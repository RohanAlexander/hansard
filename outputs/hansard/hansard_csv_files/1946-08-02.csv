WOOL Minister and Treasurer) -During the course of my second-reading speech on the Wool Industry Fund BUI, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) asked whether I would make available the agreement that had been entered into in 1939 between the Commonwealth and United Kingdom Governments for the purchase of Australian wool during the war."" A formal agreement was never concluded between the two Governments, but an arrangement was developed with an exchange of cables. I now lay on the table the following paper;Wool-Outlin e of War-time Wool Purchase' Arrangement, 1039-45. Minister and Treasurer) -by leave I desire to inform the House that finality has now been reached in the detailed negotiations for the relief of double taxation between the United Kingdom and Australia, which have been taking place in London with the Board. of Inland Revenue. The agreement will, in due course, be signed in London by the Australian Resident Minister( Mr J. A. Beasley) and the British 'Chancellor of the Exchequer (Dr. Dalton), and will then be published. The agreement will apply in respect of ordinary income tax, super tax, undistributed profits tax, social services contribution and war-time (company) tax in Australia, and income tax, surtax, excess profits tax and national defence contribution in the United Kingdom.' With the exception of profits from shipping and air transport, dividends, literary and industrial royalties, pensions and purchased annuities and certain agencies, priority, oftax will be given to the counof the origin of 'the income. If the country of the taxpayer's residence also taxes the income, it will give a credit against its own tax of the tax paid to the country of origin.

2,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,Prime,11,Double Taxation
3,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim eborne partly' by Australia and partly by the Tim ted Kingdom, will be discontinued. In future the United Kingdom will provide the full relief to its residents by giving them a tax credit of the Australian tax against the United Kingdom tax on that income. Except in relation to dividends from United Kingdom companies, Australia does not tax its residents on income derived from sources in. the United Kingdom which is taxed in that country, so Australian residents do not suffer double taxation on their United Kingdom income. One of the biggest obstacles which has hindered the British industrialist from extending his enterprise to Australia or from expanding his business already established in this country is the heavy -weight of the combined United Kingdom and Australian taxation on the profits, .and on dividends paid out of those profits, where the Australian business is carried on through the medium of a separate subsidiary company. In order to reduce the incidence of the combined taxes in these cases"", Australia will exempt from its tax, dividends paid by an Australian subsidiary to its United Kingdom parent where the 'parent cornmany owns all the shares, less directors' qualifying shares, of the subsidiary company. The United Kingdom .enterprise which carries on its business in Australia through a wholly-owned separate subsidiary company will thus be placed in the same position for taxation purposes as the enterprise which carries on its business through a branch. Australia will get its full tax on the profits of the subsidiary company just as it will in the case of the branch, but will not charge tax on the dividends received by the parent company.. In the case of other dividends paid -by Australian companies to United. Kingdom shareholders who are subject to United Kingdom tax,' Australia will Teduce the tax payable on the dividends by one-half, if the shareholder is not engaged in trade or business through a permanent establishment in Australia. Dividends paid by United Kingdom companies to United Kingdom shareholders will be exempt from Australian tax. Mr Chifley. The United Kingdom will exempt from its surtax dividends paid by United Kingdom companies to Australian shareholders not engaged in trade or business through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. United Kingdom companies which are private companies under the Australian' Jaw, whether carrying on business in Australia through a separate subsidiary company or a branch, wDl continue as heretofore to pay private company tax at full rates on their undistributed income, regardless of the exemptions and the 50 per cent, reduction in tax allowed in respect of the dividends paid to United Kingdom shareholders. United Kingdom public companies, whether carrying on business in Australia through a separate subsidiary or branch, will also pay undistributed profits tax on their undistributed profits at the rate of tax charged on those profits. With regard to dividends from United Kingdom companies, Australian shareholders at-tbe present time are taxed on the net amount of the dividend remaining after deduction of the United Kingdom tax. If these shareholders elect to include . in their assessable income the United Kingdom tax appropriate to their .dividends, calculated where necessary at the net United Kingdom rate payable by the company, they will be allowed a credit of the United Kingdom tax from the Australian tax pay a-bl« in respect of the dividend. With regard to dividends received by United Kingdom shareholders from Australian: companies, the .United Kingdom will give a credit in respect of the Australian tax. In the case of ordinary and ' participating preference shares, this credit will take into account, in addition to any tax payable in respect of the dividends, the taxes, other than war-time company tax, payable by the company on profits out of which the dividend is paid. Trading, profits, other than shipping and air transport, '''will remain on tbe origin basis and each country will tax the profit derived through a permanent establishment in' its territory by an enterprise of the other country. Thus, in the case of a United Kingdom concern with a permanent establishment in Australia, Australia will tax the profits and the United Kingdom will give full credit for the Australian tax against the United Kingdom tax on the profits. Australia will continue to tax profits from film, business controlled abroad and from insurance with non-residents in accordance with its present law, and the United Kingdom will allow credit for the Australian tax. A permanent establishment will be defined as a branch or other fixed place of business and will include a management, factory, mine or agricultural or pastoral property. An enterprise of one country carrying on business in the other country through an agent will not be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the other country unless the agent has and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise otherwise than at prices fixed by the enterprise or unless the agent regularly fillsorders on behalf of the enterprise from a stock of goods or merchandise in ' the other country. An enterprise will not, however, be regarded as having a, permanent establishment in the other country merely because it carries on business dealings in the other country through a bona fide commission agent or broker acting in the ordinary course of his business and receiving commission, at the customary rate for the class of business. With regard to shipping and air transport profits, Australia will exempt profits derived by a resident of the United Kingdom from ships whose port of registry is in the United Kingdom or from aircraft registered in that country. A reciprocal exemption will be given by the Dnited Kingdom in respect of shipping and air transport profits derived by a. resident of Australia. Literary and industrial royalties, other than mining royalties, pensions-govern mental and private-and purchased annuities will be taxed on a residence basis, that is, the country of origin of the income will exempt, and the country of residence of the recipient of the income will tax. Governmental remuneration will be v taxed by the employing government .and exempted in the country where the Minister and Treasurer) -by leave I officer is employed except where the. inform honourable members that, as the officer is ordinarily a resident of the country in which he is employed or is not in that country solely for the purpose of rendering services to the employing government. The' agreement will also contain provisions relating to the remuneration of businessmen, professors and teachers, of one of the countries visiting the other country. Provision will also be made for the exchange of information between the Australian and United Kingdom taxation authorities. The agreement will run for ten years certain, and thereafter will continue indefinitely unless terminated by either party. The agreement will operate in respect of tlie current tax year and will thus apply in Australia, in respect of companies, to income derived during the year ended the 30th June, 1946, and, in respect of individuals, these being on pay-as-you-earn', to income derived during the year ended the 30th June, 1947. In the United Kingdom it will operate in respect of the year of assessment, 1946-47 in flic case of the income tax. the year 1945-46 in the case of surtax, and as from the 1st April, 1946, in the case of excess profits tax and national defence contribution. In entering into this agreement, the Australian Government has been guided by the hope that it will stimulate the flow of United Kingdom capital to Australia and so bind closer than ever the ties existing within the British Common. wealth. In place of the present system of granting reliefs, which have frequently been inadequate, the agreement will implement a greatly simplified system, which will provide all the necessary relief from double taxation. The Government confidently anticipates that the increase in .the flow of capital to Australia will lead to a consequential development of Australian secondary industries and substan-. tially increase both the field of employment and the national income.",11,Double Taxation

Dame ENID LYONS I correct it by saying that the basic wage has been regarded, and has been represented to the world t assume that the personal explanation of the honourable member must deal with that portion of the reply by the Minister in which the hpnorable member claims to have been misrepresented. . Unless the explanation contains some reference to such misrepresentation, is not the honourable member out of order? verning the making of a personal explanation are, I should think, perfectly clear. At times, I believe, advantage is taken by honourable members of this medium of addressing the House. If an honourable member considers that anything that has been said constitutes misrepresentation, that honourable member is entitled to make a personal explanation, but not to ongage in a debate. In my opinion, the kernel of the Minister's statement was that the word "" adequate "".does not appear in the booklet, but was used in the honourable member's question. If the honourable member' disputes that, and considers -that she has been misrepre-. sented, she may correct the misrepresentation ; but she may not engage in a debate on the basic wage. Dame ENID LYONS i based my question on these paragraphs in the bookletTaking the basic wage at £4 18s. (id. a week, mid adding child endowment of 7s. Od. a week for each of two children, a married man on the basic wage (no matter how unskilled) with three children bas a weekly income of ES 13s. Od. No income tax is payable on this wage by a man with a wife and three children. Based on 1940 living costs in a typical Australian city, the £5 13s. 6d. would provide n budget somewhat like the following, which has been compiled unofficially: Weekly costs. £ s. d.

(including 15s. child endowment) quoted above is the lowest amount any working man, his wife and three children' can receive as family income, and in examining this approximate budget, it should be remembered that average earnings of adult male workers are much higher than .the basic wage. For instance on the most recent figures, the average wage of adult males in factories, computed at minimum award rates for a normal week's work, was £o 19s. 8d. or £1 Is. 2d., mdrc than the basic wage quoted i above. With overtime earpings, and additional payments .not covered by awards, the amount paid in. wages and salaries to adult males in manufacturing industries averaged £0 Ins. a week in 1943. The allocation for clothes in the above minimum budget is based on a yearly allocation of £24 12s. lOd. for the husband,'working out at 9s. f>d. per week;'£12 8s. 2d. for the wife, or 4s. !)d. per week: £9 18s. 4d. for a boy of ten and a half, or 3s. lOd. per week; £8'19s. for a girl of seven, or 3s. 5d. per week; and £5 7s. od. for a boy of three, and a half, or 2s.

External Territories) [11.16] by leave I moverThat the bill be now read a second timeSince the first railway was built in Australia, in 1854, the growth of Australianrailways has not progressed according to any national plan, and State boundaries have accentuated the difficulties arising out of the absence of any national railway policy. In Australia to-day we have 6,114 miles of 5 f t . 3 in. gauge, 7,30!) miles of 4-ft. S-} in. gauge, and 13,649 miles of 3 f t . 6 in. gauge railways. The difficulties of interstate rail transport have been apparent for many years, but the war brought home to us very forcibly need for planning future railway development, particularly to meet defence requirements. Accordingly, the Government instructed Sir Harold Clapp, who was then Director-General of Land Transport, to prepare a report on the subject, and, as this report has already been presented to Parliament, I do not. propose to repeat now the many reasons contained therein for proceeding with this great national project. It is sufficient for me to say that the report has been widely accepted as one of the most complete and comprehensive statements ever made on this important subject. As the argument has been frequently advanced in recent years that railways are an obsolete means of transportation, it may' be appropriate at this stage to direct attention to the important role played by railways during the recent war, not only in Australia, but also in other parts of the world. In the United States of America, 97 per cent, of all troops, 93 per cent, of all army equipment, and 90 per cent, of navy equipment and supplies were transported by rail. The actual figures are astronomical, and include 39,200,000 passenger journeys on special troop trains, and 737,600,000,000 ton-miles of defence freight traffic.

57,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe rtlie oi er 3-2,000 freight trains were used exclusively for war purposes, in addition to 160,000 freight trains to meet other requirements. On special occasions, such as "" D "" Day, 17,500 special troop and freight trains were run. In all, 3,200 steam and diesel locomotives and 50,000 freight cars were landed in Europe. It is interesting to note that the Soviet built about 20,000 miles of railway tracks during the war, and that on the German-Russianf r o n t Germany converted 12,000 miles of 5 f t . gauge to 4 f t . S i in., and Russia, following the advance of its forces, re-converted the' 4 f t . 8-i in . gauge lines to 5 f t . , and also changed a total of 18.000 miles of additional lines to the 5 f t . gauge. It is clear, from the lessons of war that, despite the development of other forms of transport, the. railways were the backhone of the transport organization of every participating nation. In Australia, we suffered a serious handicap in the transport of men and war materials hecause there are fifteen break-of-gauge points in our railway system. This diffi' culty was overcome to some extent hy locating army service, ordnance, ammunition, engineers' stores, A i r Force and. other depots, at or near the point where the varying gauges met. However, the loss in time and in man-power in the transport of stores and equipment was considerable. very serious position which arose in 1943 may be gained from a message sent to the Ministerf o r the Army by the Quartermaster-General, who had been in conference with other .authorities regarding the hold-up of army equipment. H is message included the following words:Independent of aiiy action by tlie Transport Board, Now' South Wales and Victorian Kailways obliged refuse all loading to relieve what is now complete blockage due to endeavour force through terminals and transhipping stations more than they can absorb in any circumstances. In a later part of the message, he saidTo help in present emergency have deferred movement approximately two . Army trains each way per day into Brisbane. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the Ministerf o r the Army, in response to a request for an opinion hy Sir Harold Clapp, stated in resrard to figures show that, in 1944, the proposal to standardize the railway gauges. , The defence aspect of this problem is of vital importance, if indeed it does not of itself present a real justification for an undertaking of such magnitude in the field Of post-war construction. I propose now to deal with the argument that from a defence viewpoint railways are vulnerable to bombing attacks. 1 It should be pointed out in this connection that all transport facilities are similarly subject to this danger, hut it is interesting to note that the Rritish railways, despite 13,800 bombing attacks and the destruction or damage of 482 locomotives, 13,000 passenger cars, and 16,000 freight waggons, continued to functionthroughout the war. There were, of course, many delays to traffic, but they were mostly of short duration and usually did not extend beyond a fewhours. Since the advent .of the atomicbomb, some attention has been given to the dangers to railway traffic from this source, but in this connection I point -out that in the raid on Hiroshima.it was found that the railways suffered less than any other public utility, and w,ere again operating 4S hours after the explosion. One of the most important aspects of standardization of railways is that it. will permit the standardization of trucks, locomotives, and other railway equipment. Some indication of the In this way, in the event of a national emergency, the whole resources of the railway system could be marshalled for effective use. During the war it was found that the rolling-stock necessary quickly to transport troops required in Western Australia was not available in that State. Had the railway system been uniform, it would have been possible to relieve this situation by the diversion of rolling-stock from the eastern States. Great difficulty was also experienced in Queensland owing to the lack of sufficient locomotives and rolling-stock to handle the immense quantity of equipment required for the northern operations. Schemes were hurriedly adopted with a view to minimizing these difficulties, but the delay which frequently occurred may 'well have brought about national disaster. W it h the completion of the standardization of railways, a division nf troops",21,Second Reading
58,Mr Ward,"could be moved in approximately one-third of the time taken under present conditions. From a defence angle, railway transport has the advantage of operating entirely on fuels locally produced, whereas any interruption of fuel supplies from overseas would completely cripple other forms of transport. The report of the Defence Committee contains the following summary of the relation of standardized railways to defence requirements:NON-STANDARDIZATION. In war, there are two main factors regarding railway traffic:(a) the inevitable concentration of military traffic; (b) the priority this traffic commands. The disabilities imposed by non-fitandardization f a ll under three headings(a) Transfer stations. (5) Differences in capacity of rolling stock. (c) Inflexibility. TRANSFER STATIONS. . Tho need to transfer from one system to another imposes delay and, for example, m the case of large airframes, may even prohibit movement hy rail because. multi-handling of bulky fragile stores is bound to result in unacceptable damage. On the average! this delay amounts to one hour for passengers and one day for goods at each transfer station. Where large-scale military movements are involved, those delays can be serious. Transfer stations entail additional staff and equipment. The staff used for transferring goods during the recent war has amounted at times to 2,000 men. Extensive sidings and other equipment have been provided; some of these will remain throughout peace-time, but in the event of another war, others would have to be re-established. Of more significance is the duplication ot service installations imposed by breaks of gauge, and the vulnerability of the transfer stations which require special defence precautions. Breaks in gauge make for uneconomical use of locomotives, waggons and man-power. Late running of trains aggravates this waste. At transfer stations, goods are exposed to damage and pilferage. It is rarely possible to transfer directly the whole load of a railway waggon to a waggon of an adjacent system of different gauge. This is due tn the differences in the dimensions aud the carrying capacities of waggons. Furthermore, there is often a difference in the power 1 of locomotives, leading to"" variations-in the load that can be hauled. These -disabilities are of great significance where military, traffic is concerned, because they rule out the use of pack trains, i.e., military trains of standard composition, which . is the normal method of military supply by rail. Furthermore, services' consignments are liable to be separated at. transfer stations, e.g., goods loaded together in Melbourne for Cairns, andpossibly for shipment overseas, may arrive not only in different waggons, but in different trains, and part may miss the ship. The preparation of documents for such split consignments is complicated aud laborious. With non-standardization, there can be no common pool of locomotives and rolling-stock from which to meet emergencies This inflexibility is serious,-as in war there is a greatly increased demand reaching peaks in different areas at various times. The population from which the bulk ot Australian militia forces must be drawn will be located, in peace in the areas of densest population. These areas are mostly far removed from the parts most exposed to enemy action. Should, therefore, Australia he threatened with invasion, considerable movement of troops and material will be necessary over long distances, and these movements may necessarily be concurrent. For example, presuming that the permanent forces have moved to their war stations at an earlier stage, strategic concentration might involve, the movement of major formations from the south-east to the west and to the north*. ' ACOMPARISON INTIME . Becent computation of the times taken to move troops by rail over long distances shows that, with standardization, the .time required for the inurement of a major formation is approximately one-third of that required under existing conditions. POOL OF BOLLINO-STOCK. . Some improvement over present conditions would result if only the "" military trunk routes"" were converted to standard gauge, but to provide, say, sixteen trains a day over great distances for appreciable periods, considerable resources of locomotives and rolling stock are needed, and it is unlikely that such resources would exist if standardization were restricted to the military trunk routes. Standardization of lines other than the military trunk routes would be of direct benefit by providing a pool of standard locomotives and rolling-stock for emergency movements on a large"" scale, by enabling the development of substitute routes in the event of loss of the main routes by enemy action, and by facilitating the deployment of the forces. Standardization, resulting in the'increased speed of movement, may prove an' important factor in the defence of Australia. After a full examination of the facts, the Commonwealth Government has come to the conclusion that the standardization and modernization of our railway systems is an essential defence work. Whilst the project is advanced by the Commonwealth primarily as being necessary for .defence purposes, it cannot be overlooked that the economic gains resultant from the adoption of uniformity in gauges and railway equipment, would be tremendous. One of the essential features of transport is that its charges must-be kept as low as. possible, and in this respect railway traffic has definite advantages over others, with the exception of sea transport. Each form of transport, whether it be by rail, air, road or sea, has. its place in the nation's economy, and it is hoped that the Australian Transport Advisory Council will exercise due influence in developing each form, in its proper sphere. The State Ministers for Transport have indicated, their whole-hearted co-operation with, the Commonwealth in the achievement of this objective, and it is hoped that the plans, now being prepared will lead to a better utilization of the various forms of transport' and so end "" cut throat "" competition. Standardization of railways, coupled with modernization, will enable the number of types of locomotives, passenger rolling stock and goods vehicles, to be reduced considerably. We now have 143 types of locomotives, 456 types ofpassenger vehicles, and 766 types of goods cars. It will be readily appreciated that' by producing fewer types of modern locomotives and rolling-stock, it would be possible to develop mass-production which would lead to considerable economy in production and maintenance. Advantages to defence and civilian traffic may he briefly summarized as' follows:-Standardizatio n will obviate the necessity for changing trains at present break-of-gauge points, thus eliminating delay in the transfer of passengers and goods, as well as the labour involved therein; and enable rolling stock to be used on all lines, which would:(1.) allow of the most economical use of the available rolling stock, by using it for through journeys, Ur. Ward. thus avoiding congestion, and sometimes empty back-running from break-of-gauge points. (2.) Facilitate repair and replacement, since all railway workshops, foundries, &c. in thtseveral States would use standard parts. Repair and replacement of rolling stock would be speedier, cheaper, and less liable to interruption by enemy, attack, owing to the wide dispersal of the workshops. (3.) Facilitate the marshalling of trains for strategic and tactical moves, as a result of the interchangeability of rolling stock. (4.) Allow of the employment of standard trains in all States for service purposes, thus facilitat-. ing staff work and administration generally. Sir Harold Clapp's report on standardization was presented to the Government in March, 1945, and steps were taken immediately to open negotiations with the rState governments to ascertain their views on the subject. After a Conference of Transport Ministers in May. 1945^ the Conference of Commonwealth and' State Ministers in August of the same year, resolved, inter aliaThat theconference declares that the work . of standardizing Australia's railway gauges-' should be proceeded with as being essential to national defence and development. The matter was again submitted to the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in January, 1946, when it was decided that the Commonwealth would bear half of the cost of the work, and that the mainland States would share the remainder on a per capita basis. Negotiations .with the States were continued in order to work out the details of an agreement. Whilst a great deal of progress was made, the negotiations finally broke down because of the objections to certain sections of the proposals by representatives, of Queensland and Western Australia. At a conference of the Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers in May this ye'ar, when it was'apparent that no further progress could be made towards the completion of an agreement to include all the States, I announced that I would recommend to the Commonwealth Government that negotiations should opinion between the States, and between continue with the States prepared to cothe States and the board, provision is operate. Having obtained the approval made for a railways council consisting of of the Commonwealth Government to the Commonwealth Minister for Transthis recommendation, I proceeded to conport, the Minister administering the fer with the Premiers of Victoria and Commonwealth Railways, the Minister South Australia on the conversion of for Transport, New South Wales, the their railway system to the 4-ft. 8-i-in.

This general agreement beorder tween the Commonwealth and the three provision to ensure that standard plans States mentioned was the subject of and designs shall be established is confurther .detailed discussion, which retained in the agreement, and in such cases sulted in the agreement now before the the States and the Commonwealth colParliament. It is to be regretted that QueensIn brief, the agreement is framed on the land and Western Australia are riot inbroad basis of full co-operation between cluded in this plan, and it should be made the Commonwealth and the States and clear that that is not the fault of the on the maximum degree of collaboration Commonwealth.

In the meantime, in the case of accomplished. Western Australia, the survey of the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle line, which was commenced some time ago as a result of the early negotiations disclosed that financial assistance afforded by the Comthe States, whilst appreciating the necesmonwealth, will not be interrupted. The scheme of administration provided were reluctant to accept the responsibility by the agreement is that the general confor providing funds for a project which trol and supervision' of the work will be was primarily designed to meet defence entrusted to a board consisting of a direcneeds, a'though its economic advantages tor-general, a director of mechanical were fully recognized.

A further lectively will determine such standards. Regarding the financing of the profit, sity for standardizing railway gauges, detriment of other great national works, such as housing, and water conservation, to which expenditure the States are already committed. Consequently, the Commonwealth agreed to an arrangement to finance the undertaking which would minimize the burden on the States-par ticularly in the early years. It should be realized, moreover, that the States had already determined upon large programmes of railway rehabilitation works, and these may now be put in hand with a full knowledge that the funds for standardization will be available and thus enable all the work to be co-ordinated, and thereby the maximum advantage to the nation will be achieved. The principal features of the financial provisions are as follows:(a) Total cost for the complete plan for New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia is £50,870,696. (b) The cost of new locomotives and. rolling stock is debited 25 per cent, to standardization funds and 75 per cent, to the State concerned. (c) The cost of standardization is shared equally by the Commonwealth and by the States. (d) The States' contribution will be made in annual payments -extending over 50 years. (e) The cost of related works-e.g. , works which, although related, are not caused by standardization, are borne by the State conor organization of employers or employees"". cerned.

COAL INDUSTRY BILL 1946. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 1st August (vide page 3594). Clause5 agreed to. Clause 6(1.) A member of the board shall not exercise, and shall forthwith relinquish, any power or authority vested in bim (otherwise than by or under this Act or tlie State Act) by reason of which he may influence the management or control of any coal-mine or any company owning or controlling a coal-mine or engaged in tlie handling or distribution of coal. (2.) If a. member of the board is a shareholder in any such company, he shall not as such exercise any vote. I move That, in sub-clause (1.), after the words ""distributio n of coal"" the following words be added:-""o r any union, association or organization of employers or employees engaged in the coal industry"". Later, I shall move That, in sub-clause (2.), after the word ""company"" the following words be inserted:""or a member of any such union, association This clause prescribes the conditions governing the appointment of members of the Joint Coal Board. In my opinion, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) should make it perfectly annually in accordance with the clear that no member or officer of a union or employers' organization shall be Minister will contend that the Government does not propose to appoint any such person at present; but when an appointment is made in the future, the appointee should not hold a controlling interest in any organization of employers or employees.

The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has made it perfectly clear .that the board shall be an independent authority.'

What the Minisor organization of employers or employees "". ter did not say was that Prime Ministers do not live for ever. The present Prime Minister might die, alter his mind, or be instructed by caucus' to alter his mind as the result of pressure exerted hy the miners federation or some other outside organization. elections, he might no t be Prime Minister. t that the Minister would be glad to accept the amendment, because after the elections, the Labour party would fear that the incoming government would swamp the Joint Coal Board with persons unacceptable to it. The Government has not attempted to make of this a balanced clause. For example, any person associated with the management or control of any coal-mine or any company owning or controlling a coal-mine or engaged in the handling or distribution of coal shall not be eligible for appointment to the board, but other persons will not be disqualified by reason of the fact that they are members of industrial organizations. As Mr Justice Davidson reported, the coal-mining industry has been brought to the verge of ruin by the leading officials of the miners federation. The president of the organization, Mr Wells, is a Communist, but neither he nor any other member of the union will be disqualified from appointment to the Joint Coal Board. In the interests of justice, the representation on this board should be equal. As the clause is now drafted, the representation may be one-sided and the board may be an ili-balanced body. Representatives of the miners federation have followed this debate intently, arid the newspapers this morning reported that attempts had been made to exert pressure on the Prime Minister to amend the bill in a certain manner. Repeatedly, the Prime Minister has wilted under pressure. If the Government will accept this amendment, it will be able to resist thatkind of pressure. Amendment negatived.

Minister that a person who has invested his life-savings in a coal-mineis entitled to some consideration. The Minister is fond of referring to the ""great coal octopus"", but he should bear in mind that these enterprises belong, in the main, to a large number of small shareholders. Recently, the honourable gentleman referred, in scathing terms, to persons whom he described as ""little capitalists"" who,he said, should not be allpwed to own their own home. He is now saying, on behalf of .the Government, that small investors who put their savings into enterprises of this kind shall have the privilege of ensuring that wages are paid to the workers, but shall not ,be entitled, by statute,, to reasonable returns on their investments.. He is saying, in effect,. "" You may use your money to develop the coal-mines, to install machinery, and to meet all necessary charges in connection with the industry, but you shall not be allowed any compensation if the Government should' take over the mine in which you have invested your money, and .you shall not be entitled to a reasonable profit from the operation of the industry "". There is no provision whereby an investor will be enabled to obtain a. reasonable profit. But every effort will be made by the Government to ensure such a *tate of inefficiency, and so great a loss of production, that the mines will That,' in sub-clause (1.), after paragraph ""(e) to ensure to owners engaged in the coal industry a fair profit on capital invested, and, for this purpose, where necessary, to pay bounties on coal produced, to make grants and to pay subsidies "". Such an approach can reasonably be expected from a government that proposes to take control of this industry. This clause is the kernel of the .bill. It gives to the Minister the power to take controlof the coal industry, and of every other industry that may arise out of the derivatives or by-products of coal. As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) stated last night, there are. 1-50 by-products and derivatives, including clothing, explosives, dyes, chemical's, plastics and fertilizers. An industry entirely new to Australia may be established here, and command considerable public support. These provisions represent the complete socialization of industries, and we shall oppose them with all our might. We realize, of course, that we have as much chance of securing in this chamber sufficient support to have our wishes translated into law,as we have of witnessing a miracle; but that will not deter us. If , by the use of steam-roller tactics, the Government intends to have these provisions enacted, and eventually to take over the coal-mines, it should not first ruin the industry, but should at least give to those whose money is invested in it and who have done a good job for this country in a time of crisis the opportunity to obtain a fair return. The Minister should have the clause redrafted so that it will not inspire fear. Failing",28,Effect Of Full Standardization
73,',Mr Dedman -That is what the honor,29,Effect Of Full Standardization
74,Mr Harrison',"I suggest to thethat, he should do the decent and honest thing by those who have ventured their all in this great industry. provisions which the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) proposes 1 to substitute for those which the bill now contains could have been taken word for word from the National Socialist code of Hitler-Germany, because by their means the whole of the resources of the State could be used to guarantee the payment of dividends upon investments in a particular industry. That is why Hitler was so wholeheartedly supported by the big industrial magnates of Germany. He assumed control of industries which had become uneconomic because of the difficult political, economic and social conditions in Germany after, the last war and during the period of the depression, in order that the considerable sums invested in them might be protected. Such pro-' visions would not be accepted in democratic Australia. The honourable member for Calare( Mr is expanded by the definition clause. Breen) either pretended to misunderstand, or has misrepresented, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr appeals. Some person in the office, of Harrison), whose proposal cannot be related to Hitler's code. It should be observed that under the Constitution the Government cannot acquire property except upon just terms. Any person whose property has been acquired may have recourse to the courts for protection. I say advisedly that under the provisions of this clause the Government could avoid the payment of compensation to any one whose property had been, not acquired, but controlled. The power of control given by the clause is so plenary and wide as to exclude for all purposes any real ownership by those who now have the conduct of the coal mines. I draw attention to this matter, because upon it I made some remarks at the second-reading stage. The bill as originally drafted, and before a portion was removed from it, provided, as does the Coal Production (War-time) Act 1944, that in the event of disagreement a person could obtain compensation from the Government through any court of competent jurisdiction if a mine were controlled as distinct from being acquired. I emphasize again that no provision for compensation is needed in respect of a mine that has been acquired, because the matter is covered by the Constitution; but when a mine is controlled, and the powers in relation to the control are such as completely to exclude the owner and the shareholders from effective control of its operations, there is no provision for compensation. I ask the Minister two plain questions. The first is this: In the event of the -power of the board being exercised, as it may be under this provision, so as to control a mine in exactly the same way as it was intended that, the Government should' be able to exercise control under clause 19 of the bill as originally draftedj is it intended that compensation shall be paid? The second question is: If it be intended that compensation shall be paid, why is there no provision in the bill making that payment obligatory? Surely those questions are simple enough 1 I , point out that under clause 13 (2) («), most complete .control is taken over coal, not only in the sense in which that word L? ordinarily used, but also as the term Power is given to regulate prices and profits, but no provision is made for the board will tell this or that person, "" These are your prices and profits "", and there will be no appeal ' from that decision. I Understood that this Government had talked about the removal of controls. Here is an epic example'of the imposition of controls to an even greater degree than existed during the war. But the matter does not rest there. Let us turn to paragraph / of sub-clause 3, which provides that the board shall have authority to "" assume control of the management and operation of any coal mine""; and to paragraph which pro' vides that the board shall have authority "" to terminate, suspend, vary or modify any contract or agreement relating to or affecting the production, supply or distribution of coal, including sale, transportation by land or sea, loading, discharge, delivery, storage and use "" of coal. Under this clause, power is given to the board to interfere with contracts, and that may result in substantial loss to the parties to the contracts. There is no provision for the appointment of a tribunal to fix compensation, or to hear",29,Effect Of Full Standardization
75,Mr Breen (Calare) [12.5],The,30,Effect Of Full Standardization
76,' Mr Spender (Warringah) [12.7],"appeals from a decision, of the board. I notice, however, that a different view is adopted when dealing with the rights of employees; because, under paragraph k, if a"" person be suspended or excluded from employment in. the coal industry, he is to have the right of appeal;, and rightly so. Why are people whose money is invested, many of them small shareholders, to be given no right of appeal? Why is the ordinary personfor example, a small business man whose contract in relation to coal is interfered with under paragraph j-to have no right of appeal? As a lawyer, I regard this bill as it will be passed by Parliament as a lamentably drafted bill. It has been prepared in a slovenly fashion, and has no regard for the rights and interests of the people of this country. Nowhere in it is there any right to compensation, no matter to what degree the interests of people may be interfered with. It is about time more attention was paid to the drafting of the bills that are brought to this Parliament. I want to hear the views of the Government upon these simple . questions: Under this clause, cannot the Government, as I have alleged, do anything in respect of the industry, including the control of any mine or interference with any contract? I speak in the widest terms If that be so, does not the Government realize. that people . may suffer such damage as even to ruin them through the exercise of powers that may be necessary in the interests of the country? Is it intended to pay such persons compensation, or to give them the right to apply to a tribunal for compensation? If that is the intention of-the Government, why not state it in the hill? I have heard, the view expressed, and I know that it is held by some of the advisers of the Government, that there is a limited .legal significance in the constitutional provision requiring the payment of compensation for acquisition hy the Commonwealth. According to this view, the effect of expropriation by the Commonwealth can be achieved by saying to the owner of the property, ""You'-shall not run this business except on the conditions we lay down. You shall not enter into any contract except on the terms and conditions prescribed, and if you do enter into such contract, we have authority to set it. aside."" In this way, they argue, the Commonwealth can expropriate a person's property without paying, any compensation at all. This is a matter which strikes at the very heart of constitutional government in a democracy. In both Australia and the United States of America, the constitutions provide that the Government may not take over any property without paying just compensation, and that if the person affected is dissatisfied with the compensation offered he may go to the courts of the land to have the matter determined. The will not contain Part TV., the part which provides for the "" control of coal-mines "". Therefore, there will be' no provision in the bill as it will be passed for the payment of' one penny of compensation to persons whose property may be expropriated. I give that opinion in my capacity as a lawyer, something which I seldom do in this House, as I do not think that it is right. I see an officer in attendance on the Minister laughing. It too often happens that the advisers who sit behind the Government benches show by their demeanour and by their laughing what they think of arguments placed before the Parliament. order. Is it permissible for an honourable member to attack officials who are in the chamber to advise Ministers, and who cannot defend themselves.

Labour party asks me to look at clause 20, but I remind him that clause 20 is in Part IV . of the bill, and that part is to be dropped. Clause 20, if it were to remain in the bill, would effectually protect the'owner of. a mine which had been taken over, but, with the omission of Part IV . of the bill, no such provision exists. This is another example of the growing practice of employing legal stratagems to avoid the provisions of the Constitution. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge ofj the Council fo'r Scientific and Industrial Research) [""12.21 J I resent very much the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr referred to in paragraph j of sub-clause 3 Spender) about the officers .who sit in the House to advise Ministers. Just because an officer happens to smile, the honourable member assumes that he is smiling at something which he himself has said. Surely the officers who are advising Ministers have ordinary human rights when in attendance in the chamber, and they are entitled to smile or to look grim as jjeems fit to them. Last night, and to-day, the honourable member for Warringah talked more hot air than 1 have known any honourable member to use before. For a lawyer, he has a slatternly, sloven y, lazy mind. He said that a board of three should be set up. This bill provides for the setting up of a board of three. Evidently, the honor-. able member did not even take the trouble to read the bill. The Hansard' record will show clearly what he said. Now he says that no provision is made for the payment of compensation if a contract is terminated. ' I refer him to clause 57, which reads as follows:If any parson claims' that he has sustained any loss or damage by reason of an exercise by the board of the power referred to in paragraph ' ( j ) of sub-section t3.) of section thirteen of this act, he may, withinthree months after .the exercise of the power, lodge with tlie board a claim in writing setting out f u l l particulars of the loss or damage and the question whether any and, if any, what amount, of compensation should, in all the circumstances of the case, be paid to that person shall be settled by agreement between him and tlie board, or, failing any such agreement, by an action by .the owner against the board in any court of competent jurisdiction. It is evident that the honourable member has not taken the trouble to read the bill, and in that case I am not going to waste time answering him further. It is well that the Minister should have referred specifical.y to clause 57, because it emphasizes the very, point that I have made. It is a rule of law which happen? to have stuck in even my slatternly, slovenly, lazy mind, that if an express provision is made to cover one specific matter, other matters are thereby excluded. Clause 57 provides that compensation may be payable to any person who has sustained loss or damage by reason of an exercise by the board of the power of clause 13. Thus, the provision applies ( to matters referred to in that paragraph of clause 13, and to no 'others. I suggest to the Minister that he should have a good look at the bill himself, and try to find any provision in it imposing an obligation on the Commonwealth to pay compensation where the control of a mine is assumed by the Government. For instance, I asked him where provision is made to compensate an owner, the control of whose mine has been afsumed under paragraph / of subclause 3 of clause 13.

There is nothing in the whole of the clause which cannot now he done hy the Government of New South Walesi f it is so minded. I should like to know whence the Commonwealth Government obtained power to regulate prices under paragraph g of subclause 2. I always understood that in peace-time the Commonwealth had no power to fix prices. The position in regard to this bill is much the same as it was in regard to the-Wheat Stabilization Bill. It is obvious that certain legislation complementary to this measure will have to be passed by.the Parliament of . New South Wales, but this House is asked to pass this bill without seeing the New South Wales bill. Does New South Wales propose to surrender to the Commonwealth the necessary constitutional power to regulate prices in that State. referred to a board. power is to be exercised by a Commonwealth instrumentality, the Parliament of New South Wales must first refer the power to-.the Parliament of the Commonwealth. There is no other way'in which it could be done. by the Commonwealth but. by the board. board may be the Commonwealth's instrumentality. If the New South Wales Government refers powers of any kind to the Commonwealth they should flow to the Commonwealth Parliament and not to a board established by the a joint control board. does not affect the issue. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) had something to say about paragraph j of sub-clause 3. The wording of that paragraph reminds 'me of Alice in Wonderland who, on being asked, "" What does it mean?"", replied, """"It means what I mean it to mean; no more and no less"". The paragraph vjrovides that the board may terminate, suspend, vary or modify any contract or agreement relating to or affecting the production, supply or distribution of coal, including its sale, transportation .by land or sea, loading, discharge, delivery, storage and use. Under the powers to be vested by that paragraph, coal sent to South Australia for a specific purpose may be diverted by the board to another purpose. That provision will not assist in bringing about harmonious relations between New South Wales and the other States. Sub-clause 4 provides that the board is to have power at any time to rescind, terminate or vary any order, direction or requirement made or given by it. A wider power than that could not be imagined. The only other occasion I can remember such a power being given to any authority was when, under the National Security Regulations, the Director-General of Allied Works' was vested with power to override the decisions and determinations of the Arbitration Court. I am not sure that the board could not do likewise under the power proposed to be conferred upon it. General of Allied Works have exercised such .a wide power except under the authority vested in him under the National Security Regulations? that power was to be exercised solely to meet war emergencies. There seems to be no reason why such a wide power should be vested in a body which will operate in peace-time. The board's",32,Effect Of Full Standardization

99,Mr James (Hunter) [12.38],"I have.abroad revealed it to be from 12 to 15 per cent, higher in oil content than any other coal in the world. Other nations have developed processes for extracting oil from coal, yet we are content to lose 65 per cent, of coal of the highest grade. I only wish that mining men who are now sitting in the gallery had the privilege of speaking in this'chamber so that they could tell us what they know about this matter. Unfortunately that privilege is denied them and they have to speak through their representatives in this chamber. The South Maitland, East Greta, A y r field, Glenayr and Heddon Greta collieries are flooded because of the owners' disregard of the need for conserving the nation's coal supplies. Insufficient pillar support has been left, cave-ins have occurred and swamp waters have entered the mines, making it impossible to work them. Coal seams in that area from 5 feet to 35 feet in thickness and about 6 miles in length have been ruined for all time simply because of the "" get rich' quick "" methods adopted by the coal-owners. They have always said, in effect, "" To hell with, the nation's future "" . question one would expect from the coal miner farmer from In d i . Whenever a government has endeavoured to enlarge-its industrial powers it has always been faced with the most consistent opposition of honourable members opposite. I agree that when we were in opposition we did likewise. Senseless opposition of that kind, causing lack of uniformit y in industrial matters throughout the Commonwealth, is the root cause of many of our industrial troubles to-day. interests of the nation surely we can work in harmony and agree that the Commonwealth Parliament should be clothed with f u l l powers to deal with industrial matters. Sitting maladministration by the coal-owners. Old Greta has been practically abandoned because of fires in the coal-seam. In parts of Cessnockwe find a similar state of affairs. Newspapers fro m time to time report the occurrence of fires. The fires occur because of the present method of extracting the coal, the only purpose of. which is the earning of diviv Sendsf or the owners. It pays' no regard to the welfare of the nation. Whereas, a century ago in Great Britain. the miners were working high seams like those on the Maitland field, they are now operating at depths below 3,000 feet in seams from 18 to 20 inches thick. The same condition applies in Germany, Prance and Belgium., One can easily imagine what the cost of coal will be to this nation in years to come if we continue the present wasteful method of working the seams. We must t r y to conserve our coal resources for future generations, but under the present system of ownership I do not exjject the application of any other policy than the get-richquick policy of to-day. The shipping companies that have bought majority shareholdings in mines, of course, are not concerned about earning dividends from the actual production of coal. Their interests lie in the profits to be made from the freight charged on the carriage of coal to Australian ports and in providing cheap coal fuel for vessels sailing overseas. The honourable member for W h a t did Mr Lang Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) asked why this bill had been brought down and. with particular, reference to this clause, asked why the Government of New South Wales had not used the powers proposed. I interjected that the State Government had nothing to do with the interstate transport of coal. South Australia, of which he is the sole remaining Opposition representative, is suffering to-day, not because coal is in short supply, but because shipping is lacking to carry it from Newcastle to Port Adelaide. Co-operation between both In the governments and all sections of the industry is imperative, if this legislation is to be effective. It is an honest attempt to overcome the difficulties in the coal-min. ing industry. It is not political. It contains some clauses that the miners do not suspended from 1245 to 2.25 p.m. like, but I accept the majority decision I was dealing with the of my party. the miners not. like? empower the board to expel from the industry managers, superintendents, or any other employees.

106,Mr James,"I would not '""fallacy. He is blinded, by class bias whenbill. That fact was demonstrated'by the ever he talks about the mine-owners. I have "" debunked "" his argument on this occasion, as I did during the second-read-, ing debate when he made fantastic claims regarding fatalities and accidents in coalof the amendment which I have submines. I direct my attention now to the evasive statements made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mi*. Dedman). He had no effective answer to the charges made by the Opposition regarding clause 13, and so he indulged in one of the oldest of debating tricks. Such a trick might be effective in a debating class of the Eureka Youth Movement, but not in this chamber. The honourable gentleman drew a political rabbit out of his hat and tried to concentrate our attention on that, in the hope that we would overlook his failure to answer our charges. He quoted clause 57. He knew that it had nothing whatever to do with the subject of compensation which had been discussed by the honourable mem-, bev for Warringah ( Mr Spender) and myself. Having quoted the clause he said, in effect, "" The honourable members have not read the bill and, therefore, I shall not seek to answer them further "". Part IV . of the bill, which the Government proposes to exclude, provides for compensation to be paid to mine-owners in respect of the acquisition of mines. Paragraphs / and g of sub-clause. 3, clause 17, give power to the Joint Coal Board to assume control of the' management and operation of any coal-mine and to acquire and operate any coal-mine. The Minister knows this, and he knows, too, that, following the exclusion of Part TV. of the bill, there will be no legislative correct, then any person who considers provision for the payment of compensation to owners whose mines are acquired. Obviously the honourable gentleman referred to clause 57 in the hope that our attention would be diverted and that we would overlook the main point at issue. Unfortunately for him, we have read the bH thoroughly and we know exactly what it contains. We also know exactly what thoughts lieat the back of the Minister's mind. I accept the fact that the Government originally intended to provide for the payment of compensation to mine-owners in respect of mines acquired under the powers conferred by the inclusion of Part IV . However, that part will be deleted from the bill. NowI merely seek to give effect to"" the Government's original intention by means mitted. If the Government intends to deal justly with the owners, it must agree to my amendment. Only by doing so can it .prove .to the people that it still believes in the democratic traditions of this nation. One of the traditions embodied in tlie Constitution provides that every man whose property is acquired has the right to receive just compensation. If the Government rejects my amendment, it will sweep aside the Constitution and override one of the fundamental principles of democratic justice. If the Minister will accept the amendment -we shall believe his assertion that the Government intends to dispense evenhanded justice to the owners in the event of the powers provided in clause 13 being exercised to dispossess them. honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has jjointed out that under the Constitution, the owner of any property acquired by the Commonwealth is entitled to compensation on just terms. Previously, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said that clause 13 represented an attempt to evade that provision of the Constitution. He even made the dramatic statement that lie would stake his reputation on the accuracy of his charge. There was no need for any such gesture by the honourable gentleman. If his contention be himself to be aggrieved by any action of the Commonwealth under the terms of the bill may appeal to the High Court. The honourable member for Warringah knows that no provision of this bill, or of any regulation promulgated under this bill, can override the Constitution. If this clau.se be invalid, the mere fact that the words ""just terms"" are omitted will not prevent justice being done. As the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) said, clause 57 makes ample provision for the payment of compensation for any damage that may occur as the result, of the acquisition of a mine. A claim for compensation may",36,Effect Of Full Standardization
107,Mr Morgan (Reid) [2.34]!,"Th ebe lodged with the Joint Coal Board, and, failing agreement in that case, with any court of competent jurisdiction. If the Commonwealth controls a mine and increases its profits, it is entitled to a reasontowards paragraphs h, i , j , k and I of. able return for its service. As there Li no acquisition of property, no compensation is payable. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) said that the Opposition will oppose with all its power and might the passing of this clause. That attitude is only consistent with the stand that the employing classes, which honourable members opposite represent, have adopted for many years. They have always opposed reform, or the improvement of conditions of the coalminers. Wentworth. .also said that this clause provided a complete answer to the Government's policy of nationalization. I remind him that this bill does not contain any proposal for the nationalization 'of,the coal industry, although 1 admit that nationalization could be effected in certain circumstances. The bill provides for four methods of operating the mines. First, the present method of operation under private ownership could continue. The national security regulations applying to the coal industry, which are being continued in this measure, did not remove private ownership during the war. If private ownership provides proper working conditions for the employees and efficient methods of production, the Government will not interfere with it. Thi3 legislation, and the creation of the JointCoal Board, will be a salutary deterrent to the continuation of inefficient methods and unsatisfactory working conditions, just as the provision to empower the board to suspend persons will be a salutary deterrent to those whose conduct may be prejudicial to the efficient operation of the mines. Eor that reason, the bill has been wisely drafted. The second method iscontrol by the Commonwealth without actual acquisition The third method is to encourage a co-operative method of mining between employer and employees. Many of the more liberalminded owners recognize that the employees must be taken more into the management, and given a voice in the conduct of the industry and a share of the profits of their labour. The fourth Mr Morgan. method is outright government ownership or nationalization, which may take place under certain conditions. 1 should like the Opposition to define its attitude sub-claiise 2, which empower the board to make provision for(h) the health and, subject to this Act, the safety, of persons engaged in the coal industry, including the regulation of conditions in the industry with respect thereto, and the enforcement of measures for the abatement of dust in mines; (i) .the establishment of sound industrial . welfare practices including the provision of amenities for employees in the coal industry; (;) collaboration with other persons and The honourable member for authorities in the establishment and. provision of amenities and of health, educational, recreational, housing and other facilities for communities of persons in coal-mining districts, and in the promotion of the development and diversification of industry and of town and regional planning in such districts; (fc) the regulation of employment and recruitment to the coal industry, including the control of the mantling of mines and the promotion of stability of employment; (i) the training, efficiency, and competency of persons engaged in the coal industry; Such provisions for safeguards and . amenities have been sadly lacking in the past.. The owners neglected to provide suitable amenities and housing conditions for the miners. That was admitted by Mr Bernard Kirton, who. is the chairman of the Excelsior mine on the south coast of New South Wales. He stated that proprietors should take an interest in the housing conditions of the workers. Mr Kirton lives in an elaborate mansion on the mountain-side near his mine,and the employees' live not far away, many of them in hovels. Yet the colliery proprietors in the district have thousands of acres of beautiful land,' with fertile soil, which could have been made avail-, able to their employees so that in their spare time they could have engaged in gardening and other useful and healthy occupations. The bill will make up for some of those deficiencies of the past, and, therefore, I am surprised that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) declared that the Opposition would oppose this clause with all its -might. Repeatedly, honourable members opposite have deprecated what they described as the "" maudlin sentimentality "" for those miners whose health has been destroyed by coal dust. Recently, the Sydney Daily Telegraph published under the heading Lung-dusted Miners Die a Thousand Deaths -contracted Sunday Telegraph sent an impartial investigator to the south coast to obtain first-hand information about the sufferings of the men who have contracted miners' phthisis and he wrote, inter alid"" There will be no miners on the south coast in ten years."" This is what they say at Wollongpng, where all miners on tbe south coast met last week to discuss the recent deaths of three men from dust on the lungs. Of the two articles written by the special investigator, one is entitled, "" Why the Miners Fear the Dust so M u c h "" , and r.he other, "" Twenty-five Yearsi n the Pits, Now Among the ' Walking Dead' "". He described the lives of some of the coalminers. The Daily Telegraph summed up the situation in a leading article, as follows:We have attempted to lay bare all the facts ""t the South Coast mining trouble. It is clear that this is a special problem, dissociated from the ordinary type of coalfields dispute. We must have coal-bu t we cannot expect to. get it at the sacrifice of men's lives. The evidence shows that the South Coast mining conditions are particularly unhealthy. The local president of the Miners' Federation asserts that 50 per cent, of the southern miners are affected by nodular fibrosis, a chest disease which the miners refer to as "" dust"". This is a progressive disease for which, apparently, science has not yet found the-cure. dust was so thick he often could not see his Meanwhile men are naturally drifting from nn industry which they consider dangerous. And this is occurring when we need more coal than ever before. Accepted preventive measures include methods of laying dust by water. The men -demand high-pressure infusion of water into the coal seam. It is not established beyond all doubt that this is entirely effective. But it appears to be the best known means of reducing tbe incidence of the disease. To retire and compensate affected workers is not enough. Tbe latest known devices for preventing the disease must be used. W it h the consent of honourable members, I shall incorporate in Hansard the remainder of the article. is a newspaper article.

The Unfortunately, none of these various remedies are easily applied because the industry has inherited prejudices, customs, and hates which overwhelm reason. I ask leave .of the committee to incorporate in Hansard two further articles on the dust menace. Leave not granted. articles. The first is headed "" Why miners fear the dust so much "", and is as follows:The menace of dust on the lungs has caused a near-panic among miners on the South Coast of New South Wales. Three of them died last week. None of them know who will be next. But they're all afraid, and by the weekend their fear had spread right through the Illawarra District. Dust is almost the only thing they talk about in hotels and shops, in the homes, and on street corners. Barmaids told me that' even youths just beginning work in the mines talk nothing but dust and "" compo ""-compensation . The men admit they're . scared, aren't ashamed to say that three deaths recently have made them realize the dust menace is assuming unsuspected 'proportion. Dust is worse on the South Coast than elsewhere because South Coast coal is extra soft, and pulverises easily, so that when it is being extracted from the seam clouds of coal dust surround the men. A miner told me last week that at Corrimal mate loading coal on the opposite side of a .skip, five or six feet away. Even surface workers who have never been below have been found to have dusted lungs. These dusted lungs result from the dust settling on the chest, then gradually forming a gritty coating in the air passages. order.

The honourable member's time has expired. --Whateve r we think of the bill, we may be certain that the miners will welcome it. Ostensibly intended to deal out evenhanded justice, it pushes the mine-owners around and loads the miners with gifts. .Some clauses in the bill foreshadow and provide for improvement of the miners' working conditions, the introduction of mechanization, the removal of the dust conditions to which the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) has referred, and generally brighten the drab conditions in the mines. There are, of course, other provisions which empower the hoard to increase wages to a point which i! conceives to be compatible with the miners' well-being and the necessary production of coal. The board can fix the price of coal. To these proposals I agree., r am not concerned as to how much it will cost to improve the working conditions. Australia, which aspires to lead the world in industrial conditions, cannot rest tamely under the charge of not only tolerating, hut also encouraging, conditions which have their roots in the bad years of long ago. This measure, so the Minister tells us, is intended to benefit of 'the bill? There is an acute, shortage both the miners and the people of this of coal. The production per capita has country. The honourable member for Hunter ber for Hunter( Mr James) has referred ( Mr James), who has had an incomto the wasteful method by which coal is parably greater first-hand experience of extracted.

Of course they do, but he wishes us to adducefrom that portentous deliverance that,,.' if the mines were nationalized-that is. taken over by the people who own them, and have leased them-to the mine-owners Nothing is farther from the truth than, that. The honourable gentleman does not appreciate the fact that what the miners"" leaders, desire is not government control .. and operation of the mines by the people, for the people. That is the last thing the mines for the benefit of the miners, and them alone. They want to fix their own wages, charge .their own prices, andgive to the people just as much coal as they feel inclined to do. I do not lay that charge against the bulk of the miners,. the conditions in the industry, are nor the result of deliberate -determinationsby the great majority of the employees, but are due to the decisions of the mere handful who roll up to meetings. My experience is that gatherings at which decisions are made regarding strikes, stoppages, and the like are usually attendedby from 5 per cent, to 10 per. cent, of the persons affected. The great majority of the miners stay away from the meetings. Those who attend are ' overawed by the mob that act on written instructions from Moscow. Do honourable members think that Mr Wells, who talks of nationalization of the mines bringing peace to the industry, really wants peace ? If there were peace in. the coal-mining industry, his job would be gone. He thrives on unrest as do the leaders of other trade unions who take their -ordersfrom MoscowI refer to the Waterside Workers Federation, the Seamen's Union and the Iron Workers Union.

114,Mr Hughes (North Sydney [2.49],"because, as Mr Mighell has pointed out,-opposed to the ""dog-watch""-the.secon d shift and the introduction, of the machine. The miners have been opposed to the introduction of mechanical means for handling coal. It is true that, when -challenged, they deny this. Mr Wells says, "" We are for mechanization-in a planned and orderly way; and we are the persons to plan and order it "" . All that I can say is, that if there is no mechanization now for pillar extraction it is hecause, as Mr Justice Davidson pointed -outMechanization in pillar working, which at present is prohibited under legislation and by rulings of the Minister of Lands of the State of New South Wales, would substantially from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, increase productive capacity, .and lessen the fearful waste of an almost priceless asset that is now occurring. During my experience, which has been considerable, the miners have always -opposed ihe introduction of the machine. There is nothing in this bill which promises any different approach by the miners to this problem. They do not recognize their responsibilities as citizens. They, look at the matter from their own individual stand-point They, of course, are a' body apart. I remember Judge Heydon saying that it was as futile to talk about putting non-union labour into a mine as to talk of invading an enemy territory. The miners live together. They work in couples in the'mine. They and their families are housed together when outside the mine. They are thrown back upon themselves, all the time. I welcome everything in this bill which promises to give to the miner a chance to mingle with his fellow citizens on equal terms. Coal-mining is a drab uninviting industry. The question whether they get more than other workers does not influence me in the slightest degree. They do not work any harder than shearers or cane-cutters, but.they work under far different and much worse conditions. What we are here to do is to bring about peace in the coal industry. This bill 'will not do that. I pointed out last night that Mr Justice Edmunds was appointed by me because the miners would not attorn to the jurisdiction of the court that was then in existence. He awarded them eight hours from bank to bank, but this great concession did not bring peace. I then appointed Mr from 675 tons per man in 1939. to Charles Hibble, and he functioned on the tribunal for years. But strikes went on. Mr Justice Edmunds resigned his position because the miners treated his awards with contempt. They will take everything with both hands, but will give nothing in return. This bill has been brought in to increase the output of coal. It will not achieve that object unless discipline is observed; the miner must realize that. I know that it is of no use to talk about the enforcement of discipline. You have to get the miner to realize that discipline is in his interests as well as in ours. I repeat what I said last night, namely, that of the miners in the northern, southern and western fields are in favour of continuity of operations. Strikes are causing them to lose money, and they are building up for themselves a body of resentment. We were told in the press this, morning that there is a possibility of wholesale unemployment in the great secondary industries of New South Wales and Victoria because there is no coal. A worker in any other industry is as much entitled to consideration as is the miner. The miner is entitled to justice, but not to any greater degree than the average citizen. If we agree that the workers of this country are to all intents and purposes organized in unions, then this is a fight by this one union against every other union in the land. Let us have a fair deal all round. We have handed over to the miner the key industry, upon which all other industries depend. Other unionists .cannot do a day's work except by permission of the miner. This is a machine age. Without fuel industry cannot function. In this country this means that it must have coal. Our transport system depend? upon coal. The train and tram services are disorganized, rationed, re.duced to a mere skeleton, because, even though the tribunals that have been functioning during the Avar have conceded practically every demand the miners have made, there is an ever-increasing decline in the output of coal. In the United States of America, the output of coal per employee per annum before the war was 739 tons, and in 1944 it was 1,295 tons. In Australia, the output has declined 591 tons in 1940. use to talk about England. There, the seams are narrow and the miners have to get the coal while lying on their stomachs. But in the United States of America the coal seams are comparable with ours. Why can the output in that country be 1,295 tons per annum per man against 591 tons in Australia? The reason is, that America has continuity of operations, mechanization, and no government control. I do not intend to talk about government control. All that I say is that the people of this the public. Nevertheless, something must country must have coal, and that there must be peace in this industry. able gentleman's time has expired. not be said that the right honourable memBroadcasting Commission. Mr Wells, ber for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), to whom we have just listened, approached this subject in a bitter manner, as have some other honourable members opposite. His attitude is the right one. He would advance the interests of this country if he were to induce the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) to adopt a similar attitude. I know that from the rime when I was a lad in a mine .the right honourable gentleman has taken a . keen interest in coal-mining. I admit that he has done a lot for the coal-miners other industries are set up in mining disof this country. But some of his statements were not accurate. I agree that the miners were opposed to mechanization in his day. To-day, however, they are not 'opposed to it. What they are opposed to is mechanization in pillar extraction. I disagree with many of my colleagues in their opposition to it. No matter what system were adopted, pillar extraction would be highly dangerous. The miners contend that, because of the noise of the machinery, they cannot hear the roof working above them, and that should it cave in they would have no warning, and the result would be loss of life. During my recent travels overseas ! saw mechanized mines in operation; it was a great lesson to me. However, I was favorable to mechanization before then, despite the/fact that many oppose it. I would far sooner see a mechanical unit lost in pillar extraction than see a human life lost. I believe in mechanizaI t is of no tion, subject to proper controls, particularly stowage precautions. I do not believe that the coal-owners should have the right to employ machines for the removal of pillars indiscriminately, and should be able to order the miners to operate the machines at rates of pay 25 to 50 per cent, lower than they received on contract-work. I would oppose the mine-owners having the right to do that because although they would have an increased output at less cost, they would not reduce the selling price of coal to be done. It is not sufficient to oppose this measure merely for political reasons. This legislation will go a long way towards improving conditions in the coal industry. Recently, I participated in a debate which was broadcast over the national stations by the Australian the presidentof the miners' federation, and I presented one side of the case, and two representatives of the coal owners presented their case. I had nothing to do with the selection of speakers. As many miners may be listening to this debate to-day, I say to them that they should realize that they should co-operate with the management, and try to settle disputes in their initial stages before a stoppage takes place. If tricts, so that the children of miners can obtain employment adjacent to their homes, and if a shortage of coal then throws their children out of work, the miners will have brought home to them the effect of an industrial dispute. The miners do not believe what they read in the newspapers. They have no faith in the press, or in governments. The simple explanation is that the bitter experiences through which they have passed have robbed them of their faith. In 3929 and 1930, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) joined with me in criticizing the Bruce Page Government when it allowed the coal-owners to use some millions of tons of coal, that had been at grass during World WarI . , to lock out the miners for sixteen months in 1929-30.. The government of the day did absolutely nothing to bring about asettlement. At the request of the right",40,Effect Of Full Standardization

116,Mr James (Hunter) [3.3],"It canhonorable member for North Sydney and the then honourable member for Fawkner, Mr Maxwell, and three or four others on the government side of the House, the then government decided to take action against the late Mr John Brown. But when the Parliament went into recess the proposed prosecutions were dropped. Although there was an award of the tribunal, presided over by Mr Charles Hibble, who was appointed by the right honourable member for North Sydney when he was Prime Minister, the coal-' owners, by using the coal which was at grass, were able to starve the miners into submission. The men had to accept a 12-J per cent, reduction of their wages, in a breach of an award of the court. Such actions on the part of the coal owners are among the root causes of the miners' loss of faith. To-day, they have no faith in anybody; they believe that every other person in the community is trying to "" take them down "". It is that lack of faith in others that makes them provide for themselves. They live their own community life; they build their own hospitals. The coal-owners have not contributed one penny to the hospitals on the coal-fields. Those institutions have ' can help to maintain peace in industry. been built out of the earnings of the miners, so that medical attention may be available for themselves and their families. The miners contribute to funds out of which their burial expenses are met; they provide their own social services. They do these things because of their lack of faith in others. We must-, try to restore the lost faith of the miners in other sections of the community. We must show them that they constitute an important part of the community; that on them the country's progress largely depends. We must discourage the constant condemnation of the miners by newspapers. Unfortunately, that condemnation is expressed in general terms; miners as a whole are criticized and condemned. Those who speak scathingly >>f miners as a class probably do not know-or , if they do know, they conveniently overlook the fact-that some miners have never lost a day's work in twenty years. Of course, the miners resent these constant attacks on them. They have a right to do so. What the right honourable member for North Sydney said is perfectly true: these men want to work; they do not want to be condemned day after day. I do not want to be personal in this debate.' I want to help this industry. I want, if I can, to help the miners to realize that they constitute an important unit in this country'sprogress. 11 an appeal is made to them on the right lines I believe that they will respond. But concurrently with that appeal to them there must be an appeal to the coal-owners also. There must no longer be what is termed an "" upper social stratum "" in mining districts. We must get away from a social system under which the coal-owners live to themselves, having their own bowling greens and golf clubs from which workers in the mines are excluded. . The amenities for which this, bill makes provision will probably bring the coal-miners and the coal-owners closer together. I hope to see the, day when they will work togetherinstead of opposing one another. When I was in Great Britain recently I saw a number of clubs which are frequented by those engaged inmining. There are no sueh clubs on the coal-fields of New South Wales. At Collie, in Western Australia, I have seen how the existence of a club In a club a mine manager may approach the chairman of the miners' lodge and, over a drink of amber fluid, settle a pending dispute. What has been done along those lines on the coal-fields of NewSou th Wales? The bill also makes provision for the amicable settlement of disputes. It also provides for the training of youths in coal mining, so that they will have some knowledge of the industry before they go to work in the mines. At Sheffield, England, in company with Mr Jack, an officer of the Coal Commission, I saw training centres where youths who intended to engage in coal-mining were trained on the surface No such training has ever been attempted in Australia. In this hill the Government says that money will be expended to make coal mining more attractive. I want the honorafr'e member for Wentworth to retract what he has said. His remarks were broadcast, and, doubtless, were listened to by many persons in the community. He took advantage of the opportunity to present incomplete facts to the people. When he referred to casualties in coalKembla, Mount Mulligan, B u l l i , Stanmines he took mainly the depression ford-Merthyr, Dudley, and Greta.

The casualties among metalliferous miners have been cited against the coal-miners. D u r in g the depression a bounty was paid on the production of gold. Naturally, more men were employed in metalliferous mining while, on the other hand, coal-mining declined. Upt ill that time the population of Kalgoorlie and Boulder had been rapidly declining. It had, in fact, declined from 50,000 to 10,000, hut with the help of the gold bounty it immediately began number of persons engaged in the coal mining industry has been: continuously declining. In my own electorate, 13,000 coal-ininers used to be employed up to 1929, but by 1936 that number had declined to 7,000. A t one time, the total number of coal-miners employed in the Commonwealth Was 24,000, but it is now only 15,000.

On. Sunday next, the Ministerf or the United States of America, where lie will take up the position pf Ambassador for Australia. It seems to me to be appropriate that on this occasion something should be said in farewell. I do notsuggest that I have always agreed with the overseas appointments made hy the Department of External Affairs, but in'this instance Australia's first ambassador is a man 'who has had a very distinguished record in. this House. Years ;igo, he occupied the same position as you now occupy, Mr Speaker. I was not then a member of the House, but r have been informed that he was regarded as the second best Speaker who .had ever filled the position, and that is a high tribute. It seems to me. that we should be lacking in the proprieties if we allowed the honourable member to go without some reference to his departure. As a member of the Opposition, holdingno official position, I wish hi m success in his mission to the United States of America, and we trust that his services there will be of benefit to the Commonwealth-. It is obvious that in. the years ahead relations between Australia and the United States of America w ill be of the utmost importance, to this country. I j o in with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) in expressing my best wishes, and those of other members of the Australian Country party, to the Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Makin) on the occasion of his departure for the United States of America to take up the position of Australia's first Ambassador. He came into this Parliament at the same time as I did. 27 years ago, and since then he has occupied some very distinguished positions. Although he and I have differed greatly in politics, I have never doubted that he always sought to do what he believed was the 'best for his country. I am confident that his activities in the United States of America will be of benefit, not only to Australia and to the United States of America, but through their co-operation to the whole world. When a man is appointed to so important a position, he ceases to represent any party but becomes the representative of all Australians; and we shall regard h i m as such. I take this opportunity to explain my reason for addressing a question this morning to the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) when I asked why the price of Australian butter in our contract with the United Kingdom was lower than the price at which Great Britain has contracted to buy butter from Denmark. I asked the question in a friendly way, because I hoped that the Minister would set out the facts with regard to Great Britain's needs of that, commodity, and also its treatment of Australian producers of butter. I thought that the Minister would have made it clear that at this particular time Australia should not try to get the last penny out of Great Britain, because; as I shall show, the Government is receiving from GreatB r it a in a substantial amount which it refuses to pass on to the butter producers. I take this opportunity to recapitulate the history of this matter during the war years. In 1938, the year before the war, when I was in London as Ministerf o r CommerceI arranged with Sir Henry French, the British Controller of Food, to sell to GreatB r it a in the whole",44,Prisonersof Wak
128,I Be Wavy ( Mr Makin),w i ll leave for,45,Prisonersof Wak
129,Sir Earle Page (Cowper),"[3.23]of our butter exports. At that time all arrangements were completed, except tbe price, which was about to be fixed when war broke out. The-committee to handle the transaction was appointed. price was fixed, not in any haphazard fashion, but on the basis of an offer from the British Government which was submitted to the Dairy Products Export Control Board which asked for a conference of all bodies interested in -the production of butter in this country. That conference decided that the British offer was reasonable and should be accepted. Subject to other conditions, one of which was that Great Britain should guarantee to provide the necessary shipping, and agree to pay for any butter which was stored in Australia while awaiting shipment, Great Britain arrangement; and the agreement was implemented. No pressure whatever was brought to bear upon Great Britain to pay a higher price until 1944 when this Government raised the aspect of the increased cost of production. Tn 1942'the Prices Commissioner had increased the price to the producer by Id. per lb., and in order to prevent further costs consumer the Government subsidized the industry, first, to the amount of £2,000,000, and, subsequently, to the amount of £6,500,000. But in 1944 negotiations were entered into direct with the British Government by representatives of the industry in Australia who had arranged the original contract; and, finally, in 1945 an arrangement was made whereby the British Government agreed to increase its payments by 42s. a cwt. Britain act in the matter that the Auditor-General in his report for the year ended the 30th June, 3945, pointed out that Great Britain agreed not' only to increase' the price from 134s. a cwt. to ISOs. Sid. a cwt. but also to pay an additional subsidy of 16s. 8d. a cwt. in order to help the Australian producer. In addition, Great Britain agreed to pay that subsidy retrospectively as from the 1st April, 1943. It has actually paid to the Commonwealth that subsidy totalling £3,000,000 up to the 30th June, 1945, whilst £300,000 is still outstanding on that account. The subsidy for 1945-46 is Sir Earle Page. additional. That payment was something over and above the price at which Great Britain .contracted to buy Australian butter. Therefore, there is not the least That justification for saying that Great Britain has been hard to deal with in this matter. Our objection has always been that the Government has paid the British subsidy into the Treasury and refused to pass it on to the butter producers of this country. Consequently, the producers are receiving 16s. 8d. a cwt. less than export parity on the whole of their butter. I also point out that a new agreement is now being negotiated. How are those negotiations being carried on? They are not being conducted by a member of the Government who would necessarily have to go abroad for that accepted that purpose, but by the representatives of the butter industry, including Mr Sheehy, Mr Gibson and Major King, who are negotiating for an agreement on a basis which will enable the industry to carry on. You, Mr Speaker, called a Minister to order when he interjected "" You old humbug-"" when I was asking my question. I hoped that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture would put on record the generosity with which Great being passed on to the Britain has always been prepared to meet Australia with respect to the purchase of not only our butter, but also wool and other primary products. In 1942 Great Britain, without any direct request having been made to it, agreed to pay an additional 2d. per lb. for Australian wool. It is the Minister's duty to make these facts known instead of implying that we. are obliged to bludgeon Great Britain into paying reasonable prices for our products. Great Britain displays this So generously did Great generosity at a time when it is more in need of money and food than at any other time in its history. The Government has failed badly to supply greater quantities of butter than it originally contracted to. supply to Great Britain. ""When we are not able to-supply the whole of Britain's butter requirements we should be the last to criticize Great Britain because it is buying butter from Denmark. join with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) in congratulating .the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) upon his",45,Prisonersof Wak

I have been a member of this House for only a few years, but the Minister has been of great assistance to me. I know something about his early career in South Australia. He has always been held in the highest esteem by South Australians, whom he has so faithfully represented in this Parliament. I am confident that in his new office he will do justice to himself and credit to this wonderful country, which he loves so much. health in the future, I trust that he will be spared to come back to this country and give to it the benefit of the valuable experience which he gains abroad. I join with pleasure in the sentiments expressed by honourable members who have voiced their appreciation of his splendid work. It is gratifying to hear such praise fall from the lips of honourable gentlemen opposite who are not of the same political persuasion. I wish the Minister every success in his mission. join with honourable ""members in wishing the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) every success in his important mission as Australia's first Ambassador in the United States of America. Ever since I have been privileged to be a member of this Parliament I have enjoyed his friendship and profited by his kindly advice. Although honourable members on this side of the House view national and other problems from a different perspective from that in which they are seen by the Minister, we readily acknowledge that he has conscientiously devoted himself to his duties and has dispharged them with credit. The honourable gentleman, who has occupied important posts in the Parliament, first as Speaker of this House, and later as Minister of the Crown, leaves behind him a record of achievement of which he might well be proud. I join with other honourable members in wishing him every success in his important office and trust that through his efforts the friendship that exists between Australia, and the United States of America may be even more firmly N cemented. The future of this country and the prosperity of its people depend not only upon our own efforts but also upon the maintenance of goodwill between [130] the, English-speaking peoples of the world. We can depend upon the honourable gentleman to work to that end, and I look forward to hearing frequently of the successes which I trust he will achieve in his new and important office I am sorry at this stage to have to introduce a discordant note, but the urgency of a situation which I propose to outline compels me to do so. I draw attention to the racketeering' that is I wish him good taking place in Brisbane in connection with housing. .Representations have been made to me by the combined organizations of returned soldiers, who are just, as much concerned about the conditions that exist there as I am, that immediate action should be taken to-curb the activities of Australian people who are exploiting the black market. I base my remarks on an article which was published in the Brisbane Sunday Mail dealing with housing costs rackets and representations from the secretary of the Queensland United Council of ex-Servicemen. The serious shortage of houses perhaps excusable during the war, has merely been accentuated during this first year of peace. The housing position in Brisbane to-day is calamitous. Economic ills of every kind flow from the housing shortage, ranging from child delinquency to higher child mortality, from a decline in public health to strained marital ties resulting in a cluttering up of divorce courts with wrecked marriages. If this problem is not dealt with immediately, and in a resolute manner, a shattering blow may he dealt to the moral, physical and economical fibres of Australian national life from which it might never recover. So seriously has the question been regarded in South Africa, that in a recent speech, the Governor General of . the Union referred to the passing of the Housing (Emergency Powers) Act to speed up home-building. In his. first speech to the New Zealand Parliament at Wellington as Governor-jGeneral of that dominion, General Sir Bernard Freyberg, V.C., saidThe housing of ex-servicemen is a matter of special concern to my Government, and considerable progress has been made despite shortages of building materials and labour.

On the 2nd July, Mr R. H . Coates, acting honorary secretary of the Queensland United Council of ex-Servicemen, wrote to the Honourable H . A . Bruce, Ministerf o r Works, in Queensland, as follows:I have by direction of this Council to submit . the following resolution passed by them at their last meeting:"" That this Council calls the attention of the Queensland Government to published statements in the Sunday Mail on the 19th May, 1943, alleging excessive building charges and racketeering, also of black-marketing by various sections of the Building Trade. "" That we further call upon the Government to appoint a properly constituted Commission of Inquiry into the matter, such Commission to accept evidence from representatives of reputable ex-servicemen's and other organizations interested."" It is felt by .the United Council of exServicemen (Queensland) that the charges made by the Sunday Mail are so grave that in the interests of tlie people generally, itnd ex-servicemen in particular,, the State Government should probe these allegations. We are concerned at the lag in the building of homes for men discharged from the Forces as disclosed by the latest figures of 29 per cent, of the quota to June 1946, of homes constructed or under construction, and feel that such charges if sustained must operate against a complete fulfilment of the Government's housing policy. The Minister replied as follows:Your letter of the 2nd July received, requesting that the Government appoint a properly constituted commission of inquiry into the The honourable statements published in the Sunday Mail of the 19th May, 1046, alleging excessive building charges and racketeering, also blackmarketing by various sections of the building trade.

Tlie lag is further accentuated by the strike that is at present, taking place all over Queensland insofar as housing material procured from the southern States is not available owing to the waterside workers being on strike in sympathy with tlie meat workers.

The time has come when he is about to leave parliamentary life to take up duties as an Ambassador .for this country in a foreign land. For many years the honourable gentleman fought a lone fight in South Australia on behalf of the Labour movement. For a considerable time he was one of a comparatively small band of Labour representatives in this Parliament, and I believe that it was the high regard in which the Minister was held personally in South Australia during those years that eventually built up in that State a high opinion of the Australian Labour party-so high, in fact, that, with the support and the co-operation of the Minister at the last general elections, South Australia returned three Labour senators and five Labour members to the House of Representatives. We shall miss him at the forthcoming general elections. appreciate the great service he has rendered not only to South Australia, but to the Commonwealth. As I said to him privately a few moments ago, I hope to meet him very soon in his new sphere. I believe that he will be a great Ambassahas been called. dor for Australia. I believe that as a result of his work, the United States of America will be even more friendly towards Australia which will be of immense assistance to us. No more suitable man could have been chosen as our first Ambassador to that country. I am.confident that he will take with him from Australia the good wishes of not only the members of the Australian Labour party but also the members of every other political organization in Australia. We all desire him to return to Australia at the end of his term in Washington, endowed with knowledge that will be of benefit to his country. In a few years he carried out his duties with great dignity may again grace this House as the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I wish him well. With his departure I shall regretfully lose personal contact with a wise counsellor and a very good friend. ijroud to add my tribute to those paid to die Minister for the Navy( Mr with other honourable members in bidding Makin) on .the eve of his departure to take up his new duties as Australia's first Ambassador to Washington. I have not known the honourable gentleman go intimately and for so many years as have other honourable members, but in the last few years I have grown to know his innate qualities and abilities. He is undoubtedly a credit to the Australian Labour movement. He is a man of whom this Parliament and the Australian people can well be proud. In his new sphere he is certain to add lustre to the splendid record that he has established in his long association With the Commonwealth Parliament. At no other time could a man of his calibre play a greater part in shaping the destiny of the world. We have passed through trying times and entered upon what we hope is a new era, an era in which the nations of the world will collaborate and cement ties of friendship. We hope to avoid the bloodbaths' that have too frequently enveloped the nations instead of the spirit of real friendship and comradeship that should animate all We peoples. Australia could send abroad no man who could more adequately and nobly promote the new spirit. The honorable gentleman has been an ornament to this Parliament and will be a credit to Australia in the. high office to which he desire to pay tribute to the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin). I shall miss him. For many years he has been a dear friend. Since my advent to the Commonwealth Parliament he has been most helpful on all matters on which I have approached him. The high esteem in which he is held in South Australia is proved by the fact that for more than a quarter of a century he has been returned to this House as member for the Division of Hindmarsh. As the representative of his constituents he has and ability. I know that as Australia's Ambassador to Washington he will be a credit to his.country.

As the -Leader of the Government and as a friend of the honourable gentleman for a long period I desire to say how deeply I regret his departure, which temporarily severs my contact with a man whose friendship I value highly. On behalf of the Government, I express gratitude for his loyal co-operation with his colleagues in the Ministry during the last five years. He leaves with our best wishes, warmest admiration and deepest affection. a representative of Victoria, although a comparatively new one, I heartily join with honourable members from the other States in bidding farewell to the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin). I think that all Victorians wish him well and have every confidence in his ability to render very efficient service to Australia at Washington. I regard the honourable gentleman as a member of a ""vanishing race"" in that he, as had his former leader, the late John Curtin, has a political approach that is unfortunately disappearing, in Australia particularly. When I came to this Parliament as a new member, I found that both the late Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, regardless of my political affiliations, offered me helpful advice. I know that my experience was shared by other new members. That went deep into my heart. I have the greatest respect for any man who can approach life in that way, because that is tlie attitude that we so urgently need but are unfortunately losing. The honourable gentleman is a member of a small band ofpoliticians who have won and retained the admiration and respect of all the people of their country. inarches on, and to-day brings about a parting between myself and a* man with whom I have been associated for many years. Tbe Minister for the Navy( Mr He is indeed a Makin), in the various public positions It is perfectly that he has held, has proved himself to be a great Australian. It is my firm belief that every man who enters public life endeavours to do the best that he can for Australia. Norman Makin has associated with him for a long time, 1 have no doubt as to the results of his work as Australia's Ambassador in the United States of America. He and his family have every reason to be proud, of his achievements in his political life-time. I associate myself with the remarks of other honourable members. too, pay my tribute to our worthy colleague, the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin),'who is about to leave to represent Australia in the United States of America. Everybody in this Parliament, and every intelligent person, not only in South Australia, but also throughout the Commonwealth, knows of the achievements of the honourable gentleman. Furthermore, he had the honour and privilege to be the first President of the Security Council of the United Nations, so that now his name is known throughout the world. We in Australia know of his ability and sincerity. He has served his country faithfully. Asother honourable members have said, he "" held the for t "" for many years in South Australia as a representative of the Australian Labour party, in whose creed he has a deep faith. I have had the privilege of knowing him for many years. Most of my relatives still live in the Division of Hindmarsh, which he represents in this House. They appreciate his capacity and sincerity, have always wished him well, and have always been numbered amongst his loyal supporters. I trust that he will strengthen the very firm friendship that, already exists between Australia and the great United States of America, which is 1 probablythe greatest nation in the world to-day.

Then Mr Makin, in association with the late Frank Anstey, was carrying the banner of the Australian Labour party, a job which required courrole very satisfactorily. His personal age in those days.

Throughout his career the Minister has realized that no man can live unto himself. Whether it be in. a -simple act or in an important one we should all realize that our conduct will affect other members of the community. Awareness of this fact has guided the honourable gentleman in many of his tasks. Because of the consideration for others which he has always shown, he has earned the respect of all sections of the, community regardless of their political beliefs. He has never compromised with his conscience; he has been honest to himself and to the nation. He will be greeted in Anierica with the same respect with which he is regarded in Australia; He will bring credit not only upon himself but also upon this great young nation.' . 1 first met the Minister for the Navy the splendid opportunities that have come ( Mr Makin) during my successful bymy way. I have shared richly in the election campaign in the Fremantle electorate. Throughout my association with him on public platforms at that time, I noticed the immense respect which he inspired amongst the people. During the year in which I have been a member of this Parliament, I have come to know him fairly well and I have learned to value both his friendship and his advice. Although we regret his departure, his appointment is a matter for congratulation both for the Government and for himself. It is a truism that friendly relations with the United States of America are of vital importance to Australia. The British Dominions occupy a very important position in relation to the United States of America, being links between that country and Great Britain which do not arouse the traditional suspicion with which many American citizens regard Great Britain. I am certain that the honourable gentleman is admirably endowed with qualities that will enable him to fulfil his new character and his philosophy will appeal to a very wide section of opinion in United States of America is new to its present world pre-eminence, and I know that he will stand up for the interests of Australia against any section within the That was good advice.

I am deeply moved by the tributes, that honourable gentlemen have paid to me on this, my last appearance, at least for a time, in the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

Not only have I had the privileges of representing wonderful people in the constituency of Hindmarsh, but also I was entrusted with the high and honourable office of Speaker of this House, and 1 remember with satisfaction my pleasure when that honour was conferred upon me. Some years later, when Australia was in dire peril and an enemy threatened its security, I was called to be one of the trusted Ministers of the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, and to render to him assistance and advice in those dark days. My appointment as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions at that critical period was one of the greatest honours that could be bestowed upon any man, because it afforded to me the opportunity to serve my country in its dire need. LaterI represented Australia at the first meeting of the United Nations, and I had the' honour of being elected first president of the Security Council. Now, I have been further honoured; the Government has appointed me as its first Ambassador to the United States of America. Undoubtedly such experiences deeply enrich one's life, and I am profoundly grateful for all those manifestations of great goodness. The tributes that honourable members with the feeling of assurance that my on both sides of tlie chamber.have paid friends in Australia are supporting me in to me personally and to my public service the important task I am about to hav""e touched me deeply.

I leave this House Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [4.25].' I believe that those out his mission, I have no doubt that be will act with dignityj ability and sincerity, and bring credit to Australia during the years that he will serve us in the capital city of the great United States of America. A question was raised in the House this morning concerning the booklet entitled Australia and Your Future, issued by the Department of Information. I originally drew attention to this matter last Tuesday, and the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), in reply, questioned my honesty of purpose. In fact, he accused me of misquoting the booklet. That charge I deny. My question, as honourable members w ill appreciate, when they refer to Hansard, did not purport to give a literal quotation of the text of the booklet at any point, but it was intended as a f a i r and accurate presentation of the purport and substance of matter contained in the booklet. The first part of my question contained this statement as f a i r l y representa budget which would leave them halfing an assertion contained in the bookletThat 22s. a-week rental will provide a com' fortable unfurnished home for a man, his wife and three children. The relevant matter in the booklet is as follows:Rentals vary considerably in different localities, but the sum set out above, £1 2s., would provide a comfortable house for such a family, the assumption being that the husband would be the owner of sufficient furniture. , There is nothing at all in the way of squares. In an article published in the literal substantiation there is a fair and accurate tation of the purport and substance of the was shown to vary in that city from £145 matter contained in the booklet. next part of my question embodied the trial suburbs, to £200 a square in others. statement Is. 6d., or l^d. each.

Such houses would unpair and ordinary shoes 18s. lid. a pair. doubtedly cost 35s. a week, if taken on The item in the booklet actually ""Shoes 18s. lid.. The last part of my question that the figures supplied relate to any Dame Enid Lyons. to which exception has been taken was couched in these termsA wife can be adequately clothed for £12 8s. 2d. a year, a boy of 10i for £9 18s. 4d., and a girl of 7 £8 19s. a year. In the booklet, the following paragraph appears, under the heading "" H o w the Basic Wage Works o u t "" The allocation for clothes in the above minimum budget is based on a yearly allocation of £24 12s.. lOd. for the husband, working out at 9s. 5d. a week; £12 8s. 2d. for the wife, or 4s. 9d. per week; £9 18s. 4d. for a boy of 104, or 3s. lOd. per week; £8 19s. for a girl of seven, or 3s. 5d. per week; and £5 7s. 5d. for a boy of 34, or 2s. Id. per week. I maintain that I did not, either in intention or in fact, misrepresent the statements in the booklet. The word "" adequate "" does not appear in it , but it is most certainly suggested. Its use in my question in no way misrepresented the purport of the whole booklet. What would be the point in presenting an inadequate budget? Would anybody setting out to attract migrants offer them clothed or underfed? The whole booklet is entirely misleading. Australian housewives have laughed loudly at the figures, but a newly-arrived immigrant would not do so. The booklet also refers to housing. How many houses in Canberra could be secured at a rental of £1 2s. a week unless in slum areas and under slum conditions? It is generally estimated that the minimum space required for a man, his wife and three children, the kind of family dealt w it h in the booklet, is eleven of the matter, but Sydney Morning Herald before this conrepresentroversy arose, the cost of house-building The a square in the industrial or near industhat one dozen oranges cost That represents a cost for each house words are, "" one dozen at 22s. a week? It would seem most unThen my likely that the figures given in the booklet with regard to rentals are likely to be the actual rents prevailing in Australia for read, a rental-purchase basis. I look .in vain (best), £1 5s. 8d.; (ordinary), through the booklet for any statement one year. The Minister, in his reply to my question, said that they related to normal times, and not to war-time conditions or the conditions obtaining now. It so happens that there is one part of the booklet where a date appears. Under the heading "" Howthe Basic Wage Works Out"", one finds these wordsTaking the basic wage at £4 18e. Od. a week, ment to the British Government. Of the and lidding child endowment of 7s.

Gd. would provide a budget somewhat like the following, which has been compiled unofficially. After that statement, the booklet gives the prices which have been questioned so widely throughout Australia. considered the matter very carefully, I suggest that a mistake has been made somewhere in the compilation of the booklet. The Minister, apparently, was under the impression that the figures given in it related to pre-war years; yet, according to the body of the booklet, they represent livingcosts in a typical Australian city to-day. Anyone reading the booklet, at any rate in an overseas country, would be. under the impression that he or she could live in Australia in reasonably comfortable circumstances ou the amounts stated. I suggest to the Government that, even at this late hour, the booklet be withdrawn and reprinted, giving such figures as will enable people overseas to have a true appreciation of what conditions they can expect to find when they come here -Last week, I asked whether supplies of for the.

The amount of £37,800 has been paid by the Australian Governtotal, £22,S0O was accounted for by entries that had been made in the soldiers' paybooks by .the British paymasters at the time of payment. Where the Australian soldier could not produce the.

In a number of instances, "" green "" pay-books were not banded in by the personnel concerned to Having Australian paymasters; consequently the amounts received by the personnel were not brought to account when the soldiers' services were terminated. These amounts represent £15,000 of the total of £37,S00 paid by the British paymasters. Whilst the amounts in question are properly recoverable from the ex-soldiers concerned, I have issued the instruction that where the soldier has been discharged and the final payment has been effected, recoveries are no't to be made of any amounts received from British paymasters at the time when the personnel were released.

Quite a lot of uncertainty exists to-day as to when the demobilization of the armed forces will be completed under the points system. On this subject, a soldier has written to me in these terms, I would appreciate some information, if you could obtain it . as to the possibility of the Government completing demobilization by 80th September, as publicly stated by the Minisister for the Army on a number of occasions, as well as by the Director of Demobilization. Major-General Savige, in reporting progress. I have 104 demobilization points, having enlisted at 21 and have had three and a half years' service. I have been content to await my priority but always accepted the fact that the limiting date would be September 30th. Tins impression has been strengthened from time to time by official statements that the demobilization programme was ahead of schedule. In the .last few months there has been no sign of this progress. . A t (ith June orders staled that all with over 130 points were to he disi-hargetl"" without reference to higher authority"", and at the same time 112 points became "" high priority points for discharge. "" The latter means that personnel in that group are available for discharge provided replacements are available to their unit. In point of fact such reinforcements are rare and discharge comes when units receive the order to discharge authority. The latest order received states that by August 17 all with over 120 points will be discharged without reference to higher authoritv and "" h i g h p r i o r it y "" points stand at 112. 120 points for single men under 22 years of age at enlistment. being ahead of its schedule, the Government must fall down on its undertaking plete definite admission of the facts is overdue, and Mr II illuhinson. also an indication as to when the other groups may expect discharge and when demobilization will be complete. In the week ended the 20th July, the Minister for the Array( Mr Forde) made in this House a statement to the effect that the number of volunteers for service in the interim defence force was not large. He said that of a total of 9,818 enlistments, 9,675 men had volunteered for service in Japan. That means that the number who volunteered for. service in Australia was only 143, and is complete evidence of the lack of a defence programme on the part of the Government. Obviously, if replacements have to be made, demobilization must be delayed. I ask that a carefully considered statement on this subject be made by the Minister at the earliest possible dateI hope next week. The men still in the services are anxious to return to civil life. They have been led to expect that the latest 'date of demobilization would be the 30th September, but it now appears that there is no possibility of demobilization being Completed by then. If circumstances have changed, the House should be notified, so .that men still in the services may know what to expect. Question resolved in the affirmative.
