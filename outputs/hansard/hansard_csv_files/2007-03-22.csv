164,Mr Adams,"to move:Thursday, 22 March 2007 ----Hockey Australia success of Australia’s national hockey teams, the Hockeyroos and the Kookaburras, and the success they have had over the last 20 years. Much of this tremendous national success has been a result of Hockey Australia’s high-performance program, which since 1984 has been based at the Perth Hockey Stadium near Curtin University in Perth. Hockey Australia is now reviewing where the home of the high-performance program will be. The board of Hockey Australia was due to make its decision about that matter at its meeting on 17-18 February. That meeting deferred the decision until the board’s next meeting on 20 April. In the run-up to the board’s February meeting, I very much welcomed the following statement by the new Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator George Brandis: Not all the centres for sporting excellence in Australia are in the south-east corner of the country. Nor should they be. I made the point at the time that both the board of Hockey Australia and the Australian Sports Commission should take very careful note of that message from the minister. I now have very grave concerns that the board of Hockey Australia and the Australian Sports Commission are deliberately ignoring that message sent to them by the minister. The Australian Sports Commission have made it clear on a number of occasions at Senate estimates that they will simply rubber-stamp whatever decision is made by the board of Hockey Australia. There are clearly national interest issues here which the Australian Sports Commission cannot wash its hands of. I fear that the Australian Sports Commission is effectively engaging in a conspiracy of silence with elements of the board of Hockey Australia to move the High Performance Unit from Perth to Sydney, not on the basis of merit but on the basis of a Sydney and south-east Australia phobia of the west. I am also very concerned that Hockey Australia is now engaged in a tainted process. When the board delayed its decision in February, it enabled Hockey New South Wales to have full and detailed knowledge of the bid by the Western Australia Hockey Association for the location of the unit to continue in Western Australia. There are members on the board of Hockey Australia who are clearly in a conflict of interest position. There is now a very grave danger that in a conspiracy of silence, without any transparency, without any objectivity, the board of Hockey Australia will change the location of the High Performance Unit from Perth to Sydney. This decision will be based not on merit but on a Sydney and New South Wales phobia of the west. The board of Hockey Australia and the Australian Sports Commission should pay heed to the message sent to them by the new minister. It is not in the national interest to have high-performance units located solely in the south-east corner, and this should be the subject of national attention and national interest.

165,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,,125,Statements By Members
166,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (9.30 Am),"Many Australians are aware of the tremendousPetrie Electorate: Redcliffe Hospital Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (9.33 am)-TodayI rise to speak about the appalling state of Redcliffe Hospital. I have real concerns regarding this hospital in my electorate of Petrie, but what is the state member for Redcliffe, Lillian Van Litsenburg, doing to fix the hospital? Absolutely nothing, I am very sorry to say. Ms Van Litsenburg and her boss, Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, have a very poor record on health. I note that in the Redcliffe & Bayside Herald of Wednesday, 14 March, there are no less than three articles which highlight the appalling state of this local hospital and its health services. One newspaper report tells the story of a fit and healthy young Clontarf woman who was hit with a sudden illness so severe that she could not sit up, but she was denied access to the hospital’s emergency department. She spent the whole night on a gurney after being told that nine out of the 10 beds in the emergency department that night were taken up with people suffering from smoking related illnesses. Her commitment to a healthy lifestyle meant absolutely nothing to the Beattie government. The hospital is currently being reviewed after the public hospitals performance report that was released earlier this month showed higher than normal death and surgery complication rates for some patient categories. This included common complaints such as heart attacks and strokes, and higher than average complication rates for some surgery, including hysterectomies. I would like to acknowledge the most wonderful work that the hospital staff do, particularly under these very difficult and trying conditions, and I want to pay tribute to them for showing up to work each day, particularly when their budgets are being cut and they are working under incredible conditions. But why is this hospital not being properly resourced? That is what Lillian Van Litsenburg, as the state member, really needs to address. She needs to stand up and fight for funds for her electorate. She needs to fight for better health services for the people of Redcliffe. There is Peter Beattie’s shameful record on the emergency department of the nearby Caboolture Hospital, which was closed for a while, with all of the emergency patients again transferred to Redcliffe Hospital in my electorate, placing even further incredible burdens on the Redcliffe Hospital. The low number of ambulance officers in the Redcliffe region is also a real concern to many of my constituents. The electorate has a high percentage of elderly residents who rely on their local ambulance officers to be available when they need them most. Reducing the number of ambulance officers available on the Redcliffe peninsula places enormous pressure on the dedicated officers who remain in the area and who have seen a dramatic increase in their workload. It is unbelievable that the people of Redcliffe have had to put up with a dreadful hospital system and now they also have to put up with a reduction in the funding available to the ambulance services. They deserve more than this. (Time expired) Werriwa Electorate: Roads residents of Ingleburn, Macquarie Fields, Glenfield, Minto and other suburbs: the state of the crossing at the Cambridge Avenue bridge in Glenfield. The crossing at Glenfield at CamMAIN COMMITTEE",125,Statements By Members
167,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.36 Am),"TodayI want to raise an issue of great concern to thebridge Avenue is not really a bridge; it is a crossing over a causeway. It was constructed by the Defence Force in the 1940s so that they could access the Ingleburn railway station from their Moorebank and Holsworthy facilities. In 1948 the causeway was opened to the public. The causeway provides an essential transport link to many of the residents of the south-west of Sydney. Anyone familiar with that region would know that a great number of the residents travel outside the area each day to work and many travel across the Cambridge Avenue bridge. The population growth over the last few decades has increased the use of the bridge and has highlighted some of its inherent safety problems. I have had my own near miss with the bridge when a car came a little too close one morning when I was out running, forcing me to jump from the bridge into the river. This near miss is not an isolated incident and is, sadly, not the worse. I am aware of two fatalities that have occurred in the area, sadly, one as recently as last year when a firefighter, Steven Richardson, was killed in a head-on collision on his way to a fire. During my by-election the state of the causeway and the inherent dangers were raised with me regularly. At the time. I received advice from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence that a transport plan was being prepared and that, once commissioned, the plan would take six to nine months to complete. That was back in April 2005. A year after, the Campbelltown City Council received an almost identically worded letter from the Commonwealth. So in 12 months not only had the government not made any progress in finding a solution; it could not even be bothered updating its letter of response. In June 2006 the parliamentary secretary informed me that the report on the proposed Moorebank freight hub was expected to be completed later that year. He also indicated that the report would outline the requirement for funding and upgrading of the transport infrastructure. I was still awaiting this report in February this year when another storm event occurred, with flooding closing the bridge to traffic, creating local chaos and shifting the traffic burden to the M5. I immediately wrote to the Minister for Defence to find out the status of the report, but to date I have not received an acknowledgement, let alone an answer to that correspondence. Like me, many local residents, including Barry Jarrett and Melissa Wellfare, continue to wait for pretty simple answers to some simple questions. Minister, what have you got to hide? (Time expired) Port of Brisbane Motorway Project roads, and businesses need better roads to transport their goods. Improved roads not only help reduce the number of traffic accidents and congestion but also provide a major boost to our economy, and that means more jobs. The port of Brisbane is the third busiest and fastest growing port in Australia. It continues to play an extremely important role in helping local businesses in Bonner export and therefore create jobs. Unfortunately, while we have a first class port, we have a second-class road network, and the Port of Brisbane Motorway needs not only extending but also immediate improvement. That is why I am fighting to secure funding from this government for the upgrade of the motorway. We have already delivered $1.2 million in Commonwealth funding for a planning study to examine the future extension of the motorway, and I am pleased to report that this study is now well underway. MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Statements By Members
168,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (9.39 Am),"All residents in Bonner have a right to drive on saferI also take this opportunity to thank my senior colleague the Hon. Mark Vaile MP, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, for the interest he has shown in the port of Brisbane, and I commend him for having committed $1.2 million in funding for this extremely important planning study. Of course, there is more to be done and further substantial funds are needed to carry through with the extension and upgrade of the motorway as soon as possible. I will continue to make serious representations to my federal and state colleagues on this matter to secure the needed investment in the Port of Brisbane Motorway. The project has my full support and that of the local community. I am determined to deliver an improved road network that will ensure not only the safety of drivers but also the continued expansion of our booming port. In recent weeks I have been pleased to announce to the Bonner community the Prime Minister’s $2.3 billion funding commitment to improve the Ipswich Motorway. This motorway is a major arterial road servicing the Brisbane area. I know that a large majority of the Bonner constituency have, at some point, suffered seemingly endless waits in traffic or experienced a near miss while travelling on the motorway. This is unacceptable, and I commend the Prime Minister for committing such a significant sum of funding to improve the motorway and relieve this road of up to 80,000 cars. Most importantly, I believe that this project will ultimately prove beneficial to Bonner’s southside community who, for too long, have had to battle the constant stream of trucks and heavy vehicles on their suburban roads during both night and day. In the meantime, the government’s extension of the toll-free trial on the Logan Motorway is continuing to provide an incentive for these heavy vehicles to move away from our local suburban streets and onto the motorway. Parramatta Electorate: Lynwood Park Public School Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.42 am)-Last week I had the pleasure of attending a very special event in my electorate: the opening of the parliament of the Lynwood Park Public School. I was privileged to hear policy speeches by each of the ministers and to stay for question time which followed. Like members of this House, members of Lynwood Park parliament are elected. Once prefects and school captains are selected, they are formed into two parties-in this case, the Lynwood Park Party and the Advance Always Party. Potential prime ministers and ministers are selected from each party. Then there is an election-with policies, campaign slogans, budgets, posters and speeches. The election is conducted on the day under the supervision of a representative of the Australian Electoral Commission. All of the children vote. The winning party forms government, and the other party the opposition. The school captains become speakers and the other students in years 5 and 6 become the backbench. This is not a show parliament. The students at Lynwood Park Public School have real power and input through their parliament, and they use it well. Policy speeches are about real, important school business-standards of education, access to sport and recreational activities and behaviour in the playgrounds. The private members business that I attended, conducted on the day, approved three projects: the reintroduction of structured playtime in the lunch hour, the selection of Bandaged Bear as the parliament’s charity for 2007, and a proposed event, with proceeds going into treasury funds. For each of these three projects, committees of parliament were formed to develop the details and participate in the negotiation of the projects through the senate, which is made up of teachers, before the project returns to the house and is finally signed off by the governor-general, the principal. MAIN COMMITTEE Lynwood Park Public School is a very special school. It has a zero per cent suspension rate-that is, no suspensions. In part, that probably has something to do with the fact that the children are actively involved in finding ways to improve behaviour. In fact, it was the Lynwood Park parliament that came up with the idea of putting student mediators in the playground, along with teachers, to assist in finding solutions before trouble grew. I thought it was appropriate to offer, in this House, my sincere congratulations to the newest members of the Lynwood Park Public School parliament 2007: congratulations to speakers Nicole Ainsworth and Zachary Winslade; Prime Minister Brooke Mancey; Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Nicole Bassani; Minister for Communications Samin Kazi; Minister for Health, Safety and Environment Kayla Frary; Minister for Sport and Recreation Jamie Teleiai; and Minister for Education Shane De Salis. I also congratulate Leader of the Opposition Alec Hobbs; Deputy Opposition Leader and Treasurer Chhavi Malhotra; shadow minister for communications Alana Henley; shadow minister for health, safety and environment Jacob Bradley; shadow minister for sport and recreation Lachlan Sugg-Owen; shadow minister for education Britney Edwards; Serjeant-at-Arms Elle Mustapha; and Hansard reporters Alison Go Smith and Lucas Crouse. May they learn and grow through their term in office and may they serve their constituents well. Mr Jim Kirkbride death of James Kirkbride-or Jim, as he was known to his family and friends. While his name may not be familiar in this place, Jim Kirkbride will be forever part of Australia’s history. He was part of that very special generation of Australians, because Jim was a Rat of Tobruk. With his passing, Australia has lost another living connection with our military history in which Jim played a significant role. I have great respect for all our veterans and Jim was no exception. I was fortunate to have known Jim personally for many years. He was a man very proud of his family and a man of integrity who was highly respected within his community, and yet he was very unassuming about his service to Australia. It is this trait that is all too common in our dedicated servicemen and women, whereby they believe they have done nothing special. All our defence personnel through history step forward to serve our country with an overwhelming sense of pride, honour and duty. Jim was no different. To Jim, it was a badge of honour to be part of this duty and to show loyalty to the country in which he lived. While World WarI is said to have started the process of shaping our national identity, World War II further cemented Australia’s unique character in our history books. Courage, determination, selfless sacrifice and mateship were the traits which were ever so evident among the soldiers at the Battle of Tobruk. The Tobruk legacy, which Jim was part of, will remain in our history books as one of Australia’s great military victories. Just as the tactical withdrawal from Gallipoli was a major victory for Australia, so too was the defeat of the Germans at the siege of Tobruk. During the eight long months of the siege, the messages home to loved ones were that they would not survive. Defeat was not an option and, true to the spirit of the ANZACs, Jim and his fellow Rats of Tobruk defied the odds. In closing, I take this opportunity to extend my sympathies to Jim’s widow, Eileen, and his children and grandchildren. Although his family are mourning the loss of a husband, a father and a grandfather, they should be comforted in the knowledge that his legacy will forever be MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Statements By Members
169,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (9.45 Am),"I rise to place on the Hansard record theetched in the hearts and minds of all Australians. Tomorrow in Roma, the town in which he spent his life, a service to honour his life will be held at St Paul’s Anglican Church. Unfortunately, I cannot join the congregation, but I will be there in prayer and thought as our town and his family farewell a great Australian and acknowledge the passing of that great person, Jim Kirkbride, a Rat of Tobruk. Water served in, and I can concur with the member for Maranoa’s comments. Money talks, even louder than state premiers, and these words led the Sydney Morning Herald’s editorial on the Prime Minister’s $10 billion national water plan on 26 February this year. The editorial went on to further point out that the states have made a real mess of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is particularly true of the last 30 years. It has been ineffective because each state could exercise a veto power. The national interest was the first casualty. The problem with the Murray-Darling river system is easily identified: too much water given to irrigators. The solution is also easily identified: buy back the licences and stop the overallocation-but doing it is much harder. The Commonwealth’s plan to buy back licences from irrigators to reduce demand, increase water use efficiency and cut water by improving the infrastructure of irrigation is not a perfect plan. However, it does represent a turning point in environmental and constitutional politics, as was pointed out by Paul Kelly in the Australian on 28 February. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma, whose government could not afford to buy back the licences and the overallocation of water his state has allowed, realised immediately that his state had to agree to the proposal. South Australia, Queensland and the ACT arrived at the same view, albeit with some grandstanding. However, to the credit of the leaders of these states, some sensible concessions were gained from the Commonwealth without compromising the national management of the rivers. A panel of five experts, to be appointed for their expertise rather than on state loyalty, is a sensible move, and Mike Rann of South Australia should be congratulated for putting that idea forward and having it accepted. Mr Bracks and Victoria have not come on board; however, despite all the huff and puff, they will. The national plan is only at a raw beginning stage. A mass of details has to be resolved before the plan can become a reality. This is a real chance for cooperation and national interest to be front and centre instead of petty state jealousies and a blame game with the Commonwealth. Canberra’s money is most welcome; however, it will take a tremendous amount of goodwill for the plan to be a success. But a success it must be for the sake of all Australians. Whilst on the issue of water, it is disappointing that other aspects of the water debate are so intellectually shallow. I refer of course to the up to $1 billion desalination plants being planned and built in New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia and to the building of weirs near the mouths of rivers, while ignoring stormwater conservation and the recycling of water. This will prove particularly disappointing if the Cheltenham racecoursethe last significant open space in Adelaide-is sold for a housing and retail development and to secure a car-racing track and grandstand infrastructure at Victoria Park.

170,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (9.48 Am),"The 2nd/48th was a unit my uncle RalphNational Community Crime Prevention Program and order, and on the achievements of a remarkable Territorian in this field. While the Howard government’s National Community Crime Prevention Program has committed $64 million to remote communities’ safety, local crime prevention starts with the community and its citizens. If all levels of government work together, we can make a community safer. We can make a difference. One Territorian who has made a difference is Bill Somerville, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Offenders Aid and Rehabilitation Services (NT) Inc., better known as OARS NT. In March, I was pleased to announce funding of $490,000 to OARS under the National Community Crime Prevention Program for a project to reduce the number of exinmates who reoffend. Current statistics show that the vast majority of prisoners will commit crimes soon after their release. OARS have demonstrated that they can dramatically reduce the number of reoffenders, and the expansion of this service can only benefit our community. At a state and territory level, this issue is inevitably political. In any given election year it becomes a ritual which gets down to this: who is the toughest on crime, who will put more cops on the streets, who will increase sentences or who will build more jails. But it is also a national issue and it poses the question: can governments reduce crime by taking a new approach to repeat offenders? Bill Somerville’s model proves they can. He has found a relatively cheap and cost-effective way to stop prisoners from reoffending. He claims an 80 per cent success rate. The crucial factor is that OARS can provide support and stability to released prisoners by helping them to find accommodation and work and by developing their living skills. Their post-release programs are designed to integrate prisoners back into the community and to confront the uncertainties of freedom, dealing with remote bureaucracies, wary employers and the temptation of drugs, old mates and easy money. ABC’s Four Corners recently focused attention on this issue in a program called ‘Road to Return’. To summarise, billions of dollars are fed into a nationwide prison system that has seen the captive population nearly double in a decade, yet in most states only one per cent or even less of corrections budgets is spent on post-release programs for integrating prisoners back into the community. Projects, like OARS, which adopt a grassroots approach to dealing with crime prevention will make a real difference to local residents. The project provides intensive one-on-one preand post-release assistance to offenders and those at risk of becoming offenders. The assistance is provided by qualified counsellors and is focused on the high-risk period of three to six months after release. These are the types of practical on-the-ground projects that the Howard government is funding. They will make a real difference in tackling crime and will make the public feel safer. I take my hat off to Bill Somerville and OARS. (Time expired) Banks Electorate: Veterans erans’ Affairs a matter raised with me by my constituents Mr Garry Lilley and Ms Maha Aziz.

Having no response to that, he dispatched a second email 10 days later. Having no response again, Mr Lilley then phoned the department to be advised that tenders had closed the previous day. Mr Lilley was advised during the phone call that he would not be eligible to apply for a contract for another four years on the expiry of the current contract period. A phone call from the department a few days later provided updated advice. As a result of a meeting with the Optometrists Association of Australia, through which other optometrists advised of similar problems, it was agreed that new tender forms would be placed on a website. Ms Aziz was advised at this point that there could be no guarantee that there would be continuity of the contract. Acceptance of these subsequent tender applications cannot be guaranteed because they will be considered last. Mr Lilley and Ms Aziz are very concerned about this situation and I share their concern. Their business has provided a vital service to veterans in my electorate for over 23 years. I believe they provide the service not just to make money but rather to assist the community. I am advised that prices are set by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and are the same for all suppliers of optical goods. The profit margins are extremely low and the focus is on the provision of a service to the veteran community. I would like to quote directly from their letter to me, which I believe indicates better than anything I might say what their motivation is: We are very concerned about the impact this will have on the veteran community we have been serving and supplying spectacles to for the past 23 years. All our veteran patients are elderly and now having to travel to other suburbs will cause them a great deal of distress. We still have a contract with DVA to supply eye examinations to veterans ... but from May 2007 we will no longer be able to supply our veteran patients with spectacles and we will have to issue them with their prescription and ask them to find another supplier. Since we are the only optical supplier in our suburb it will cause our elderly patients much distress to have to travel elsewhere to order spectacles, travel again for the collection of the spectacles and travel again when needing repairs or spare parts to spectacles, as this is also covered by the contract. A chain of difficult circumstances has caused this situation to arise and we are regretful that we will be disappointing and causing difficulties to so many of our elderly patients. Mr Lilley and Ms Aziz are most concerned by the potential impact this situation will have on the veterans in my electorate. I take this opportunity to raise the matter with the minister and request that he take into account the matters I have raised in considering his formal response. Water minder to us to consider water. Water is a critical issue on the Central Coast. It is not a federal obligation to provide water. Water is supposedly delivered by local governments and also state governments. State Labor have failed the people of the Central Coast, hence my involvement. The last move that state Labor made to do something about water on the Central Coast was when they tried to have Sydney Water take over the Central Coast-Wyong Water Authority.

Nothing of a major infrastructure project has been created. Yet new home buyers are being fleeced by up to 25 per cent of the purchase price of a house with various taxes, stamp duties on loans, mortgages and also contributions to local requirements. During this last election campaign, the state Labor government wanted to build Tillegra dam on the Hunter. Premier Iemma reckoned that he knew the situation was desperate on the Central Coast. We are down to 13 per cent in our water supply. Tillegra dam-even if it does happen-will do nothing for 10 or 15 years. They do not even own the land on which to put the dam and now a group up in the Hunter have made note of the fact that where they want to put the dam is on a fault line-the same fault line that caused earthquakes in Newcastle some years ago. So that really is another con. What will happen? Hunter Water provides millions of dollars to the state government in revenues from water. They want the Central Coast to be indebted to Hunter forever and a day by stitching us up for probably an extra 90c a kilolitre over and above what we can provide water for in our local area. The Central Coast Water Authority has introduced a plan called Water 2050. This is a follow-up to a plan that was introduced in 1975 by the public works department. It outlines the solutions for water issues on the Central Coast. To complete that plan we need approval from the state government; they have taken over planning. They need to immediately give authority for the local water utility to put in this link between Mangrove and Mardi Dam, and they need to increase the water sharing that can be taken off the Wyong River, because the catchment area puts water into Mardi. That is what we need. Water tanks are not a real solution. We need to look at grey water recycling because you can use that every day of the week.

Second Reading am)-I present the explanatory memorandum to the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 amends the Nuclear NonProliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, which is subsequently to be known as the safeguards act; the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, the CTBT act; and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the CW(P) Act, which all implement a range of Australian policies and treaty commitments promoting the non-proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons. In particular, this bill enables Australia to demonstrate its commitment to strong international measures for the physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities. These measures are essential to counter the heightened risk of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The bill is the main element of legislative steps that will allow Australia to ratify a 2005 amendment to MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Statements By Members

That amendment requires states parties to establish robust and comprehensive security regimes for nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. Several new offences are created by the bill, including an offence for conduct against a nuclear facility which causes, or is likely to cause, death or serious injury, or substantial damage to property or to the environment by exposure to radiation or release of radioactive substances. In addition, a new offence of trafficking in nuclear materials is introduced. The bill also improves the application of Australia’s existing non-proliferation arrangements. It extends the geographical jurisdiction for offences related to the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons by an Australian citizen or resident anywhere. It also updates penalties for the most serious offences so that these provide a significant deterrent to the commission of such offences, and are consistent with penalties under comparable Commonwealth non-proliferation legislation. Further, the bill introduces a requirement for a permit to be obtained under the safeguards act where a nuclear or related facility is to be decommissioned. This seeks to ensure that non-proliferation safeguards measures can be effectively applied in the course of decommissioning. It underscores Australia’s ability to apply the principle that planned nuclear activities are fully transparent to the International Atomic Energy Agency. To ensure that Australia’s domestic arrangements are robust, the bill allows that most provisions implementing the amendment to the physical protection convention can come into effect in Australia ahead of the entry into force of the amended convention. I thank members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other arms within the Australian government for their contribution to the development of this bill, and I commend the bill to the chamber. Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I commend members to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and also to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, which has prepared a succinct summary of the provisions of the bill. As that report notes, the bill primarily amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, which gives legislative effect to Australia’s non-proliferation obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and also under the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. As the parliamentary secretary indicated, the bill is intended to meet the new requirements of the July 2005 amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material-the physical protection convention-as described by the parliamentary secretary. The bill is also intended to deal with the decommissioning of a nuclear facility, namely, the facility at Lucas Heights in Sydney. I note the speaker’s list contains my friend the member for Hughes, who will no doubt have an interest in that aspect of the bill, given that that facility is in her electorate.

As the minister indicated, the bill contains three new offences relating to the decommissioning of a nuclear facility. That is of interest to me because my electorate of Barton is the neighbouring electorate to the seat of Hughes. Proposed new section 16B will be included in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act to allow the minister to grant a written permit to allow the decommissioning of the whole or part of a nuclear facility, which includes the Lucas Heights facility as defined in the legislation. That proposed new section requires that the permit to decommission a facility be approved by the Director of Safeguards. The director must also be satisfied that appropriate safeguards could be applied and that adequate physical security could be provided for nuclear material during the decommissioning. The bill also inserts proposed new section 29A, which makes it an offence for a person to decommission the whole or part of a facility without holding such a permit. Obviously those provisions are desirable-indeed, essential-for the safe decommissioning of the Lucas Heights facility. I note that the facility is almost exactly my age. I think it was originally commissioned on the day I was born, or thereabouts. It has gone, but hopefully I will be here for a little longer.

The bill also increases various imprisonment penalties for offences committed under the act. The bill also extends the geographical scope of jurisdiction for various offences, which will mean that Australian citizens residing overseas will be imprisoned if found guilty of these offences. It is noted that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade strongly supports Australia’s continued engagement in multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. Indeed, the parliamentary secretary said that this bill is obviously intended not only to introduce necessary provisions but also to demonstrate Australia’s strong commitment to the non-proliferation regime. I will place on the record reasonably briefly those areas in which Australia has played a significant role and those in which we believe it could still play such a role. Of course, non-proliferation has become a crucial issue as a result of the nuclear test in North Korea and the controversy in respect of Iran and its apparent intention to develop a nuclear weapons capability. It was controversy relating to the French nuclear tests in the 1980s that we can recall that motivated the then foreign minister, Gareth Evans, to drive what has become the Canberra commission. He proposed drawing together a panel of military, scientific and administrative experts from around the world who had world-renowned reputations for their expertise. That Canberra commission, as it became known, was given secretarial support by both DFAT and the Australian Department of Defence. Its brief was to come up with practical measures in relation to non-proliferation, the French nuclear tests being seen not only in the context of the MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Statements By Members

180,Mr Mcclelland,"The effect of the amendment will be to strengthen measures relattests but in the whole context of potential proliferation of nuclear weapons and the testing, obviously, by countries as part of that process. The topics of the Canberra commission included horizontal proliferation-that is, more countries becoming nuclear capable. It included, perhaps with some foresight, the risk of nuclear terrorism. I note that Einstein wrote to the United States President in World War II cautioning him regarding the possibility of a nuclear device being planted in the hold of a ship coming into one of the significant harbours. Even then, intelligent analysis suggested the risk of a nuclear terrorist event. The Canberra commission also realised that it was necessary to address the issue of potential delivery of nuclear weapons and, therefore, focused on the elimination of ballistic missiles as a form of delivery. Those who read the 2000 non-proliferation treaty will see a remarkable similarity between the wording of that treaty and the recommendations of the Canberra commission. It was intended that Prime Minister Keating, as he then was, would launch the Canberra commission report on the floor of the General Assembly of the United Nations but there was a change of government. The government subsequently presented the report. But it was noted by the then Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs and former Canberra commission panel member, Mr Jayantha Dhanapala: The Canberra commission report received lukewarm support from the government that inherited it after Keating’s party suffered an election defeat and did not do more than absolutely necessary. Indeed, the agenda of the Canberra commission was followed up by a number of countries coming together in June 1998 to form a coalition known as the New Agenda Coalition. They published a document called Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda. It was also part of their legacy that resulted in the striking of the agreement to create and enter into the 2000 non-proliferation treaty to extend the original treaty indefinitely. So we can see that Australia did play a very significant part. I should add that the new government did not form part of the New Agenda Coalition, if you like taking a backseat role, although they did vote for the motion in December 1998 as a result of recommendations of that New Agenda Coalition. Jayantha Dhanapala has proposed that the model of the Canberra commission, driven by Australia, provide a template for the world and the international community to consider in dealing with the issue of weapons of mass destruction. He proposed the establishment of a new commission based on the Canberra commission format, essentially bringing together people of world renown to consider practical measures to address the issues of weapons of mass destruction. He said that must include nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and that the mandate of the new commission must extend to both non-proliferation and disarmament of those weapons of mass destruction that already exist. We should not ignore the fact that, while we all have tremendous fear of these weapons of mass destruction, of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons coming into the hands of terrorist organisations, we should not ignore the reality that many countries in the worldregrettably, many legitimate nation states-have weapons in each of those categories. So it is not simply an issue of non-proliferation-that is, stopping other countries or organisations from acquiring those weapons of mass destruction; it is also very much necessary for the international community to focus upon disarmament of those countries that continue to possess and, regrettably, develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. MAIN COMMITTEE Dhanapala said that obviously the mandate would also need to very specifically cover and come up with practical measures to address and prevent the possible use of those weapons by terrorists. It is significant that just this month the Leader of the Opposition committed a future Labor government to driving a new Canberra commission type agenda to look at those weapons of mass destruction and to come up with practical measures in respect of both non-proliferation-that is, the spreading of those organisations and countries that possess and develop those weapons-and, significantly, the need for countries to disarm themselves of those weapons of mass destruction. The Leader of the Opposition also indicated that a future Labor government would be seeking international agreement for a fissile material cut-off treaty to end the production of both highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons-and that is obviously particularly relevant to the events that we are seeing in Iran. Such a treaty would apply directly to a country’s capacity to develop or enrich uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons, and he is very strongly committed to that agenda. Given Australia’s history in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, I think we could play a very constructive role indeed. In conclusion, I note that the minister indicated-and sincerely indicated, I believe-the government’s intention to introduce these amendments not only for its own sake to strengthen the control of nuclear material and to impose penalties and greater protections and safeguards against the measures coming into the hands of terrorists or criminals but also to demonstrate Australia’s strong commitment to non-proliferation. In that context, I note that in the near future the government will be confronted with a decision as to whether or not it agrees to sell uranium to India. India, of course, is friendly with Australia. We have significant relations in a number of areas-economically, militarily and culturally-and of course in sport. But the reality is that India hasthat, India is still not a party to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The reality is that they should be. It is in their interests that they are. One can imagine what would happen should an Islamic fundamentalist movement gain control of the government in Pakistan. The fear and risk to the international community would be so much more profound in India. One can understand their anxiety, but the reality is that no-one wins a nuclear conflict. One would think it would be in India’s interests to promote more rigorously than any other country the non-proliferation agenda. Rather than agreeing to sell uranium to India, in circumstances where they are not a party to the non-proliferation regime, the government should be putting pressure on India to become part of that regime if they want to utilise Australian uranium. With those words, I conclude my contribution by indicating our support for these measures. 2006 will be welcomed by the people of Australia, and most especially by the people in my electorate of Hughes, in which is located Australia’s only nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights. The bill implements Australia’s commitment to strengthened international measures for the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. Further, it provides for machinery changes to improve the application of existing non-proliferation arrangements.

It makes penalties for the most serious offences consistent with penalties under comparable Commonwealth non-proliferation legislation and provides a significant deterrent to the commission of such offences. tre of Australian nuclear expertise. It is the second largest corporate employer in my electorate. It employs around 900 local residents and provides income for several hundred local tradespeople and industry suppliers. As a matter of fact, ANSTO contributes over $70 million to my local electorate economy. government, industry, academia and other research organisations. ANSTO’s nuclear infrastructure includes the research reactor OPAL, which has taken over from HIFAR. It has particle accelerators, radiopharmaceutical production facilities and a range of other unique research facilities. OPAL will be Australia’s only nuclear reactor. It will be used to produce radioactive products for use in medicine and industry and as a source of neutron beams for scientific research and to irradiate silicon for semiconductor applications. The OPAL-which stands for Open Pool Australian Light-water-reactor is due to be officially opened on the same site as HIFAR at Lucas Heights in my electorate in April this year. The new OPAL reactor is of profound significance for those at the leading edge of science and research. The new reactor will be a world-class neutron source, capable of supporting up to 17 neutron beam instruments. The scope of research that these instruments will allow is tremendous, from research on advanced materials through to molecular biology, using technologies that were unknown at the time that the old HIFAR was opened by Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies on 18 April 1958. As well as opening up new areas of research, ANSTO is well known as the principal producer and supplier of radioisotopes for medical diagnoses, treatment and pain relief in Australia. Last year approximately 550,000 patient treatments were transported from ANSTO to hospitals around Australia and, increasingly, in South-East Asia. Nuclear medicines are chiefly used for diagnoses, but increasingly also to treat disease and for pain relief. For example, bone scans can detect the spread of cancers six to 18 months sooner than X-rays. ANSTO also continually conducts new research aimed at developing new radiation treatments for different types of cancer and other medical conditions. With additional capacity, ANSTO will also be able to expand its support of the Australian manufacturing, minerals and agricultural industries. The estimated gross benefit of support to the minerals industry alone currently exceeds $100 million annually. The replacement reactor will give us significantly more. This modern, high-tech research facility will attract eminent foreign scientists to work in Australia and provide Australian scientists with greater reciprocal access to complementary first-class research facilities around the world. Indeed, the return to Australia from the new research reactor will be significant in attracting to Australia the greatest scientific minds of our age. To put this into perspective in terms of general everyday use, radioactivity from ANSTO includes applications in the automobile industry, which uses radioactive materials to test the quality of steel in cars. Aircraft manufacturers use radiation to check for flaws in jet engines. MAIN COMMITTEE Mining and petroleum companies use radionuclides to locate and quantify mineral deposits. Manufacturers use radioactive materials to obtain the proper thickness of tin and aluminium. Pipeline companies use radioactive materials to look for defects in welds. Oil, gas and mining companies use radioactive materials to map geological contours, using test wells and mine bores, and to determine the presence of hydrocarbons. By showing how plants absorb fertiliser, radioactive materials help researchers learn when fertiliser should be applied and how much is needed. This helps prevent the overuse of fertilisers, a major source of soil and water pollution. Radiation sterilisation techniques are used to control insect pests such as fruit flyvery important to Australian industry. The smoke detectors in our houses and offices rely on a tiny radioactive source to sound the alarm when it senses smoke from a fire. The irradiation of silicon for the semiconductor industry is a significant business for ANSTO. Non-stick pans are treated with radiation to ensure that the coating will stick to the surface. Photocopiers use small amounts of radiation to eliminate static and prevent paper from sticking together and jamming the machine. Cosmetics, hair products and contact lens solutions are sterilised with radiation to remove irritants and allergens. Radioactive materials are also used to sterilise medical bandages and a variety of personal health and hygiene products. The use of radioactive materials, nuclides and isotopes are so varied and extensive within our community that I think many of us do not realise the applications in our everyday use. I also want to take this opportunity to remind the constituents of my electorate of the existence of ARPANSA. ARPANSA is the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Depending on your point of view, I will either accept the blame or the credit for its existence. When the Prime Minister informed me many years ago that we would receive in my electorate a new reactor, which is now called OPAL, I asked the Prime Minister if we could have an independent oversight agency. I want to acknowledge the work that was done towards establishing this agency by a previous minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, and a previous member for Adelaide in her role as parliamentary secretary. It took a tremendous amount of work to establish this agency which has a vital role in establishing world’s best practice and overseeing the fact that such is continued on at ANSTO by the professionals that are there. The agency is headed up by Dr John Loy, who is highly regarded, and his team of scientific researchers. My constituents can take great faith and comfort in the fact that this is an independent body, an independent oversight agency of very high expertise. I am grateful to the government for having made sure that this came into existence. To return to the bill, Australia has international obligations to safeguard nuclear material under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The convention sets standards for the international transport of nuclear material used for peaceful purposes. It defines serious offences involving nuclear materials which parties to the convention must make punishable. These include ‘the receipt, possession, use, transfer, alteration, disposal or dispersal of nuclear material’ without lawful authority and a threat ‘to use nuclear material to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial property damage’. The convention also specifies certain levels of physical protection needed during international transport of nuclear material. This requires Australia and the other signatories to the convention to ‘take appropriate steps within the framework of its national law and consistent with international law’. The convention was opened for signature in 1980 and entered into force on 8 February 1987. Notably, the original document did not address the protection of MAIN COMMITTEE nuclear facilities and deals only in a limited way with the domestic use, storage and transportation of nuclear material. On8 July 2005, delegates from 89 countries agreed on changes to strengthen the physical protection convention. The amended convention makes it legally binding for states to protect nuclear facilities and material in peaceful domestic use, storage and transport. The amendments strengthen requirements for the protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities against criminal or terrorist attack. There were four main amendments to the convention: (1) a new article 2A established a series of fundamental principles to be applied to protect nuclear material against theft and sabotage and to rapidly recover any missing or stolen nuclear material; (2) an amendment to article 5 to strengthen cooperation among states in the event of actual or threatened theft of nuclear material or sabotage; (3) the creation of new offences under article 7 of the convention relating to the trafficking of nuclear material and the sabotage of nuclear facilities with the intent to cause death, injury or damage by exposure to radiation; (4) new articles 11A and 11B dealing with extradition and mutual legal assistance in relation to offences under article 7 of the convention that stipulate states cannot refuse to extradite or provide mutual legal assistance for an offence under article 7 on the sole ground that it is a political offence under domestic law. In a statement to the convention, the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office supported the proposed amendments. It stated: The Australian Government is committed to addressing international concerns about nuclear terrorism, smuggling and sabotage, and to protecting people and the environment from any impacts associated with such activities. The amended Physical Protection Convention aims to address these issues more comprehensively than the existing convention. Australia has played a leading role in developing these changes, and to encourage universal adherence should be among the first to ratify and implement them. The provisions of the bill are to implement Australia’s commitment to these international measures which increase the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. In particular, the bill is intended to meet the new requirements of the July 2005 amendments to the physical protection convention. The amended convention makes it legally binding for states to protect nuclear facilities and material in peaceful domestic use, storage and transport. To this end, the bill makes amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the Extradition Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Most of the bill’s amendments are made to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. This act gives legislative effect to Australia’s international nuclear non-proliferation obligations, establishes a system of permits for the possession and transportation of nuclear material, and provides a legislative basis for the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office. The bill inserts a new section 13(3)(d)(da) into this act stating that a permit to possess nuclear material may be granted provided ‘measures are taken that are consistent with Australia’s obligations under the physical protection convention’. The bill also amends this act to: introduce new offences and increase penalties for various offences under part III of the act; MAIN COMMITTEE extend the geographical scope of jurisdiction for various offences under part III; and require a permit to decommission a facility. The bill also introduces three new offences and imprisonment penalties under the safeguards act. Under new section 29A, a person found guilty of decommissioning a facility without a permit faces an imprisonment penalty of five years. Under new section 34A, a person commits an offence if he or she carries, sends, or moves nuclear material into or out of Australia or a foreign country. A person found guilty of this offence faces an imprisonment penalty of 10 years. Under new section 35A, a person found guilty of interfering with the operation of a nuclear facility-and who does so intending or knowing that the act will cause injury or damage to property-faces an imprisonment penalty of 20 years. The bill also strengthens the maximum term of various imprisonment offences under part III of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. It contains five provisions to lengthen imprisonment penalties under the act. Under proposed section 23(1), the maximum imprisonment term for a person found guilty of possessing nuclear material without a permit will be lengthened from not more than five years to not more than 10 years. Under proposed section 26(1), the maximum imprisonment term for a person found guilty of communicating information about nuclear technology as defined in section 4(1) of the act will be lengthened from not more than two years to not more than 10 years. Under proposed section 26A(1), the imprisonment penalty for a person found guilty of communicating information that compromises the security of nuclear material will be lengthened from two years to eight years. Under proposed section 31(1), the maximum imprisonment term for a person found guilty of obstructing or hindering an agency inspector in the performance of a duty under the act will be lengthened from not more than six months to not more than two years. Under section 35, the maximum imprisonment term for a person found guilty of using nuclear material to cause serious damage to any person or substantial damage to property will be lengthened from 10 years to 20 years. I have taken time to explain those increased penalties for the benefit of the constituents of my electorate of Hughes. The bill inserts a new section 16B into the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to allow the minister to grant a written permit to decommission the whole or part of a nuclear facility. Under this section the bill requires that the permit to decommission a facility must be approved by the director of safeguards as per subsection 12(2) of the act. The director must also be satisfied that appropriate safeguards could be applied during the decommissioning and that adequate physical security could be applied to nuclear material during the commissioning. The bill also inserts a new section 29A which makes it an offence for a person to decommission the whole or part of a facility without holding a permit. In conclusion, the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 is a strong response to Australia’s new obligations under the amended physical protection convention. It reflects the active role that Australia took in negotiating the amendments to the convention. The system of permits and the list of offences under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 already includes elements of some of the new offences required by the amendments. The bill responds further to the amendments by increasing the prison penalties and extending the geographical scope of jurisdiction for offences under the safeguards act. It also contains three new offences relating to the decommissioning of a nuclear facility without a permit, trafficking nuclear material and interfering with the operation of a nuclear facility-all very imporMAIN COMMITTEE tant amendments and aspects for the people of Australia but of particular interest to the people of my electorate. I commend this bill to the House. Hughes speaking on the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I know that she has a pretty good understanding of the nuclear industry and the nuclear fuel cycle, which, of course, is very relevant to her electorate. I know that, like most members of this place, she understands the significant contribution that nuclear technology plays towards health in this country in treating a number of deadly diseases in that area commonly coming under the banner of cancer. I appreciate her contribution to the debate. I am of 1962 vintage, so I am just old enough to remember the Cold War. I think it is true to say that those of us who remember the Cold War take a slightly different attitude to nuclear weapons capability than those younger than me who did not live through that period. It was a period which, I suppose you could say, formally came to an end with the eventual fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Those of us who lived through that era grew up with American television and films: James Bond, Get Smart and programs and movies such as these which highlighted the very strong tussle between the West and the East. I think most of us remember the concept, if not first hand then through television, of people having bunkers in their backyards to protect them from a possible nuclear attack of some sort. No doubt that is the reason why, in this country, we have such strong opposition to the use of nuclear energy for civil and peaceful purposes. Too many of us are scarred with the fear that we grew up with when we were younger. We all remember the fear, and I suspect many remember the Cuban missile stand-off with President Kennedy. We really were living under the fear of nuclear attack when I was growing up. I suspect that people significantly younger than me are relatively complacent about the use of nuclear weapons, not having grown up with the fear of them and not having the threat of nuclear attack thrust upon them almost on a daily basis by television programs and movies. That may seem light-hearted, but it is very true. I fear that it is a complacency that is misplaced. The world remains one in which nuclear attack is not likely-certainly not as likely as it may have been in the three or four decades following the Second World War-but where it is a possibility. We have seen that in recent times with the stresses and strains in the Middle East in particular. North Korea, with an apparent nuclear capacity sitting not all that far away from our own continent, possibly has a capability for that nuclear capacity to reach our own shores. We have enormous instability with the emergence of non-state groups and rogue states, so this is not a world with a very good balance. We see the legitimate concerns of the Israelis about the ongoing refusal of the Iranians to comply with their obligations to the international community, to reassure them that their interest in nuclear does not go beyond energy and peaceful, civil purposes. As the member for Barton indicated, Labor supports the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. It is a bill that strengthens Australia’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and all of the issues that go with safeguarding us against the misuse of nuclear facilities and tools. What it does not do, and what it and any Australian government cannot do, is strengthen the foundations of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty itself. Only the international community, acting in concert, can do that. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is a treaty under much stress and strain. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Statements By Members
184,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.38 Am),"I am not surprised to hear the member forMy colleague the member for Melbourne Ports showed me some interesting research that he has done on new revelations about the Russian attitude to the Iranians. I know that he is going to say something about that, and I am delighted by that news. I will let him expand on that. The problem for the international community is the nuclear non-proliferation treaty itself. It is a document which is now decades old, and many of the foundations on which it stands have been undermined and changed by the new paradigm in which we all live: the emergence of terror, rogue states and non-state groups. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is of course premised on the basis of state groups, not non-state groups. IfI am wrong about that, I would be more than happy to hear some counterarguments, but that is certainly my interpretation and assessment of the treaty as it stands. Of course, that treaty amongst other things does recognise five original nuclear states-the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. One of the problems of that proposition is that of course we now have other democracies. Those five states also happen to be-not just by coincidence-the five members of the UN Security Council. But we now have other democratic states that also have nuclear capacity. Take India, for example-one reference made by the member for Barton-which still stands outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty simply because it cannot enter into the treaty without giving up its nuclear capacity. I am at one with the member for Barton: India should sign up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and we should be very reluctant to be engaging ourselves in her nuclear fuel cycle without that commitment. Having said that, you can understand why a democracy like India is not prepared to forgo its nuclear capacity-with the neighbouring state of Pakistan with similar capacity. It is like asking them to take their gloves off but allowing their neighbour to leave them on. While we do not have any sympathy with that view, I do acknowledge and recognise, as I am sure we all do, that this is a problem for the international community. How do we get the Indias of the world to agree? India is an emerging superpower and therefore probably sees itself, particularly given that it is a democracy, as a country that is legitimately entitled to have the same capacity as the Chinas of the world, for example, which are not democracies. This is a big challenge for the international community. That is the first problem with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which was first established in 1968. It is a very old document. The second problem, under the second pillar of the treaty, is that we have this determination to ensure that the five original nuclear weapon states disarm themselves or at least significantly reduce their armaments, their nuclear capacity. But it has not worked-it has worked to an extent, but those countries have, over the decades, found many and quite often legitimate reasons why that commitment is not always possible. The third pillar has many strengths. It is a commitment to ensuring that all nation states have a right to use uranium for civil and peaceful uses-in other words, for power generation. But in many senses the problems with the first and second pillars undermine the strength of the third, and that was the example given by the member for Barton. We have a situation in which India should be able to enforce its right to nuclear power generation but it cannot source the fuel it needs to do so because it is unable, it would say, to comply with the first pillar of the treaty. There is no point giving it the right to generate nuclear energy if it cannot MAIN COMMITTEE get the fuel to supply its nuclear energy generators, and it cannot get the fuel to supply its nuclear generators because it is not part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Of course, it would argue that it cannot be part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty because it is not possible for it, in strategic terms-it would argue, not my words-to forgo its nuclear capacity when it has a neighbouring state which is also not a part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and which can maintain its nuclear weapons. I have not done my research on Pakistan’s energy needs, requirements and strengths but, for example, Pakistan might not have any need for uranium for civil purposes and therefore does not face the same dilemma that India does. These are complex issues for the international community. I was very pleased to have visited the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna last year to look at the very good work they are doing. The IAEA not only work towards non-proliferation but also assist various states in assessing their future in nuclear energy. Firstly, the states look at whether or not nuclear energy is for them, and, for various reasons, it sometimes is not. They have great expertise in helping nation states work through this process. Secondly, if states draw the conclusion that it is for them, they advise on how to put the civil industry in place without the threat of getting it wrong and therefore raising concerns amongst other nation states about nuclear proliferation. They also assist with putting it in place in a way that ensures the safety of their domestic community. One of the strong messages I walked away with from the International Atomic Energy Agency is that it is underresourced-significantly so. One of the other issues that face the international community is finding the strength and the will to more sufficiently resource the agency to ensure it can continue to do its very good work-and, for all the reasons I have outlined, that work is getting more difficult and more challenging. Labor supports this bill, which amends our domestic laws to strengthen our commitment to our various international obligations. I know that some of them are a bit belated, but we are not going to be too critical of that. We welcome their introduction in this place. I will close by reinforcing what I said at the beginning. We are living in testing times. We have emerging change in the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region. The Middle East is as unstable as it has ever been. I note that the member for Melbourne Ports is agreeing with that point and I know that he knows the strategic situation in the Middle East better than I do because it has great significance to a large slice of his constituency. In Africa we have significant problems as well. The old Soviet Union is struggling under its new form of democracy-I am not suggesting it poses a threat to us, but it all adds to the stress and the strain of what is happening geopolitically across the region. Cyprus is still divided and, although it is not in the daily headlines, it is still causing significant geopolitical stresses. Enormous energy issues are emerging, and that brings me back to what we now know as Russia. They now control much of the energy supply to many energy-dependent nations, and they have already shown their preparedness to cut off that supply to suit their own strategic and economic ambitions or protections, or the mix of the two. Iraq, in my view, has been a disaster for this country-the worse foreign policy decision ever taken by us as a nation state. I was most disappointed by the Prime Minister’s response last night on the fourth anniversary of our intervention in Iraq. I thought he had to do one thing last night before any other: I am not going to say that he should have apologised, because he never does that, and I know he will not. I had no expectation whatsoever that we MAIN COMMITTEE would get an apology from the Prime Minister for his decision to take us to war in Iraq: first to get weapons of mass destruction-very relevant to this bill-which were eventually found not to exist; second to impose regime change-something he said did not in itself justify any intervention in any nation state; and now, supposedly to bed down the fledgling democracy which exists in the country. Of course, this is all despite the fact that his Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson, told us that victory is not possible in Iraq, nor is the imposition of a Western style democracy. On that basis, I am not sure why we are still there. However, I did expect the Prime Minister to attempt to take some responsibility for the mess in which we find ourselves in Iraq. There was no apology nor any acknowledgement that he got at least part of it wrong. He has never acknowledged that our approach to Iraq could have been handled differently. I thought I might have heard the Prime Minister succinctly argue the case that Australia is now a safer place as a result of our intervention in Iraq. He talked more broadly and globally about the world being a safer place. He would argue that, but I do not agree. However, he did not specifically focus on whether someone going to a football match in Melbourne or Sydney is now more or less vulnerable to a terrorist attack today than they were before our intervention in Iraq. The Australian people are entitled to hear the Prime Minister argue his case. His speech was simply a summary of his position on Iraq and the usual rhetoric about how, if we were to withdraw from Iraq, terrorism would suddenly proliferate and the world as we know it would come to an end. He did not argue that case very well; he simply concentrated on the politics and, of course, once again, on instilling fear in the Australian community. He sent the message that if the opposition’s view on Iraq were ever put into effect the world would somehow be a more dangerous place. It would have been fine for him to do that if he had produced the evidence, but he simply failed to prosecute that case. The Prime Minister tried to suggest that there is some inconsistency in the Labor Party’s approach to Iraq vis-a-vis Afghanistan. That is not true. Iraq has descended into a civil war and the connection to al-Qaeda is, at best, tenuous. Of course, that situation will not be fixed using the guns and bullets of international forces but by using diplomacy and with the will and strength of the Iraqis themselves. Resolution depends on the will and strength of the religious and ethnic groups to sort themselves out, and we need to put pressure on them to do so. The best way to do that is to let them know that we will not be around forever. Of course, Afghanistan is another situation, where you have a government fighting what is effectively an invasion by Taliban troops trained in Pakistan. It is an entirely different situation. It is a war in a country that is training members of al-Qaeda and associated groups; it is training the terrorists who are bombing Australians in places like Bali. That war can be won and must be won. That is the very simple difference between Iraq and Afghanistan, and the opposition maintains its position.

185,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.58 Am),"I am very pleased to speak on this very important legforeign minister in relation to Iraq. I did not hear him talking about how the Leader of the Opposition categorically supported the government when we went to war. He did not apologise to the 12 million Iraqis who went and voted at the ballot box. We in this country cherish our democracy, but somehow it is not appropriate for 12 million Iraqis to cast a vote. Ryan. Is the member seeking to ask a question? ernment has acted in poor faith. I absolutely reject the comments of the shadow foreign minister and his Labor colleague there in relation to the 12 million Iraqis that went to vote. Why is itreject that assertion. I sat in silence while the shadow foreign minister gave his speech. I sat in absolute silence and courtesy, and here we have his Labor colleague, who refuses to allowMr Danby interjecting Mr Fitzgibbon interjectingof order please. Member for Ryan, do not respond to interjections. the government has a position which the opposition fails to support, it is entirely appropriate for government members to defend the government’s position. The bottom line is that 12 million Iraqis went to vote at the elections, and you cannot have a situation where the opposition says to the government, ‘No, that’s not good enough.’ Twelve million Iraqis went to vote: that is absolutely good enough for this country. We can sit here and enjoy democracy, but why can’t other people? And that goes to the heart of what we are all about. Why this bill is important is that it is all about global security, it is all about global energy and these issues are tied together. It is, in fact, quite relevant that the shadow foreign minister spoke about Iraq and the Prime Minister’s presentation last night, because it goes to the status of the US in the world and to the credibility of the US’s position in world affairs. For the United States to be compelled to withdraw from Iraq in the current climate would send the absolute wrong message. I would suggest that those sitting opposite-who claim to have the exclusive monopoly on wisdom in foreign affairs and in international relations-do some basic 101 studies and bone up on foreign affairs, because they have absolutely no idea whatsoever.

196,Mr Johnson,"I am pleased to speak on this bill because it is an important bill. Whenbring about the democratic vote in a country in the Middle East where people want to have the sovereign right to determine their own future. And what is wrong with that? Just as the people of North Korea absolutely want to be able to determine their own future-what is wrong with that? It is a terrific position for us to enjoy in this part of the world. Why can’t we be part of a coalition to bring about freedom around the world? Why can’t we be part of that? I am just so disappointed. Of all members of the opposition, the member for Melbourne Ports in particular goes about trying to defend freedom for this part of the world but not for that part of the world-it is absolutely absurd. In relation to this important bill, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, was negotiated in the mid-1960s between the United States, the Soviet Union and the 18-nation committee on disarmament. We all know that the NPT came into force in 1970, and our country became a party to it in January 1973. There are some 189 states that have signed on to the treaty. It is an international agreement that we very strongly respect and that we are very strongly part of promoting. As part of our commitment to the treaty, Australia also signed a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1974. As a signatory to the treaty, Australia has an obligation-as do all member states, of course-not to transfer nuclear weapons and not to assist any non nuclear weapons state to manufacture or to acquire such weapons or devices. The treaty also outlines that, in the case of a non nuclear weapons state like Australia, there is a responsibility not to receive or manufacture nuclear weapons, and to apply International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities carried out within our borders. Australia also has international obligations to safeguard nuclear material under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The convention sets standards for the international transport of nuclear material used for peaceful purposes. It also defines serious offences involving nuclear materials, including the receipt, possession, use, transfer, alteration, disposal or dispersal of nuclear material without lawful authority or making a threat to use nuclear material to cause death or serious injury to any person, or substantial property damage. Australia’s obligation and that of other signatories to the convention is to make those offences enforceable in their domestic law. I will make a few comments on the current legislative framework for non-proliferation. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 gives legislative effect to Australia’s obligations under the NPT and the physical protection convention. The act primarily provides for a system of permits for the possession and transport of nuclear material, the establishment of a facility and the communication of information relating to nuclear technology. The act also enshrines a number of offences and their punishments in Australian law including those relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear material such as the possession of nuclear material without a permit, a breach of duty to ensure the security of nuclear technology, the communication of unauthorised information, establishing a nuclear facility without a permit and accessing without a permit areas which are restricted. Offences relating to the physical protection of nuclear material include stealing nuclear material, demanding nuclear material by threats, the use of nuclear material causing injury to persons or damage to property and threatening to use nuclear material. I turn to the specifics of the bill. I will not go into the changes to the physical protection convention, because they are quite numerous, but I will talk about the changes that this bill MAIN COMMITTEE makes to the amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to implement Australia’s international obligations as a country that is absolutely committed to the non-proliferation of nuclear material. This bill brings Australian law into line with our commitments as a party to the NPT, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s safeguards agreement and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The bill will also demonstrate Australia’s commitment to the physical security of nuclear facilities, material and information. Firstly, the bill will introduce three new offences under the safeguards act relating to decommissioning a nuclear facility without a permit, trafficking nuclear material and interfering with the operation of a nuclear facility. Secondly, it will make the penalties for the most serious offences in the safeguards act consistent with penalties under comparable Commonwealth non-proliferation legislation. Thirdly, it will extend the geographical jurisdiction for various non-proliferation offences in the safeguards act. The extended geographical jurisdiction allows for Australian citizens residing overseas to be imprisoned if found guilty of these very serious offences. Lastly, the bill will also regulate, with respect to nuclear safeguards, the decommissioning of a nuclear facility to ensure that Australia is able to meet its international obligations to the IAEA. I think a good way to stress the gravity and importance of this bill is to use the example of North Korea and South Korea. The Korean peninsula is one of the most sensitive geopolitical and security areas in our region. I had the very great privilege last year to be invited by the South Korean government to visit South Korea. I also had the very special opportunity to visit the demilitarised zone, which, as everyone would know, separates North and South Korea. It was a profound experience and one which will certainly live in my memory for a very long time. It did inspire me to take a far deeper interest in the issues of the Korean peninsula and in the relationship between the north and the south in particular. As members who follow foreign policy and international relations with interest would know, North Korea withdrew from the NPT in January 2003. In October 2003 North Korea declared that it had completed processing spent fuel rods in order to obtain the material used in the production of nuclear weapons. Then in February 2005 the North Korean regime openly declared that it had actually manufactured nuclear weapons. We all know that in October 2006 North Korea successfully detonated a nuclear device, and that came as a tremendous shock to all of us-not only to the people of Asia but also to those of us in this country. The blast was estimated to have had an explosive force of less than one kiloton. The precise nature of the North Korean nuclear program probably is still largely unknown given the absolute secrecy of that regime. But, more than the measure of explosive force, the key impact of that test was a frightening wake-up call to the democracies of the world and to countries like Australia that the sheer potential for something catastrophic in our times and in our part of the world still exists. We must, more than ever, be vigilant about our global security and our global activities that prevent something catastrophic taking place, such as a wider regional conflict that might bring in countries like North Korea to react in the worse possible fashion, including exploding further nuclear weapons if they have them. As a signatory to the joint declaration on the Korean armistice in 1953, our country would probably have some kind of obligation to be part of a wider solution to such a terrible conflict. It is incumbent on all of us at this time, before such a disaster comes our way, to be as vigilant MAIN COMMITTEE as possible and to recognise that North Korea remains a serious threat to global peace and security. The progress that has been made in recent weeks with the United States Ambassador, Christopher Hill, and his counterparts in the six-party talks is to be commended. However, I read a couple of days ago with some disappointment that there may be some difficulties with those talks continuing as successfully as seems to have been indicated in the previous few weeks. We wish that North Korea and South Korea could perhaps one day unify in peace and security. Unfortunately, at this point in time, North Korea’s successful nuclear test last year continues to cause immense anxiety and concern, not just for us here in Australia but also for the immediate neighbours of North Korea. One of the results has been to bring into the public domain conversation about whether countries like Japan and South Korea would go towards nuclear protection in an absolutely worse-case scenario. All of us would be aware that Japan remains under the protection of the US security umbrella, as does South Korea. But that is why this bill is so important and this architecture, the NPT architecture, is so important to all of us and that we are able to implement it, we are able to enforce it is much as is possible. Without these kinds of agreements, we really do not have a reference point in which to deal with countries like North Korea. I want to very strongly commend the bill to parliament. I know that, as we look across the world, particularly to the Middle East, there are worrying signs that other states might be looking to acquire such devices. All of us, with our very best intentions and our very best faith in those with the capacities to prevent that, wish that that would happen. On the media reports that suggest progress has been made in the six-party talks, if they have any substance to them, that would be a huge setback and would be of immense disappointment. I would hope very much that the North Korean regime would not again waver in terms of its commitment to trying to come to some sort of solution, particularly with the influence the Chinese might be able to bring to bear on North Korea’s future conduct. I will end my remarks with some thoughts from the former US Deputy Secretary of State, Rich Armitage, who came out to Australia last year and made some comments about things getting done in global politics. He made reference to the fact that active participation in international relations by the United States was still vital to the global peace and security of the world, that the United States certainly was not taking its eyes off what was happening in our part of the world and that, at the end of the day, nothing very meaningful could take place in any part of the world without the involvement of the United States. I think that those comments have some significant merit. This bill is a strong step in the right direction, reaffirming our commitment to non-proliferation, and I hope that it encourages other countries to be equally committed to this very worthy endeavour. The world must stand strong and united against the threat of the spread of nuclear weapons. We all know that we live in very challenging times and that countries like Australia have an immensely important role to play commensurate with our size and our economic strength. portant bill.

197,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.17 Am),"The opposition supports this very imregulates with respect to nuclear safeguards the decommissioning of a nuclear facility to ensure that Australia meets its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency under the additional protocol. It also deals with appropriate penalties for serious offences-and we all appreciate that we are dealing with a very serious issue when it comes to the issue of nuclear non-proliferation. CanI say on behalf of the opposition that there is also much more that needs to be done when it comes to the global non-proliferation regime. This is one of the challenges that confront us as a global community, especially as a nation, because we are strategically positioned to be one of the biggest suppliers of yellowcake to the world; therefore, we have additional responsibilities with our huge uranium assets. For that reason, it has been the opposition that have called for serious attention to be given to this issue, because we, in government, will make sure that Australia as a nation takes a lead in the international community in getting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty back on track. I must say that it is a treaty that both sides of politics, the major political parties in Australia, have supported for some considerable time. But you reach a point in time where you have to step up to the challenge of revising the treaty and modernising it for the challenges that confront the global community. I therefore give credit to the former Labor leader, Kim Beazley, who said in July last year: Australia has no greater international obligations and no greater international opportunities than those granted by our position as a nuclear supplier. That is about Australia accepting its international responsibilities on that challenging field. Kim understood that the world is threatened by the collapse of the existing non-proliferation regime and we must do everything to prevent that. At the time, he as the Labor leader proposed a new diplomatic initiative against nuclear proliferation to be led by Australia. It was to be about a review to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. That is where we believe our nation’s efforts have to be focused-and I can assure you that that is where the Labor Party’s forthcoming national conference’s efforts will also be focused in the context of a major debate about us removing our three-mine policy with respect to uranium mining in Australia; it is an outdated policy and it is time it was thrown out the door. We are strategically located as a nation to be a major supplier of uranium to the world in the context of guaranteeing that it is mined and handled with safe hands internationally. As part of that decision we also have to accept that we as a nation have to put a bigger effort into modernising and strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I can assure honourable members that this will be a key issue in the debate about uranium at our conference at the end of April, because we regard the issues as inseparable. Let us go to the issue of the United Nations. In working with the United Nations and our allies to exercise the leadership needed to get the nuclear non-proliferation treaty back on track, we have to provide a coherent international framework for the future peaceful use of uranium in nuclear technology. That is the challenge that confronts us as a nation. We are prepared to mine it with safe hands and supply it to the world. The world needs uranium because it is part of the solution to the growing demand for energy throughout the world. Demand for energy is expanding, and not only in Australia; it will double internationally by 2030. Part of the energy mix is going to be nuclear power. We as a nation do not have to make those tough decisions because we are energy rich. Other nations such as China are going to increase their use of nuclear power in the same way as they are going to increase their use of new renewables and MAIN COMMITTEE also coal and gas. But, for a whole variety of nations, including the United Kingdom, France and the United States-there are nearly 40 such nations throughout the world-nuclear power is a fact of life. As part of that growth in nuclear energy, we have to make sure that, side by side, we strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is about leadership. Australia is used to playing above its weight. We do it in the sporting arena, we do it in the arts, we do it in international business and we do it in international politics. I remind the House that in 1988 it was Australia, under the Hawke Labor government, that led the way to a global agreement preserving the Antarctic forever from human exploitation of its minerals. In 1989 it was Australia, again led by Hawke, which established APEC, a very important forum in terms of our own backyard. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation process was established here in Canberra by the Hawke Labor government. It started as a consultative forum of 12 economies with a modest program of sectoral and trade negotiations to promote economic growth, and it will meet in Australia later this year. It was an original Hawke initiative. We believe that Australia can and should lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation too. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, there is nothing illegal about any country having processing technology. Let us be clear about the facts. The acquisition of highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium is one of the most difficult and important steps towards making a nuclear weapon. If a country with a full nuclear fuel cycle decides to break away from its non-proliferation commitments, a nuclear weapon capacity could be within reach in a very short time. So these are huge responsibilities with respect to the nations participating and supporting the nuclear non-proliferation process. That is why we as a world are frightened of Iran at this point. As the United Nations struggles to hold Iran to account under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime, it has never been clearer that the NPT must be reviewed to make it more relevant to today’s issues and more relevant in a modern world. We clearly do not want rogue nations processing uranium. It is very disappointing that so few nations supported Mohamed ElBaradei’s proposal-he is head of the International Atomic Energy Agency-for a five-year moratorium on the enrichment of uranium and production of plutonium at the last nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in May 2005. That was a failed exercise, unfortunately, despite the leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Unfortunately, Australia is one of the many and not one of the few. We have to get the balance right. The peaceful nuclear cycle offers so much to the advancement of society: for clean power generation in those countries less fortunate in their energy resources than Australia, for minerals processing, for advanced industrial processes and for radiopharmaceuticals. I simply remind Australians that there are very few of us who have not been touched in some way by the requirement for a nuclear medical capacity in Australia; yet people say we should not be fronting up to our responsibilities in the nuclear debate, when we are beneficiaries on the medical front. We will continue to be beneficiaries on the medical front, and that is why the future of Lucas Heights and the new OPAL reactor to be opened in April this year is very important for Australia as a nation, and exceptionally important from a research and a medical point of view. I say that because I think the peaceful nuclear cycle is so important in these contexts that the debate is no longer about uranium mining. The world has moved on. The big marches on MAIN COMMITTEE Palm Sunday in the seventies were about nuclear non-proliferation and ending the international capacity of the world to actually embrace nuclear weapons. Uranium mining was a side issue. The world has moved on. It is a new debate-one about climate change and where nuclear power fits into that debate in countries which are not as energy rich as Australia is. We are the envy of the world when it comes to our access to energy; be it coal, gas-which is really a peaking capacity more often than not-renewables or geothermal, we have got it. Other nations have not, and they are going to embrace coal, gas, renewables and nuclear power. They are facts, and it is about time some people in the Australian community had a factual debate rather than an emotional debate about these issues. When it comes to the nuclear cycle, the Labor Party will always stop to think about national security, global security, the safety of workers and the protection of the environment. They are part of the debate. I remind members of the House that article 4 of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty recognises the importance of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the broad sense, not just nuclear power. I also remind the House that Australia has an important contribution to make in this field, which will be further realised when we open the OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights next month. I also remind members that OPAL is fuelled by lowenriched uranium, which is not a proliferation concern. ANSTO in Australia is therefore contributing to reducing the global use of high-enriched uranium, and that is very important. most of Australia’s competitors use high-enriched uranium. We are again leading in a very practical sense on this important non-proliferation issue. Given that some in the community remain concerned about the safety of the Lucas Heights facility, it is also worth noting that a 2005 US government agencies peer review of security concluded that security at ANSTO is equal to or better than security at any civilian research facility in the world-facts, rather than what you hear from Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation. Security is critical with respect to the future operation of OPAL, and particular care has been taken to separate the researchers from the reactor itself. This means that scientists from around the world will be able to access the worldclass instruments at Lucas Heights without having access to areas of any significance to the safety or security of the OPAL reactor itself. I believe ANSTO is one of Australia’s iconic research institutions, as important as CSIRO, as important as our CRCs and as important as our universities. It is part of our research capacity as a nation. It is part of our future. It is part of our employment and new manufacturing opportunities of the future. There is no question in my mind that it is the appropriate organisation to be responsible for managing radioactive materials in Australia. ANSTO is Australia’s nuclear research and development organisation and it is the centre of our nuclear expertise. As well as OPAL, ANSTO also operates the national medical cyclotron, an accelerator facility used to produce certain short-lived radioisotopes for nuclear medicine. Interestingly, this is located in the grounds of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, in close proximity to Sydney University. In addition, ANSTO manages Australian cyclotron facilities at a number of overseas locations. The Australian facilities overseas have been a critical resource to CSIRO in developing an understanding at an atomic level of its new low-cost processes for the production of titanium powder and metals and parts. The potential of these titanium techMAIN COMMITTEE nologies for Australian resource and manufacturing industries is extraordinary. It is important, for example, to the future of the aviation industry. The synchrotron facilities have been an important piece of infrastructure that has helped CSIRO reach the level of achievement that it has in these new technologies. I am pleased to say that Australia now has its own synchrotron, which was built by the Victorian government and is located adjacent to Monash University and the CSIRO campus at Clayton in Victoriaa campus that is going to become more important for the centre of CSIRO’s manufacturing research activities. Both CSIRO and ANSTO are foundation investors and members of the Australian Synchrotron Co. It is a world-class facility that will deliver beams of very intense X-rays with unique characteristics that can be used for a wide range of scientific experiments, including new drug design, advanced manufacturing, medical imaging, metals research and mineral analysis. The effective operation of this facility will support a large number of Australian national research priorities and associated goals. We are fortunate as a nation to have this capacity to develop leading-edge technology in many areas, guaranteeing our future as a nation. There are outstanding research and development opportunities but unfortunately little is known about them, and some of the organisations involved are pilloried for the wrong reasons. Let us stop the fearmongering with respect to some of these debates, because we need these facilities. Nuclear non-proliferation is an issue that raises the question of waste disposal. The Labor Party when last in government started two decades ago a process to deliver a national approach and a national solution to the issue of nuclear waste. That is still unresolved and it is an indictment of all of us. There is not a member or senator in this parliament who would not agree with me. I simply say that, if the games were stopped and all of us delivered a responsible outcome to the Australian community on this complex challenge, we would be a better nation. Australians deserve better than the cheap politics that has surrounded this complex and important decision for over two decades. Radioactive material is currently stored at over 100 locations around Australia: in government stores, universities, hospitals and factories in the suburbs of our major capital cities. That is where it is stored now. We are saying we cannot establish a national facility in remote Australia to store it on a long-lasting basis, but, again, the facts speak for themselves. This waste is currently stored in the suburbs of our major capital cities. So let us have a factual debate rather than the emotional debate that has surrounded this issue for far too long. Radioactive waste is disposed of at the Western Australian government’s Mount Walton East integrated waste management facility and in the Queensland government’s purpose-built radioactive waste store at Esk. Radioactive waste is stored at Woomera in South Australia and at the Lucas Heights facility in Sydney, and in defence facilities in and around Melbourne, Ipswich, Wodonga, Albury, Newcastle, Darwin, Sydney and Nowra. Radioactive waste is stored at CSIRO facilities in Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide, Mount Gambier, Brisbane and Melbourne-and guess where-at the Australian National University, one of Australia’s leading institutions. It is about time we worked out where to put this waste and how to manage and store it in a proper, professional way. This waste includes such things as contaminated laboratory equipment, protective clothing, paper, rubber gloves, plastic, glassware, lightly contaminated soil arising from previous CSIRO research into mineral extraction that was transported to WoomMAIN COMMITTEE era in 1995, and low-activity, disused radioactive sources such as smoke detectors and exit signs from the buildings we are working in today. Let us store it properly and stop this stupid political debate that has surrounded this issue for far too long. We need a national repository, we need it sooner rather than later, and we need it in the hands of ANSTO so it is managed in a professional and proper way by an institution that we can trust. The Labor Party started this process, so we have got to be part of the solution. It has become too politicised in recent times, with foolish decisions made in the last election in an attempt to get it off the political agenda in the short term. This has only complicated what should have been an easy decision. I raise these issues because, as far as I am concerned, they are all interrelated to the debate about the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and our responsibilities as a nation that will potentially be even more important in the global debate about the safe use of uranium into the future. The use of uranium coming out of Australia is going to grow sooner rather than later, with us as a nation potentially having the largest mine in the world and being the largest supplier of uranium in the world. The current policy limits our capacity to three mines, let alone using our capacity to open up a range of new opportunities in most states and territories of Australia. This treaty is exceptionally important and the Labor Party supports the changes reflected in the bill before the House today. But we have added responsibility to work to strengthen the treaty even further as part of the ongoing debate about modernising the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We owe that to ourselves as a nation. We owe that to ourselves as part of a global community. We also owe it to Australian scientists and engineers, who have a proud history in nuclear technologies-just as they have in solar technologies, light metals, coal technologies and so on. It is equally important that we are at the leading edge of nuclear technology into the future as well. I say in conclusion that Labor supports the bill, but I call on the government to take a stronger approach when it comes to non-proliferation and for it to adopt Labor’s call for a new diplomatic initiative led by Australia to get the nuclear non-proliferation treaty back on track. Both sides of politics have supported those endeavours in the past. The global community has failed, at recent conferences, to achieve that. Both sides should renew their commitment because it is of fundamental importance to the future of a safe global community, a global community that will embrace nuclear energy more than ever. I commend the bill to the House. lation Amendment Bill 2006. This is a non-controversial bill which, as the member for Batman has pointed out, the opposition supports. The purpose of the bill is to reinforce Australia’s commitment to the international regime for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons by strengthening the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities in Australia. The bill implements new requirements following amendments to the International Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It regulates the decommissioning of a nuclear facility to ensure that Australia is able to meet its international obligations in this respect. It increases penalties for serious offences relating to security of nuclear materials. These are sensible measures and the opposition supports them. Australia is currently having a debate about the future of nuclear energy in this country and also about the future of uranium mining and exporting.

198,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.37 Am),"I rise to support the Non-Proliferation Legisthese issues at our national conference next month, so we will have a sound policy to put to the Australian people at the election later this year. The scope of that policy is something that delegates to the conference will determine, but I can tell the House now that our policy will firmly reject any suggestion of nuclear power generation in Australia. Let me quote from an excellent article by Senator Chris Evans, the shadow minister for resources and energy: For countries with limited energy choices, nuclear energy may be a reasonable option despite its substantial disadvantages. But for a nation with vast reserves of cheap coal and gas, and an environment suited to renewable energy production, nuclear power makes no sense at all. Australia has a competitive advantage in coal; we have an abundance of supplies and an established industry. What we have got to do is bring the new technology into play to make it cleaner and more efficient. Labor rejects both the anti-coal fundamentalism of the Greens and the fetish for nuclear power which seems to have seized the coalition in recent months. These are discouraging times for those of us who take the issue of nuclear non-proliferation seriously, which is why I support any moves Australia can take, such as those in this bill, however limited, to support non-proliferation. Indeed, I echo the excellent sentiments of the member for Batman in pointing to the call by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, for a new international diplomatic initiative led by Australia to enhance the provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Last year we saw North Korea join the club of declared nuclear powers, although it now appears that the device the North Koreans exploded was small and not very sophisticated. That a lunatic such as Kim Jong Il should be close to developing a useable nuclear weapon is a frightening prospect and one which the international community, particularly North Korea’s neighbours, such as Japan, are increasingly alarmed by. AlthoughI welcome the recent announcement that North Korea has agreed to suspend its nuclear program in exchange for assistance in developing non-nuclear energy options, I remain sceptical. The North Korean regime’s record of bad faith and broken agreements is too long for anyone to believe that Kim Jong Il has suddenly given up his strategy of nuclear blackmail. I fear we have not heard the last of this story. The extended deterrence of the nuclear umbrella of the Americans over North-East Asia has provided the security that has underwritten the spectacular economic growth of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even China. But, as a result of nuclear proliferation, I am concerned that Japan will now be asking the US for a nuclear guarantee-which, of course, no US government could provide. Although the North Korean nuclear threat to Japan has steadily grown since the end of the Cold War, it is not just about North Korea but also about China. During the Cold War, China developed nuclear weapons for its own defences, including deterring both superpowers. Now China is free to use nuclear weapons for other purposes, China’s destruction of one of its satellites in January strongly suggests the rise of China might not be too peaceful. This should be seen in the context of yet another 17 per cent increase in China’s acknowledged defence spending, its lack of transparency, its activities in the East China Sea and the rapid build-up of the Chinese navy. Australian policymakers have to be concerned particularly about the effect on Japan of these developments in North-East Asia. I wonder about the internal debate within the Japanese governing party, the LDP, re extended deterrence of the US nuclear umbrella. Is their MAIN COMMITTEE support growing for what might be described as the Gaullist position, long advocated by the likes of Japanese Diet member Shintaro Ishihara? Such a change in attitude in Japan would be based on the belief that Japan could not rely for its nuclear security on more powerful allies who might not prove reliable in a crisis. According to Robyn Lim, professor of international politics at Nanzan University in Japan, a top Australian analyst, who recently testified to the Labor Party national security committee, we are now entering what some strategists call ‘the third nuclear age, in which a much faster pace of nuclear proliferation can be expected-that is, horizontal proliferation; states acquiring nuclear weapons for the usual reasons: power, status and security’. Professor Lim has long questioned whether extended deterrence can possibly work in a multithreat environment. It is important to remember that everything we know-or we think we know-about nuclear deterrence and extended deterrence came out of the particular global strategic circumstances of the Cold War. The problem is, as Professor Lim points out, that the rules of the game have changed. If we have a multithreat environment, not based on two polar opposites who had rational aims, we have a very complicated situation with nuclear proliferation. Particularly worrying is the rapid progress being made in Iran towards the development of nuclear weapons. Iran does not need nuclear energy any more than Australia does. It has huge reserves of oil and gas. The only reason Iran is building nuclear reactors is so that it can produce nuclear weapons. Indeed, the Iranian regime is scarcely bothering to conceal that fact. Furthermore, while we can reasonably expect that Kim Jong Il does not actually intend to use a nuclear weapon if he finally succeeds in building a rocket that could deliver one, the same cannot be said of Iran. Kim’s reasons for playing the nuclear card are essentially political and economic: he wants to blackmail the West, particularly South Korea and Japan, into perpetuating his economically and morally bankrupt state. His intentions are evil, but based on what Bismarck called an iron logic. President Ahmadinejad does not need Western money and his country is far from bankrupt. Iran is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, although that is not reflected in the living standards of the Iranian people, who continue to suffer under the Islamic republic’s economic mismanagement and corruption. Iran can afford to build nuclear weapons that work and delivery systems that deliver. Iran is the only country in the world which has openly expressed the desire to destroy another sovereign state, Israel, in blatant violation of the UN charter to which Iran is a signatory. Today even Syria and Libya grudgingly accept Israel’s right to exist. Iran is the last bastion of rejectionism and its most dangerous advocate. I do not think the world quite realises how deep are the religious and ideological convictions that drive the behaviour of President Ahmadinejad and those around him. Shiah Muslims, like Christians and Jews, believe in a great redeeming figure who will return to earth and bring human history to an end. Christians believe in the return of Christ; Jews await the coming of Mosiach the Messiah; but the variant of Shiism to which Ahmadinejad belongs is known as Twelver Shiism. It awaits the return of the 12th or Hidden Imam, whose name is Muhammad al-Mahdi. Twelver Shiahs believe that Muhammad has been hidden by God since the ninth century and he will one day emerge to fulfil God’s plan. President Ahmadinejad and his circle believe, on the basis of various omens and prophesies, that the return of the Hidden Imam is imminent. Since the return of the Imam will bring human history to an end, they are not particularly concerned about earthly things, like whether the people of Iran can find employment or the broken-down state of Iran’s oil industry; they MAIN COMMITTEE are concerned above all about the end of what they see as the greatest affront to God-that is, the establishment of a non-Muslim state in the Middle East, namely Israel. Honourable members would be aware of President Ahmadinejad’s recent sponsorship of a grotesque conference of Holocaust deniers, led by David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan, in Tehran. They probably think Ahmadinejad’s preoccupation with disproving the Holocaust offensive and ridiculous but essentially harmless. This is a mistake. Ahmadinejad’s objective in trying to refute the irrefutable is to de-legitimise the state of Israel as a prelude to its destruction in fulfilment of what he conceives to be God’s will and as a precondition to the return of the Hidden Imam. That is the basis for his rhetorical attack against Israel. When he speaks to the UN Security Council next week, which is scheduled to discuss extended sanctions against Iran for its failure to observe international demands that it cut back its nuclear program, we can expect to hear more of his deluded view of reality, which he will bring to the UN Security Council, which he sees as a necessary precondition for an actual physical assault on the state of Israel. This is the essential difference between the North Korean situation and the Iranian situation. North Korea is playing a game of bluff, a dangerous game but essentially a game. Kim Jong-il has his price and it now appears that the US and Japan-Japan less willingly-are willing to pay that price. This may prove to be a mistake in the long run, but it certainly eases the North Korean situation in the short term. President Ahmadinejad, in my view, is not bluffing and he does not have his price. He cannot be talked out of his nuclear ambitions and he will not be bribed out of them. What arguments, what bribes could mean anything to a fanatic who believes in the coming apocalypse? That is why Iran’s nuclear ambitions are so dangerous. Of course, there are many international diplomatic moves that can be implemented in the meantime to stop the Iranian atom bomb. We can hope that comments made in the Iranian press recently by people associated with the mullahs, the Supreme Guidance Council, denigrating Ahmadinejad are a sign of hope, because many people argue that within the power circles in Iran the mullahs are more interested in keeping control of power than getting involved in a nuclear exchange. They prefer to continue running Iran than to get involved in a nuclear war with Israel. That is again a glimmer of rationality. Hopefully within the power circles in Iran this will be resolved in their favour by their pulling back Ahmadinejad on the nuclear weapons acquisition plan. It is of course a great pity that this drama with Iran is unfolding at a time when there is a crisis of leadership in the Western world. President Bush has been discredited by the debacle in Iraq. One of history’s greatest Labour prime ministers, Tony Blair, is about to retire in September. The failure in Iraq, particularly the botched post-invasion plan, means that it is almost now impossible to mobilise international public opinion in the Western world to take the Iranian threat seriously. People say: ‘We were lied to about Iraq. Why should we believe you about Iran?’ It is a difficult question to answer. But this is, in my view, not a problem for Israel alone. People no doubt remember the Israeli air attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981 which ended Saddam Hussein’s first attempt to acquire nuclear capacity. They assume that Israel could always do the same thing to Iran. Perhaps many world powers secretly hope the Israelis will, so that it will absolve everyone else from dealing with the situation. There are two problems with this rosy MAIN COMMITTEE scenario, one military and one political. Firstly, the Iranians also remember what happened to Osirak and are not as dumb as Saddam Hussein. Their nuclear facilities are scattered all over Iran and buried, thanks to North Korean engineers, deep underground. Perhaps the Israelis know where they are, but probably they do not, or they do not know where all of them are. Even if leaders in Jerusalem did, a single air raid would not do the job and they do not have the capacity to bomb every bunker in a country the size of Iran. In any case, following the demise of Arik Sharon, the Israelis are quite unprepared for the challenge. Few analysts believe that the current shaky coalition government in Israel has the nerve to make a pre-emptive attack on Iran-even if it has the means to-unless the Iranian threat literally becomes imminent. I have no doubt, however, that if Iran really did attack Israel the response would be immediate and overwhelming. I am sure honourable members understand what I mean by this: the whole region, the whole world, would be plunged into a nuclear conflagration. That is why the current Iranian regime is the greatest threat ever faced by the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, of which this bill is a small part. Russia’s move in the last couple of days to withhold nuclear fuel from the nearly completed Bushehr nuclear power plant-I suspect it is unless Iran suspends its enrichment program-is a very encouraging development. When told of Russia giving Iran an ultimatum on its enrichment, a senior European official said: We consider this a very important decision by the Russians. It shows that our disagreements with the Russians about the dangers of Iran’s nuclear program are tactical. Fundamentally, the Russians don’t want a nuclear Iran. For a long time, there has been a proposal which would create hundreds of millions of dollars of business for Russia and at the same time ensure that Iran does not go nuclear. The proposal involves Iran receiving, for its power reactors, nuclear enriched material that was produced within Russian territory. Iran has unfortunately rejected that proposal. Last month the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, informed some European officials that Russia had made a political decision not to deliver the fuel to Iran, adding that Russia would state publicly that the sole reason was financial. Then, last week, a senior Iranian official confirmed in an interview that the Secretary of the Russian National Security Council, Mr Ivanov, had threatened Iran with an ultimatum: the fuel would be delivered only after Iran’s enrichment of uranium at Natanz was frozen. In other words, the Russians are happy to provide nuclear fuel for the real domestic nuclear power facility they are building for the Iranians at Bushehr, but they are not prepared to continue providing it if the Iranians go ahead with their nuclear activity with their centrifuges at Natanz, which is where the world fears Ahmadinejad’s Iran is building fuel for their nuclear weapons. Mr Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, also called on Iran to resolve outstanding questions with the International Atomic Energy Agency about its nuclear program and to stop enriching uranium. The Russians have been pressing Iran to take some sort of pause in its uranium enrichment which might allow the UN Security Council sanction process to halt and bring Iran back to the negotiating table. The Russian foreign minister said: The clock must be stopped: Iran must freeze uranium enrichment ... The UN. Security Council will then take a break, too, and the parties would gather at the negotiating table. I congratulate the Russian foreign ministry and President Putin on this very wise stance of the Russian federation. MAIN COMMITTEE Five years ago, President Bush described Iraq, North Korea and Iran as the ‘axis of evil’. Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq has been overthrown. Kim Jong Il’s regime is now being bribed and cajoled into abandoning its nuclear program-at least for the time beingalthough, as Robyn Lim has pointed out, the subject of negotiations with North Korea is its ongoing nuclear program at Yongbyon. The negotiations are not about decommissioning the nuclear weapons that, theoretically or actually, the North Koreans have. This is subject to further negotiations, and I hope that in the political blowback from Iraq in North-East Asia we do not concede too much to the North Koreans. It is a very encouraging development, but we have to remain firm in our purpose in North-East Asia and hopefully decommission their primitive bombs. President Ahmadinejad’s regime in Iran is the one partner in the ‘axis of evil’ that really does have the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, really does have a target in mind as it builds them and really does have a regime evil enough and reckless enough to use them. After what has happened in Iraq, I am aware that there is not much appetite in the Western world for the concept of regime change. At this stage any regime change in Iran will be internal and limited, with the mullahs there realising that the whole world, via the UN Security Council, is putting tighter and tighter sanctions on them-financial and economic sanctionsand realising that the particular brand of provocative international behaviour of the Iranian president is going to lead to conflict and to their loss of power. I hope that this will cause them to wake up and to abandon this attempt to acquire nuclear weapons and to use them. Unless there is a change of regime in Iran one way or the other, there is a real danger that not only will the nuclear non-proliferation regime be at grave risk, but so will the peace of the world. That is why I strongly endorse the comments of the member for Batman that the proposal of the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, for a new effort, an international diplomatic effort, by Australia to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and non-proliferation regime is an urgent task that Australia should take to its heart. This issue is becoming very live all around the world, and we are going to see more of it at the United Nations Security Council meeting next week when President Ahmadinejad will face all of his critics, including the Russian government, the European Union, the United States and indeed the entire world, who have decided that if Iran will not desist from its policy of acquiring nujad’s no doubt deluded rhetoric next week, forces within Iran come to the realisation that the international community will not put up with these threats of genocide and the plan to acquire nuclear weapons that would enable them to put that into effect. previous member, the member for Melbourne Ports. I do not always agree with him but I think the arguments which he presented about the proliferation of nuclear weapons, in particular in relation to Iran and North Korea, are very apposite. We need to take strong note of them because there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, and I am sure in the minds of many others, that we have to be watching very carefully as to what happens in relation to those matters. Nevertheless, it is important that we do solidly support the legislation that is before the House today. The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 will implement new requirements of the amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material which were agreed in July 2005. The bill amends a range of acts, including the Nuclear MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Ansto S Radiopharmaceutical Production Process Also Uses Low Enriched Uranium Whilst

200,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11.56 Am),"Firstly, let me say that I enjoyed listening to theNon-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The 2005 amendment will come into force after two-thirds of the parties to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material have ratified or otherwise accepted the 2005 amendment. Unfortunately, to date only seven parties have done so. The title of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is expanded under this legislation to include the protection of nuclear facilities. The preamble to the convention is also replaced completely by the new preamble in the 2005 amendment. The paragraph relating to criminal offences is expanded both to include coverage of nuclear facilities and to reflect an urgent need to strengthen existing offences. There is a new paragraph which reflects the desire to ‘avert the potential dangers posed by illicit trafficking and the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and the sabotage of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, noting that physical protection against such acts has become a matter of increased national and international concern’. I note that this legislation has gone through the processes of the Senate and the Senate committees, and they have endorsed strongly this legislation as well as Australia’s continued engagement in multilateral efforts on disarmament and non-proliferation. I want to also attach myself to those recommendations, because, as the member for Batman said, it seems to me that we have a great responsibility for a number of reasons, but, because of our interest in ensuring that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is back on track, we should be increasing our efforts internationally to ensure that is the case. I say that because we know that there is a debate taking place within the Labor Party at the moment-and other members have referred to it-about the question of expansion of the nuclear industry in Australia through the mining of uranium. That debate will have its culmination on the floor of the national conference in April in Sydney. I have been involved with this debate on the nuclear industry since the mid-1970s. I did my utmost to prevent the expansion of uranium mining in the Northern Territory in 1977 and 1978, and the arguments about the nature of the nuclear industry which were used then remain valid today. These are issues which this community has to contemplate, and one of these issues is the question of nuclear non-proliferation. There is grave concern, despite the fact of the wealth that the uranium industry might bring to this country, about the question of proliferation of nuclear weapons. As I said earlier, we have heard the member for Melbourne Ports in a very erudite way explain what is happening with North Korea and Iran in terms of nuclear non-proliferation. There is genuine concern in the community, despite the fact that we export uranium, about the question of nuclear non-proliferation, and it is of interest to know that that issue-although not one which is seen in the headlines of major newspapers when we have these discussions-is very important to the Australian community. We need to ensure, as this bill does, that we support every effort that will prevent the expansion of the nuclear industry, but, most importantly, we need to protect-and ensure that we protect-those places where nuclear materials might be stored or otherwise used. We need also to contemplate the arguments which are used-again, as they were in the early seventies-about the expansion of the uranium industry in Australia in terms of their environmental impact: what that has meant, what has developed over time, what the issues are MAIN COMMITTEE and whether they have been addressed. That is something which I know is, again, at the heart of many of the concerns which are being expressed within the Labor Party as I talk to members of the Labor Party about the proposal to change the Labor Party’s policy at its conference. Those issues go not only to the immediate environmental impacts of the mining operation themselves but also, most importantly, to the question of the downstream effects of nuclear waste. The member for Batman, I think quite properly, said that this country needs to take a far more sophisticated approach to the question of nuclear waste disposal. him that it is totally inappropriate for the Commonwealth government to seek to impose nuclear waste facilities upon the community of the Northern Territory without consultation and without agreement. The fact is that a great proponent of the nuclear industry in terms of mining, the South Australian government, prevented the siting of a nuclear waste facility, the national repository, in their state because they sought to reflect the concerns which were being expressed in their community about that matter. The bottom line is-and this, of course, is the rub-that one of the chief proponents of the change to the uranium policy at the ALP national conference will be the Premier of South Australia. To me, you cannot have it both ways. You have got to be in a position to accept that, if you are going to start the process in the nuclear fuel cycle, you have to go to the very end of that process and understand that you have obligations to deal with the nuclear waste generated. Everyone accepts that there needs to be a national repository. But to have that waste repository now, as a result of the decision by the South Australian government and of decisions taken by the Commonwealth government because of the inability to be able to negotiate a set of arrangements with any state government, and to impose it upon the people of the Northern Territory just because the Commonwealth can do so is, in my view, immoral. The fact is that the Northern Territory community is sick and tired of the way this government has dealt with this situation. When a conservative government in the Northern Territory dealt with a Labor government federally, not once in the 13 years that that Labor government was in power did it seek to impose its view upon the people of the Northern Territory in the way the current government has sought to impose its view on the people of the Northern Territory-on a number of occasions-by denying due process and the right of the Territory community to determine what should happen within the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory. One of the most heinous of these has been the decision by the Commonwealth government to arbitrarily choose three sites around the Northern Territory, which is Commonwealth land, and say to the people of the Northern Territory, ‘We’ve now chosen three sites; one of these three sites is quite probably going to be the place where we are going to secure our nuclear waste repository.’ They did that without agreement. We heard members of this parliament, ministers in this government, say to the people of the Northern Territory that they thought this country was uninhabited, that no-one was living out there, and so on. Of course, that is just absolute, absurd nonsense. There are Aboriginal people with traditional rights in those communities, and there are pastoralists who live very close to the sites which have been chosen. The community is most concerned about it, yet it was not something which was negotiated; it was something which was imposed.

202,Mr Snowdon,"WhilstI note that the member for Grey said, ‘Hear, hear!’, let me say toWhilst the member for Batman is quite right to raise the concerns about our needing to have a national repository, the way in which it has been imposed upon the people of the Northern Territory is not appropriate and, as I said, is totally immoral. But we do have a responsibility, and that responsibility means that we should be engaging all communities nationally to find a solution to the problem-and not, as the Commonwealth has done, just imposing it upon one part of the community just because it can. With great respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you come from a rural community and understand, as I do, that rural communities across Australia are sick and tired of being dictated to in the way this federal government seeks to dictate to them. We need to be able to assure the people who live in the bush that they are not going to be subject to arbitrary decisions in the way in which people in the Northern Territory have been subject to decisions about nuclear waste disposal. We have a responsibility to ensure-and I am sure you do; I hope you do-that we speak up on behalf of those rural constituencies. You have a responsibility to say to this government that, just as your rural constituents would not want their land denigrated in the way the Northern Territory land has been denigrated by this governmentand their rights denigrated-you would support the people of the Northern Territory in ensuring that their struggle against victimisation by this federal government is successful. I hope that is something you would do in your party room, because we share a common interest, and that common interest is to ensure that the rights of every Australian are protected by this parliament. They have not been protected by this parliament, particularly by your government, in the way in which it has imposed this nuclear facility on the people of the Northern Territory. I will go to the question of the ALP national conference. As president of the Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party, I have been holding forums across the Northern Territory on the question of uranium mining. That is with the full knowledge that, given the way in which these things happen, in all likelihood the Labor Party will have a discussion about a policy proposal which will be given to it by its leaders at the national conference, there will be a vigorous debate and the policy will be changed. We all know what the end result is likely to be. Nevertheless, I saw it as my obligation to go and talk to the rank and file of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory about what they thought about these policy proposals. They indicated to me that not only do they still harbour the same concerns that were expressed by me and many others in the seventies but also they remain really concerned about nuclear non-proliferation and waste disposal. They are most concerned that when we have this discussion, as the member for Batman said, we properly address all parts of the question. We need to do that in a sophisticated and relatively detached manner. Even though I have been opposed to the nuclear industry all my adult life, I am a realist and I understand that we are going to have uranium mining now and into the future. Therefore, we need to rationally address all of these issues. The fact is that we are not going to have a policy change in the Labor Party which will close down any mines. The fact is that, under the existing arrangements, there is the capacity for new mines to be developed across the country. The odd thing is that they have not been, even though I understand that uranium is almost at $100 a pound. The fact is that we have not had a plethora of uranium mines developed across the community, partly because state Labor governments have said they will not countenance them-except, of course, the government of South Australia. That government MAIN COMMITTEE has decided that it will not accept a nuclear waste repository, even though it is a chief proponent of the expansion of the uranium industry. I think, therefore, that there is some logic in us arguing that those people who are proponents of the nuclear industry should come up with a solution for nuclear waste disposal and should not allow decisions which they make to have a detrimental impact upon other people in the community in the way in which the decision taken by the South Australian government has had an impact upon the people of the Northern Territory. They have an obligation. I say to those people who are going to participate in this debate at the national conference that they should accept that obligation and should come up with a proposal which, on the issue of nuclear waste disposal, addresses the national priorities, needs and concerns. They should accept that if there is an open and fair process in assessing a site-which did take place as a result of initiatives of the Keating government in the early nineties-once the site is selected, on the basis of the best scientific knowledge, negotiations should take place in a proper and ordered manner. All of the communities that might be involved need to be engaged, including the local communities. Then we can get a resolution to this. It will not happen if, as the federal government has done with the Northern Territory, you seek to impose a solution. But if you accept that you are going to be a party to the discussion about where a nuclear waste facility should be, then you should be prepared to accept that the outcome which is agreed as a result of that discussion is something you will advocate. You should not treat the community with contempt, which is what has been done by the government of South Australia. I think they have been contemptuous of their obligations, partly because they were participants in the process in the first instance but also because we have a national responsibility to address the issue. Whether or not we end up getting a waste facility in the Northern Territory, if, as I hope, Labor wins the federal election later this year, then the undertaking is very clear: we will go back to the drawing board. Unless contracts have been let, we have an obligation to go back and find a rational way to deal with this issue. The rational way we would deal with this issue is by going through the process which I outlined a little earlier. I know that there are people on both sides of this parliament who are concerned about the way in which we are dealing with these matters. I know there are people on both sides of this parliament and certainly people in the general community who, whilst they are very concerned about uranium mining, accept that uranium mining is going to continue now and into the future. We need to address these issues of national priority. We must do it in a way which the community accepts as being fair and reasonable and not in a way which imposes upon people or derogates people’s rights and their desires to live safely. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased that I have had the opportunity to contribute to this discussion, but I say to you that the nuclear industry-uranium mining and all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle-is not going to leave the community’s psyche. People are going to be engaged in this discussion for many years to come, partly because of the priority that the government is imposing on us to develop nuclear power generation. Let me make it very clear, so that the government and those people who support the government around this place know, that the Labor Party will not be part of it. We will not be part of embracing nuclear power generation. MAIN COMMITTEE it very clearly. Expanding uranium mining and nuclear power generation do not go hand in glove, my friend. The fact is that we have sufficient cheap energy resources so that we do not require nuclear fuel generation, as you well know. The fact is that, if the government were prepared to invest in renewables in the way they ought to be prepared to invest in renewables, we would not even be having this discussion. about this, and I am happy to have one with him. But unfortunately, as I only have 56 seconds left, it ain’t going to happen today. pm)-in reply-In rising to summarise the contributions to this debate, I want to proceed on three fronts: firstly, to address the arguments made by speakers on both sides of the House; secondly, to deal with the content of the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006; and, thirdly, to deal with the process and those who have contributed to the bill. In dealing with the contributions made by speakers on both sides of the House, I hope that I am characterising their contributions correctly and accurately by grouping them into three main themes. The first of these themes was support for the general provisions of the NonProliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I believe that we have had universal support from all speakers, representing strong and unified support within the parliament for the general notion of protection of the physical materials and strengthening of penalties for any serious offences in relation to nuclear materials within Australia or arising from Australian activities. The second theme of debate today has been around a general desire for a strong non-proliferation regime. I know from my time in a previous life before being a member of this place that I was engaged with and saw the work of the foreign minister, the Prime Minister, the then defence minister and others in the development and establishment of the comprehensive test ban treaty. Australia was one of the driving forces behind that, and it has been one of the driving forces in maintaining the integrity of and further strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. So those are two fundamental pillars of the international non-proliferation system. Their work and their standing as foundation treaties are critical. We are proud of the role that we have played and are committed to future work on that front. But there is strong and united support within the House on those points. The third of the themes raised for debate within this House has been the division which we have seen on the opposition side over the future of uranium mining in Australia. As I understand it, we saw from the member for Batman clear support for extension and expansion of uranium mining and the uranium industry within Australia, and that of course is somewhat at odds with the position presented by the member for Lingiari. So it is representative of a debate currently going on within the opposition but one which I think is a settled debate, even though it is likely that there will be some light and fury over the coming months. But it does highlight the curious position of, on the one hand, expanding uranium mining and, on the MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Ansto S Radiopharmaceutical Production Process Also Uses Low Enriched Uranium Whilst

207,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12.15other, opposing nuclear energy, because all uranium mined from Australia is used for one purpose. Honourable member interjectingAustralia, but essentially it is used globally for the generation of nuclear power. It is not used for paperweights or bookends; it is used for a very clear purpose-that is, contributing to the practice and expansion of nuclear power globally. The counterposition of opposition to nuclear energy is entirely at odds (a) with the continued practice of uranium mining and (b) even more so with the proposed expansion of uranium mining which some within the federal opposition are championing. So there is a fundamental unresolved tension which is contradictory, which the members opposite know to be contradictory, but which they will persist in advancing. I note specifically the tension between the positions of the member for Batman and the member for Lingiari on precisely that front. I specifically commend the contribution of the member for Hughes, who has within her electorate the Lucas Heights reactor. She has been a strong supporter of the new reactor, which is being used for scientific and medical purposes. The capacity to do different forms of medical imaging in nuclear medicine around Australia is dependent upon the work of that reactor and others of a similar nature around the world. It creates waste which has to be dealt with. At present, that waste is stored in hospital basements around Australia, and so we have opposition to waste management by different state governments but a willingness to allow that waste to remain within hospital basements. Again, that is a fundamental tension. No person in Australia has strongly recognised this more than the member for Grey, who has said it would be an appropriate place in his own electorate. He has been a champion of a national repository within his own electorate but unfortunately his state government, whilst generating uranium and nuclear waste through the treatment of patients for good and proper reasons in their own hospitals, will not accept that responsibility. So we are left with the tension, which the member for Lingiari set out, that the very people who support the industry and benefit from the medical treatment in South Australia are opposing in quite a venal way the storage in their own area. I similarly want to commend the words and work of the member for Ryan in relation to non-proliferation and North Korea. There is a long way to go but we are making promising steps. We are not as advanced with Iran and the potential for a breach in the non-proliferation regime there. We will be vigilant. There is a lot of strong international diplomacy, of which Russia plays an important part, still to be carried out. This brings me to the second part of my speech, which is to re-emphasise very briefly the core elements of the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. These elements can be summarised in three parts. Firstly, there is an establishment of stronger and better physical protection standards. Whilst these are legislative standards, they reflect an existing practice and international regime already in place. It is not as if there has been a lapse, but we are strengthening the legislation to back up that which is already in place. Secondly, there are clear and precise areas where we are increasing the penalties for serious offences, which may in some way involve Australians acting against the safeguards and the regime for protecting the use of nuclear materials. Thirdly, in this bill there is a strengthening MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Ansto S Radiopharmaceutical Production Process Also Uses Low Enriched Uranium Whilst
208,Mr Hunt,"Well, there may be some medical purpose for the uranium that comes fromof the national counterproliferation objectives by extending the territorial jurisdiction for certain offences to include Australian residents anywhere in the world. The law currently applies to Australian citizens, but we are ensuring that it also applies to Australian residents. It is a tough recognition of the challenges we face today but it is an important one, and I am pleased that it has the support of all members of this House. Finally, I want to thank all of those organisations, institutions and individuals who have contributed to the development of this bill, in particular the members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but also all of the different contributors. They serve Australia well. They do a great job. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I thank them. I commend the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Unemployment: Statistics Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (12.25 pm)-Since 1960 the Australian Bureau of Statistics has relied on the labour force survey to provide our community with information on employment, unemployment and labour force participation. The survey is done on a monthly basis with a sample of around 29,000 households comprising approximately 65,000 individuals. The ABS definition of an employed person is ‘a person aged 15 and over who during the reference week worked for one hour or more for pay, profit, commission or payment in kind in a job or business or on a farm’. Employment for only one hour or more in that reference week is the test as to whether are you considered to be employed or unemployed. Despite the huge changes in our labour market since the 1960s-with the growth of casual, part-time and contract labour, and the decline in full-time jobs-the one thing that has not changed is how the ABS measures unemployment. It is a statistical convention set by the ILO which has not changed in four decades. The steady rise in the proportion of people working non-standard hours means that the way we define who is employed actually underestimates the true picture, because it does not measure the extent of underemployment in our economy. When part-time employment constituted less than 10 per cent of total employment back in the early sixties, adopting a rule that defined employment as working more than one hour a week did not cause any great distortion. Today part-time work accounts for 29 per cent of total employment, the second highest proportion in the developed world. Now that part time, casual and contract work is so much more common, the arbitrary one-hour rule is much more misleading. In the past employment was considered to be a proxy for self-sufficiency, but, as we know, today a casual or even a part-time job is no guarantee of self-sufficiency-let alone a situation where if you work for one hour you are considered to be employed. For example, people searching for full-time jobs are not counted as unemployed if they manage to pick up a few hours of causal work in a survey period.

209,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.25 Pm),"I move:So when we hear the Howard government loudly proclaim the historic low levels of unemployment in Australia, remember that in the calculation of the unemployment rate, currently at 4.6 per cent, it does not matter whether an individual worked for one hour or 40 hours in a week. Anyone working for more than one hour is defined as employed and by definition cannot be considered unemployed. We now have in Australia more underemployed workers than officially unemployed. Underemployment has been defined by the ABS as a situation where a worker has a job but works for fewer hours than he or she is willing and able to work. Unfortunately, the ABS only calculates the underemployment figure once a year, in September, and many months pass before it is actually released. The latest broader measures available are for September 2005. They show that the official unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent then, blowing up to an underutilisation rate of 10.5 per cent and an extended underutilisation rate if you include discouraged job seekers of 11.4 per cent. In September 2006, that translated into 521,000 unemployed and 544,600 underemployed Australians. When you look at the figures for the state of New South Wales in September 2006, you see that the official unemployment rate was 5½ per cent and the underemployment rate was 5.1 per cent, leading to an aggregate labour force underutilisation rate of 10.6 per cent. These figures, I think, are proof that the official unemployment rate that we refer to in fact hides the true labour market situation. The narrow measure of unemployment that we now use, and that the ABS uses, could be rectified by adding a standard question to monthly labour force surveys asking how many hours the person would like to have worked. This would provide both a broader definition of unemployment, along with the narrow official definition that is used to maintain international comparisons. If you take both the official unemployment rate, the underemployment rate and an estimate of discouraged jobless, you get a much broader measure of the true unemployment rate in Australia. This ends up being roughly double the narrow official rate. On this basis, a more realistic measure of unemployment in Australia today is not 4.6 per cent but nearer to nine or 10 per cent. In the region I represent-the Illawarra-it would be in the order of 14 to 15 per cent. Water pm)-Today is International Water Day. On International Water Day in my electorate of Flinders at Gunnamatta Beach-one of the great beaches in Australia-every hour, 17 million litres of partially treated sewage will continue to be dumped off our coast. Over five years ago, the then state Labor government, which is the continuing state Labor government, made an ironclad pledge that they would clean up the Eastern Treatment Plant and the Gunnamatta outfall. They have broken that promise; they have failed to fulfil it. Today, International Water Day-as over 400 million litres of waste water is dumped off our coast, is not recycled, is allowed to both pollute the environment and not be used for productive agricultural and industrial purposes-I call on the state government of Victoria to commence works on upgrading the Eastern Treatment Plant by International Water Day 2008. There is no timetable for this upgrade. There is a vague commitment which was made over five years ago. By next year it will be six years. Every hour, 17 million litres of waste water is polluting the Mornington Peninsula’s coastline. Every day, including today, International Water Day, over 400 million litres of waste water is polluting the Mornington Peninsula’s coastMAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
210,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12.30line. Every year, 150 billion litres of waste water is polluting our coastline. On every day that this occurs, that water could have been used for industry and agriculture in place of fresh water and to take pressure off our dams and pressure off our communities. It is a waste of water and it should not occur. On International Water DayI repeat my strong view that the state must commit to commencing the upgrade of the Eastern Treatment Plant by International Water Day 2008. Electoral Roll only 48 per cent of all 18-year-olds were enrolled to vote. Of the people in that age bracket, some 260,000, the AEC has only 126,000 enrolments-that is, 134,000 18-year-olds would not have been enrolled to vote if we had had the federal election last year. With state elections in Victoria and New South Wales we will see some young people being picked up by the AEC and a slight improvement in the numbers enrolled. The figure that was cited to me by one of the very capable representatives from the Electoral Commission, Mr Pickering, was that after the federal elections in December 2004 only 68 per cent of 18-year-olds were enrolled to vote and that figure had dropped to 48 per cent by 2006. He was expecting that it would once again rise to a figure like 68 per cent, but that still leaves an enormous number of people off the electoral roll, particularly in the younger age group. As alarming is the fact that 17 per cent of all 21to 25-year-olds were not on the electoral roll as of 2006. As at December 2004, 82 per cent of 19-year-olds were on the roll after the election, but only 66 per cent were on it last year. For 25-year-olds the figure was 85 per cent after the election; it is now 79 per cent. It is therefore clear that a vast number of young people all across Australia are not enrolled and will not be participating in the next federal election. I estimate that if you added all of those figures together you would have nearly half a million young people not on the electoral roll. These are very alarming figures. There are many ways of approaching this. One is to say that it is an ongoing problem, increasing over time, that we have to deal with using long-term solutions. I know that people at the Electoral Commission are planning to do something all around Australia, which I commend them for, and that is to take addresses where there were previously enrolled voters and physically doorknock them. This is a vast expense to the taxpayer but it is something that is really worthwhile. It shows the seriousness of the Electoral Commission in dealing with the matter of young people being enrolled to vote. One of the long-term ways of handling this would be for Australia to move, like other countries have, to a fixed election period. People would know when the election was coming and they or the AEC could get themselves on the roll. I favour the great plan of the former Labor Prime Minister and visionary, Mr Gough Whitlam, that we move to a fixed four-year term. I think that would provide more stable government for Australia. Both political parties could support that. It would also have the democratic effect, in a compulsory voting system, of allowing people-especially the missing 500,000 young people-to get onto the electoral roll. I have to end this speech by pointing to the cynicism of the government. While the Electoral Commission is working overtime to get these people on the electoral roll, particularly the 500,000 missing young Australians, the government has come up with a plan, which we all know about, to close the electoral roll for young people, first-time voters, on the day that MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
211,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.33 Pm),"I regret to advise the House that as of 2006the election is announced. We know that this will be a disaster. Its motivation is not based on any fact of electoral integrity. There have been 72 proven cases of electoral fraud over six elections, where 72 million Australians voted. It is one per million. Therefore there is no serious threat to electoral integrity here, yet 80,000 young Australians who would have been able to use the week of grace that they have been given in every previous election from the early eighties to now will now be disenfranchised. I call on the government to, even at this stage, revise its ridiculous legislation that will disenfranchise young people. (Time expired) Investing in Our Schools Program has ever been initiated by the Howard coalition government, and that is the Investing in Our Schools Program, which was announced in the lead-up to the last election. It has an allocation of $1 billion: $700 million of that to go to government schools and $300 million to go to nongovernment schools. I also congratulate the now Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Julie Bishop, on her work to secure the additional $0.2 billion. That is going to go a long way towards assisting schools in the next round if they have not had the opportunity to apply till now. I wish to highlight what has been delivered not just in my electorate but in every electorate across the whole nation. Whether you are a member on the opposite side or on this side of the House, you will know that this has benefited schools, students and the living and working environment of teachers and their students on a daily basis. In my electorate of Greenway, government schools have received $4.235 million and non-government schools have received close to $572,000. That is close to $4.9 million. This is money that was not available to schools prior to the last election; this is money that has never previously been available from the federal government. I congratulate the Howard government and the education ministers past and present on their hard work in delivering this. In many of the schools that I have spoken to, particularly in recent weeks, where I have had the privilege of announcing fresh funds and also talking to them about and opening what we have already been able to deliver, the response from the school students and also the parents has indeed been heartening. RecentlyI attended Barnier Public School-the principal there is Mr Rod Gibbs, and Mrs Vivienne Husking leads the Friends of Barnier Inc -and I had the privilege of listening to the students as they showed me the ICT equipment costing $50,000 that was delivered by the federal government. This is enabling these students to learn in an environment that meets their needs and where teaching is delivered in a methodology that is 21st century. So this is indeed wonderful. I will also talk about a number of other schools. I want to highlight one project that the Minister for Education, Science and Training was able to come and open with me, and that was at Riverstone High School, where they have extreme temperatures, sometimes over 40 degrees. Some of the funding was able to be used to build an outdoor education area which is covered to ensure the safety and protection of the students, particularly in the heat of the summer sun. I would also like to mention another school, called Lalor Park. This school is going to secure funds that are well overdue. This school has not been able to secure the assistance that it requires from the state government. This school is severely underresourced and was actually advised by the state department that it should not apply. It has secured $142,000 for the conMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
212,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.38 Pm),"I rise to talk about one of the best programs thatstruction of a toilet block. The toilet blocks were completely unacceptable for any student in our day and age to use. They were leaking. They were filthy, and not through lack of cleaning. They were completely unacceptable-Third World. SoI congratulate Lalor Park. I had been knocking on their door, talking to them and asking them, ‘How come you haven’t secured funding?’ and they were telling me that they were advised by the state department, by the state Labor government, not to apply. Yet the state Labor government and the member, whose name I will not mention, failed to secure the basic needs of a hygienic toilet block for these children. SoI commend this program. I think it is a wonderful program, and I would love to see it continue beyond this round of funding. (Time expired) International Women’s Day: Ms Malalai Joya Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (12.43 pm)-I want to talk this morning about International Women’s Day, which was held on 8 March. Particularly, I want to talk about a wonderful opportunity that I was able to share in on the morning of 9 March. UNIFEM, a wellrecognised organisation which is very involved in the celebration of International Women’s Day, had invited to Australia for this year’s International Women’s Day a young woman-I believe she is 28 years old-from Afghanistan, Malalai Joya, who is a member of the Afghan parliament. She was invited by UNIFEM to come to Australia this year to assist in celebrating and recognising International Women’s Day. I had the enormous privilege of organising and hosting a meeting here in the House with Malalai Joya on the morning of 9 March. This was an extraordinary opportunity both for me and for a number of women within the ACT community who were able to come along, meet with her and listen to the remarkable story that is represented by Malalai Joya. In fact, the BBC has described her as ‘the most famous woman in Afghanistan’. She is now an MP for the Farah province and the director of a nongovernmental group called the Organisation of Promoting Afghan Women’s Capabilities in the western Afghanistan provinces of Herat and Farah. Despite continuing death threats, Malalai Joya continues her efforts in Afghanistan, speaking at rallies and on radio and encouraging large numbers of women within her province to attend public gatherings such as International Women’s Day. Amongst many of her concerns-and there are many-is the fact that, since the fall of the Taliban, Iraq has displaced Afghanistan on front page news. I will quote from an article in the Canberra Times of 9 March 2007, which comments very accurately on her views, the sorts of views she discussed with us here that morning. She is very concerned that the complacency reflected by the displacement of Afghanistan in the news ignores the continuing suffering of Afghans, particularly women, at the hands of powerful warlords. She spoke to us very passionately about the role that she has. Despite the death threats, she travels around Afghanistan under the protection of a burqa, with bodyguards where necessary, because she has had so many attempts made on her life that that is the only way she can in fact continue her life and the work that she undertakes representing women in particular within Afghanistan. I have to say that I was a bit overwhelmed by the commitment of this young woman. We in politics in this country know what we have to do to engage and have an active role in politics. It pales into insignificance when we consider a young woman like Malalai Joya, who has on more than one occasion put her life on the line to try and influence an open and democratic process in Afghanistan and to try and make sure that the road to recovery from her point of MAIN COMMITTEE view and the point of view of her community in Afghanistan has some hope of actual success. The article says: She is also impatient with talk of Afghan women having thrown off the burqa. She describes rapes, beatings, and murders of women and young girls. Sadly, these continue in her country and represent to an incredibly high level the sort of representation those women really require. I call on all the members of our House, male and female, to make themselves, if they have not already done so, aware of the work of a young woman called Malalai Joya. We are all to learn from her and to understand better the sorts of situations that women and children are facing in Afghanistan even today. I want to thank Ros Strong, the president of the national board of UNIFEM Australia, and Libby Lloyd more locally for the work they did in getting Malalai Joya here and for managing to allow me and other women in this region to have this valuable hour with this incredible young woman. I look forward to continuing to hear of her success and her work. I wish her every success for her future in her work in Afghanistan. Iraq Harmony Day putting all of that on the public record in this place, because it very nicely ties in to some of the comments I want to make. It highlights very much in one sense why the government has a commitment to creating a sense of liberation and freedom for the people in Iraq. Having the most culturally diverse electorate in Queensland brought home to me very quickly early on in the whole Iraq debate the reason that Hussein had to go. When I had Kurdish community members coming to me telling me the same sorts of stories as the member for Canberra has just passed on to the House, it made me realise why that vicious and brutal regime had to go and why Australia had to take a stand as a strong democracy. SoI thank the member for Canberra because those stories have to be told. It is important that they are told. I think with regard to the way in which Australia meets and greets refugees of conflicts in other places, meets and greets those who have come as business migrants and meets and greets those who have come as the poorest of migrants to this country it is important that we give them an enormous sense of encouragement. Yesterday was Harmony Day, a government program that I once administered. I know that Harmony Day is meant to be 365¼ days of the year. It is not meant to be an ephemeral orange-ribbon-wearing occasion. It is meant to remind us that Australia is the most culturally diverse nation in the world. One in four of us was born in another place. One in four of us has at least one parent born in another place. So, for many families in Australia, Australia is a very recent experience. I am seven or eight generations along. On my mother’s side it is eight; I am seven on the Hardgrave side, and I always say I am two parts Scottish, one part English and one part Irish. I see that the member for Bendigo is laughing. But what that means is that I like a drink and I want someone else to pay for it. At the end of the day, our cultural diversity in this nation is part of the economic strength that we have. I know that schools like Runcorn Heights State School value their cultural diversity. They bring the parents of their kids together. They celebrate diversity, show off their cultures and share their food. At Warrigal Road State School MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
213,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.48 Pm),"I am indebted to the member for Canberra forMuslim women arrive, some wearing scarves and some not, for their annual fete every year and provide the food alongside the Greeks and the Italians. This is all fantastic. We all have to eat-some of us less and some of us more-and sharing each other’s food and culture is an important thing to do. But it is more than that. It is important that we do not create a sense of victimhood in the minds of those new to Australia. And yet you have a lot of the peak bodies writing to us saying: ‘People are being victimised. They are being pinned down by comments in the paper and made to feel awful.’ This has been the Labor Party’s way in the past. When we came to office in 1996, we promised an end to this separate treatment-this favoured treatment for one group over another. I remember the stories that cultural groups were told, ‘Don’t tell anybody else what we are giving you; but if you vote Labor, you’ll get more of it.’ They kept it secret from each other. Australia was in the process of Balkanising under the Hawke and Keating governments. This government has said, ‘What have we all got in common?’ The No. 1 answer is that we are all part of this country. What brings us together sets us apart from other nations. It is not unreasonable for us to challenge every new arrival to this country to be who they are but to be it for Australia. It is not unreasonable for us to make available to them the tools to integrate, English being the No. 1 tool. And, providing we can get proper and quick recognition of the skills they bring and the educational experiences they have had, and repair the differences between what is required and what they have, we have to get these people to work. I see people like David Kemp at BDS-a fantastic shopfitting company in Brisbanegoing out of their way to bring people like Sudanese refugees into their workforce. He has 130 people in his factory at Crestmead and about 25 per cent of them are Sudanese refugees. Why? Because they are great workers. Why? Because they value the job they have. He wants to see more of that, and I do too-because once we give people a sense of confidence and we give them the competence to participate, they build a commitment to Australia and they have a sense of ownership of the place. That is what this government has done that is so different to the work done by the previous government. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils has asked me to: ... show leadership and provide reassurances to Australia’s vibrant culturally and linguistically diverse communities that Australia is a compassionate, welcoming, empowering and inclusive society and that there is a place for everyone. I happily do that. I also publicly state that these people have made an enormous contribution to Australia for many decades. (Time expired) New South Wales: Labor Government Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (12.53 pm)-With the upcoming New South Wales state election this Saturday, I rise to draw the state’s attention to the use of public resources by the Premier of New South Wales. He has faxed to all the schools in my electorate his Labor policies on schooling. I would like to table that. It is a statement on Labor’s ‘strong record on new technologies’. Leave granted. Miss JACKIE KELLY-This is the document in which Morris Iemma claims that he will be connecting classrooms. Yet in the third round of the Investing in Our Schools Program for my area, 12 schools had ICT upgrades, which is basically the installation of computer labs. In MAIN COMMITTEE the last two rounds it would have been a similar number. As usual these promises will only be delivered in the fourth year of a Iemma government-by which stage the federal government would have fully kitted out every school in my electorate with ICT upgrades. It is this fraud by the New South Wales government that has got people so frustrated. It is the most unpopular New South Wales government in my memory. Further to that, Bernie Riordan is mailing out, to the New South Wales Department of Education and Training’s mailing list of students, letters against the NECA Group Training company, saying: ‘Don’t vote for AWAs.’ So this government is in cahoots with the union movement in defeating legitimate negotiations on AWAs, and yet no investigation has been conducted by the Iemma government into who gave Bernie Riordan that list. Was it an authorised disclosure? How did the union get hold of such information and why wasn’t that made known to the company? Further to that, we also saw the Leader of the Opposition visit my electorate today on a last round of beating the stumps. They must think they are in trouble in Penrith because there he was, pumping the pump with Morris Iemma today. He breezes in through the back door. There was a welcome committee there for Kevin Rudd. A number of people were out the front. They included media, local constituents who wanted to meet him, schoolkids and a few protesters. But Kevin Rudd came in through the back door and he left by the back door before Morris Iemma had even finished speaking. This man is a coward and he should be held accountable. How many times have I had the Prime Minister come to my electorate and, when there are protesters, John Howard goes up the guts of the protesters every single time? I have never seen John Howard run from protesters like this little weasel did today. He absolutely went in thethat remark. Miss JACKIE KELLY-I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. He went in the back door. This man behaved like a little furry animal running through a pipe to scurry away from possible or imagined dangers on an empty highway. These were constituents who had given up their time this morning; they had flagged that he was going to be there. They thought they could at least meet the member. As far as I am concerned, the sole signal that Kevin Rudd’s visit to my electorate today sent to the electorate wasor by their seat. Miss JACKIE KELLY-the Leader of the Opposition-was that they have given up on Lindsay. Basically they have written it off as a safe Liberal seat. He does not care to meet the constituents there. He does not care to meet the media there. He does not care to meet the protesters there. He does not care to get into discussions about issues in Penrith. He breezed in the back door, out the back door, saw the inside of a hall; he did not even visit my electorate, which has wonderful things to visit. We have the wonderful Nepean River. We have a wonderful CBD. We have some great areas. We have some areas of concern that he should see, such as our rail stations, such as our roads infrastructure, such as the upgrades that are required on various community facilities.

217,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) Attorney-General’s Department AGD has a clause permitting flexible remuneration arrangements in their workplace agreement. There are no specific provisions offering childcare benefits. The AGD Certified Agreement also contains provision for expenses relating to dependant care responsibilities to be met by the Department in certain limited circumstances. The provision reads as follows: “3.71 Expenses relating to dependant care responsibilities This clause applies if: an employee is directed to perform additional hours of duty; and the direction is given less than 24 hours before the duty is to be performed; and the employee must arrange for the care of dependant family members in order to perform the additional duty. In recognition of the employee’s dependant care responsibilities, the Secretary may approve the reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in making the arrangements mentioned in paragraph (1) (c). In this clause: family includes a relation by blood, marriage (in law or fact), adoption, fostering or traditional kinship, or a person who stands in a genuine domestic or household relationship with the employee for more than 12 months.” Administrative Appeals Tribunal Administrative Appeals Tribunal Agency Agreement 1 July 2003 – 30 June 2006 Assistance for Caring Responsibilities 73. The Tribunal acknowledges that employees often have diverse primary caring responsibilities and provides scope for various leave to assist employees in balancing these responsibilities with their work at the Tribunal. However, there may be occasions where operational requirements mean that the Tribunal cannot accommodate a request for leave or may require an employee to work away from home outside his or her normal work pattern. In these circumstances, the Tribunal will provide the following assistance: (a) reimbursement of some or all reasonable additional costs of caring (eg. holiday childcare, respite care) incurred by employees who, for operational reasons, are unable to be granted annual leave. Reimbursement will be up to $20 per day towards the cost of caring services. The maximum weekly payment is $100 per employee. Approval is subject to the applicant having given notice of intention to take leave 3 months prior to the expected leave commencement and prior in-principle approval from the Registrar for reimbursement. Where the Registrar is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist a lesser period of notice may be acceptable. (b) where employees are required to work away from home outside of their normal hours (eg. interstate), reimbursement of some or all reasonable additional costs of caring incurred by the employees provided that they indicate their intention and obtain prior approval from the Registrar. Australian Customs Service Under the Australian Customs Service Certified Agreement 2004-2007, staff may apply for financial support to a maximum of $500 per annum if they incur domestic care costs while undertaking training and development activities. It does not cover situations that are ordinarily part of the duties of the position, for example interstate travel.

Customs will endeavour to provide as much notice as possible of forthcoming training. If employees are required to attend part of the training outside their rostered hours overtime provisions of Clause 2.4 of this agreement will apply. Employees may be reimbursed additional costs up to a maximum of $500 per annum in accordance with the Domestic Care Support Scheme. Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ASIO’s Seventh Workplace Agreement contains two provisions relating to childcare; specifically: “To assist staff manage the impact of work on their personal responsibilities, it is agreed to reimburse staff when the unexpected demands of their jobs result in additional dependant care costs being incurred, for example, paying a carer to attend to an invalid parent, placing an infant into child care etc.” “The parties to the Agreement agree to work actively to examine the feasibility of providing child care and gymnasium facilities for Canberra-based staff during the term of the Agreement.” Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions The CDPP CA has a provision that where an employee with school children has approved leave cancelled without reasonable notice or, is recalled to duty from leave during school holidays, the CDPP will contribute up to $15 per day per child towards the cost of care for each child attending an accredited school holiday program. The maximum payment per family is $150.00 per week or the actual cost incurred, whichever is the lesser. No claims have been made under this provision. This provision is also extended to employees on an AWA. Federal Court The Federal Court has arrangements for staff to bring children and dependents to work as provided in its Certified Agreement, clause 90 of which is set out below. “90. Child and Dependant Care 90.1 The Court will continue to provide emergency child and dependent care rooms or facilities in each Registry. The Court’s OHS Committee will identify guidelines for Registries on providing rooms/facilities within three months of certification. Once developed, these will be included in OHS audit checklists for use by workplace OHS representatives. Arrangements may be reviewed from time to time, in consultation with the NCC.” Federal Magistrates Court “53.1 CHILD CARE SUBSIDY: Where employees, who are the sole available carer of dependant children, are required by the FMS to be away from their home base overnight, reimbursement of reasonable childcare costs that would otherwise not have been incurred, will be considered. Application for consideration, including an estimate of the cost involved, is to be made prior to the finalisation of travel arrangements. Evidence of expenditure must accompany any claim for reimbursement.” Office of Parliamentary Counsel Schedule6 – Clause9 of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel Certified Agreement 2004-2007: Dependant care costs – The First Parliamentary Counsel may approve reimbursement of reasonable costs arising from dependant care arrangements which are required: because an employee is required to travel out of Canberra for official purposes; or because an employee is directed to work additional hours or to attend a conference or training course outside the employee’s approved hours of work; or MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING to ensure that a part-time or full-time employee is available, if required, to work outside his or her normal hours of duty (but within the span of hours during which employees may work normal hours); or because of other special circumstances which, in the First Parliamentary Counsel’s opinion, justify the reimbursement. (8) In addition to the assistance for childcare provided for Certified Agreements, as described in (7) above, the following arrangements also apply. Administrative Appeals Tribunal New draft AWAs refer to Personnel Direction 11 (PD 11) but there were no references in previous AWAs. The relevant excerpt from PD 11 is below: “Personnel Direction No. 11, Family Responsibility Policy Statement Assistance for Caring Responsibilities The Tribunal acknowledges that employees often have diverse primary caring responsibilities and provides scope for various leave to assist employees in balancing these responsibilities with their work at the Tribunal. However, there may be occasions where operational requirements mean that the Tribunal cannot accommodate a request for leave or may require an employee to work away from home outside his or her normal work pattern. In these circumstances, the Tribunal will provide the following assistance: (a) reimbursement of some or all reasonable additional costs of caring (eg. holiday childcare, respite care) incurred by employees who, for operational reasons, are unable to be granted annual leave. Reimbursement will be up to $25 per day towards the cost of caring services. The maximum weekly payment is $125 per employee. These amounts apply for the 2006/07 financial year and will increase to $26 per day/$130 per employee in 2007/08 and $27 per day/$135 per employee in 2008/09. Approval is subject to the applicant having given notice of intention to take leave 3 months prior to the expected leave commencement and prior in-principle approval from the Registrar for reimbursement. Where the Registrar is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist a lesser period of notice may be acceptable. (b) where employees are required to work away from home outside of their normal hours (eg. interstate), reimbursement of some or all reasonable additional costs of caring incurred by the employees provided that they indicate their intention and obtain prior approval from the Registrar.” (9) No. (10) No. Media Monitoring and Clipping Services (Question No. 4139) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, in writing, on 7 September 2006: (1) What sum was spent on media monitoring and clipping services engaged by the Minister’s office in 2005-06 (2) What was the name and postal address of each media monitoring company engaged by the Minister’s office.

The person was detained by AFP members before being transported to hospital for psychiatric assessment. It was later determined that the person suffered from a mental health condition which required treatment, further assessment and observation. The person was detained under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW). Incident 2: On 21 April 2004, NSW Department of Fisheries (NSW Fisheries) was patrolling Botany Bay, in the vicinity of the airport, when they observed a small boat with two male occupants and a third male in the water. NSW Fisheries officers suspecting illegal fishing approached the boat and obtained identification details from the occupants. When they attempted to speak to the male in the water, the intercepted boat departed the area. The male in the water attempted to evade NSW Fisheries by hiding in the rocks at the southern end of the runaway and was later observed running on the north/south runway. Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd (SACL) and the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) closed the main north/south runway for approximately forty minutes. During this time two domestic flights were diverted and the arrival of several international flights delayed. NSW Police Air Wing and Dog Squad were called to assist locating the trespasser. A police dog tracked the trespasser who was subsequently detained by the NSW Police Service (NSWPS) and APS officers. Custody of the male was then transferred to the AFP.

The statement was unclear and ambiguous with words spoken to the effect of either “I do not have explosives in my bag” or “I have a bag full of explosives”. The passenger was allowed to proceed through Customs and to board the aircraft. Later, the passenger was asked by Emirates staff to disembark and the AFP was notified. Despite the risk having been assessed as negligible, in the interests of public confidence and at the request of Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL), an AFP Bomb Appraisal Officer conducted a hand search of the luggage and found no hazardous material. The person was subsequently questioned by AFP and denied making any threat. Incident 2: On 15 November 2004, a female person entered the Sydney Airport International Terminal after ramming her vehicle into another vehicle outside the terminal. The female was observed to be wearing a black jacket inscribed with the words, “Don’t shot bom”. The female was approached by AFP Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR) officers and instructed to stop. The female stated, “Get out of my way; I have a job to do”. AFP CTFR officers then obstructed her entry into the terminal. AFP CTFR cordoned, contained and evacuated the immediate area as a precautionary measure and NSW Police were requested to attend. The female removed a black case from under her jacket and placed it on her lap. The black case had words inscribed on it stating “Don’t Shot Bomb” with wires that appeared to lead from the case to her left thumb. NSW Police then attended and commenced negotiations with the female, known to be suffering from a mental illness. She was then searched. No explosives were located on her or inside the black case. The female was transported by NSW Police to hospital for assessment. (2) This incident was confirmed as a hoax. (3) (a) (b) (c) Incident 1: The threat was received by a private security guard.

Parties to this Agreement The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding (Agreement) are the Commonwealth of Australia (the Commonwealth) and the New South Wales Government (the NSWG). 2. Introduction The Commonwealth will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) programme of events for 2007 (APEC 2007). APEC is the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2007 programme will encompass a wide range of ministerial, officials’ and business meetings and events across Australia that culminate in meetings of APEC economy leaders (AELM), to be held in Sydney, New South Wales on 8 – 9 September 2007. Several of the preceding meetings and events are held in the week leading up to the AELM and are collectively referred to as the APEC Leaders’ Week. The purpose of this Agreement is to identify the organisational and administrative arrangements associated with holding the APEC Leaders’ Week in Sydney including services and obligations to apply for the term of the Agreement. This Agreement only relates to coordination of events associated with the facilitation of the APEC-related events in the APEC Leaders’ Week. A list of scheduled APEC meetings and events, that comprise the APEC Leaders’ Week are at Attachment A. MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING 3. Aims The Commonwealth and the NSWG (the governments) agree that their principal aim is to ensure that Australia’s hosting of the 2007 APEC Leaders’ Week is successful. A successful APEC Leaders’ Week, and, in particular, a successful AELM will: facilitate bilateral and multilateral outcomes that are in Australia’s national interest, be secure, have a distinctive Australian style and effectively showcase Australia and Australia’s business community, be involving and acceptable to the wider community, minimise disruption to the general public, and enhance Australia’s international reputation to be able to deliver complex, high security international events. 4. Guiding Statements The governments agree that the following principles will guide their approaches to the APEC Leaders’ Week: that the Commonwealth, and specifically the Prime Minister, is the sole host of the APEC year and the APEC Leaders’ Week. that in order to deliver a successful APEC Leaders’ Week, an effective and cooperative relationship between the governments is vital. in accordance with Constitutional conventions, as well as extant law enforcement and security frameworks such as the National Counter Terrorism Plan (NCTP), the NSW Police (NSWP) is responsible for operational security of APEC events held in NSW. Australia’s international standing and profile will be enhanced by a successful APEC Leaders’ Week. 5. Term of the Agreement This Agreement covers the period from the date of signature to the conclusion of all activities associated with the APEC Leaders’ Week. 6. Commonwealth Security Support to New South Wales The Commonwealth recognises that the size and complexity of the APEC Leaders’ Week will generate demands on security resources above and beyond that normally encountered for government events and that the NSWG has finite capability in these areas. Accordingly, the Commonwealth agrees to make available Commonwealth assets and other resources including but not limited to commercial security contractors, appropriate elements of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Australian Federal Police to secure the APEC Leaders’ Week. Calls on Commonwealth assets and other resources to complement the APEC security overlay, identified during APEC Leaders’ Week security planning, will be endorsed by the APEC Leaders’ Week Executive Management Committee (AEMC) prior to any request for such assets being made to the Commonwealth. These processes do not replace or alter any Commonwealth – State relationship under the NCTP or any ADF deployment under the Plan. 7. APEC Related Cost Framework Security Costs The governments acknowledge that at the time of signing security planning was at a relatively early stage resulting in specific requirements and costs not being clearly defined. MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING The Commonwealth, while noting that constitutional responsibility for the maintenance of law and order within the State of New South Wales including the protection of life and property rests with the NSWG, will cover those APEC specific security costs, provided such costs are agreed by the Commonwealth and the NSWG to be APEC-specific. This will include costs incurred in preparation for APEC Leaders’ Week, operational costs at event time as well as post-event matters directly related to the event. Security for APEC 2007 and the Leaders’ Week means provision of planning and the policing related response for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of life and property. Security will be conducted in coordination with APEC 2007 Taskforce resources. The conduct of activities will be executed with APEC 2007 Taskforce resources, NSWP or other response organisations. The general areas of security include but are not limited to traffic and transport, intelligence, emergency response, personal safety, public order, tactical response, dignitary protection and venue related protection. The APEC 2007 Police Command will work closely with the Commonwealth APEC 2007 Taskforce and the PSCC to identify the security arrangements for the APEC Leaders’ Week under the current security environment. The development and management of a detailed security framework for the APEC Leaders’ Week is the responsibility of the APEC Leaders’ Week Security Operations Group (ASOG) as defined under the governance section of this Agreement. The ASOG will develop an APEC Security Operational Agreement (ASOA). The roles and responsibilities of the ASOG are outlined at Attachment E. Non-Security Costs The Commonwealth also recognises that there will be other APEC-specific costs, not directly related to the APEC security overlay. Subject to the governments agreeing on these other APEC-specific nonsecurity costs, the Commonwealth agrees to meet these costs. Such costs could include, but are not limited to, medical and emergency services, public outreach programmes, unusual utilities required for APEC activities and costs related to adjusting public works schedules that ensure disruptive projects do not impinge on APEC activities. The governments agree that the responsibility for meeting the costs of provision of non-security related services by NSWG instrumentalities will be dealt with through an APEC Operational Agreement (AOA) to be developed and managed by the APEC Leaders’ Week Operations Group (AOG). Arrangements for the provision of these services and cost recovery arrangements will be detailed in the AOA. Financial Agreement Schedule All payments by the Commonwealth will be in accordance with the agreed payment schedules developed as part of the ASOA and AOA. The operational groups (the ASOG and AOG) will identify financial milestones that will form the basis of these financial schedules to be submitted for endorsement by the AEMC. Release of funds for an activity may be deferred until agreed actions for that activity have been completed to the satisfaction of the AEMC. 8. Contract Negotiations and Compensation Contract Negotiations Arrangements between the APEC Taskforce and APEC 2007 venues such as the Sydney Opera House (SOH) and the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre (SCEC) will be subject to commercial negotiations between the Taskforce and the venues. It is noted that some NSW venues the Taskforce will hire may be heritage listed or significant NSW icons such as Government House and the SOH, therefore the Taskforce will seek advice and consult with appropriate NSW representatives regarding their use. Compensation to Corporate Entities The Commonwealth, while recognising that APEC Leaders’ Week activities may cause a level of disruption to some business entities, aims to minimise the range and magnitude of this disruption. MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING The Commonwealth assesses that any disruption to normal levels of activity of business entities located in or near APEC events may be offset by patronage from APEC accredited delegates and by contracts to the Commonwealth, as represented by the APEC 2007 Taskforce in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) for the provision of services to the APEC Leaders’ Week. Cancellation Compensation In the event that the Commonwealth is forced to cancel the APEC Leaders’ Week in Sydney, the Commonwealth accepts that it may in some circumstances be liable to provide compensation to the NSWG. Any such compensation claims should be raised using the dispute resolution framework outlined in this Agreement. 9. State and Territory Government Access to APEC Events The NSWG recognises that the Commonwealth, and specifically the Prime Minister, is the host of the APEC Leaders’ Week and that the hosting of the APEC year is an Australia-wide commitment. The NSWG also recognises that the core APEC programme of meetings, specifically dialogues between senior officials, APEC ministers and economy leaders, can not be accessed or used for promotional purposes by the NSWG. The Commonwealth recognises that the government and people of NSW are playing a key role by providing the venue for the APEC Leaders’ Week. As part of the show-casing aspect of hosting APEC and to maximise the business leverage of the APEC Leaders’ Week the NSWG, along with other state and territory governments and business entities, may be given access to supplementary activities related to the APEC Leader’s Week that may include but are not limited to: promotional opportunities at some venues including the SCEC and the SOH, elements of the Chief Executive Officers’ Summit, elements of the APEC Business Advisory Council forum, and the Official Leaders’ Dinner. 10. Commonwealth and State Legislative Amendments The governments realise that there may be some requirement for short term legislative amendments at both the state and Commonwealth level in order to ensure that APEC specific operations can occur. Any requirements for legislative changes will be identified by the operational groups (ASOG and AOG) and endorsed by the AEMC before being forwarded to the respective government for consideration. 11. Governance The governments agree to establish a governance framework that seeks to ensure that structures and processes are in place to maximise performance and meet accountability requirements. The governance framework will cover strategic, operational and tactical level elements of planning for and delivery of the APEC Leaders’ Week. The governments agree to establish organisational groups which form the key components of the APEC planning and decision-making process as described below and interact as illustrated in Attachment B. A. Executive Management Committee The APEC Leaders’ Week Executive Management Committee (AEMC), chaired by the Head of the APEC 2007 Taskforce, is the senior governing body that is to manage the relationship between the Commonwealth and the NSWG and review and endorse all major planning components for and oversight the implementation of APEC Leaders’ Week.

(1)(a) Australian-based Antarctic tourism operators are required to obtain an authorisation for Antarctic activities under the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 (ATEP Act) and the activity must be carried out in accordance with this authorisation. Authorisations may only be issued after an environmental impact assessment has been carried out by the tourism operator on the proposed activities. In addition, a permit under the ATEP Act is required for certain activities, including entry to some protected areas. (b) The Department of the Environment and Water Resources regularly consults with Australian-based Antarctic tourism operators and seeks to ensure that all those planning Antarctic activities are aware of and comply with the requirements of the ATEP Act. The Department investigates any reports of activities that may have been conducted in contravention of the ATEP Act. (c) As far as it is known, all current Australian-based Antarctic tour operators obtain appropriate authorisations and permits for their Antarctic activities and conduct their activities in compliance with these instruments. (2) The environmental requirements for Antarctic tourism activities are derived from the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection. Australia monitors the development of Antarctic tourism and will continue to work with other Antarctic Treaty member countries to ensure that the environmental requirements for Antarctic tourism are adequate.

The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, today announced the successful recipients of the 2006 Volunteer Small Equipment Grants (VSEG). “This is the eighth time the Howard Government has delivered these grants, with over $35 million distributed to approximately 16,800 community organisations across Australia since 2001,” Mr Brough said. “The grants have been allocated to volunteer organisations which demonstrated their work significantly contributes to supporting families and strengthening local communities. “This funding helps these organisations purchase a wide variety of equipment items to make the valuable work of volunteers easier, safer and more enjoyable. “This includes the purchase of equipment such as urns, microwaves, computers, lawn mowers and tools items which make a significant difference to volunteers’ work, and which organisations may not have otherwise been able to afford.” Mr Brough said that this round of VSEG attracted an unprecedented 15,000 applications reflecting the popularity and usefulness of the grants. “While in any single round only so many can be funded, I was so impressed by the nature of the applications in general that the Government has determined to automatically roll over most of the unsuccessful applications so they can be considered in the next round. “Volunteers provide essential support and services to members of the community who are most in need, and the Howard Government will continue to support organisations’ commitment to their communities,” Mr Brough said.

(1) For each year since 2001, no person in immigration custody has died during either removal or deportation from Australia. The answer refers to both removals and deportations because the deportation power is no longer widely used. Most enforced departures from Australia occur under section 198 of the Migration Act which requires that unlawful non-citizens be removed as soon as practicable. A deportation order may be issued against a non-citizen under s200 on security grounds or because they have been convicted of serious criminal offences. Terrorism (Question No. 5307) (1) During his address to the 61st session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, did he say: “States should conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. This would demonstrate an unambiguous commitment, ensuring all terrorist acts are criminalised in international law. It is disappointing that the UN still cannot agree on the scope of such a convention… too often in the world of politics, the temptation is for governments to strike an attitude and then leave the substantive action for another day, or offload the responsibility onto others”. (2) Will he support a motion in Parliament calling on the UN to sponsor an international convention on suicide terrorism, as outlined in my Private Members’ motion of 16 October 2006; if not, why not. (3) Will he outline Australia’s contribution to the progress of the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism referred to in his speech. (1) Yes. (2) The Government does not support the motion’s call for the UN to sponsor an international convention on suicide terrorism and seeks to disallow the motion moved for reasons outlined as follows. First, the Australian Government does not see the benefit in initiating an International Convention on Suicide Terrorism, since there are already 13 existing international conventions on terrorism that cover all types of terrorist acts and behaviours. The Government has a long-standing policy of seeking a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism though negotiations with United Nations member states. It supports a comprehensive instrument on terrorism, rather than seeking separate conventions on specific forms like suicide bombings, additional to those that already exist. Second, current offences defined in the Criminal Code already capture all types of terrorist activity, making it unnecessary to create a separate offence of suicide terrorism either in domestic or international law. There are also practical constraints, such as difficulties the prosecution would face in identifying the perpetrators remaining after a suicide terrorist attack. The definition of a terrorist act in the Criminal Code makes it an offence to engage in, train for, prepare, plan, finance or otherwise support terrorist activities. In its June 2006 report, the Security Legislation Review Committee approved the Criminal Code’s definition of a terrorist act.

254,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Third, the Government’s policy is to focus on strong intelligence and security measures, as well as other strategies to prevent terrorism, including suicide attacks. Prevention strategies include working closely with mainstream Muslim communities in Australia and overseas to reject notions that such actions are either heroic or supported by religious doctrines. I ( Mr Downer) emphasised the need to address terrorist ideology and propaganda in my address to the seminar convened by the Indonesian Government in February 2006, “International Cooperation Against Terrorism: Focusing on Suicide Bombing as a Symptom of Terrorism.” Fourth, the Government considers that suicide terrorism may already be considered a crime against humanity, both at the international level where the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction and under Australia’s domestic law. Crimes against humanity are defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Government legislated in 2002 to make crimes against humanity an offence under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. (3) Australia has been contributing to progress on the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) through constructive and active engagement in the Ad Hoc Committee’s negotiations on the text through our Mission to the United Nations in New York. The Government has strongly supported the adoption of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the most comprehensive CT statement ever adopted by the General Assembly. We have sought to move CCIT negotiations forward in New York through coordinated and combined efforts with other countries to build consensus. These countries include the CANZ subgrouping (Canada, Australia and New Zealand), as well as other like-minded countries on this issue. In statements with CANZ, Australia has urged States to redouble their efforts to conclude the CCIT and demonstrate unambiguous commitment to criminalise all terrorist acts, and cooperate in the prosecution of those responsible for such acts. We have also engaged in advocacy on a bilateral basis with a range of other countries, urging them to support the conclusion of the CCIT negotiations. In the 2006-07 budget, the Australian Government committed $92.3 million in regional CT assistance over the next four years, including to capacity-building in law and justice sectors to help countries comply with, and ratify international CT conventions. Papua New Guinea (Question No. 5309) Is he aware of a report by the Australian Conservation Foundation and Papua New Guinea’s Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights titled Bulldozing Progress: Human Rights Abuses in PNG’s Large Scale Logging Industry; if so, (a) has he sought advice in respect of the contents of the report and (b) what is the Government’s response to the issues raised in the report. I am aware of the report. (a) Yes. The information in (b) below reflects advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID. (b) The Government is concerned by the allegations of human rights abuses contained in the report, many of which involve police intimidation and assault on communities in logging areas. Australia has been seeking to encourage and assist the PNG Government to reform the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), in order to improve the law and order situation in the country and address a range of problems within the RPNGC, including indiscipline, violence and corruption. Assistance to the RPNGC was a key focus of the Enhanced Cooperation Program established by the two governments in 2004, until the PNG Supreme Court ruled in May 2005 that aspects of the MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING",212,Uncac Through The Apec Anti Corruption And Transparency Experts Task Force And The Conferences

256,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:program were unconstitutional. The Australian Government has since offered to provide a number of Australian police as advisers to the RPNGC to assist its reform. The ACF report also refers to the abuse of women in logging areas. The Government is concerned about violence against women in Papua New Guinea, which extends well beyond the forestry sector. The Australian Government, through programs conducted by AusAID, has provided support for the justice system, including village courts, to deal with family and sexual violence, and funded community initiatives to raise awareness and support victims of sexual violence. We have also supported local organisations, such as the Family and Sexual Violence Action Committee, which played an important role in encouraging legislative changes in Papua New Guinea to protect women from sexual violence. The ACF report raises allegations of poor governance and unsustainable practices in PNG’s forestry sector. The Australian Government takes these allegations seriously and has called for the Papua New Guinea Government to ensure that relevant legislation and procedures are enforced, including those pertaining to environmental and landowner protection. Australia is strongly committed to sustainable forest management. We have sought to improve the capacity of the Papua New Guinea Government to tackle these problems by funding four advisers in Papua New Guinea’s National Forest Authority to strengthen the agency’s corporate governance and financial accountability functions. The Australian Government is also supporting the development of a sustainable forest industry in Papua New Guinea by providing funding for forestry projects sponsored by the International Tropical Timber Organization. Discussions are continuing between PNG and Australia on possible further support to the National Forest Authority. Energy Initiatives (Question No. 5311) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, in writing, on 6 February 2007: For each calendar year from 2000-2006 and in each State and Territory: (a) how many service stations sold unleaded petrol containing ethanol, bio-fuel petrol blends and liquefied petrol gas and (b) how many (i) litres of unleaded petrol containing ethanol and bio-fuel blends and (ii) tonnes of liquefied petrol gas were sold through these outlets. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The detailed data has not been collected by my department. However, information that is provided publicly by petrol retailers indicate that the number of service stations selling biofuels has been increasing rapidly in recent years. (a) The number of service stations selling unleaded petrol blended with 5 or 10 per cent ethanol (E5 and E10 respectively) in June 2005 was approximately 70. By mid-September 2006 this had increased to around 395; and by the end of January this year the number of service stations selling E5 and E10 had increased to about 525. There is limited information available regarding the number of service stations providing biodiesel and the total number of service stations selling biodiesel is not available. However, Caltex announced in October 2006 that they are in process of rolling out their New Generation Diesel that contains 2 per cent biodiesel to 185 service stations in NSW. With the introduction of the $17.2 million Ethanol Distribution Program the number of service stations selling ethanol blended fuels should increase over the course of the year. The number of service stations selling liquefied petrol gas (LPG) is approximately 3,200. MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING (b) The volume of biofuels sold through individual service stations is not available for the time period requested. The volume of LPG sold from retail outlets since 2000 to 30 November 2006 is: Year Litres 2000 1,978,322 2001 2,452,650 2002 2,366,853 2003 2,481,006 2004 2,452,144 2005 2,568,456 Jan to November 2006 2,256,182 Total 16,555,613 Overseas Development Assistance (Question No. 5317) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 6 February 2007: Has the Government established a timetable to ensure that Australia will donate 0.7 per cent of its gross national income towards Official Development Assistance by 2015, consistent with the United Nations Millennium Project and the commitment made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee; if not, what measures has the Government put in place to ensure that this target will be met. While the Australian Government will continue to support the United Nations Millennium Project goal of 0.7 per cent of GNI as an aspiration, it does not support a time bound target to reach this goal. The Government is committed to increasing Australia’s official development assistance (ODA) to around $4 billion per annum by 2010. Indigenous Health (Question No. 5340) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 6 February 2007: (1) Can he confirm that the Department of Health and Ageing is leading a Council of Australian Governments trial in the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Yakunyatjatjara Lands that includes a Healthy Stores Policy component; if so what are the full details of the Healthy Stores Policy; if not, why not. (2) Can he confirm that the Mai Wiru Policy encourages the provision of cheap, nourishing food in remote Indigenous communities; if so, how; if not, why not. (3) In what year was the Mai Wiru Policy and Healthy Stores Policy initiated and fully implemented. (4) Can he advise the average price of fresh fruit including, but not limited to, apples and oranges (a) in the financial year prior to the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy and (b) following the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy; if not, why not. (5) Can he advise the average price of fresh meat including, but not limited to, mince and stewing steak, (a) in the financial year prior to the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy and (b) following the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy; if not, why not. (6) Can he advise the average price of baby formula (a) in the financial year prior to the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy and (b) following the implementation of the Mai Wiru Policy; if not, why not.

257,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes, the Department of Health and Ageing is leading a Council of Australian Governments trial in the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Yakunyatjatjara Lands. The Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy and associated regulations were developed on the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Yakunyatjatjara Lands following a decision by the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Executive. The Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy has the endorsement of both the Commonwealth and the South Australian governments. It is guided by a comprehensive plan that addresses the issue of food security, food access (including affordability) and food availability (including range and quality). Activities are carried out by the Mai Wiru Stores steering committee under the auspice of the Nganampa Health Council. (2) Yes. The provision of affordable healthy food is covered under a Memorandum of Understanding with all community councils. It provides for: (a) Negotiation of a system for the bulk purchasing of supplies. (b) Negotiation of a coordinated freight system. (c) Standardisation of stores management systems and practices. (d) Human resource management improvement. (e) Coordination of public health nutrition activities. (f) Development and negotiation of a subsidy on identified food, health consumables and health hardware items. (3) Mai Wiru policy and regulations were developed in 2000-2001. Implementation of the policy has occurred since 2002. Preferred supplier agreements were signed in April 2006 which allow for rebates based on volume and a flat freight rate across the lands. (4) (5), and (6). No. There are several factors that influence the price of goods in the stores. Historically there have been no store budgets. For the 2006–07 financial years budgets have been prepared for each store with the intention of determining the true cost structures and the running costs of the individual stores. This will assist in determining where price reductions can occur without impacting adversely on the viability of the store. Some stores have been servicing a debt that usually involves a price rise. Mr Peter Foster (Question No. 5347) (1) On what date was Mr Peter Foster, who was in custody in Vanuatu, most recently issued with an Australian passport. (2) What ‘good character’ requirements must be satisfied before an Australian passport is authorised for issue. (3) Did the Government have any negative reports regarding Mr Foster’s character when he was most recently issued with an Australian passport; if so, what are those details. (4) Is there a procedure for withdrawing an Australian passport if a citizen consistently displays evidence of bad character whilst overseas; if so, what are those details. (1) Mr Peter Foster was most recently issued with an Australian passport on 31 July 2003. His passport was cancelled on 5 February 2007 and he was granted a limited validity travel document to facilitate his return to Australia. That document was impounded on arrival in Australia.

260,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) An Australian citizen is entitled to be issued with an Australian passport subject to the requirements of the Australian Passports Act 2005. The Act provides for a competent authority to request that a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant issued in Australia for an indictable offence or who is prevented from travelling internationally by force of a court order, parole or bail condition or direction under a law of the Commonwealth, should be refused issue of an Australian passport. (3) According to passport records, Mr Foster was not subject to any legal restraint that would have prevented issue of a passport under the passport legislation in force at that time (Passports Act 1938). (4) The Australian Passports Act 2005 provides the Minister with the power to cancel and/or refuse to issue a passport to a person at the request of a “competent authority” which suspects on reasonable grounds that a) the person is the subject of an arrest warrant issued in a foreign country in respect of a serious foreign offence, or b) the person is prevented from travelling internationally in connection with a serious foreign offence, or c) the person would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice security or endanger the health or physical safety of other persons in Australia or overseas. Death Penalty (Question No. 5351) What instructions, if any, has the Australian Government given to our Ambassador to the United Nations in respect of any proposal from that body to oppose the death penalty. The Australian Government instructs its Ambassadors and Permanent Representatives to the United Nations in New York and Geneva on a range of multilateral issues, including the death penalty. By way of recent example, in 2006, the Australian Government instructed our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York for Australia to: (a) Join other UN Member States in supporting a statement on the death penalty in the United Nations General Assembly. This statement was delivered on 19 December 2006 by the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Finland on behalf of 85 Member States, including Australia. (b) Deliver a statement to the Third Committee of the General Assembly in which we strongly encouraged other Member States to work towards abolition of the death penalty and to join Australia as a State Party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This statement was delivered on 27 October 2006 by Senator Brett Mason, MP, Parliamentary delegate to the Australian delegation to the United Nations. Iraq (Question No. 5352) Prior to the decision by President George Bush to escalate the US presence in Iraq by dispatching a further 21,000 US troops to that country, did the President, or his advisers, seek the view of the Australian Government in respect of the proposed future strategy for the war in Iraq. The Australian and United States Governments consult closely on Iraq matters.

264,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Terrorism (Question No. 5393) 2007: To which countries in Asia and the Pacific does Australia provide assistance and/or advice in their fight against terrorism and what is the nature of that assistance and/or advice. Australia has provided extensive counter-terrorism (CT) assistance and advice to partners in Asia and the Pacific, with an emphasis on those facing the greatest terrorist threat and those least equipped to address it. Australia has established a network of bilateral CT cooperation arrangements that underpin and facilitate practical, operational-level cooperation in countering terrorism with regional partners. CT Cooperation Memoranda of Understanding have been concluded with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, East Timor, PNG and Fiji. Most assistance and advice is provided under bilateral programs. Some is provided to regional or sub-regional groups of countries, such as Assistance and advice has been provided to our partners in a wide range of areas, including law enforcement; border control; transport security (including protecting aviation against Man-Portable Air Defence Systems); CT legal frameworks; intelligence; terrorist financing; defence; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear terrorism; and strengthening of national CT coordination arrangements. The assistance takes many forms, including, where appropriate in each case, training, technical assistance, exchange of information, expert advice, provision of equipment, seminars/conferences and the conduct of CT response exercises. For further information on Australia’s offshore CT engagement see the recent Government publication Protecting Australia Against Terrorism (www. pmc.gov.au/publications/protecting_australia_2006/index.htm). Australia and Indonesia are leading Southeast Asian CT efforts through a regional CT ministerial meeting process. An important mechanism for providing practical assistance is the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation – also an Australia-Indonesia initiative – which is building the expertise and professionalism of regional law enforcement agencies, with around 85 courses conducted so far for more than 1900 regional participants. The Philippines is an increasingly important CT partner, with cooperation focused on law enforcement, port security, border management and defence issues. Funding arrangements for CT assistance to the region are as set out in DFAT’s Portfolio Budget Statements and those of other relevant agencies. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (Question No. 5402) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 12 February 2007: Since the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was give the capacity to conduct safety investigations on the Defined Interstate Rail Network and responsibility for the Marine Confidential Reporting Scheme, (a) how many rail safety investigations have been conducted, and what are the details and (b) how many reports have been received under the Marine Confidential Reporting Scheme. (a) Thirty one investigations on the Defined Interstate Rail Network, (including investigations into separate derailments on 30/1/2005 which were incorporated in one report), have been conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s rail safety unit since 1 July 2003.

There are no authoritative estimates on the total number of Iraqi civilian casualties, or the number permanently debilitated and disfigured. Estimates, and the methods used to compile them, vary widely. Afghanistan (Question No. 5421) 2007: (1) Which European countries have troops serving in Afghanistan. (2) Which, if any, of the countries identified in Part (1) have imposed restrictions on their troops being reassigned from northern Afghanistan to southern Afghanistan.

(4) Are there any European countries that have troops serving in Afghanistan, but have not imposed restrictions on the movement of their troops; if so, which countries. (1) Of the 37 countries participating in the NATO-ISAF mission in Afghanistan, 33 are European. The 33 are: Albania; Austria; Azerbaijan; Belgium; Bulgaria; Croatia; Czech Republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; France; former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Iceland; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey, and; United Kingdom. (2) It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the national policies of other countries. Furthermore, restrictions may be classified for operational reasons. (3) I delivered an address to the Munich Security Conference (10 February 2007) in which I urged nations involved in the NATO-ISAF mission to relax or remove caveats that restrict their troop deployments in Afghanistan. I said such action would “give the ISAF commanders the flexibility they need to achieve victory”. Ministers and high-ranking officials from many NATO-ISAF mission nations attended the Munich Conference. I will continue to encourage NATO members to take such action.

(6) What has been the response of the Solomon Islands people to the open letter. (1) YesI am aware of the report. RAMSI continues to do very good work in maintaining security in Solomon Islands and in helping to equip Solomon Islands overcome the many difficulties the country faces. The political environment is challenging, but the Australian Government is working hard to keep RAMSI in place and effective. (2) Australia remains committed to Solomon Islands through both RAMSI and bilaterally. We continue to look for ways to engage with the Solomon Islands Government (SIG) in order to deal effectively with issues as they arise, and have urged the SIG to provide an opportunity for our High Commissioner to present his Letter of Introduction, to enable him to carry out his duties. (3) The High Commission in Honiara took the decision to buy space to ensure the letter was printed in full. I understand this is the first time that space has been bought for such a purpose in Solomon Islands newspapers. (4) (a) See Attachment A for copy of my letter to the people of Solomon Islands. (b) The letter was published in the Solomon Star, Island Sun, and the National Express newspapers. (c) Total cost was SBD12,003 (approximately AUD 2265.00) for publication in the three newspapers. (5) RAMSI contributing countries were briefed on the letter on the day of publication. (6) It is difficult to gauge public reaction. However, the editorial in the Solomon Star on 9 February 2007 highlighted the need for Solomon Islands and in particular Prime Minister Sogavare, to mend the relationship with Australia.

275,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Attachment A A Letter to the People of Solomon Islands From the Hon. Alexander Downer Minister for Foreign Affairs, Australia. I have taken the step of writing directly to you, the people of Solomon Islands, because I believe you have a right to know the plain facts of what is happening in the relationship between my country and yours, and in particular the current attempts being made to undermine Australia and the Pacific region’s efforts to help you through the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). It would seem that Solomon Islands is once again at a cross roads. At such a crucial time in your country’s history, I feel it is important that the people of Solomon Islands have access to accurate information about the views of Australia, your friend and neighbour, who has been working so closely with you these past years, especially through our leadership of RAMSI. I know because you have told me that the majority of you appreciate very much this partnership and what we have managed to achieve together in the past four years. Solomon Islands is a very different place now than it was prior to RAMSI’s arrival. I also know each and every one of you remembers only too well the fear and intimidation, the breakdown in basic services, the closure of hospitals, schools and medical clinics, the hopelessness that took over so many of your lives. Australians and indeed your regional neighbours who make up RAMSI remain committed to working with you to prevent a return to those bad old days; we remain committed to keeping RAMSI in place, so that Solomon Islands can continue to move forward. Sadly there seems to be a deliberate push to undermine RAMSI, to tarnish its reputation, and make it hard for it to continue its work. For instance, personnel are finding it difficult to enter the country and take up their positions in RAMSI, and for their families to stay in Solomon Islands with them. At the same time, the Solomon Islands Government has spoken about removing the legal protection which allows RAMSI personnel to undertake their work efficiently and independently. There has also been an insulting attempt to smear RAMSI with the allegation that prostitution was being allowed on RAMSI premises. No evidence was ever produced to justify this shameful allegation. More recently the outrageous allegation was made in a Solomon Islands court that Australia was behind an alleged plot to assassinate your Prime Minister. Not only is this not true, it is a grave insult to the people and government of Australia. It would appear that you, the people of Solomon Islands, are currently facing two very important decisions: 1. Whether RAMSI and its partnership with you is to continue and 2. Whether certain units of the Solomon Islands Police Force (SIPF) should be re-armed. Moves by the government to re-arm the SIPF are of very great concern. RAMSI has acknowledged that the SIPF will need to use some arms in the future. But despite what has been achieved so far in building the capacity of the SIPF, it is clear that it is too early yet for such a sensitive step. It appears most Solomon Islanders agree. I understand a recent newspaper poll found that 95 per cent of the many asked were opposed to re-arming. The RAMSI Special Coordinator believes, and we support his judgement, that it would be against RAMSI’s mandate to support re-arming in the face of such strong concerns from the people of Solomon Islands. The security of the Solomon Islands Prime Minister is, of course, a very serious matter. RAMSI provided armed close personal protection to Prime Minister Sogavare until he – not RAMSI – asked for this protection to be removed in late 2006. RAMSI remains ready and willing to assist in meeting the Prime Minister’s security needs. Australia has also been watching with some concern as government institutions in Solomon Islands, designed to ensure the government and people are accountable for their actions, have been undermined. MAIN COMMITTEEQUESTIONS IN WRITING The government dismissed the Attorney General, a Solomon Islander, and replaced him with a man wanted in Australia on child-sex charges. Late last year, the Solicitor General, a RAMSI deployee, was forced to leave after being personally threatened. Without giving any reason, the government then banned the Police Commissioner, Shane Castles, from the country. Despite all of this, Australia has attempted to move ahead on the bilateral relationship. We have welcomed to Australia a new Solomon Islands High Commissioner, His Excellency Victor Ngele. We have also appointed a new High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Peter Hooton, who is keen to advance our shared interests. Unfortunately, the Solomon Islands Government has now cancelled two appointments for Mr Hooton to present his letter of introduction, thereby preventing him from carrying out his legitimate duties as Australia’s representative to Solomon Islands. Australia has been accused of not respecting the sovereignty of Solomon Islands. In fact the whole reason for RAMSI’s existence has been to support and strengthen that sovereignty. Before RAMSI, Solomon Islands’ sovereignty had been seized, at the point of a gun, by bands of thugs and criminals. Since then, RAMSI has been working very hard to ensure that the people of Solomon Islands can live their lives in peace and security. We have helped Solomon Islands to build institutions capable of delivering essential services, such as health and education, to the people. These are the basic building blocks of sovereignty. Sovereignty, of course, entails responsibility. Leaders are responsible for ensuring they work for the benefit of their people and for listening to and respecting their people’s wishes this is particularly relevant to the re-arming debate. It is also important that governments play a constructive role in ensuring social and ethnic harmony. Australia wants to continue to help Solomon Islands face the challenges of your nation’s future. But we are finding this increasingly difficult due to the obstacles being placed in our path. The coming weeks and months will be a critical time. The decisions that your country is currently considering – on RAMSI and the question of re-introducing guns to the police – will lay the foundations for the future. I urge Solomon Islanders to consider these issues very carefully, and to go out of your way to encourage your leaders to listen to you, their people, and make wise decisions for the future of your country.
