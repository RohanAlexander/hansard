8,Sir Robert Menzies,"Perhaps Iphysical sense. It is rather inaccessible, and information about it is very difficult to obtain, but it is thought that there is a great hydro-electric potential in the area, a great possibility for exploiting timber resources-thi s has been put to me more than once by the honourable member-and a great possibility of further mineral discoveries. The proposition of the Tasmanian Government is that we should reach some financial arrangement for assisting in the construction of a road of access to the area. It is not a cheap proposition; about £2,500,000 would be involved in it. We have looked at the proposition and I have now informed the Premier of Tasmania that, having regard to all the possibilities involved, the Commonwealth Government is prepared to provide the cost of the road of access, £2,500,000, and to do this by way of a non-repayable grant. addressed to the Treasurer. It concerns certain tenders called by the Commonwealth Stores Supply and Tender Board. I preface the question by saying that, in the calling of some tenders, the board lays down as two of its conditions, first, that the Commonwealth shall be under no legal obligation to purchase any or all of the supplies shown as estimated to be required; and secondly, that the board reserves the right to purchase supplies of the item from other sources during the contract period. I ask the Treasurer: Is it fair that the Commonwealth, after accepting a tender, can desist from making any purchases from the successful tenderer and at the same time purchase supplies of the item from some other source? In such circumstances, what is the point in calling for tenders? Does the Government realize that in the case of small firms particularly this procedure either deters them from submitting tenders or involves them in the risk of a critical loss of capital and stock production outlay in anticipation of orders that are not honoured? tion would have been more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Supply, who handles this section of the Administration. I can tell the honourable member only that, for my part, I think these rules are soundly based. It might be as well if my colleague supplied a detailed set of answers to the questions asked by the honourable member. to the Postmaster-General. Is he in a position to inform me of the progress that has been made on the installation of an automatic telephone exchange at Mudgee, New South Wales? Can he say when the cut-over from the manual system to automatic working will take place? the honourable member for Lawson has inquired as to the progress of this important work in his area. Some time ago I advised bim that we hoped to cut over before Christmas. I regret to say that a delay has occurred in the provision of the equipment required to bring this exchange into operation and it will not now be possible to effect the cut-over before Christmas. Nevertheless I anticipate that the cut-over will take place early in the New Year. I am sorry that I cannot give a definite date. Prime Minister whether he recalled having said in March, 1956, that the Commonwealth lacked adequate machinery powers to deal with certain major economic problems, particularly inflation. The right honourable gentleman replied that he could not be expected to remember what he said in 1956. That, of course, was not an unreasonable observation. Mr Harold Holt -D o you remember what you said in the past about defence? that I have ever said on defence. I do not wriggle like the Treasurer. I will deal with the Treasurer in the appropriate place.

19,Sir Robert Menzies,"The matterMinister for Shipping and Transport. I refer to the very welcome announcement that tenders are to be called for the construction in Australia of two very large bulk-carrying ships, each of 47,000 tons, which will provide a very large volume of work for our shipbuilding industry and which will be available for the carriage of overseas cargoes. Will these ships embody the latest features of automation developed overseas, which reduce very substantially the running costs of such vessels? If so, will this tend to remove some of the excessive crew costs and exaggerated manning requirements which hitherto have dogged our shipping industry and prevented us from becoming a successful maritime nation? there have been developments concerning automation and automatic devices in ships -particularl y in Europe, the United States of America and the United Kingdom-and it has been evident that we must keep an eye on those developments. Fortunately, just recently the chairman of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, Captain J. P. Williams, and the deputy chairman, went abroad to study these developments. The honourable member can be assured that what they saw overseas will be borne in mind when ships are being constructed for the Australian National Line. The reduced manning possible in overseas vessels as the result of the use of automatic devices has given those ships an advantage over vessels constructed here in earlier years. If our shipping is to remain on an economic basis, obviously these developments will have to be incorporated. Without wishing to engage in a discussion of the very detrimental effects of the tactics of the Seamen's so as to protect Western Australia against Union in other years, one can say that undoubtedly these automatic developments will call for smaller crews and therefore there will be a better opportunity for Australian ships to obtain charters for voyages overseas in competition with other ships. Minister is supplementary to that asked by the States is in proportion to their populathe honourable member for Franklin. Was tions, some States must lose seats. ' That the existence of large deposits of iron ore in the region of the Savage River on the west coast of Tasmania one of the reasons why the Commonwealth decided to provide financial assistance for the construction of an access road to the west coast? If so, does the Government intend to provide assistance in the future to develop these iron ore deposits, having regard to their undoubted importance to the economy of Tasmania and to our balance-of-payments position? of this kind are accompanied by such information as is available. They then receive a great deal of study by the Commonwealth's own authorities. The proposition that the honourable member has in mind no doubt will receive careful study. He will forgive me if I do not try to make some anticipatory judgment of the ultimate decision. In the case to which I referred a great number of details were put forward by the Government of Tasmania. We examined the case very closely for quite a lengthy period and arrived at the decision that I indicated earlier. I am sure the honourable member welcomes that decision. the Minister for the Interior. Is it a fact that Western Australia, which comprises one-third of the total area of Australia, is represented in this House by only nine members? Is it correct to state that the redistribution proposals which he introduced into this Parliament recently would have reduced Western Australian representation from the present inadequate nine members to only eight? Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation to amend the Representation Act the loss of a seat in any future redistribution? If so, will he introduce such amending legislation before the House of Representatives is dissolved for the forthcoming election? that a formula is laid down in the Constitution and in the Representation Act which provides that in certain circum-",14,Australian Institute Of Aboriginal Studies

In view of thc Prime Minister's reply to a question by the honourable member for Kingston last Thursday to the effect that the Government is fully aware of thc position in West Irian, can he now state whether these allegations are groundless or factual? Sir JtOBERT MENZIES I cannot positively, but I share with the honourable member a belief that considerable pressure is probably being put on a number of people in what is now called West Irian. We have no illusions about these things; what we can do about them is a different matter. addressed to the Treasurer.

Can the Treasurer advise the House of the latest trends in bousing? to see the highly favorable comments which appeared in this authoritative English journal. responsible economic and other publications are, I think, indicative of the regard in which Australia is held at the present time around the world. It was a little unfortunate from our point of vicw that the period covered by the ""Times"" review ended, I think, about Ihe end of June; because the economic indicators since that time have revealed a very much more buoyant state of tbe economy, including the housing aspect of it, than was apparent at that earlier time. Housing approvals for the three months ended last August showed a sharp increase over those for the comparable three months of the previous year. Housing loans from financial institutions for the three months ended last July shewed an increase of £32,000,000. This represented an increase of 60 per cent, in total amount and an increase of 49 per cent, in the number of loans. The total value of building approvals for the three months ended last August, £194,000,000, was an all-time recordfigurefor this country. So the honourable gentleman will perceive that housing activity is now proceeding at a high rate. Indeed, our resources of man-power in the building trade are fully engaged. I would just like to add, while replying to this question, three other pointers which confirm thc very healthy trend towards sound progress to which the ""Times"" referred. Unemployment, which was given as 1.8 per cent, of the work force in the ""Times"" review, is now down to 1.4 per cent., on the basis of numbers registered for employment. The price stability to which tribute was paid has been confirmed byfiguresfor the September quarter, which showed a rise of only one-fifth of 1 per cent, in the quarter. Motor car registrations for the -September quarter were 19 per cent, higher than in the record September quarter of last year. All this reveals, I suggest, very healthy progress in the Australian economy. Minister for Shipping and Transport a question. Why does this Government speak with two voices about the likely success or otherwise of an Australian overseas shipping line?

The announcement was that these 47,000-ton vessels are to be built for the Australian coastal trade, but that they would be built in such a way that they could be engaged in the overseas trade because they could be run more economically as a result of automation and the automatic devices that would go into them. That is just a possibility. They are not to be built definitely for the overseas trade at all. That is in the background. It could be done if it were found possible to do it. addressed to the Postmaster-General. Is it a fact that the practice of setting aside annual amounts in order to spread evenly the effect of stock losses through fire at main Postmaster-General's stores has been discontinued? Was the balance of the provision which has been absorbed in accumulated profits, namely £506,000, considered to be inadequate or unnecessary? Why was this change in the commercial accounts considered to be advisable? in the statement on the commercial accounts awaiting some final Treasury instructions. of the Post Office, which I tabled yesterday.

The result can be seen in the fact that in the last ten years it has been necessary to charge against this item only a little more than £4,000.

I believe that sometimes when this group of estimates is being considered the importance of this organization fails to attract the attention and public interest that it merits. The interim report of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner for 1962-63, particularly, as well as previous annual reports, has set a pattern in providing, on a very high plane indeed, the answer to Australia's transportation problems. We should first of all remember that the Commonwealth Railways undertaking is not a railway undertaking in the ordinary sense.

The lines ing the east with the west, 822 miles of line from Port Augusta to Alice Springs and 316 miles of track from Darwin to Birdum. I suppose that in South Australia there is no general appreciation that in the financial year 1962-63 electric power in that State was made cheaper by tbe capacity of the Commonwealth Railways to transport coal between the Leigh Creek coal-field and the power stations in Adelaide as required over a standard gauge line at low freight cost. The interim report shows that in 1962-63 almost 1,500,000 tons of coal were hauled in this traffic. It will be remembered, of course, that, in the early stages, the transways employees in the whole of the system, port of coal over this line by the Commonwealth Railways was subsidized by this Parliament. But, some years ago, the subsidy . was withdrawn. However, there was no increase in the freight charges on' the coal carried, and the South Australian community as a whole enjoys a low freight charge on coal used in the generation of power that is not enjoyed by any other section of the Australian community. The interim report of the Commonlocomotion. wealth Railways Commissioner for the handled 827,000,000 gross ton miles, the financial year 1962-63, reporting the cost of loco power was £936,000.

Any one who looks at the structure of the Commonwealth Railways and at the improvements accomplished since dieselization was adopted, must realize that in the last decade we have neglected a great potential for our future development and it still lies untouched. The Commonwealth Railways adopted dieselization in 1951. In that year, thc undertaking employed 2,550 persons. In 1961, a decade later, there were 2,739 employed, an increase of a mere 180 raillf we want to ascertain the economic value of a rail system, we look at the gross ton miles. The figure for gross ton miles in 1951 was 827,000,000 and in 1961, 1,984,000,000. In other words, the productivity of this rail service increased two and one-half times in ten years for an increase of man-power of a mere 180. While we are thinking in terms of production, let us compare the cost of diesel-electric locomotion with the cost of steam In 1951, when the system Labour is very proud of the activities of at that time most praise came to the Labour 17th October, 1917, and the first passengerfi aancial advantage it would be if we took train across the line ran five days later.

They allege that this action has been taken with the approval of the Public Service Board and that the award was irregularly substituted for the log of claims that was lodged earlier in this months earlier than is now estimated. I regard. The persons concerned request that the determination be disallowed and returned to the Public Service Arbitrator for target dates can be brought forward. further consideration. Because they stress the urgency of the matter, believing that the matter is at present being considered by the Public Service Board, I ask that their request be given consideration. The next matter to which I refer concerns early in 1964. The Minister has advised outstanding telephone applications. Some time ago I wrote to the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) about this matter and the honourable gentlemen was good enough to reply in detail regarding proposed work and future planning for telephone services. In many respects the information supplied to me is very pleasing and I wish to express my appreciation not only of the detail of the reply but also of the work that has been done in my widespread electorate. I realize that the dates of completion as supplied to me concerning the various projects are tentative and may be subject to alteration. I am aware that the unusual weather that we have experienced in the past sue months in my district would have disrupted the department's timetable. I think we had more than our average annua] rainfall for the year by 31st March. This is one of the difficulties with which the Postmaster-General's Department has to contend. As an example of some of the pleasing factors in the information supplied to me I direct attention to the fact that at The Entrance, which is a fast growing area, there are no deferred applications. At Buff Point, 29 applications are outstanding. I am informed that the cable relief required in connection with the Buff Point exchange is expected to be in place by March, 1964, and that the manual exchange will be replaced during 1963-64 by an automatic exchange. That is an example of thc work that is going on in the district. tion has been experimentally transmitting At Gosford, 306 applications are outmodulation system with a view to permastanding. The major cable relief necessary nently spreading stereo-radio over Britain. should be completed by March, 1964. The exchange capacity will be extended by 300 lines in 1963-64.

In tbe Hornsby exchange area 551 applications are outstanding. Tbe Minister has advised that 50 services will be connected by November, 1963, and that 98 applications will be met also that 403 applications in the Hornsby North to Mount Kuring-gai area will not be met until late in 1964. I would like more definite information about these matters. I am informed that this work was to have been completed twelve months earlier than is now scheduled. I would be grateful if the Minister once again would investigate the position in relation to Hornsby to see whether the services required in that exchange area can be provided at an earlier date than is scheduled. On a number of occasions in tbe last two years I have referred to the need to restore frequency modulation broadcasting in Australia. I have discussed this matter with the Postmaster-General and with officers pf his department whom the honourable gentleman was good enough to ask to discuss the proposals with members of the Parliament who have been promoting the re-introduction of this service. SinceI last spoke on this subject. I have received a number of letters from various places in Australia and I propose to quote from two of those letters. One letter is from a former listener, but it is indicative of the. type of letters that I have received from, many people The second letter from which I will quote is the result of a request made to a delegation that waited on me tb put its submissions in writing. The first letter states that the British Broadcasting Corporastereophonic broadcasts on its frequency The letter states that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, having re-organized its amplitude modulation radio networks to provide a better service to listeners, has recognized that more people are listening to radio despite the introduction of television services. The letter continuesThe commission, however, despite its recognition of the need, has failed to play its part in pressing for the restoration of frequency modulation broadcasting, with its known superiority as a method of transmitting radio broadcasts. You appreciate therefore, that despite all the progress being made in broadcasting, which cannot be developed here unless members of Parliament are made aware of the true position, that the decision to abandon F.M. broadcasting was ill advised and disastrous. I therefore urge you to continue your efforts for the restoration of F.M. broadcasting. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that a conference be called by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and that officers of the Postmaster-General's Department and representatives organizations should be invited to attend. The second letter to which I refer says, in partThe problem is not yet solved, and has been recently highlighted by the Australian Broadcasting Commission's recent re-organization of programmes. It is clear that there is a need for a high fidelity noise-free channel in all capital cities the end of this term. He took over the and in country districts also. Tho Australian Broadcasting Commission has produced two separate programmes over the last 30 years and there is now so much programme material that a third programme is necessary. Thc transmission technique has been the same for the last 30 years and there are in Australia at present no transmissions of international standards. The A.B.C. uses the best studio equipment and highly skilled performers produce first-grade musical programmes and then is not responsible for the next link in the chain. The Postmaster-General's Department takes over and does its best with the techniques allowed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Unfortunately the listeners, who pay the licence fees, find that part of the programme is left behind and the great deal of realism and fidelity has vanished on the way. In Great Britain, where there are over 60 F.M. transmitters in operation further expansion and improvements aro taking place. The B.B.C. is experimenting with stereo F.M. and in the near future a decision will be made on the particular type of stereo F.M. which will be standard in the European area. At the International Audio Festival in May 1963 in London much interest was shown in a demonstration of equipment for stereo broadcasting and reception. In the USA. 300 of the 1,200 F.M. transmitters are now giving stereo programmes. In April 1964 in London the first B.B.C. television service in the U.H.F. band is due to commence and the total of 64 television stations in this band have'been allowed for. The deputation to which I referred, asked "" Why is Australia lagging in the development and usage of these frequencies? "" The letter continuesThe Postmaster-General has said there is no frequency space available in the V.H.F. band for broadcasting. If this be so, then what developmental work is at present being done by the control board towards the employment of F.M. in the ultra high frequency band? As far as is known Australia is the only country to have planned on using the U.H.F. band for this purpose. As this may involve new techniques and these may take some months to evaluate, would the Postmaster-General consider using the A.B.C.'s television sound transmitters for multiplexing a separate F.M. audio programme? This would provide a temporary service or services without prejudice to the existing television programmes. The only thing I wish to add is that there has been increasing support for the reintroduction of this service and I believe a conference such as I have suggested would be of great assistance in seeing whether this of interested outside service can be restored to Australian listeners. This is the last occasion upon which the present Postmaster-General will be sitting at the table during a discussion of these estimates, because he has informed us that he intends to retire from the Parliament at portfolio of Postmaster-General in January, 1956, and so he has presided over this department during a time of great development and many difficulties and problems, including the development of television in Australia. BeforeI close I would like to be one of those who express great appreciation to the Postmaster-General for the work that he has done on our behalf. I know his job has been a very difficult one. It is curious that when people are developing or establishing new industries they make sure that they have such services as water, power, and roads, but seldom look to see whether there is a telephone service available. When the industry is established they write to the Postmaster-General or to their local member and say that the lack of a telephone is ruining their business. This adds urgency to the problems that the Postmaster-General has to cope with. I would like to thank the honourable gentleman also for the manner in which he has co-operated with members of Farliament. His practice of immediately acknowledging the representations we send him, writing follow up letters telling us of the progress that is being made, and then notifying us of the final decision is appreciated. I thank him also for the personal friendship he has shown to honourable members of this House. I offer him our very good wishes in his retirement. honourable member for Robertson ( Mr for Parkes. I would welcome a battle with Dean) has spoken of the impending retirement of the Postmaster-General( Mr programmes. There is little difference of Davidson). From this side of the House we can support what he has said. My duty is to say, with pleasure, that the Postmasterjust cannot seem to force himself to be General, who is a personal friend of mine and a very fine man, has done a remarkable job. department and the problems he has faced have made his task much harder. That is all I need to say on that matter to-day, but because this Parliament will shortly go to the country, I would like the Minister to say something here and now on certain other subjects. Other honourable members will deal with the vexed question of telephones; I want to talk about television and to lay on the line something which should be said before this Parliament is dissolved. I realize that because the party which has been kind enough to make me its spokesman in regard to television, and because I have insisted that the Australian content of television should be enlarged, some people have an idea that I am plugging some sort of line. That is quite wrong. There is a basic duty for any government, of whatever colour, to see that a culture that is Australian to the fingertips is screened on television. Profits, hatred of me personally, or any other such consideration has nothing to do with the case. It is thc duty of honourable members of this House to see that this, the greatest medium of diffusion of ideas, entertainment and knowledge, provides programmes that are evenly balanced with an Australian content reflecting the Australian concept of life. overseas. This problem was faced by the That is not being done at the moment. It is not being done because, commercially, it is easier not to do it. If the commercial stationsI make no differentiation between one or the other-woul d not attack members of this House on the issue the position would be belter. Recently the ""Sunday Telegraph "" ran a full page of derogatory reference to me, personally, because of my advocacy of Australian television programmes. We have the staff, tbe writers, the talent and the desire to produce Australian programmes, but too few are being produced. I am being pursued in my electorate by a man whose name escapes mc but who is alleged to be Packers' pea him on the issue of Australian television opinion between the Government and the Opposition on this issue, but the Minister tough enough with the licensees. Nevertheless we believe that his I am very hopeful that the long awaited report of the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television will be released before this House is finally dissolved, because I am sure that the committee has come to many worthwhile conclusions. I hope lhat it has come to conclusions which we all have come to and that some of my conclusions will be embodied in the report. The committee has conducted a most painstaking and exhaustive inquiry and is now being pressed a little to make its final report available before the House of Representatives is dissolved. I am sure that we will obtain some guidance in this matter before this House goes into the limbo of forgotten things. Thc point I make in regard to Australian television content is that although we do not have the answer in this country to all kinds of entertainment problems, we should not accept that we have no answers to any of the problems, that we have nothing to sell, that we have no kind of humour to portray and that we have no kind of drama with which to entertain the world, l f television is a mechanical kind of theatre in this mechanical kind of world, ""where is our place in it? Australia has been squeezed out because it is cheaper to buy programmes Americans, who are a much more logical people than we are and can stand up to criticism and like it. Let no one say that I am speaking in this way only because I want jobs for members of Actors Equity and for certain other reasons. The Americans had a solemn and steady look at why",22,Appropriation Bill 1963 64
53,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.42],"Th etelevision programmes in the early dayswe were not as good as they should have been. It is well worth repeating what was said by Mr Newton Minnow, chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission. Mr Minnow did not mince matters. Addressing the National Association of Broadcasters Convention, he said that if a man were game enough to sit at his television set from daylight to dark he would secA vast wasteland, a procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials many screaming, cajoling and offending. And, most of all, boredom. Is not that the -position with television today? Mr Jeff Bate -You keep at it all the time. This is boredom. you until you do something about it. All you do is sit in your place and think about fat cattle. According to "" Time"" magazine of 19th May, 1961, Mr Minnow commented that you have to look at the rackets surrounding television. station licensees say: "" Tbis is a good show. Think of its rating. We have examined the rating that it has received."" Mr defeated because the television stations are Minnow states that a rating is only a collection of data culled over the telephone by some organization which gets paid to come up with the right answer. Mr Minnow statedThere is some doubt as to what the public wants and ratings are at best only an indication of how many people saw vvhat you gave them . . . I am not convinced that the people's taste is as low as some people assume. It is nc good television licensees saying that any show must be good because the people watch it. The fact is that the people have no alternative. They have to make the best of what is offered to them. Mr Minnow continuedIf people would more often prefer to be entertained than stimulated or informed your obligationsHe was referring to television station licenseesarc not satisfied if you look only to popularity . . . it is not enough to cater to the nation's whims-yo u must also serve the nation's needs. That is why the Government grants teleare still in the early daysvision licences. It is not enough to make profits and to show muck on television. The stations must do something better than that if we are to have a national television service of which we can be proud. Mr Minnow then went on to sayThe people own the air. Thcy own it as much in prime evening as they do at six o'clock Sunday morning. For every hour that the people give you, you owe them something. I intend to see that your debt is paid with service . . . never have so few owed so much to so many. I would like the Minister, as a final act before retiring, to make the licensees realize that they owe a debt to the viewer and to see that the debt is paid to the viewer, who makes television possible and who has made the industry what it is. They invade the sanctity of the home with the box in the corner, so they must provide some entertainment which has an Australian content. Actors' Equity has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. Too many of its 3,000 members are out of work. ThcyI will continue to bore have been squeezed out of radio and out of television, if they were ever in television. The Minister imposed a quota of Australian content. Last year he said that 40 per cent, of programmes must be Australian. Next year the Australian content will be up to Some 45 per cent, and I suppose the following year it will be 50 per cent. He is right on the ball but his objective is being putting on cooking demonstrations and news and weather bulletins to make up the Australian content. What we want in Australian television is Australian drama, with Australian artists. Even our great artists who have made names for themselves overseas have been crowded out. We are not complaining about the Australian documentary. I saw one on Channel9 the other night called "" Spotlight on Indonesia"". It was a magnificent effort. I am not given to praise lightly. Some of our documentaries are not worthy of praise but "" Spotlight on Indonesia"" was excellent. There was also a magnificent film of the Bolshoi Ballet. No one in his senses believes that there should be nothing but Australian programmes. There must be a balance of art. When an Australian programme is good, it must be shown on Australian television. We are complaining because there is too much muck now and no place for good Australian drama.",25,Appropriation Bill 1963 64
54,. Mr Haylen,"The licensees claim that Australian programmes are not good enough and not technically up to standard. That is rubbish. All they have to do is to provide the money for the scenery and equipment. Australian photography in television is the best in the world. It isflawless;it is peerless because of good lighting and magnificent technicians. Do you mean to tell me that we cannot follow on and get script writers and playwrights to supplement the technicians? That is not to be thought of in a country like Australia. The fact is that commercial pressure is applied and it is claimed that it would cost a good deal of money to present Australian plays. There must be an Australian standard. It must not be on the sweated labour level nor on the basic wage level. It will cost plenty to produce good Australian plays. If the industry cannot stand the expense unaided, let us remember how many industries we subsidize. Let us remember the range of primary and secondary industries which are subsidized. The Government has .made no move in any direction except to present voluminous reports which contain mostly statistics that prove nothing. Wc have television, which could be a great educative force in the comthat the report of the Senate select commitmunity. When do we intend to use it to do what every other nation does-to sell our story to thc world? The Americans have their story; the Asians have their story. Various propaganda agencies circulate their stories throughout the world through the medium of good, bad and indifferent plays, but we have no voice. We are satisfied with a second-hand coverage because that is cheaper. The claim that good programmes are so costly that we have to buy them where we can is no longer valid, because all television companies are now making very handsome pronts. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), quite unfairly, said that I bored him by pressing this matter. But he is a good Australian and he knows that we must press on. You have no vitality left if you have no concern for your own country and its destiny. The only way to arouse that concern is through the institution of Parliament, the institution of democracy and thc institution of letters. Men put their ideas on paper and those ideas are then turned into plays and films for entertainment, propaganda, education and culture. If the Government vacates that field, it should not licence television sets. This is a question of the responsibility of governments on the educational side of this great mass medium. Every one recoils from tbe word "" education"" but there are different kinds of education. There is a bad influence on education-the television quickies-and there is a good influence on educationdecent drama. Then we come to the economic side of the question. How can we develop in Australia a great writer class such as exists in Great Britain? The British are the most literate race in the world. They have ennobled and enlightened the world with their stories. They are as competent to produce an ordinary television script as they are to produce a great play. We in Australia have the same tradition, and I resent and reject entirely the suggestion that we cannot do a good enough job without the expenditure of a great deal of money and a great deal of sweat. The point is that while you can get cheap and nasty things, little things, trilling things, without having a quota to protect Australians you will achieve nothing. I hope tee will give us some guidance in this matter. I am confident that the groups on both sides of the Parliament who are working together on this subject are earnestly trying to devise a formula that will result in better television programmes. This is not a hate session directed against anybody who has a television station or licence. It is an attempt to ensure an Australian culture that we should be proud of, by means of our greatest educative force, the television screen. I join in paying a tribute to thc Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson). His term of office in this honourable Parliament is drawing to a close, and I say in all sincerity that while he has been administering his portfolio he has done a remarkable job for the Postmaster-General's Department. During his term of office many reforms have been introduced, and I shall refer to just a few of them. Television is one of the great services that have been put on the map in Australia since the Postmaster General has been in office. He has been",26,Appropriation Bill 1963 64
55,Mr Brimblecombe (Maranoa) [4.6].,"responsible also for the introduction of the extended local service areas system and for other reforms. Some of them had a ralher stormy introduction, but the people have come to realize that they have been of great advantage and benefit to the whole community. The Minister is a member of my party, and we certainly will miss him. I wish him all the best in his retirement from politics and from the Postmaster-General's Department. NowI would like to say a few words pelled to close, through no fault of the subabout that department, and I may be a little scribers themselves.

Subject to this section, the Commission or a licensee, as ihc case may be, shall retain in its areas, do not use their telephones just for or his custody a record of matter made in purthe purpose of having conversations. The suance of the last preceding sub-section for a charges are very high, and subscribers have period of six weeks from the date on which the to be careful to use their telephones for matter was broadcast or televised or for such longer period as the Minister, in special circumspecific business reasons only. stances, directs. The commission or the licensee must make a recording of ths matter broadcast and must retain it for six weeks, for tbe purpose, in my view, of having it available as evidence against the commission or the licensee if the person making the broadcast departs from his script and broadcasts objectionable matter. If this happens, the licensee is held responsible, not the person who makes the broadcast. I do not think this is fair to the licensee, l f a person, whether he be a politician or anybody else, presents a script and says, ""That is what I want to talk about"", and then departs from the script and makes an objectionable statement over the air, he should be held responsible and any penalty decided upon should be imposed on him, not on the licensee. I think the committee would agree with me in this regard, and would agree that the licensee should be able to compel the person who intends to make a broadcast to sign a statement to the effect that he will accept responsibility if he departs from his script. The Postmaster-General has only a short time left in bis portfolio, and I appeal to him to give these people a break. I also want to make a brief reference to the position of subscribers to certain country telephone exchanges which may be comto retain communication with the rest of the areas, where many exchanges are nonbut now it is an absolute necessity. People in the country, particularly in the far western have to wait three or four years for a telephone service. about people waiting three or four years. I put it to him that if some city subscribers would pull their weight and assist the Postmaster-General's Department as people in the country do, they would be better off. In many cases people in my area have said to the department-and the department has accepted the offers in most cases"" We will give our own labour free in erecting a line. We will supply poles and we will do certain work without any charge to the department."" That is what is done in the country. Country people should not be criticized in this connection. They arc prepared to make a community effort to help the country",27,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

It is my ment that an application had been considered opinion that the Australian made by the Newcastle Broadcasting Broadcasting Control Board, in its early and Television Corporation Limited to deliberations on television services for New the Minister for approval to sell a large South Wales, did not give the people of parcel of its shares. With matching speed, Newcastle a second thought. Proof of that the Minister gave his approval to the sale can be found in paragraph 113 of the 1960 and at the same time sought to explain away report of the board, in which are listed the his reasons for doing so. I believe that if populations of the twelve principal country the Minister had known of some of the cities and of Perth and Hobart.

The Minister's approval of the transfer has completely negated the high principles he referred to in It therefore appears to me that we should be more assistance to the board if we outrespect, a tremendous responsibility rests",29,Appropriation Bill 1963 64
59,Mr Griffiths,"We will tell you whooutcome of this inquiry will be tantamount to a charter of development for the television medium in this State. Mr Lamb referred to great principles and complained about other applicant companies who were concerned only about the profits likely to be gained from obtaining the licence. As an indication that he intended to keep the licence, if granted to him, he said to the board. . . medium in this country will be served best by keeping the surrounding circumstances of that further development fluid and by declining to accede to the submissions of those companies which have already secured for themselves a powerful vested interest in the industry and who desire now to expand their own profit potential by closing the doors to other entrants into that medium, except those under their control or undue influence. Is it any wonder, Mr Chairman, that thc licence was granted to the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation Limited? In my view, the recent sale of shares by the company calls for the widest possible investigation. Not only have large parcels of shares been sold within seventeen months of the granting of the licence, but the personnel and management have been changed. No one can deny that those in the know in station NBN3 have made huge profits from the licence granted less than two years ago. The company's prospectus showed that 1,500,000 10s. shares were issued. The Lamb family held at least 33-J per cent, of thc total allocation. Thc United Broadcasting Company Proprietary Limited was allotted 618,000 shares, 2UE Broadcasting Station, Sydney, was allotted 67,200 shares and the Workers' Cash Order and Finance Company Limited was allotted 55,000 shares, making a total of 740,200 shares held by three companies in which the Lamb family held the major interest. I understand that the balance of the shares was taken up by other organizations and the general public. The report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for 1962 revealed that the interest of the Lamb family in the station had by then grown to 50 per cent. I also understand that thc shares in the company had been paid up to 7s. 6d. each, which means that the United Broadcasting Company Pioprietary Limited made 100 per cent, profit on its investment in a period of about two years-o r about £300,000. Yet the Minister can see nothing wrong in the transaction to which I refer. The installation of television sets in Newcastle has cost considerably more than the installation of an equivalent number of sets in Sydney. Additional expense has been involved in the installation of antennae in an attempt to get good reception from Sydney stations. I ask the Minister to give consideration to the granting of a second it is our firm belief that the television commercial television licence for Newcastle. able member's time has expired. would like to join with those people who have paid graceful tributes to the Postmaster General( Mr Davidson). I think that everybody in the Parliament can bear witness to his complete and transparent honesty in anything he has done. I think that we can also agree that he has had a very heavy burden to carry as the Minister in charge of thc administration of the Postmaster General's Department. It is a very big department. He bas had to handle Australia's initiation to the television era. MrL . R. Johnson -What do you mean by "" transparent"" honesty? mean honesty that is as clear as the best glass you can buy. Honesty is clearly apparent in anything he does. I am not the first one to use that phrase. I have borrowed it from somebody else; and I do not think any honourable member should sneer at what I am saying, because this tribute is rightly due to the Minister. He has taken a heavy load and has carried it to the best of his ability. Above all, he has done his duty with complete honesty. I substitute the word "" complete "" for the word "" transparent ""; nobody has ever impugned his honesty and his intention to endeavour at all times to do a good job. The honourable member for Shortland has directed attention to what has happened at Newcastle. I am moved to say something about the Wollongong area. against the Minister personally. nobody would think of doing so.

64,Mr Jeff Bate,"Of course not, andcountry should be conducted free of monopoly control. This medium can have such a tremendous influence on people's minds. It was intended that there should be no monopoly control over the images and ideas that can flow to thc people not only by way of words, as they do over the radio and through speeches, but also through the eye which is really the most powerful of all entrances to the human mind. Television is something of immense importance to any country and I am confident that both the Parliament and the Minister have tried honestly to prevent the emergence of any monopoly in this sphere. But on the evidence adduced by the honourable member for Shortland, and on the evidence that I have, this undesirable thing has appeared in the community. I repeat that the intention of the Parliadid service. The railways are now operating ment and the Government was that nobody should control more than two stations, but, by a process of altering articles of associaopportunity to pay tribute to the Minister tion and searching through the law with a view to discovering loopholes, there has emerged what I might call an association rather than a monopoly. This is an association of people who have endeavoured to get the best programmes they can at immense expense. Tbey pay as much as £60 customs duty in respect of one-hour programmes. They have banded together to buy these programmes for resale to people who seek to use them in advertising campaigns. Here it is interesting to note that commercial television stations are financed entirely by income derived from advertising whilst the national stations are financed from revenue obtained through a licence which costs each viewer £5 a year. The Postmaster-General has had a tremendous task in front of him. He has applied certain conditions to thc licences granted to this powerful band of people. He has even had them taken to the High Court which has brought down decisions that were almost unbelievable to those who are seeking to discipline this group of firms. people who were delighted with the results I know, too, that the Postmaster-General would be prepared to continue to deal with this problem but for the fact that he has been advised to give up his strenuous position. We appreciate what he has done, cause the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and and we appreciate his courtesy. Here, I Airmen's Imperial League of Australia should like to emphasize that I appreciate took upon itself the task of proving that the the courtesy which has been extended to me by all officers of the Postal Department, l t is important that I receive such courtesy when I approach the department on behalf of the people whom I represent, and I thank all officers of the Postal Department for the treatment they have accorded me. An important business undertaking administered by the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) is also under review at the moment. I do not think that the people of Australia appreciate just how successful the Commonwealth Railways are I do not think they quite understand what those railways have done. They have gone through periods of great difficulty to achieve their present success. During the last war, the Trans-Australia Railway was of extreme importance and rendered splensuccessfully on the Leigh Creek run with diesel-electric locomotives, and I take this for Shipping and Transport and everybody connected with the Commonwealth Railways for the success that has been achieved. Let me revert to television and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I think most people would be impressed by the fact that our ace television interviewer, Michael Charlton, ran into trouble in Great Britain. Some of us admire this man's technical ability, but I think that he suffers from' something that a great many Australians suffer from due to our insularity. Our country is surrounded by great oceans and therefore we do not mix with the people of other countries in the way that the residents of Britain and Europe do. We are not cosmopolitan. Because we are insular, we develop a sort of smug, arrogance. So we find that Michael Charlton has been rebuked by people in Great Britain for his behaviour on some television programmes over there. In. Australia, a great many people were shocked when the programme "" Four Corners"" was televised. As the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) has said, the only achieved by that programme were the Communists. Obviously they would be delighted beCommunist organization was bad for Australia. It certainly has been bad for the Labour Party over the past few years, if I may say so, and the league, which represents men who were prepared to make physical sacrifices in defence of their country, was prepared to investigate the workings of the Communist organization in Australia after the war. In other words, the members of the league were prepared not only to defend Australia physically against her enemies but also to look at its enemies within. Because this organization dared to attack the Communist movement, this insulting programme, "" Four Corners "", was televised. I think one comment received by the honourable member for Isaacs from a Victorian sub-branch is worth repeating. It came, I think, from Mr Stan Veale, president of the Caulfield sub-branch, and readsWe wish you to protest at the earliest opporto fight"". This is typical of the conduct tunity against ihe method used to portray the RSL. Four Coiners sessions. . . . This club was tricked into making its premises and personnel available and is greatly distressed at the himself above the distinguished person that distorted and untrue presentation that was shown to the public. Any action you may take to refute this slander will be greatly appreciated. In this programme, something happened which happens quite frequently in interviews with members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's staff, whether in connection with radio or television programmes. When the acting president of the Returned Servicemen's League was asked what he had to say, he was bullied and intimidated by the interviewer, who wanted him to say things that be was not prepared to say. The point I am making is that Australian interviewers ought to do a little thinking about themselves. To say that the programmes they produce are controversial is no excuse for being rude and brash and causing acute distress to viewers of the programmes and to the people being interviewed. On one occasion I saw a woman named Winifred Atwell being interviewed by a panel on television. Winifred Atwell is a graceful woman and a talented artist. The people who were interviewing her kept asking her, "" Miss Atwell, do you find that because you are a negress you are treated badly in our hotels? "" She looked surprised and a little hurt, and she said, "" No, I have not experienced that at all"". In fact, these people were reminding her that she was a negress. This type of interrogation went on for so long that everybody watching the programme was embarrassed. I mention that as an example of the type of thing that happens on television and radio programmes in Australia. Australians can be arrogant and brasb. Thcy can also be rude and then seek to defend themselves by saying that the programme they are producing is controversial, that it has created a lot of interest. That is no way to deal with people. It. is no wonder that Australians run into trouble when they conduct themselves in that way. For instance, when our troops went to the Middle East the first thing they did was to put down their packs and then say to the British troops who were leading them and who were taking them to their quarters, "" Come on, I am an Australian; we are going of interviewers who interview visitors from overseas. The interviewer chooses to put he is interviewing. It is about time the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial stations had a careful look at this problem of the bad manners of interviewers when interviewing people. The cause of the trouble over the "" Four Corners"" programme on the Returned Servicemen's League was, not bad politics, but bad manners and the brash way in which the interview with Sir Raymond Huish, the acting president of the league, was conducted. But the Communist editor was given a free go. In that instance, thc objective of the "" Four Corners"" programme was twisted. only a Chesterfield, himself! language the honourable member is using. I know that he attempted to say something, but I could not work it out. The sort of conduct that I have been discussing has gone far enough, Mr Chairman. Australian radio and television interviewers should behave as if they were seated in the living rooms of the people who see or hear the programmes. The interviewers should behave politely and gracefully. Courtesy never hurt anybody.",32,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

The greatest damage that could be done to any person would be for the honourable member to support that person in public. That would really hurt. Interviewers should behave decently when they are interviewing people on television or radio programmes. interviewers learned to conduct their interbelieve that it is important for this Parliaviews decently, we would indeed have interviews of which we could be proud. There are many things in Australian television of which we can be proud. I think that one honourable member said that we have flawless techniques and high standards of photography, lighting and other aspects of television in Australia. Nobody contests that. We have some brilliant technicians, not only in the commercial broadcasting and television services, but also in the Postmaster-General's Department. It may be a bit boring to hear some one say that Australians lead the world, but let us say at the unofficial agency for the expression of least that our technicians in the fields of radio and television are of a very high quality. However, let us see that better standards of behaviour are observed. In this respect, I am talking, not about announcers on national news sessions, but about brash, officious and rude interviewers who treat our distinguished guests so badly on television programmes before our eyes in our own homes. Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [4.49] Mr Chairman, the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), as I know from personal experience, is very sensitive about television programmes. Not' so long ago, he and I participated in a lengthy interview of, I think, something like three-quarters of an hour on one of the Wollongong television channels. I remember that on that occasion he was quite dissatisfied with some of thc treatment that he received. I know that the honourable member's standards in this regard are high. He believed that he should have had more make-up treatment and so on, as well as the benefit of special lighting. SoI am not surprised that he is critical of the interviewers whose activities he has discussed this afternoon. On the occasion of the television programme that I have mentioned, I was perfectly satisfied with the interviewer. IfI remember correctly-the honourable member may correct me if I am misrepresenting him-h e believed that he was not treated as he would have preferred to be treated. Be that as it may, Mr Chairman, I think that the honourable member has raised some very interesting matters this afternoon. I do not intend to discuss the Australian If the Broadcasting Commission at length, but I ment to take all possible steps to ensure that the commission maintains the highest possible standards. It broadcasts my favourite programmes. However, I have been given to understand in recent times that there appears to be some reliable evidence that the morale of members of the staff of the commission is below the peak at which it should be. There arc rumblings and rumours, some of which have been substantiated, that the news section of the commission, particularly in relation to foreign affairs, is becoming something like the Government's point of view. I know that all honourable members would like to believe that the commission, in all the various facets of its activities, is an uninhibited organization that is making a worthwhile contribution to the world of ideas, information and entertainment. With these considerations in mind, I want to make a few remarks about the commission, this afternoon. I want to make some brief comments also on telephone problems. I believe that there is a feeling that the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is tending to toe the line a little when pressure is put on him by the Government. if he knew Dr. Darling, would not say that. Mr L. R. JOHNSON I agree with Dr. Darling's observation, in the latest annual report of the commission, that this kind of pressure that I have mentioned should never be manifested and should never be effective in any way. I believe that, on occasions",34,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

Why has my question been deliberately avoided and why has the answer been kept until to-day? Interference of the kind that I have mentioned is a matter of concern to us. A number of questions about the Australian Broadcasting Commission need to be answered. As I have said, it is tremendously important that the personnel engaged in disseminating information about such important matters as world affairs and politics should have a real conviction that they will not be intimidated if they give a charged to the telephone section of the viewpoint contrary to that held or favoured by the Government. office, it will do the intimidating, as the Leader of the Opposition did a few years ago. Mr L. R. JOHNSONI do not think that comment justifies a serious answer. It is one of the old cliches that are bandied about in a pre-election period. I think in this pre-election period it is probably more that amounts to about £20,000,000 a year, important for me to emphasize the Government's shortcomings on matters under the administration of the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson). He has been a good Minister and I wish him well on bis departure from the Parliament. I want to refer to the fairly arrogant attitude of the Government on the subject of obtain telephones, instead of being put into outstanding telephone applications. Lack of telephones has a vital bearing on the business life of our community, on our capacity to trade overseas and on many other important aspects of the Australian way of life. At 30th June, 1962-unfortunately, I have no later information available to me in thc form of a report-ther e were 78,836 applications for telephones outstanding. Many people have been waiting for long periods for a telephone. In my own miles from the Sydney General Post Office, more than 1.000 people are waiting for teleinterest docs not come back. It goes into phones, and I know that some of them have been waiting for four or five years. Some are people who suffer from illness. Others are small businessmen, but large businesses, with a capital investment of £250,000 or £500,000, are also waiting for telephones. The fact that telephones cannot be obtained by applicants such as these is a matter for alarm. Recently, the proprietor of a business contended to me that the lack of telephones was impeding Australia's export drive. He conducted an export industry, but he could not get a telephone to enable him to carry on his work. I do not know where the primary responsibility for this state of affairs lies. Perhaps thc public sector of the economy is too small and should be expanded. However, one factor that does give me concern is that last year interest amounting to £19,900,000 was Postmaster-General's Department. This must seriously impede efforts to provide telephones for those who need them. Interest on all services of the Postmaster General's Department amount to £21,100,000. A peculiar situation obtains here. Since about 1901, the Postmaster General's Department has been gathering all kinds of assets, in the form of white-anted old telegraph posts, worn-out telephone exchanges and old post office buildings. All these assets are subject to an interest charge and this is quite beyond comprehension. The assets of the Postmaster-General's Department are now valued at about £505,000,000, and interest is charged on this amount. I believe that the £19,900,000 charged to the telephone section as interest could well be used to meet the needs of a very large section of Australians who cannot Consolidated Revenue. back. Mr L. R.

79,Mr Barnes,"Thank you. This is ancommission is playing an increasingly important role in preserving our way of life. We must preserve our democracy. After all, this Parliament depends on the considered vote of each individual; and if a person is to exercise a considered vote he must be well informed. I do not think our ordinary information services are adequate to enable a man to form a considered opinion. But thank goodness we have the news services and other information services of the A.B.C, which is completely independent and completely unbiased. The commission's news and other information services are not slanted in any way. People to-day can be better informed by listening to the commission's news services than by obtaining their information from other mediums, such as the newspapers. This is an unfortunate fact. Our newspapers are completely free and in a democracy they must remain free. I would like to join other honorab.'e. members in paying a tribute to the Postmaster-General, who will retire at the close of this Parliament. The Postmaster-General has carried out a very difficult task in prenote that about £1,027,000 was spent on siding over his department, wbich has grown into a very large and complex organization. No longer is it responsible only for the ordinary communications services, such as telegraphs, telephones and postal services, but it has also expanded into the fields of entertainment and information-broadcast ing and television. Perfection of these new services was reached after trial and error, although I do not think there was much error. The department no doubt experienced growing pains when it moved into the fields of information and entertainment. It is to the credit of the Postmaster-General that his department is held in high esteem by the average Australian. I think most Australians like to feel that the A.B.C. is prethey report the news. They have entree to serving the idea of Australia. This is somecircles in which other people are not always thing of which we can be proud. Anybody who has been overseas must have realized what a great place Australia is compared with other countries. Australians believe in fair play and an understanding of the views of others. I hope that this attitude will be preserved. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr should be sold to them at cut rates, but it Haylen) has often claimed that a larger proseems a shame not to make something out portion of Australian material should be of the news because it is possible for the used on television and radio. 1 thoroughly agree with him, but it would be fatal to compel television and broadcasting stations to use more Australian material. A few years ago, in order to encourage the Australian film industry we compelled theatres to use a certain percentage of Australian and British productions. The result was that some very poor Australian material was produced. It was so poor that it gave the Australian film industry a very bad name and the system was abandoned. I am afraid that the same thing would happen, if we compelled television and radio stations to use a certain percentage, of Australian, material. We must use other means to encourage the use of such material. Sub-, sidics for Australian productions may be the answer. I note from the report of the A.B.C. that total expenditure in 1962-63 amounted to more than £10,692,000. I think every Australian will agree that that money was well spent. 1 would like to see a greater amount spent by the commission because its expenditure ultimately benefits the community. I news services-o n salaries and the gathering of news. Revenue from the sale of news amounted to about £26,000. 1 understand that the commission sells some of its news' broadcasts to commercial stations. Obviously a large service has been built up. The commission's news service is equal' to and perhaps superior to the news services provided by newspapers. I think honourable members will agree that in relation to the recent disturbances in South Viet Nam the' most reliable news from the area was that which emanated from the A.B.C. I am informed by reliable sources that the prestige of the commission's correspondents and representatives in South-East Asia is of a very high order because of the way in which welcome. This is important. I think a greater amount of the commission's news services could be sold to newspapers which are not in a very favourable position financially.' Some of our country newspapers have difficulty making ends meet. I do not suggest that news commission to use only a fraction of its news. Obviously £1,000,000 will pay for a lot of news. It is a pity that more of the commission's news services cannot be made available to some of our smaller independent newspapers. Unfortunately, newspapers in this country are getting into the hands of only a few people. This is a serious matter. I would like to refer to the wide scope of the A.B.C. Not only does the commission provide news and entertainment; it also provides rural broadcasts. Any man on the land will join with mc in saying that its rural broadcasts are of the utmost value to people on the land. They are more valuable than any extension services that have been instituted in the past seven or eight years. I have profited from the commission's rural broadcasts, just as I am sure everybody on the land has profited. Thc man on the land may get from a rural broadcast ideas on how to improve the management of his farm or station. That is accepted by the rural people of Australia with a great deal of interest. We are very grateful for the high standards and thc talents of the officers in charge. Then there arc the women's sessions and sporting events and Radio Australia, which has great prestige all over the world. I conclude my remarks by again paying a tribute to the Postmaster-General for his very keen understanding, as a country man himself, of what is required in country areas. wish to deal specifically with thc lag in the provision of telephone services because my electorate, which throughout its various the cost of overcoming the lag in the prodistricts is expanding at a very great rate, is vision of telephone services throughout particularly affected by this problem.

This in 1962-63. lag is something into which we must search In other words, if the additional expendi tine in order to try to find the psychology which this year were increased by £5,500,000, to is behind it. It cannot be said that it is normal for a lag to exist, because it is important for us to remember that it is the duty of the Postmaster-General's Department to provide telephone services. This is not something whicb the department can do if it so wishes, but a duty. The department cannot claim, as it tries to claim at times, that all telephone services installed must be an economic proposition. The department has been given a monopoly of telephone services and must, in many instances, provide them in areas where tbey are not an economic proposition, the object being to assist development. That is common sense and it is the reason why the Postal Department has been given this monopoly. The department's job is to provide telephone services and it cannot at all times look at them from a purely economic viewpoint. It has a duty to the community as a whole. In reply to a letter from me the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) was good enough to supply me with figures relating to the number of outstanding applications for telephone services as at 30th June last-for which I thank him. At that time there were 19,547 outstanding applications in New South Wales and 11,337 in Victoria. That is a total, for those two States alone, of 30,884 out of the 36,635 applications outstanding throughout Australia, or approximately 84 per cent. I notice that Queensland, the Minister's own State, has only 2 per cent, of the total outstanding I also asked the Minister what would be Reduction of deferred applications to a practicneed to be expended in New South Wales and Victoria where 85 per cent, of the outstanding The amounts given are, of course, over and the £54,775,000 proposed for 1963-64 expenabout £10,000,000, in the ensuing year or",38,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

Considering the overall budget of nearly £55,000,000 for this department an increase of £5,500,000 would not be too high a price to pay to overcome the lag in the provision of telephone services which has continued for eighteen years. We accepted the lag in the provision of telephone services as an aftermath of the war. Everything, very rightly, had gone into the war effort and there had to be a tooling up and a movement forward after the war. But it is not right that, eighteen years after the end of the war, we should be still going along as we were in the immediate post-war j'ears. The provision of the extra amount I have mentioned would overcome the lag and all the problems associated with it, including the adverse effect it The Government's psychology is wrong. has on private individuals and on business men and businesses throughout our community. For that reason this is a matter which has to be examined.

Tbe allocation sheeted back to thc Treasury. We should of the additional funds would permit the look at the psychology of the present policy department to tool up and obtain the and ask what is the reason for continuing necessary staff to proceed with the work. the lag year after year. Is it the belief of the Treasury, the Treasurer, or the Government that starving this department of funds to overcome the shortage of telephones, will ensure efficiency? Is that the principle staff and equipment, particularly exchange behind the present position which is causing equipment. Thc shortage of exchange such hardship to so many thousands of equipment is one of the worse aspects of Australians? If that is the position, then let the present state of affairs. It is one of the Postmaster-General or the Treasurer the main bottlenecks. In my own electorate admit it so that we can have it out in the there are many areas in which extraordinary House and decide whether it is a correct delays have occurred.

The people there have to General himself, but to the Treasurer and depend upon one public telephone. Surely to Government policy. I do not think I am that in itself is an indictment of the very far wrong in my assessment of the basis department. of that psychology. The Government has advanced two arguments, first, that this is not an essential service, and secondly, that the starvation of funds improves efficiency. Apparently you can starve funds and improve efficiency but the fact that you also starve the population of telephone services does not seem to matter two hoots to the Government. A careful study of the figures shows that thc increased allocation shown in the estimates this year will not meet the greatly increased demand for telephone servicesa demand which, on the Minister's own admission, is rising at a great rate each month. This is further evidence of the Government's policy, apparent in every sphere of activity, of too little too late. It believes that it cannot overcome this lag of eighteen years' standing, so the best it will do is to try to prevent thc lag from becoming too large. There is little doubt that there is a need to allocate additional It is essential that we take positive action representative. Liberal Party who represented the electorate until 1961 was responsible for nothing being done. I have made representations to the department about this matter. Provision had not been made for this phase of the work in this year's estimates, but the estimates have now been amended to include it. The unfortunate position is that a Liberal member who previously represented thc electorate did nothing about telephone services. We should consider reducing the rental on telephones held by pensioners. This request is made regularly from all sections of the community. A telephone is essential for old people. They need it to contact their relatives in times of sickness and woe. Thc Government should give very serious and compassionate consideration to this proposal, because such a concession would be of great assistance to pensioners who, by and large, are not very well off and need telephones. Finally, I ask the Minister to consider seriously the allocation of the additional £5,500,000 that he stated would almost overcome the lag of eighteen years standing in the installation of telephones. If the Minister cannot wring the necessary shekels from the Treasurer, then the Treasurer and thc Government should state the reason to the committee. honourable member for Mitchell( Mr houses which have replaced the orchards.

They say, ""What definitely is being taken up. You might you have done we would have done if we look at the number of outstanding applicahad had the opportunity to do it "" . Because tions now and say that it is not very much what we did proved to be good, they claim that they would have done it. That claim makes no impact on the people. The honourable member said that in Victoria there are about 11,000 outstanding applications for telephones. About 1,000 of those applicants are in my electorate. That sounds a large number. For people who do not have a telephone, this is a matter of concern because their way of life has been interrupted. The people are entitled to easy and ready communication with friends and relatives. To those 1,000 people the lack of a telephone is a serious disadvantage, but it is fair to say that 570 of those 1,000 applications come from an area surrounding a single exchange building. Major works are in progress there which should be completed by June, 1964, when 570 services will be provided. On the face of it, the number of outstanding applications in my electorate then will be cut in half. But, of course, the number will not be cut in half because in the intervening period another 500 applications will have been lodged. I think I have virtually an endemic situation of something like 1,000 outstanding applications. This is not surprising because the number of voters in my electorate, in the eight years that I have represented it, has grown from 40,000 to 100,000. Formerly there were between 50 and 100 orchards in the electorate. They have now been transformed into thousands of houses. The old manual exchange that provided telephone facilities for 50 or 100 orchardists is now incapable of providing services for the occupants of the several thousands of 300,000 people. With a population like that, naturally great demands will be made",40,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

In those eight years about 640,000 houses have been constructed. In the conditions that apply toin the street and a few channels being day, the majority of people who go into a house have a telephone service very soon afterwards. This is the way it ought to be. A telephone service gives communication with those friends and relatives with whom it is important socially to keep in contact. It is also very important to many people .who find it necessary in their daily occupations to communicate with their customers or with those from whom they are purchasing. In the period in which I have been a member of this Parliament my experience has been quite different from that of the honourable member for Mitchell. It is true that he has been in the Parliament some two years while I have been here some eight years. Perhaps that extra experience has enabled me to realize that to get the best results from the department the most effective method is frequently to explain just how many people are waiting for a telephone through a particular exchange. I have tried to persuade the department of the strength of the case made out by the electors of Bruce. I have found this method remarkably successful'. I have had literally thousands of letters from people during the eight years in which I have been in this Parliament. I cannot say that I have not encouraged them; when they have mentioned a telephone problem to me I have said, "" Go ahead and write to me, and when I write to the Postmaster-GeneralI will very quickly let him know how many are waiting for this service "". I have had thousands of letters and I have had many petitions, signed by numbers of people ranging from ten or twenty to several hundreds. I do not think there is anything quite so persuasive in the case of the Postmaster-General as a petition signed by a great number of respectable people asking for a service to which they believe-and rightly believe-that they are entitled. It has also been my experience that that it is. It is very different. Section 65 people, or at any rate 99.9 per cent, of of the act, dealing with the powers and them, going into a brand new area, where functions of the commission, uses a very the furrows of the orchard are still visible, short formula in sub-section (1.)where the fruit trees have sometimes been left in the backyards, realize that there is no advertisements. magical formula, that you cannot flick a finger and have a telephone service tomorrow morning. But they are delighted when they see a P.M.G. work cart parked dug. I would like to take a minute or two to thank the Postmaster-General publicly. It is probably not correct to thank a political officer, but we all know that this is his last Parliament, and, indeed, his last sessional period of a long and distinguished career as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, and I would like to thank him for the co-operation and kindness that he has shown me throughout the years in which he has been Postmaster-General and 1 have been a member of the Parliament. I. also want to say that he has been particularly well served by the staff of the department. I do not think I should go any further than that, because I happen to be one of those old-fashioned people who believe that while you can appreciate public servants, you realize that they do their job because it is their duty, and a very fine and efficient public service the Commonwealth is fortunate enough to have. I want to spend a little time speaking of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is, as we all know, a statutory body, created by the Broadcasting and Television Act. The powers of the commission are to be found in section 59 and the following sections of the act, and it would not do any harm to refer very briefly to some of these provisions. Section 59, sub-section (1.), saysSubject to this Act, the Commission shall provide, ancl shall broadcast or televise from transmitting stations made available by the Postmaster-General, adequate and comprehensive programmes and shall take in the interest of the community all such measures as, in the opinion of the Commission, are conducive to the full development of suitable broadcasting and television programmes. There is a mandatory injunction on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. One might ask whether the commission is different from the commercial television licence holders. The answer is, of course, The Commission shall not broadcast or televise This makes it fundamentally different from the commercial television stations. By very definition it is different. Another major point of difference is that the funds for the commission come from the Government. However, there is a similarity between the commercial licence holders and the commission, in that both the licensee and the commission are subject to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in a manner set out in the Broadcasting and Television Act. The powers of the board are to be found in several sections. To indicate the type of power I refer particularly to section 16, sub-section (I.)The functions of the Board arc;(a) to ensure the provision of services by broadcasting stations and television stations in accordance with plans from time to jlime prepared by the Board and approved by the Minister. So the supervisory powers of the board extend to commercial television licensees just as they do to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Section 17 of the act provides for a means of transmitting orders from the board to the commission and to commercial television stations. Tn the public mind the commission is quite clearly different from the commercial licensees. There is a difference in programme selection, but one has not been able to notice any shortage of funds on the part of thc commission to buy an adequate selection of programmes. Something that worries me is thc possibility of the commission seeking to shut out commercial television stations from transmitting attractive programmes that they may have, by finding even more attractive programmes and putting them on at the same time as the commercial stations telecast their programmes, thus giving thc public a choice of watching one of two good programmes but removing the possibility of seeing them both. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -That happens now. happened. The ultimate possibility is that the commission should shut out certain commercial television programmes and virtually render their commercial competitors unable to compete. This could amount to nationalization by stealth. We know the attitude of the Labour Party to nationalization. The members of the Opposition say, "" We will not adopt nationalization because we cannot do it constitutionally"". But if tbey can find a way of doing it by stealth, then do it they will. I fear that this would be likely lo happen under a Labour government. It has not happened under this Government, because the Government has a policy to maintain the commercial stations and to maintain the commission. The commission is a public institution in a democracy, an institution just the same as the banking institutions and insurance institutions. It has in a very short time reached the eminence of an institution, and because it is an institution it demands the utmost responsibility in the exercise of its powers. It must, as an institution, be subject to criticism. The question is, firstly, one of government control, and usually the opponents of government control describe it as censorship. They manage to pull out examples of what thcy say is censorship and then contend that in relation to a matter such as that concerning the "" Four Corners"" programme the Australian Broadcasting Commission should not have been criticized. It should have been criticized in connection with that programme, because, being an institution in the community, it took upon itself the liberty of very trenchantly criticizing another institution in the community, the Returned Servicemen's League. I think it went beyond the area of responsibility that it could properly be allowed. Undoubtedly the public does not want thc Australian Broadcasting Commission, which controls such a sensitive and persuasive medium, to be so independent as to be removed entirely from the influence of Government control. able member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) did not put the position quite correctly. The Australian Broadcasting Commission does not deny that people have the right fo criticize. Everybody who works for the A.B.C. is aware that be is open to public criticism. I believe that there is some concern in the commission and its staff about the freedom of the individuals within the commission and the fact that pressure groups can make criticisms by back-door means. The honourable member for Bruce well knows that the criticism was not levelled at the A.B.C. In fact, top representatives",42,Appropriation Bill 1963 64

But they did not take the opportunity to protest to the A.B.C; they protested to the Prime Minister. We should get the facts about the criticism in their true perspective.

I want to refer to certain actions of the find out where the surplus had been hidden. Menzies Government, of which the Postmaster-General is a member.

This is a on mail and so on. The people, particularly those of the same political complexion as the Postmaster-General, reacted to the increased charges, and for the first time in in the New South Wales seat of Lismore. That election was fought on the issue of the increased postal charges. So, in effect, the present Minister for Lands in the New South Wales Government was brought into the New South Wales Parliament by the action of the federal Government in increasing Post Office charges. The Post Oflice surplus increased from £11,000,000 in 1959-60 to £23,000,000 in 1960-61. In 1961-62 it was £22,000,000. Until that time the Post Office surplus was always published in the national income and Treasurer each year. That is a very informative paper. The surplus of the Post Oifice was declared quite clearly in it. However, this year the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) determined that the Post Office surplus would not be shown in the national income and expenditure statement. The surplus is hidden in the Post Office accounts. We' received the financial report for the year ended 30th June, 1963, only yesterday, and we delved through it io I submit that the Post Office surplus The honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Armitage) said that the Post Office is dishonest sleight-of-hand action on thc part of the Government. It reveals the whole policy of the present Government. I wish to mention a statement that was made by the Postmaster-General white the Parliament was not in session. On 20th June, 1963, in a brief statement, he said that public telephone charges would be increased from 4d. to 6d -a n increase of 50 per cent -and that callers would not be able to use six pennies, but would bave to use a sixpenny coin. The argument is that this is necessary because of thc forthcoming introduction of the decimal currency system. Let us examine the effect of this extra charge. In 1962-63, 154,000,000 telephone calls were made from public telephones in suburban areas. The cost of a call is increased by 2d. Who pays this extra charge? It is paid by the mass of workers, not by the people with top incomes. People of high incomes rarely use public telephones. They are used by the wage plugs, tbe workers. An increase of 2d. in the cost of each of 154,000,000 telephone calls means an increase in the revenue of the Post Office of about £1,250,000 each year, yet the only statement made by the Postmaster General on this matter was a brief statement made outside the Parliament. He said, ""We will increase the cost of public telephone calls from 4d. to 6d."" I want to refer briefly, because my time is limited, to the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission for 1962-63. In this report the commission expresses concern at criticism by sections of the Australian press of government interference in its activities. The commission statedThe Commission is a statutory corporation with members appointed for fixed periods by the Governor General in Council. We know that the members are in fact appointed by the Government. I do not want to cast a slur on the members of the commission. It is very probable that some of them have a liberal outlook. However, 1 believe that political appointees usually hold views similar to those held by the political party by which they are appointed. raising the two matters which I wish to The report continuesWithin these statutory limits it is, we believe, General's Department, I would like to add the deliberate intention of Parliament to give the my tribute to the many well-deserved Commission independence in carrying out its tributes that have been paid to the Postresponsibilities. The facts about this independence seem to us to be not so generally and clearly master-General( Mr Davidson) this evening recognized as is desirable. The report goes on to say that the Minister has to accept certain criticisms, although under the act he is not in control of the commission. The report then statesIf the Commission is to fulfil its duty to the community of acting as a forum for free discussion of controversial matters, on which it is necessary that a democracy should be informed, it is impossible to avoid the causing of offence in some quarters. The honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) seems to object to the position as stated in that report. I say clearly and definitely that I believe that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be kept free from political interference. I think it is time that we had a complete overhaul of the position and took a new look at it. are in opposition. against me when we are in office. At present, the members of the staff of the commission are hired by the Commonwealth Public Service Board, which determines promotions and so on. The commission must be a really independent statutory body. It should be given money, not on a year-toyear basis, but on the basis of a plan covering a long period of time. I believe that the commission must be able to be critical. It should be constructive and objective. The commissioners can recognize destructive criticism, and any officer who tried to push his own barrow could soon be brought into line. The commission must be given more and more independence if we are to have an independent voice in this democracy. We all know that the press, radio and television in this country are under monopoly control. Thc only means by which the community can be enlightened objectively is through an independent Australian Broadcasting Commission, free of any pressure from outside including that of political parties.

92,Mr Forbes (Barker) [8.0],"Befor ein this debate, some of whom will not be in the next Parliament. My experience has been similar to that of all honourable members in that I have had nothing but courtesy, attention and genuine sympathy for the problems which I have put before him. I have found him very sympathetic to the problems of those people who are seeking services from his department in country areas. It is obvious that the Postmaster General understands the isolation of people who live in country districts for he does show a great deal of sympathy for them. I should like also to mention that I was a member of a delegation that went to South East Asia with the Postmaster-General recently and I was able to appreciate his capacity for leadership and the good job he did for Australia on that occasion. I pay tribute to him for that. Having said that, it makes me all the more sorry to have to raise two matters upon which I have not been able to see eye to eye with the Postmaster-General up to date. The first refers to a situation which is becoming increasingly frequent as the Government carries out its policy of converting manual telephone exchanges to automatic exchanges. It applies to the position in which people who are connected to a manual exchange by private lines find themselves when the exchange is converted to the automatic service. I can best illustrate the point I want to make by referring to an actual case. It relates to a group of six soldier settlers who were connected by party line to the manual exchange at Penola in the south-east of South Australia. They constructed their original party line twelve years ago almost entirely at their own expense at a time of shortage of materials and so on. When the service was converted to an automatic exchange, which was a wonderful thing for the area, these people were required to have individual sercontributing to the revenue of the departvices or, at the most a group of three party lines each carrying two subscribers. In this as in all cases when a service is converted from a manual to an automatic exchange, it was necessary to up-grade the line because ment might meet more of the cost. In fact, the automatic work requires a higher standard of line than does the service from a magneto exchange. These people found that if they wanted these people are not now connected to the to be connected to the new automatic exchange at Penola after the Postmaster General's Department had done the maximum amount of construction work permissible they would have to pay at least £200 each to be connected. I mention this case because it seems to me to be basically unfair and unjust. These people were perfectly happy with the existing situation. They did not ask for an exclusive service; nor did they ask for the exchange to be converted to an automatic one. They have been contributing consistently to the revenue of the Postmaster-General's Department for twelve years. In effect, what they are being told is that if they want to stay on the telephone at all they have got to find £200 or more before they will be connected. The difficulty is brought about by the fact that the department lays down a formula relating to the amount of departmental construction that may be done, and this is the point that I should like the Postmaster-General to examine. As most honourable members will know, this formula is applied universally all over the Commonwealth. It lays down the number of units of departmental construction that will be done for an individual subscriber or group of subscribers; and the amount that will be done is exactly the same in the circumstances which I have been describing as it is for new applicants for telephone services. This seems to me to be basically wrong. I believe that there should be a different formula. There may be some argument for limiting the amount of departmental construction for new services, but I do not believe that the department can justify applying the same formula to those subscribers who have been connected with an exchange for very many years, as these six soldier settlers have been. They were perfectly happy with the existing situation; they did not want the change, and they had been ment for many years. It is through no fault of theirs that these changes were made, and I believe that in circumstances such as these the Postmaster-General's DepartI suggest that the department should meet the whole of the cost of allowing these people to remain on the telephone. I should like to inform the Postmaster-General that telephone at all. At the moment, they have no telephone service after having been subscribers for twelve years. They just could not find the £200 required to connect them to the new service. I have mentioned these particular subscribers, but similar circumstances apply to many others whom I have mentioned to the Postmaster-General. There are variations of these problems. For torate because they had not obtained instance, some subscribers to the Marcollat exchange in the south-east of South Australia were told by the Postmaster-General's Department that their service would have to be moved from the exchange to which they were then connected to a new exchange in order that thc department might be able to give a service to some people who did not already have a phone. These older subscribers found themselves involved in considerable expense as a result of this move from one exchange to the other and again tbey were people who had spent a considerable sum in getting their original service. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that he could do a great service to many country subscribers by helping them to meet the cost of the revolutionary change from manual to automatic exchanges. Let me make it clear here that I entirely support this change to automatic working. The rate at which it is being pushed on is one of tbe legacies that the Minister will leave upon his retirement, but if, in the last few weeks of his Ministerial responsibility, he could do something to relieve tbe burden of these people who are suffering from what may be likened to the introduction of automation in that they are unwittingly caught up in the process of the change, it would be greatly appreciated. The other matter to which I wish to refer has been mentioned by me before and I shall not deal with it in great detail. try to get this entertainment that is so It relates to the requirements of residents of thc country areas with relation to television services. There are many people in Australia to-day who, despite the great advances wbich the Government has made in extending television services to the country, are not yet able to receive this service within the normal viewing area of tbe station, and will not be able to do so for many years. Many people have to go to thc expense of acquiring a very high grade television set to get any sort of reception over long distances, and have to go to considerable expense to erect very high aerials. Even then they find that they can get reception only, say, two nights a week. Yet they are required to pay a full licence-fee. Recently, the Postmaster-General's Department prosecuted quite a number of people at Mount Gambier in my eleclicences. I completely support that. If the law is that people who have a television set must have a licence, the department has a duty to see that people have licences. WhatI am quarrelling about is the law itself and the requirement that people in distant country areas that are not within the normal range of a television transmitter shall pay a full licence-fee. Tbe Postmaster-General has told me that it would be administratively impracticable not to require such people to pay a full licence-fee. I cannot see that. The Minister has been unable to convince me of that. I believe that provision could be made that anybody within, say, 100 or 120 miles, or some other specified maximum distance within which good reception may be obtained from the bestlocated and most powerful television station, shall pay a full licence-fee, and that anybody outside that area shall be required to pay, say, only half the full fee. I do not see why this is administratively impracticable. The owner of a television set could bear the onus and face the consequences if he makes a mistake about tbe distance or any other material factor. Inevitably, it will, be a number of years yet before many people in country areas are able to obtain the full benefit of television services. I believe that the least we can do to help those people who want to popular in city areas and inner country areas is to give tbem a licence concession. Many country people are able to receive only Australian Broadcasting Commission television programmes, and those perhaps only two or three nights a week. I know that, eventually, some provision such as I propose will be made. Why not make it now? We know that this sort of concession has been allowed in the field of radio. Exempted zones apply to radio listeners' licences. I have no doubt that it is just a question of time before we decide that there shall be differential television viewers' licence-fees in Postmaster-General's Department. I have areas where reception is not good. I appeal to the Postmaster-General, again, on an occasion such as this, that this to undertake this last statesman-like act Government has contributed increasing sums before he leaves his portfolio and once more to the development of the Post Office. to help people in the country-the people Indeed, I should say that the Government whom he has looked after so well and so has contributed to the uttermost limits of assiduously throughout his career as Ministhe funds available for this kind of developter.

In these my final remarks about the Postmaster General's Department, I say that I have always received very generous treatment from the Treasury, having regard to all the demands that are made on the public purse. There is, of course, a continuing lag in the supply of telephone services. ber surely does not think that 1 deliberately created that state of affairs. It arose from the fact that we' in Queensland were very lucky during the war years. Many services were given to us then by other people. I do not want to take too much of the time generously allowed me by die committee. I simply say that the provision of telephone services creates a big problem. The number of services installed is increasing each year, but so is the demand. The demand arises from the fact that our economy is expanding rapidly each year under this Government's administration. The honourable member for Bruce( Mr support and the guidance of the very fine Snedden) and other honourable members have referred to the situation in Sydney and Melbourne. I have not made any attempt to hide the fact that tbe situation in the suburbs of these cities is not good. However, I again point out that the demand created by the rapid expansion of our economy causes problems. It is difficult to keep pace with the demand, but, in fact, whole, and agreed to. we are not only keeping pace with it but are steadily catching up with the outstanding applications. Some one has said that, if the Post Office were given another £5,000,000, it would be able to catch up on leave-rea d a third time. all the outstanding applications. That may be so, but, of course, while we are doing that, another 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 applications would be lodged. I think this point was made by the honourable member for Bruce. I do not want to deal with this matter Holtin any further detail. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, I will in the ensuing weeks consider all the matters that have been raised. As all honourable members know, I am not standing for re-election, but the constitutional position is that I will still be the Postmaster-General, I suppose, for at least another few-months. I will be able during that time to consider the matters that have been raised by honourable members. I want to thank honourable members on both sides of the committee-ther e is nothing political about this-for the kind remarks they have made during this debate about mc and the way I have attended to my duties while I have been Postmaster General. Honourable members opposite, as well as honourable members on this side of the committee, were very sincere in commending me. I set out to do the best that I could in my position as Postmaster General. I tried not to show any favour to any one, but to carry out my duties as I believed they should be carried out. I have been moved by the fact that, although honorabie members on both sides offered some criticisms, they concluded their remarks by thanking mc, and I thank them in return. I say no more at this stage, because this is not my swan song; I shall have something further to say before the Parliament rises. However, I want to go on record as saying that I could not have performed my duties as I did without the band of public servants in the department and the various instrumentalities associated with it. They have a wonderful tradition of service and they have served me most loyally throughout the time that I have been Postmaster-General. Proposed expenditures agreed to.

It was arranged by these . four governments that the commission should carry out a full investigation of a proposal ( Mr Harold Holt). advanced by the South Australian Government that a major storage should be. provided on a site known as Chowilla on the lower Murray. The commission was also asked to suggest the best means of sharing the water from such a storage.

The water will, however, be banked up as far as Wentworth, some 120 river miles. The dam will by 41 feet high and will be over 500 square miles. Its capacity will be by far the largest reservoir in Australia. Lake Eucumbene is 3,860,000 acre feet, Eildon 2,750,000 acre feet and Hume 2,500,000 acre feet.

In brief, with the addition of Chowilla the water in the Hume reservoir will be available for the most part for sharing between New Soutb Wales and Victoria alone.

109,Mr Luchetti,"The honourable memthe work is to be undertaken. We joinnow in a national spirit in acclaiming this work, which will do so much for Australia'sdevelopment. The Commonwealth has proposed certain financial arrangements, which have been accepted by New South Wales. In the first place, thc Commonwealth will make a loan to New South Wales to cover the cost of the proposed work. Repayment of the loan is to begin ten years after the first payment by the Commonwealth and each Commonwealth payment will be repaid by twenty equal consecutive half-yearly amounts. The rate of interest payable by the State will be the approximate rate of long-term Commonwealth loans. It will be noted, therefore, that while New South Wales will be assisted to overcome its teething problems in the matter of finance, in the long run the State will be responsible for repaying to the Commonwealth the cost of this gigantic undertaking. Let it be clearly understood that, in the final analysis, the people who will have to make this project pay will be the people farming the land which will be made available. The Commonwealth terms, which might be regarded as generous and of very great value at the present time, do no more than trigger off an important developmental project in this country. It has been stated from time to time that this work should have been started long ago. We all know that land has been there, that water has been there and that tbe technical skills of the people engaged on tbe Snowy Mountains project have been available. The only thing that has been missing has been the finance necessary to enable the work to be commenced. It is good to know that even in the dying hours of this Parliament legislation will be passed to enable this vast undertaking to be commenced. The Blowering dam will regulate the waters discharged into the Murrumbidgee River, which is a part of the Snowy Mountains scheme, and will provide an additional 430,000 acre feet a year for diversion from the river. The additional primary, production in the Coleambally irrigation area in fat lambs, beef, horticulture and crops will have a value of £5,000,000 a year. Apart from thc Coleambally development, .sufficient water .will be available for a greatly expanded irrigation scheme by private landholders and for -other potential schemes. This is of great importance, and I think the > House appreciates that this undertaking is of considerable significance to our development. The Opposition does not seek to denigrate in any way what is being done. We acclaim what is being done. We support what is being done. We uphold the great capacity of those engaged in the Snowy Mountains undertaking to do this kind of work. On behalf of thc Opposition, I have accepted the Minister's suggestion that we consider together the bill relating to the construction of the Blowering dam and lhat relating to the extension of Sir William Hudson's term of office. The Opposition is pleased to support the Government's proposal to extend the term of service of Sir William Hudson as the Commissioner of thc Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. As a general practice, the Opposition does not believe in adopting a course of this kind. We believe that young men in all spheres of activity deserve their opportunities to play their part in AustraUa's development, but we all know that Sir William Hudson's name bas become indissolubly linked with the Snowy Mountains project. Perhaps one-half of this magnificent undertaking has been completed but a number of challenging works still require the attention of Sir William Hudson, who has been associated with the undertaking since its inception. For that reason we are pleased to support the Government's proposal that his term of service be extended. Sir William Hudson has an excellent record in relation to the Snowy Mountains undertaking. His work in planning -"" its development has won the admiration of experts concerned with water storage, irrigation and the generation of hydro-electric power not only in Australia but also throughout the world. Many overseas experts have come to Australia and have been amazed at this magnificent project, which has lifted the water from the Snowy River over the range and turned it into the western streams so that it will bring life to the land on the other side of the Great Dividing Range. The commissioner of the authority has played a most important part in this work.. I want to refer to a point made by the Minister for Air( Mr Fairbairn), who v represents in this place the Minister for National Development (Senator Sir William Spooner), relating to Sir William Hudson's enlightened leadership. In his second reading speech the Minister saidThe rapid progress Uiat has been made and the almost complete absence of industrial troubles hope that some time in the future a more in thc Snowy area are some of the results of thc initiative, drive and judgment of Sir William Hudson. I join in paying a tribute to this enlightened leader. I can only express very deep regret that many industrialists in Australia, people holding responsible positions, have not followed the line of conduct which Sir William Hudson has adopted in his industrial relationships. He has set a very fine example. His fine work in engineering and planning as well as his attitude to industrial relationships show his outstanding ability. Wc therefore join with the Government and are pleased to assent to tbe extension of his term as commissioner. Under the Snowy Mountains agreement the New South Wales Government accepted responsibility for constructing the Blowering dam. It indicated, however, that it was not in a position to begin the construction of the dam immediately. I am repeating now the remarks of the Minister, and we do not cavil at his statement. The New South Wales Government made it clear that because of its many other commitments it lacked the finance to get to work on the dam immediately. I believe that everybody in Australia to-day recognizes the fact that since the introduction of uniform taxation and the establishment of the Australian Loan Council the Commonwealth Government is the ; ;. . be done, But in this case the Commonwealth Government is doing this, and we are . The Commonwealtb has agreed to lend for considerable new development in this New South Wales half the cost of constructcountry. The Minister said:ing the Blowering dam* which is at present estimated at £22,000,000, although this That stocktaking emphasized the potential national figure does not include the cost of a power advantage we were failing to capitalize without station, which is expected to be £7,000,000. Blowering. It was against this background that The New South Wales Government has the -undertaken to carry out this work, which alone, but the whole of Australia as well, which is necessary to enable the available water to will, benefit from the. large-scale developments in be fully utilized within ten years. Furthermore, New South Wales has already spent £6,000,000 on the Gogeldrie weir and supporting works. It will need a further £10,000,000 to complete the works necessary for the full effective use of the water when available. These are responsibilities that fall on New South Wales. I can only enlightened approach will be adopted towards works of this kind so that instead of the dead hand of debt falling on such works from the commencement we may be able, through a more enlightened policy, to find money for these works at an earlier time, so that they may be commenced earlier and at the lowest possible charge. As I have already pointed out, the problem of making this pay rests on the farmers, and because of that it is necessary for us to give them the fullest opportunity of going on to the farms that will become available at a reasonable cost, so that they will be able to pay their way. Farmers to-day face many problems. They have not only to manage their farms and produce crops but tbey have also to cope with the problem of marketing. Many grave and disturbing questions have to be answered by the man on the land at the present time. Let me put this to the House: How much more would we have welcomed a proposal like this if it had been brought forward at the time of thc credit squeeze, when so many of our people were searching for work throughout the land. That would have been an excellent time to bring forward a measure like this. But that time has gone and it is not much use discussing it tonight. I merely refer to it because it is to be deplored that the chance of giving fountainhead of finance and that unless the employment opportunities at that time was Commonwealth Government is prepared to neglected by the Government. team up with the various States little can The Blowering project has a number of very interesting features which I think pleased that it is doing so. should be mentioned. It will have an outstanding capacity. It will be responsible It was, therefore, naturally a lime for stocktaking. Commonwealth decided to give financial assistance to 'New South Wales. It is not' that"" State the Murrumbidgee valley made possible by the construction of the Blowering dam. Those are the words of the Minister for Air( Mr Fairbairn), representing the MinisGovernment has been most active in a ter for National Development (Senator Spooner). It is a fair and proper statement. This undertaking is a national one. It is an undertaking of great value to the whole of Australia, and not merely to New South Wales, which was called upon to find the necessary finance. As the Minister rightly said, it is a national undertaking of great value to all the people of this country. I suggest that in the future we should take a broader look at works of this kind from the national standpoint and cease quibbling over State rights and State responsibilities. Keepit dam, Menindee lakes and thc Thefinancialprovisions for the Blowering dam are interesting. The other aspects of the agreement to which the Minister referred are of importance. He told us that the work will be carried out on the Tumut River and that the dam will have a capacity of 1,300,000 acre feet of water. The agreenewspaper refers to the fact that seventeen ment provides for the construction of the dam and all appurtenant works. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, as agent for the State of New South Wales, will design and construct the' dam, spillway, which we all appreciate and applaud in this outlet works and other incidental works, and these works will be in service within six South Wales Government in this field has years of the date of agreement. The agreement also provides for the State, within six months after the compter tion of the Blowering storage works, to make tremendous development that is occurring available a minimum of 70 large irrigation farms within the Coleambally or otber irrigation areas in the Murrumbidgee valley, grand concept of the Snowy Mountains together with horticultural farms, and to make provision for the ful] use of all addinorth Queensland, Western Australia and tional water provided by the storage within ten years of the date of completion of the works. This is important. These conditions have been written into the contract, but 1 doubt whether there was any need to ask New South Wales to sign such an agreement, because this is precisely the kind of thing that is being done in developing this important part of New South Wales. Since the end of the war 1,250 farms in New South Wales have been provided with water from irrigation areas. The Blowering dam, according to the New South Wales estimate of the project, will provide water for an additional 1,000 farms. The New South. Wales Government had .made an early start on thc Gogeldrie weir and the additional works in connection with the Blowering dam.. The New South Wales number of fields, and that is why I suggest that while the responsibility of tbe New South Wales Government will be written into the agreement that government has an excellent record in matters such as this. Let' me list some of the great undertakings that have been commenced and completed, or are in course of completion, by New South Wales. There are the works at Lake Brewster, the Lawson siphons, Burrinjuck dam enlargement, Glenbawn dam, Gogeldrie weir and supporting works, enlargement of the Hume reservoir. Those are all great works. The Burrendong dam on the Macquarie River is another one. They indicate the great progress that is being made in New South Wales. The latest issue of the "" Country Life"" new blocks on the Coleambally estate are being made available. This is part of the continuing programme of development House this evening. The work of the New been particularly good. The Minister for Air, in his second-reading speech, said that this project will provide for at least an additional 650 farms.

I thought the honourable member would come back to the bill. 1 suggest that he co-operate with the Chair and do that now. Speaker. The Minister for Air, in his second-reading speech, directed attention to the Coleambally irrigation project. I do not intend to debate the wider question of works in New South Wales, but the Coleambally project is part of the Blowering project. It is the means by which the waters from the Blowering dam will be used in irrigating land. It is the justification for the Blowering project. As the Minister pointed out, it is of very great importance. It is the means of giving life to the land in that area. So, as the Minister has referred to it, I propose to do so. Thc Coleambally irrigation area, which is south of the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales, is easily the largest community irrigation scheme now being developed in Australia. The area of land selected for this new irrigation area contains nearly 450,000 acres. Next in size is the Mareeba-Dimbulah project of 49,000 acres in north Queensland. The pilot stage of the Ord River irrigation scheme in the east Kimberley area of Western Australia embraces 30,000 acres. It is apparent that the Coleambally project, which is a part of thc Blowering project, is an outstanding achievement and a very fine piece of work. A proposal to divert the waters of the the leadership of great Australians like Sir Snowy River into the Murrumbidgee River William Hudson, will be extended throughfirst came under notice in 1884. A lot of out the whole of the Commonwealth. The water has flowed down the Murrumbidgee Opposition is pleased to support the bills. River since those distant days. We all know of the great visionaries who have been concerned with this matter. This evening people will applaud the fact that this work is tb be carried out and that the nation is to get on with this very fine undertaking. Although an exact estimate of the number of new irrigated farms that ultimately will become available as a result of the extra water to be stored cannot be given yet, it is expected that the number will be about 1,000. The lands within the Coleambally irrigation area are sufficient to provide up to 720 mixed farms and 125 horticultural about 520 acres, and the latter farms will have 40 acres of first-class horticultural land and supplementary areas which could be used for cash cropping, such as vegetable production. That clearly indicates what is being done, the importance of the undertaking and the need to get on with the work The Opposition is delighted to join with the Government on this occasion. As I said at the outset, our only regret is the delay that has occurred. We should like to see the work go forward. Therefore, the Opposition joins with the Government in tbe hope that the bill will bave a speedy passage. Already too much time has elapsed since the first proposals for this undertaking were made. The Labour Party is not satisfied with the rate of national development. This work sbould have been commenced during the period of the credit squeeze, when unemployment figures reached tragic proportions. All that was necessary was for the Commonwealth Government to make funds available as it now proposes to do. The principle of Commonwealth-State co-operation which is embodied in the Blowering project should be extended to other States, and especially to northern Australia. The Opposition is proud of the Snowy Mountains project. That project has won world-wide acclaim. The Labour Party is determined that the valuable work of the Snowy Mountains Authority will be allowed to continue throughout the Snowy Mountains area and eventually, under",57,Blowering Water Storage Works Agreement Bill 1963

115,"Mr Luchettii Am Doing That, Mr As Speedily As Possible.","Sir (Chisholm) 19.171 -We are dealing with two bills. In respect of the first, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority Bill, 1 support the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr were, out on their own, on the northern Luchetti). But in respect of the second, the Blowering Water Storage Works Agreement Bill, or the honourable member. for Hume's benefit society bill, I disagree very carrying on the traditions that have been strongly with the bonorable member for Macquarie. I will tell him why. Let me refer to the first bill first. I think every 1 understand from the delegation which member of this House would like to join with the Minister for Air( Mr Fairbairn) and the honourable member for Macquarie in paying a very high tribute to somebody who, we all agree, will rank in history as one of the great Australians of this period. 1 refer to Sir William Hudson. As the honourable member for Macquarie pointed out, we admire not only Sir William's engineering capacity but also his leadership in all walks of life. He has welded people from different parts of the world into one strong and united team, and the whole project has gone ahead without industrial unrest. All those accomplishments command the admiration not only of members of this House but of all Australians. Sir William's work has been recognized outside Australia, too, and 1 am absolutely certain that it will have much wider ramifications. For instance, in March of this year I happened to be in South-East Asia. Two Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority teams were there. One was building roads in northern Thailand. 1 understand that tbe recent parliamentary delegation to South-East Asia visited that team. The other was drilling or testing proposed dam sites on' the Mekong River for the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. When I was in Souths East Asia, I had the privilege of visiting the latter team on a dam site 20 miles up the river from Vientiane. This party of ten men was out on its own, with Thailand on one side of the river ahd Laos on the other. The men were working under difficulties which people in AusSnowy Mountains scheme started. If the tralia do not realize. I say without any cynicism whatever that they were a grand team of men whom any Australian would be proud to recognize as Australians. The party included two Poles, two Maltese, one from the Snowy Mountains where, under the leadership of Sir William Hudson, they had been welded together not only as a team but also as Australians. There they border of Thailand, where Thailand and Laos are divided by the Mekong River. They were doing a magnificent job and established in the Snowy Mountains area under the leadership of Sir William Hudson. visited the road-making team in northern Thailand that the same things could be said about that team. I am therefore delighted to pay a tribute to a man who will rank in the history of Australia not only with other industrial leaders but with many of our national leaders during crises in wartime. I am delighted that the Government has extended the term of office of Sir William Hudson, if only for what is a comparatively short term. 1 am sure that every member of this House will join in paying that tribute. I come now to the second bill, which deals with the Blowering dam. AlthoughI quite understand the efforts of the honourable member for Macquarie lo make the best of the situation, his speech was the best bit of electioneering clowning I have heard for a very long time. The honourable member does not have thc background of experience that I have with regard to the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, and particularly with regard to the Blowering dam. The honor-, able member claims that credit is due to the New South Wales Government, but the opposite is the true position. I attended the first conference held here in relation to the Snowy Mountains scheme. That was the first time. I had ever sat in the Cabinet room. I did not know then that I would sit there for a short time as a federal Minister. I was then one of two Ministers representing the Victorian Liberal Government at the conference, which was to decide whether we were going to get the Liberal Party Ministers from Victoria had not backed the federal Labour Government of that time, the New South Wales Labour Government would have stopped the' scheme. Thc representatives of ""the New South Wales Labour Government said that the Snowy Mountains belong to New South Wales. They were keen to stop the scheme, and it did not matter to them' that the Snowy River rose in New South Wales and flowed out through Victoria. When they found the Victorian Ministers joining witb the federal Labour Ministers, they realized that thcy would be in difficulties if they did not come to the party. Thc federal Labour Ministers and Victorian Liberal Ministers wanted the Blowering dam included in the Snowy Mountains scheme, but the New South Wales representatives said: "" Nobody will have anything to do with the Blowering dam except the New South Wales Government. We will finance it. We will do everything in connection with it. It is not to be included in the projects that will come under thc Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority or whatever is to be the name of the authority."" The honourable member for Macquarie fication of an agreement with New South does not know the background. He has Wales to finance the scheme. It does not tried to take all the credit for the New deal with the scheme itself.

I have given the reasons why it could have been made much earlier. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that we are very glad to have the bill, but I do not agree that the Commonwealth Government is responsible for any delay. The blame should be laid at the door of the New South Wales Government. In the few minutes available to me I have put the record right, so that there can be no question of the bill being a benefit bill for the honourable member for Hume in the forthcoming election. The blame for any delay in the ratification of the agreement ought to be laid on the New South Wales Government. with the bills before the House, I want first to trace the history of the Blowering dam and the negotiations that have taken place between the New South Wales Government and thc Commonwealth Government. The New South Wales Minister for Conservation, the Honourable A. G. Enticknap, approached the Minister for National Development (Senator Sir William Spooner), as long ago as 15thSeptember,. 1952, with the suggestion that the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority should build the Blowering dam as an integral part of the Snowy : Mountains scheme. What tripe the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) has been trying to put across the House to-night. Mr Enticknap was' accompanied by the then chairman of the Conservation Authority of New South Wales, Mr C. K. Jacka, and the commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, Sir William Hudson, was also present. Mr Enticknap pointed out that in the light of availability of staff and funds and in view of its existing commitments, it was not possible for the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales to undertake the construction of the dam. at that time. He suggested that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority might build the darn and that the New South Wales authorities should concentrate on the establishment of an irrigation scheme to use thc waters as soon as possible after diversion through T l power station had commenced. member will come back to the measure before the Chair. He is now giving the history of the negotiations leading up to the agreement. We are ratifying an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales relating only to the system offinancingthe project. I ask the honourable member not to refer to the : principles of the scheme as a scheme. State representatives gained the impression that the Minister for'National Development' was favorable to the proposal in broad terms and that the question of the State of New South Wales providing the money for the construction of the dam member must relate his remarks to the bill. negotiations between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Government relating to the construction of the dam must be relevant to the measure before the House. . honourable member not to argue with the",60,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Italian And One Irishman But They Came

138,Mr Speaker,"Order! I ask the Chair.. The position is quite clear. It is a very limited bill. A degree of tolerance is necessary, but I ask the honourable member not to abuse it. Opposition consented to thc House debating two bills, one relating to the Snowy project as such and to the re-appointment of Sir William Hudson, and the otber relating to the ratification of the agreement witb respect to the Blowering dam. I submit further that the honourable member for Hume is entitled to reply to the honourable member for Chisholm who made sweeping and wild assertions based on a memory which I think has faded. out to the honourable member that the question before the Chair is the ratification of an agreement. We now have added to that the question of the re-appointment of Sir William Hudson. The project, as a project, is not under consideration, and the Chair was over tolerant with the honourable member for Macquarie when he led for the Opposition in this debate. we ratify an agreement without mentioning the agreement? the honourable member that we are not dealing with the history of the whole transaction. very short space of time. There was some justification for the honourable member for Chisholm replying to the honourable member for Macquarie, but there is no justification for a general recital of personal conversations and everything else that took place between so-and-so and soand-so or about what the scheme involves. The Chair does not want to be exceedingly hard on the honourable member, but I suggest that he relate his remarks to the bill. would be able to reply to the honourable member for Chisholm; but let me say that I wholeheartedly support the proposal before the House. The only complaint I have is that the scheme was not put into operation years ago. I happened to be a member of this Parliament when these proposals were first brought before it, and I know perfectly well that, with the exception of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr matter in this Parliament only twice. Those Turnbull) and the late General Rankin, every honourable meniber of the then Opposition boycotted the scheme. Therefore, I cannot see how honourable members on the Government side can take any credit for the scheme at all Had the Australian Labour Party not been in office at that time, there would not have been any Snowy Mountains scheme to-day because each and every honourable member who then sat in opposition to the Labour Government boycotted it. i say again that my only complaint is that this dam should have been built years ago. I know, too, that a former Minister for Works and Housing, Mr Nelson Lemmon, thought that the completion of thc dam was to coincide with the completion of the T l and T2 power stations, but that has not happened. As a result, we have seen this Government buy fourteen farms below the site of the dam at a cost of £285,000, and it has not finished yet. All the farmers below the site of the dam still have complaints about the water that is coming through now. I live in Tumut and I know what I am talking about. Hundreds of acres of some of the best farming land in this country has been put out of production, and that is our complaint. This Government has been responsible for the fact that the Blowering dam was not built j'ears ago. I say again that I wholeheartedly support the scheme and I hope that it will be completed within a bill now. 1 repeat that only the honourable member for Mallee and the late General Rankin wanted to carry tbe scheme through. Evidently the honourable member for Chisholm who made his attack here to-night, and who comes from Victoria, was a member of the Victorian State Government at that time; but I well recall that every member of the present Government parties who was then in opposition, even the present Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), sat in the Parliament as silent as oysters. I was in the Parliament at that time, and the member of this Government whose electorate will benefit most from the. construction of the dam has been sitting here as silent as an oyster.

They will certainly vote him out of office, and rightly so. So, Mr Speaker, as you will not permit agreement and the re-appointment of Sir me to go any further, I repeat that I wholeWilliam Hudson. heartedly support the scheme.

We are now dealing only with an agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government, not with an agreement involving Victoria or with the original Snowy Mountains Agreement. I ask him to co-operate with the Chair by relating his remarks to the bills. gest, with very great respect, that the reason for the introduction of these bills is that the Snowy Mountains Agreement specifically laid down that New South Wales should construct and maintain the Blowering dam. Thc Government of that State, for a variety of reasons, which, I bave no doubt, were good and sufficient, found it impossible to construct thc dam, and therefore alternative proposals had to be devised by thc Minister for National Development (Senator Sir William Spooner), an agreement with the States had to be reached and legislation had to be introduced in this Parliament to give effect to the agreement arising out of that sequence of events. Surely, Mr Speaker, I am permitted to refer to that. original agreement with New South Wales or the original agreement with New South Wales and Victoria? ment between the Commonwealth Government and New South Wales for the construction of the Blowering dam, from which arises the measure that is before us to-day. Clause6 of that agreement, in specific terms, provides(t) The State of New South Wales shall for the purpose of regulating waters of the Tumut River and the waters diverted thereto from the Eucumbene, Tooma, or Murrumbidgee River catchment(a) as soon as is practicable construct, or cause to be constructed, storage works on the Tumut River at Blowering or at such other site on that river, and of such capacity, as that State determines; (b) at all times maintain ami keep those works in good order and condition. Unfortunately and unhappily, that agreement could not be kept by one of the signatories. As a consequence, the legislation now before us has been introduced to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the most imaginative piece of work that has ever been undertaken in our country. After all, it was this Parliament that established the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, aud it was that authority that diverted these snow-fed rivers, on the one hand into the Murrumbidgee River, and, on the other hand, into the Murray River. It is the responsibility of the nation-leavin g the States out of it altogether-to ensure that, these snow-fed rivers having been diverted into our inland streams, the waters so diverted shall be utilized to the best advantage for tbe development and effective occupation of our country. That is the purpose for which these two measures are designed. They will do nothing else but achieve that purpose. They will fill the gap left by the failure of the New South Wales Government to honour its obligation to construct thc Blowering dam, and they will make it possible for the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority to act as agent for the State and to carry out the physical task of constructing the dam. Thc dam will be constructed in the course of the next few years. This legislation provides, I suggest with very great respect, Mr Speaker, for a great variety of other matters to be dealt with once the dam has been constructed. For example, the Minister for Air, in bis second-reading speech on the Blowering Water Storage Works Agreement Bill, stated that the House is now asked to approve an agreement between the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales for the construction of a dam on the Tumut River at Blowering which will provide a storage witb a capacity of 1,300,000 acre feet of water and of all appurtenant works. That is the first responsibility set out in precise terms in the agreement, and, after all, that responsibility is easy to understand. The second responsibility provided for in tbe agreement is the provision by the Commonwealth of a loan to the State equivalent to one-balf the cost of the proposed works. Repayment of the loan will begin ten years after the first payment made",63,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Italian And One Irishman But They Came

158,Mr Roberton,"The original agreeby the Commonwealth, and each payment made by the Commonwealth will be repaid by twenty equal consecutive half-yearly amounts. The rate of interest payable by the State shall be the appropriate rate on long-term Commonwealth loans. At all times when the agreement and this legislation were under consideration, the difficulty that confronted the New South Wales Government was that of finding the financial resources to enable it to carry out the undertaking it had given in the agreement. There was no way io which the State could' solve that problem without the assistance of the Commonwealth Government. After all, New South Wales is cluttered up with dams in course of construction, and it would be idle for the State Government to undertake a gigantic project such as this to add to the mumber of uncompleted dams in New South Wales. So provision was made in the legislation to provide New South Wales with half the cost of the construction of the dam. The third provision of the measure is for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, as agent for the State, to design and construct the dam spillway, outlet works and otber incidental works. It is also provided that these works will be in service within six years of the date of the agreement. That is of thc very greatest importance to the people of our country and to the nation itself. We have land-hungry men in all six States. In New South Wales and Victoria in particular, we have landhungry men who are, in my opinion, the greatest irrigationists in the world. I refer to the second generation of those who were thc original irrigationists in the Murray River irrigation areas in Victoria and New South Wales and in the Murrumbidgee irrigation area in New South Wales. The second-generation men, who were born there and who have devoted their lives to irrigation in all its practices, to every member of this House, regardless are more skilled in the science of irrigation than are any other irrigationists anywhere. It is of the very greatest importance that provision be made as rapidly as possible for these landless men to be provided with land, in the first place, and with irrigable and irrigated land in the second place. The fourth provision referred to by the Minister when he introduced the measure covers' the very point I am trying to emphasize. The State, within six months after the completion of the Blowering dam, is to make available a minimum of 70 large irrigation farms within the Coleambally area or other irrigation areas in the Murrumbidgee valley, together with horticultural farms, and is to make provision for the full use of all additional water provided by the storage within ten years of the date of completion of the works. I took some small part in these negotiations. It was argued to a successful conclusion by the Minister for National Development and by the other representatives of the Commonwealtb Government that it would be idle to enter into a contract such as this with the New South Wales Government and tbe Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority for the conservation of these vast quantities of water, unless the water was to be utilized for irrigation purposes. So the agreement, and now the legislation, had to set out precisely the term of years that it will take, tbe time when this work is likely to be completed and the pace at which the land is to be settled and used for irrigation purposes. At the moment, thc Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and the Commonwealth Government have diverted the waters of the snow-fed rivers. At the moment, the waters are pouring from the Eucumbene into the Tumut and from the Tumut into the Murrumbidgee. They flow through the arid areas of New South Wales until the Murrumbidgee joins the Murray, and then the flow continues to the sea. It is a starktragedy that the waters are not being used for the purposes for which the diversions were originally conceived and carried out. This legislation makes their proper use possible, and because of this it is of very great importance to every thinking Australian and of his political affiliations. The fact is that our rivers flow through land, much of which is subjected to a rainfall of less than 10 inches and 57 per cent, of which is subjected to a rainfall of less than 15 inches. We have rivers that have no hope of flowing continuously and irrigation schemes that must of necessity be restricted to the quantity of water available in these rivers, with no hope of expansion except through imaginative schemes such as this. -For me, fourteen years of disputation arc over. Indeed, during these last fourteen years allegations have constantly been made that this Government-neve r the New South Wales Government-shoul d do something towards the construction of the Blowering dam and thus make this water available. The passing of this legislation means that 79 years of ceaseless struggle by the people of western New South Wales and of the Riverina ure at an end. They could have no more eloquent memorial than the splendid purposes of the bill. Coleambally to-day is one of thc thriving communities in our country, restricted as it is to thc water likely to be made available without the Blowering dam. There will be a multiplication of the settlement in Coleambally when the Blowering dam is constructed and greater numbers of acre feet of water are available for irrigation purposes. On Coleambally to-day are some of thc finest irrigationists in the world. Young men and young women are growing rice there for the first time in our agricultural history. They are getting yields of up to 4 tons per acre when the average yield of rice in countries where rice has been grown for countless centuries is confined within the limit of 14 cwt. to the acre. These young men and young women-th c men could not do it without the assistance of their wives-yea r after year are turning out crops of rice of superlative quality. Rice is only one crop. They arc carrying out experiments in the growing of colton, and that industry will expand in that locality. I do not now refer exclusively to Coleambally but to that vast stretch of country between the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River and between the Murrumbidgee River and the Lachlan River in New South Wales. This is one of the greatest stretches of arable land on the face of God's earth. It is limited in use only by the amount of water available in these rivers. If more water can be put into the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan and the Darling, this vast area of arable land can be brought to a state of fertility that will not be matched in any other part of the world, and I speak as an agriculturalist. Thc passing of this legislation will restore hope to the people who, generations ago in 1884, conceived this idea and struggled valiantly to have it examined and accepted and to bave the Commonwealth Parliament intercede between the two States. There was disputation as to whether the water should go into one river or the other. This disputation was resolved by the agreement, which provided that it should be the exclusive responsibility of the State of New South Wales to construct the Blowering dam. The. State found that it could not construct the dam, and this affected the people who had been waiting for generations for the dam. It is to thc everlasting credit of the Minister for National Development that he was able to enter into negotiations with the Premier and the Minister for Agriculture and Conservation in New South Wales and reach unanimity as to what should be done. What should be done is expressed in tbe two measures, l f they have a speedy passage in this House-n o two bills are more deserving of a speedy passage-hop e will be restored to our landless men and women. A generation of men and women has been waiting patiently for the Blowering dam to be constructed so that Coleambally may be extended not in terms of 10, 20 or 30 farms but in terms of 100, 200, 500, 700, 1,000 and 1,250 farms as rapidly as possible. That is the purpose of this legislation. It has no other purpose, and it deserves the support of every honourable member. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

The great gap in the Government's proposition was where the £358,000,000-the aggregate deficitwas to como from The Treasurer implied that he would be able to raise some £300,000,000 on the loan market, but that he would have to provide about £58,000,000 by means of a budget deficit-that being the difference between total revenue and total expenditure. Technically, under the terms of the Financial Agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, any amounts which the Commonwealth raises in loan funds for defence purposes do not rank for distribution among the States. I suppose that, in thc long run, that is the only technical reason why the bill we are now contemplating deals with defence expenditure as such. To-day, the governments of Australia, and the Commonwealth Government in particular, are responsible for something like one quarter of the total expenditure in the community. Australia's gross national product aggregates, inround figures, £8,000,000,000. Such sums are astronomical in themselves and in many ways they are incomprehensible to most people. Of that total spending of £8,000,000,000 in thc year, thc Commonwealth Government is £2,000,000,000, or one-quarter. How it spends that money and where it raises it are of some significance in the economy as a whole. It is recognized nowadays that what Governments do in the raising and expending of revenues is significant to the destiny of the economy as a whole. I wish now to refer honourable members to some rather interesting comments which are to be found in a report of the Bank of Canada. Canada has an economy which in many ways is similar to that of Australia. It has a bigger population than we have17,000,000 people as against 11,000,000 in Australia-bu t its economy is similar to ours. ment must make an endeavour to make There has recently been set up in Canada a royal commission on banking and finance and, appended to the most recent annual report of the Bank of Canada is a statement by the governor of that bank, containing comments which he made to that royal commission. The document is dated 9th January, 1963, so it is quite a'recent document. On page 61 of the bank's annual report the following remarks are to be found:. . . That there should be a consistent meshing together of all aspects of publicfinancialand economic policy and, in particular, that monetary policy, fiscal policy and debt management policy should be carefully co-ordinated and purposefully directed towards attaining the overall economic objectives of the community. In Australia, last consideration seems to be given to this question of debt management-the total which the Government has to find from the loan market, in the long run, to bridge the gap between its total expenditure and the total revenue raised from the community. When we were contemplating last year's budget, the Government envisaged that there would be a deficit of the order of £118,000,000. In fact, when the results for the year were finalized, instead of there being a deficit of £118,000,000, there was a surplus of £16,000,000 in the public accounts, which meant that the Government had made an error of about £134,000,000 in its estimate of thc financial picture. Mainly because of that large error which it made in 1962-63 the Government has been most reluctant, in 1963-64, to draw any financial picture at all. When the Treasurer brought his Budget before us a month or two ago, instead of saying, as he had said in the responsible for something like previous year, that a deficit of so much was expected,, all that he said was that there would be a deficiency of £358,000,000 between the total revenue and the total expenditure for the year, and that he hoped that £300,000,000 of that would be found on the loan market, leaving a deficit of £58,000,000. That is not good enough for an economy such as ours. hard to estimate loan raisings. hard to estimate, but as I have said in this House on other occasions, the Governan estimate. you could get to the correct figure? than the Treasurer got last time. I suggest that because he did so badly last time is one reason why the country is now being plunged into an election. There is much",67,Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority Bill 1963

165,Mr Crean,"I hope I could get closeruncertainly about the future. Whether that uncertainty can be lessened depends on whether the Government is prepared to take its courage in both hands better ways of estimating a deficit? better ways of estimating and I hope that the next government will not be as far wrong as you people were last year. I am rather interested in the provocative remarks recent Budget indicates is that this Governthat are coming from the Government benches because I think they show a certain uneasiness on the part of the Government as to what the future holds. without giving any of your own ideas. in a moment, but 1 suggest that the fact that this Government is so short of ideas is one of thc reasons wby honourable members opposite are running in all directions at once, as they appear to be at the moment. This measure, on the surface, appears innocuous. It simply states that. £62,500,000 will be provided for defence purposes out of loan funds instead of out of revenue. I am not going to get into an argument this evening about how much should be expended on defence. We had that argument last night. If the Commonwealth Government intends to spend something like £2,000,000,000 in the aggregate, it does not much matter where this £62,500,000 comes from. When you pay cheques for defence purposes the people who receive them do not care very much whether the money comes from taxes, from receipts of Government enterprises, from loan funds or from a credit expansion budget deficit. That is not their concern, but it is the concern of the Government. The statement that I read from the report period between 1954 and 1961 the aggregate of the Bank of Canada highlights what every government of a modern community must bear in mind. No longer in a modern community can you say that this kind of exercise is the responsibility of the banking absorb about 75,000 people annually, find system, that that kind of exercise is the responsibility of the taxing system and that another kind of exercise depends on the loan market. The three exercises must be coordinated. For those who are interested in. reading the documentation on this aspect, let me say that the Radcliffe committee in Great Britain pointed to tbe fact that what is called debt management-in essence, the extent to which you go on to the public loan market and the extent to wbicb you resort to a budget deficit-is a very significant exercise, not something wbich should be regarded as trivial. The Radcliffe committee said that the debt management is not something that should ; be left to the end; it must be a part of the overall co-ordination. All that the most ment is not doing that kind of planning. We have not adequate resources in the banking system and in the Treasury to dovetail these aspects. The Government seems to be very proud because a month or two before Christmas only 58,000 people are unemployed. The other night, when I said that unemployment ought to be nil, an honourable member on the Government side suggested that my statement was absurd. Do honourable members on the Government side believe that the 58,000 people who are unemployed sbould be unemployed? Do honourable members on the Government side think that number is tbe irreducible minimum? I suggest that they should be looking a little closer at the figures and asking themselves what will be the position at the end of January of 1964, when another 60,000 or 80,000 young people will be on the labour market, bearing in mind that now, two months before the Christmas boom ancl only three months before the school-leaving boom, there are 58,000 people unemployed. Is this economy in such a position that by the end of January, 1964, it will be capable of absorbing about 100,000 more people into productive employment? I pointed out in the House the other evening that the census figures show that in the seven-year increase in employment in Australia was 525,000 people, an average annual increase of 75,000. Can the Australian economy, which on the average has been able to a minimum of about 100,000 jobs in the next three months? I think that is beyond the present capacity of the economy, and that is. one of the reasons why these exercises, which appear pretty trivial lo-. some honourable members on the Government side, really are quite significant.",68,Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority Bill 1963

If there has been any bad planning in Australia from 1949 to 1963, the responsibility lies on the Government, not on the Opposition. I will go all the way with the honourable member if he thinks that the answer is bad planning. I am suggesting that there should be better planning, and one place where better planning can begin is at the government level. should control the productive capacity of every industry in Australia? should. The Minister for the Interior is very bright in quoting slogans, but he will not face up to the real situation. At present that section of the community, after all, 58,000 people are unemployed, and according to the statistics only 29,000 jobs can be regarded as being vacant. Two months before Chrismas there are two people available to fill every vacant job. theoretical. because the position is under-stated to the extent that a lot of people who want work are not recorded in the figures. For various reasons laid down in the social services legislation they cannot be registered for employment because their husbands or their wives arc already in jobs. I shall not go into that argument at present, but I do ask the Government to face up to the facts. At present 58,000 people are recorded as seeking jobs whereas technically only 29,000 jobs are available. In the next three months anything up to 100,000 persons will be added to the 58,000 already unemployed. Halve that additional number if you like and say that only 50,000 will be coming on thc labour market in the next three months. jobs. Getting back to the bill, one place where you can generate pretty quickly an increase in activity is in the field of government expenditure. As a forecast of the Labour Party's election programme, let me say that the greatest stimulus that the Government can give to public spending is to give additional purchasing power to family groups in the community through such things as child endowment and increased social service benefits. The additional spending power thus generated would do something towards taking up this slack which exists in the productive capacity of the community. There are some people, of course, who will argue the reverse of what I argue on this proposition, and I will be interested to hear tbem get up and put their points of view. But I say that the reason why the economy is not ticking over as quickly as it ought to be is hesitancy on the part of the investing side of the community. The members of invest in businesses only if they can be assured that they will sell what the increased capacity resulting from their investment will generate. They will not sell it, of course, unless there is increased purchasing power in the community. We have repeated in this bill the mistakes that one would have thought the Government would have learned to avoid twelve months ago. I take the House back to that time, because the thesis of the Government exactly twelve months ago was to the effect that if the Australian economy was to tick over at the rate then regarded as desirable, tbe Government had to spend about £120,000,000 more than it collected in revenue, and the difference would have been made up by credit expansion. The ultimate result was that instead of having to face a deficit of £120,000,000 the Government finished with a surplus of £16,000,000. It seemed quite gratified by that result, but what it ignored was the fact that there had been no decline in Government activity. The total Government spending was what it had expected at the beginning, but private",69,Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority Bill 1963

175,Mr Crean,"I agree. It is theoreticalspending was roughly £ 100,000,000 less than had been expected. Because of this the level of unemployment at that stage was of the order of 100,000 persons. WhatI am suggesting is that because it was so far out on that occasion, the Government is not even game to make a guess this time. It says, ""Probably we will have to face a deficit of £58,000,000, or £60,000,000 to put it in roundfigures"", but I contend that this is not good enough. I am making thc criticism that there is a need to develop in the Treasury, or whatever economic planning mechanism exists in Australia, some much sharper instruments. The Government must have a much clearer picture, when it prepares its Budget, of the ultimate outcome twelve months hence than it appears to have at the moment. This bill, in essence, is largely an economic fiction. Whether, technically, you raise so much and spend so much, and then decide to drag (he deficiency from loan funds and allocate it to defence expenditure is really not the final exercise. What determines the success or failure of a government in a modern economy is not only its taxing policy; it has to be a combination, as the Canadian report points out, of taxing policy, or what is called fiscal policy, on the one hand, and monetary policy on the other, together with this third thing which is almost an unknown science in Australia, this business of debt management. This is a term, I would suggest, that is hardly understood in this House. Yet thi two most recent bodies inquiring into situations in any way comparable to that of Australia, namely the Radcliffe committee in Great Britain and this committee that is sitting at present in Canada, point to this business of debt management as being a much more significant exercise in those countries than it is in Australia. If we were not in the dying hours of the Parliament I would go into this matter at greater length than, perhaps, thc House is prepared to have me go at the moment. I suggest, at any rate, that the incoming government-and I hope it is a different government from the present one, because if it is, my words and thoughts will perhaps be considered of greater significance than thcy appear to be considered at thc moment-shoul d give more attention to this matter than has been given to it in the past. I think we had a measure similar to this last year, allocating a certain amount .of money from the loan fund to defence expenditure. After all, defence expenditure, for the most part, is incurred in a particular year. It is regarded as an annual commitment, and if it is in an annual commitment that vanishes in the year in which it is incurred, it should be met out of revenue and not out of loan funds. But any government, in any year, has to make the decision whether in total it expends more than it collects, or less than it collects, . according to the circumstances; that is, whether there will be a Budget surplus on the one hand or a Budget deficit on the other is a question of the economic circumstances of the time. We believe that, in the economic circumstances of this (ime it is wise for the Government to have a Budget deficit, so that it will be spending more than it is collecting, because there arc certain slacknesses in thc economy. I .suggest that in the long run the slacknesses in the economy arise from the fact of deficiencies in family groups of income, so that those family groups are not spending as much as the capacity of the economy can produce. The quickest way to correct the situation is to add to thc incomes of the family groups in the economy, because these family groups are the readiest spenders. I hope that in thc next few weeks you will hear more details as to how the Labour Party proposes to achieve this. Meanwhile, as we all know, we on this side of the House have suggested that there should be no unemployment in Australia. No one would ever interpret that as meaning that at no point of time would there be any persons who had become redundant in their jobs and had not found other jobs somewhere else. If anybody on the Government side suggests that all of the 58,000 people registered as unemployed are in this latter category, then I think he is underestimating the problem that faces the Australian community. I repeat that we have 58,000 people out of work-and that is too many-and 29,000 unfilled jobs. When we couple this .with the likelihood that within the next, three months 80,000 to 100,000 young people will, come on to the labour market, we see a much more serious situation than this Government seems to have allowed fpr. .Question resolved in the affirmative.

176,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [10.41]. Adopted In Name At Least By Australia In,"""Hansard"" pages 38 and'39 of this book which set out figures taken from reputable United Nations statistical sources. I think they would be enlightening to honourable members. Standards of living, as measured by gross national product, are set out according to countries. I refer again to the index of 1,500 dollars per head of population for Australia. The first group of countries listed, numbering about 50 arc countries whose standard of living is less than 100 dollars per head per annum. The author then lists another group of countries whose standards of living are between 100 and 200 dollars per head per annum, a third group whose standards are between 200 and 300 dollars per head per annum, and finally a group whose standards are between 300 and 700 dollars per head per annum. At that stage he still has not encompassed the standard wbich Australia has reached. The author of this book, which aims to provide a development programme,, goes on to sayDevelopment programs are investments in people are congregated not very far from Australia. and prosperity-and investments in peace and freedom as well. They are not the remarks of a wild, radical enthusiast. They are the remarks of a member of the very conservative government of the country that is regarded as the home of private enterprise. The objective of the bill is to increase the amount of aid which is given to thc under-developed areas of the world. Assistance is to be given to those countries to raise their income standards from the level of 100 dollars Or 200 dollars and to bring them closer to the Australian standard of 1,500 dollars per annum per person. The measure provides that Australia should contribute over a three-year period 20,000,000 dollars or about £9,000,000, so we see how piffling is the approach to raising the living standards of 2,000,000,000 people. The author of the book "" World Without Want"" puts into perspective the attitude of the community as a whole to this very ascendant problem when he points out that 8 billion dollars a year is required to finance development adequately and that thc annual expenditure of member countries of the United Nations on defence in 1962 was scheduled at 120 billion dollars. He draws a very pregnant contrast between the amount of money spent by member countries of the United Nations on defence against aggression and the amount needed to raise the standard of living of thc people of the under-developed countries. Wc hear talk in this House, particularly from the other side, of why money has to be provided for defence. We are told that we have to defend ourselves against Communist aggression. Occasionally we ought to ask ourselves why it is that people in other parts of the world want to go Communist politically. The principal reason is that what has been offered to them as democracy-the y have identified it to a great extent with the colonial empires of the past-ha s not been of much use in helping to raise their standards of living. I bave always felt that the most significant step in combating communism is to remove tbe conditions in which it nourishes. Communism flourishes in the discontent, poverty and economic inadequacy which affect the millions of people who live in thc underdeveloped parts of the world. Most of them The total annual expenditure on defence by all the countries that belong to the United Nations, an organization formed to adjudicate on disputes between nations, is 120 billion dollars, or £A60,000,000,000. That is near enough to eight times the annual gross national product of Australia. It represents about eight times the total value of all the goods and services we produce, of the private and public investment and of the private and public spending, which amounts amounts to £8,000,000,000 a year. The member countries of the United Nations spend about eight times that amount in defending themselves against aggression from one another. When you press these countries on the point it is apparent that they are preparing to. defend themselves in terms of two contending economic systems. In this part of the world, we say we are defending ourselves against communism. I hope, and I am sure that many of my colleagues hope, that the countries of the world will do more to get together and to remove the disparities between the rich and the poor. I hope that they will move as readily to co-operate in this field as. they seem to move in the direction of making pacts or treaties to defend themselves, according to the particular political grouping that they regard as admirable.

177,Mr Bury (Wentworth) [11.1],"I welwe are now voting funds. The International Bank is staffed with experts. It is in touch with the problems of the whole world, and, over a period of years, it has developed a sympathetic attitude towards underdeveloped countries; it has provided the right kind of technical advice to them and it has set them along the right road. The International Development Association is born out of the fact that the credit worthiness of these countries for borrowing across the commercial exchanges is limited. The International Bank fills the gap that cannot be filled in the first place by the money markets, and, when the commitments of individual countries rise beyond their capacity to repay in the normal commercial way, the International Development Association comes to the rescue to fill at least part of the gap. As the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) and small sums, at least it is satisfactory to know the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that they are well spent and well, applied. pointed out, it has two classes of members. In one class are the contributors who are, in the main, the more advanced countries. 247,000,000 dollars has been applied to In the other class are those who are qualitransport projects of various kinds. Almost fied to receive this kind of long-term loan half the money has been used to develop on which interest is not paid, and which is transport which in itself is one of the repayable very slowly over a long period of developments which sparks off many other time.

That money was used entered into commitments involving 40 for municipal water supplies and school conindividual credits for development purposes struction, two things which, in tbe end, are to eighteen different countries. The value more conducive than almost anything else of these loans is that they are all individually to the ultimate development of the countries well planned and applied in the kind of concerned. spots that do need economic advancement. In themselves, they may not be so very great, but they do touch the key points scriptions to the International Development which form the springboards of subsequent Association is that, up to July, £504,000,000 development. It is interesting to note how out of the total original contributions of the 504,000,000 dollars involved in the 40 about. £740,000,000 had been committed, development credits has been allocated and further contributions were necessary to. under the processes of the International Bank. First, the merits of the project are appraised and good advice is given as to what kind of priorities should be adopted within the recipient countries. The second process is that of negotiating credits which in itself is a useful process of education for those under-developed countries which are participating. There are then all the other requirements which have to be met for procurement. We would regard this as somewhat irksome, but it does introduce into the countries concerned a proper mode of procedure which is. useful on subsequent occasions. Then there is the procedure for the disbursement of funds. Finally, regular progress reports on the construction of the various schemes must be made. This is all important, and it should be important to the Australian taxpayers because whether we are called upon to provide large sums or Of the 504,000,000 dollars of credits, to telecommunications, which play an important part in themselves, was The reason for this call for further subprovide for continuity of operations in transmore important than loans. Above all, we actions between the International Development Association and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the one hand and potential borrowers on the other, involving the commitment of funds, though thc funds will not be drawn for a considerable time ahead. We may say that Australia's share of the additional contributions is relatively small. However, it is interesting to note that, on a percentage basis, Australia stands eighth in the list of conlributors to tbe International Development Association. Our high placing, I think, represents a record and contribution of which we can be proud. We can be assured that we are contributing at least our proportionate share to what is essentially a world and human cause, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports emphasized. When we look at our contribution, we must remember, too, that it represents only a small part of what Australia is doing for international development of various sorts. In fact, as thc Treasurer pointed out, our total provision for international assistance in growing extent, so is that of the United this year's Budget amounts to about £44,000,000, if we include our assistance to Papua and New Guinea. We must include our assistance to that Territory, because it is primarily AustraUa's responsibility. It is also, perhaps, our greatest burden and is likely to be our greatest burden in the future. The total provision this financial year for international assistance represents, as the Treasurer stated, an increase of almost one-quarter compared wilh the provision made in 1962-63. Australia's provision for international assistance hand like Malaya and Singapore, and even is growing. As set out in pubUcations of the United Nations and other authorities, this contribution may look rather smaU, but, nevertheless, it is a very solid contribution and for thc most part is well directed, well planned and well placed. All that remains for me to do now is to point out one or two things that the Treasurer said about these matters. I suggest that those who have not done so read the speeches that he made at the recent meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in which he made some important points. The crucial one is that, for under-developed countries,' market opportunities are probably have so to arrange the world as to afford those countries an opportunity to earn their living, because anything that savours of charity, however desirable in itself and however disguised to satisfy the ego of the receiver, is bound to leave in its wake some unfortunate feeling of obligation. So, not only from the point of view of those countries but also from ours, the greater the extent to which the under-developed countries can earn their living in world trade, the better it wili be for all. The road that leads to that objective would be a far better road to follow than the path of aid. Unfortunately, for some time past, though perhaps not at present-and only temporarily-the terms of trade have turned against the under-cffcveloped countries and reduced their earning opportunities. The Treasurer, in Washington, also directed attention to the fact that Mr Wood, tbe new president of the International Bank, had pointed out the importance of developing the capital markets of the world. Hitherto, the British market has been well tuned to international lending and, to a States of America. But it is certainly true, as the Treasurer and Mr Wood pointed out, that the more the developing countries can condition their affairs to make the climate of foreign investment congenial, the faster tbeir economic progress is likely to be. One has only to visit countries immediately to our north, which are of great interest to us, readily to see the differences between the economic progress and the whole outlook of countries on the one Thailand, which encourage and assiduously foster development financed by foreign capital, and on the other hand countries such as Burma, which gives it a very frigid and difficult reception and, perhaps Indonesia, which adopts a difficult attitude for various reasons. If the developing countries adjust their affairs to permit a good flow of foreign investment on a wide front in multifarious fields of activity, their economic progress is likely to be very much more rapid. On thc other side of the picture, there is scope for improvement of the capital market, particularly in western Europe, where a number of countries have for some time been running into heavy balance-of-j>ayknow that 'this association is the baby of ment surpluses.

178,Mr Uren (Reid) [11.18],"Mr Deputy The purpose of this association was to lendcent. as. administrative costs. When tbe original measure related to this association was introduced, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) and 1 spoke in the debate and applauded the formation of the association. However, we said that it should have been established some thirteen years earlier. The bill now before the House seeks approval of a contribution of 19,800,000 dollars to tbe association. We support the Government's action in this regard. However, I do not agree that we have a proud record with thc International Bank. It is a disgraceful record. We have taken money that should have been made available to other more needy countries. We should not have borrowed from thc International Bank in any circumstances. I want to deal briefly with one other point. In his second-reading speech, the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) saidI am convinced that the problem could be foreshortened if sufficient recognition were given to the role that private capital could play. I pointed out-and I was glad to hear the president of the International Bank also stress the pointthat a country that is hospitable to private investAgricultural Organization reported that the ment would have access over the years to a larger poorer countries are worse fed than ever nnd more stable pool of resources and technology and that the richer countries are better fed. than its neighbour which sought to rely solely on governmental aid. J have no doubt private capital could provide a short-term solution to the problem, but in the long-term this could be a hindrance. We know the great problem that has arisen in this country from thc indiscriminate inflow of private capital and the even greater problems that will arise in the future. However, the Treasurer and the honourable member for Wentworth still advocate that private capital is the solution to all the problems. I do not think that it is. I think the solution is for the association to give long-term loans, charging only administrative costs, or for loans to be given on a government to government basis at low rates of interest. The International Bank must be given credit for what is perhaps its greatest achievement, and that is the Indus Basin scheme. Mr Eugene Black, who was then tbe president of the International Bank, negotiated the agreement between India and Pakistan. Despite arguments over the years between these two .countries, agreement was. reached on this matter. This was a wonderful achievement for the International Bank. It took far too long for the conservative banking institutions of the world to establish the International Development Association. I say now that the amount of money being made available by this association is insufficient. It should be doubled and trebled and should continue to increase j'ear after year. I do not say that we should give aid to under-developed countries so lhat we can combat communism, but I do say that we should give aid to combat hunger, poverty, disease and illiteracy throughout the world. If people are educated and fed and if thcy are encouraged to progress, we will have no need to worry about any ideology, whether it be of the left or the right, trying to establish itself. This has been the cry of the Australian Labour Party since the early post-war years. We have asserted that this should be our objective, that we should assist underdeveloped countries in every way we can so that they can lift themselves out of the rut of poverty and backwardness. world to-day tbe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The solution to the problem is, to an extent, mentioned in the second-reading speech of the Treasurer. The under-devoloped countries should be given equitable prices for their products. Instead of giving them charity, we should give them justice. They would then move forward much more rapidly than they are. I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for his interjection. If we want to have a peaceful world, we must pay the people in the under-developed countries a fair price for their goods and make sure that there is no cornering of markets or exploiting of nations. We commend the bill. We think lhat the International Development Association should have been formed much earlier than it was and that it should make available much more money than it is. We should have a world plan so that the underdeveloped nations can get fair prices for their products",77,International Development Association Additional Contribution Bill 1963

Debate resumed from 17th October (vide page 1980), on motion by Mr in the bill will meet only one-quarter of thc FairbairnThat thc bill be now read a second time. This is a very short bill, and the House has been given a very perfunctory second reading speech to explain it. Mr Harold Holt -It is not a novel proposal. many aspects of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the airlines that demand an explanation. We have not been given that explanation. It will be remembered that before the last elections the Government introduced legislation to effectuate proposals which Mr R. M. Ansett had sent to all honourable members by letter. One of Mr Ansett's proposals was that in no year should air navigation charges be increased by more than 10 per cent, In the relevant year there was no increase of air ' navigation charges because of the recession which the Government had brought about in general business' activity and with it the decline.in air travel. Last year, however, of £3,264,000. The loss therefore suffered air navigation charges were increased. by 10 per cent, and this year they are to be increased by a further 10 per cent. The Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation in this place estimated that in 1963-64 revenue from air navigation charges as a result of the increase provided for in this bill, will amount to £1,700,000 compared with the amount of £1,483,000 obtained in 1962-63. It would seem,' however, that the increase in revenue' will scarcely meet the increase in air navigation costs. We are not given an estimate of the increase in air navigation costs, but between 1961-62 and 1962-63 thcy increased by £856,000 costs increased between the financial year before last and last financial year by £856,000. The Minister has estimated that the increase in air navigation charges provided for in the bill will bring in an extra £217,000, which is only one-quarter of the amount of the increase in costs between last financial year and 1961-62. We do not know what the increase in costs will be this year but it is reasonable to assume that thc increase in charges provided for increase in costs. Air navigation is the form of transport which is subsidized most heavily by Australian governments. We are very often told by Commonwealth politicians how inefficient, and therefore expensive, are State railways. We do not say the same thing about the Commonwealth Railways because the Commonwealth Railways has been favoured with modern equipment. Like any other railways using modern equipment, they pay handsomely, but the State railways have hot been so favoured. The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission shows that in 1961-62 the State railways lost £18,639,000. After including payments for interest, sinking fund and exchange on capital chargeable to loan accounts but excluding debt charges of which the railways have been relieved, the State railways' incurred a loss of £18,639,000. In the last financial year the Commonwealth bore air navigation costs amounting to £16,755,000 and received a total revenue from air navigation charges by the Commonwealth, or the subsidy paid on . air transport, amounted to about £13,500,000. The. deficit of the State railways in the previous financial year was about £18,600,000. . The number of passengers who travelled by aircraft and in respect of whom the Gommonwealth incurred costs or from whom it derived revenue was 3,930,000. Therefore the Commonwealth pays an average subsidy of £3 8s. per air traveller in Australia or in the Territory .of Papua and New Guinea, or going or returning from .overseas. This is a very heavy subsidy.",78,International Development Association Additional Contribution Bill 1963

Mr Harold Holt -What did the States pay on State railways? many passengers and how much freight are carried on the State railways. In the last financial year for which figures are moved forthwith. available the losses of the six State railway systems amounted to £18,600,000. That is less than half as much again as the a third time. loss or the subsidy incurred by the Commonwealth on air travel. Air travel is the form of transport which is most heavily subsidized by governments in Australia and it is really the business of members of the Federal Parliament to consider to what extent this subsidy is justified. Most people who travel by air do not pay the subsidy themselves.

Some T. and P.I. and T.T.I, married couples who are also social services pensioners will be similarly affected.
