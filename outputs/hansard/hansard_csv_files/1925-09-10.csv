OP BUTTER senting the Minister for Markets and Migration, upon notice1. H'ow long has the Dairy Produce Control Board been functioning? 2. What has it done up to *he present time? 3. What increase, if any, has it brought about in the price paid to the Australian dairy farmer for his butter fat? 4. Did the farmers receive an immediate increase in the price of butter after the Act came into force, as prophesied by the Treasurer, when the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill was before the House last session? 5. What action does the Government intend to take to ensure a living wage to the dairy farmers of Australia? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Since the Oth May, 1925, 2. During the short period of its existence the board has laid down the conditions and restrictions under which licences to export butter and cheese shall be issued, and his also taken steps to establish its London agency. Further, it has secured a reduction in the rates of marine insurance which, it is estimated, will effect a saving to the dairy industry this year of over £20,000. 3, 4, and 5. Under the Dairy Produce Export Control Act tlie powers of the board are limited to tlie control of the export and the sale and distribution after export of Australian -butter and cheese. This control only commenced with the shipment of the first of this season's dairy produce about six weeks ago. It is hoped that the board, by an organized system of oversea marketing, by judicious advertising, by effecting savings in the rates of marine insurance, and in other directions, will enable the Australian dairy farmer to secure satisfactory prices in future for the surplus butter and cheese exported from the Commonwealth. upon notice1. In regard to. the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator's determination No. 6 of 1923, respecting salaries to be paid to officers of the assessing brandies of the Treasury Department, is it the intention of the Treasurer that additional payments, due under that determination, are to be denied to Commonwealth officers transferred to the services of tlie States pursuant to the Income Tax Collection Act 1923, in respect of any advancement of the taxation agreements, whereas any payment now being made is reduced at the expiration of one month from the removal of the officer to a lower section? 2. If so, why is this determination being thus applied in part only? wealth is responsible for payment of any difference of salary between what the State allotted and what the officer so transferred was receiving at date of transfer, including allowances to permanent occupants of the positions covered by determination No. 6 of 1923. In all States except New South Wales, the Commonwealth also recognizes annual increments due under such award to permanent occupants of assessing positions, provided they have completed twelve months' service in each subdivision. So far as New South Wales is concerned, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General has advised that under the provisions of the amalgamation agreement, New South Wales officers are not entitled to incremental advancement under the determination No. 6 of",14,Polled Hereford Cattle

Will the Government accede to the request of the Queensland Government and the Queensland Council of Agriculture for a Federal bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton, instead of thc present guaranteed price under State control? 0. What is thc approximate amount that tfnglaud pays annually to other countries for raw cotton, and approximately what amount is paid to each country from which England Imports raw cotton? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and S. These particulars are being obtained, and will be made available as soon as practicable. 4. A definite decision in regard to this mat* ter cannot be readied until the views of the State Governments concerned are forthcoming. On the 14th August last, the Prime Minister communicated to the State Governments the proposals of tlie Commonwealth in regard to tlie guarantee for the coming season. The Victorian Government has accepted those proposals, but replies have not yet heen received from the other Governments concerned. 5. This question is at present under consideration. 0.

I am now able to furnish the following information:1. Yes. 2.

If so, the rates and special conditions mentioned ? 3. Isi t possible to state what is the amount of the saving in insurance to the dairymen of Australia, as compared with the previous rates charged f ' I am now in a position to furnish the following information: 1. Yes. 2. The reduced rates of insurance to the United Kingdom, the Continent of Europe, and the east coast of North America as arranged by the board for the twelve months ending 31st August, 1920, are as follow:Butter.

Thc insurance covers loss from defective condition of the butter and/or cheese from any cause which shall arise, ineluding the risks of war, strikes, malicious damage, or shortage of fuel. 3. The saving to the dairy producers in Australia will be over £20,000, based on last season's export figures.

Navigation Aet Royal Commission-Memo randum supplementary to the Reports, by Mr FAnstey, M.P. WAR PENSIONS. I moveThai in view of the factsL That, when the Australian men offered their lives to fight for their country, the Defence Department had the choice of the greatest surgeons and physicians to examine such men; 2. That they liad tlie advantage of the Health Department and the Health Scientific Department to assist them in deciding whether the men volunteering were in a state of health or not; 3. That hardships of war make more acute and observable latent and obscure weaknesses; 4. That, in view of the many and generous promises continually reiterated from the multitude of enlistment platformsit is the opinion of this House that no soldier who was accepted after passing -such examinations should be refused any rights under the War Pensions Act for himself or his dependants through certain present medical experts giving as their opinion the causes arose from pre-war causes. It is also the opinion of this House that all men who offered their lives, and passed the above scientific examination, should be considered perfectly healthy men from that date. I ask honourable members not to look upon this motion from a party point of view, because it is really an effort to secure justice for ex-soldiers and their dependants. see its way clear to adopt this motion, it would remove many injustices, prevent unkind treatment, and be a boon to the officials who are administering the Repatriation Department. limits of the act and the regulations applying to it , I have found the officials of the department very sympathetic. During the last few weeks I have had a very pleasant experience with the,League of Child Helpers. Connected with thai movement are reputed hard, business meij who, when it came to assisting the -chiV dren, I found, have hearts as soft and as sweet as the petals of a rose. There was not one single refusal to. help those little ones who are at school, and 'who will ultimately be the citizens of Australia. Why should not the Government act in the same way? No honourable member supporting the Government, if .he speaks the truth, will deny that highly capable surgeons and physicians offered their services during the war. Truly, some did object, and I was one of them, to the Town Hall being used as a place' for testing the lungs. Many of our prominent surgeons and physicians, notably the late Dr. O'Hara, Dr. Stirling, and others, offered to the medical officers who were appointed for this work the use of their own private studies for the examination of recruits The Minister will agree that if there had been any doubt about the' matter, the medical officers examining the recruits who were offering their lives for the sake of their country, could have made use of, say, the Health Department to obtain blood tests, and to call together immediately a conclave of surgeons and physicians to formulate an opinion on certain cases. I do not think that I am stepping beyond the line of justice when I say that every man who has passed under those stringent conditions should be taken as healthy at the date of examination, and that no medical officer should now be made, as it were, a private detective to try to ascertain pre-war latent causes of disease. I know many men -who, perhaps, would have fallen victims to tuberculosis had they not been well cared for. A t least, five or six of my personal friends, who seemed to have been sentenced to death by that complaint in England, came out to Australia"" and If the Government could have now lived the allotted ppan of life.

An y one who cares to go to the Christian Science Temple on Wednesday nights w ill see there how the mind controlling physical weaknesses builds up that fighting power without which persons will, perhaps, succumb they would otherwise recover. regard to the promises that were made to the soldiers, no man can speak with greater authority than I can, because I am the only person who was continuously a member of the Victorian Recruiting Committee from its inception u n t i l its disthe few survivors were enabled bandment. given from thousands of platforms throughout. Australia, and endorsed by the men and women in the audiences, should be religiously kept. soldiers i u the recent war have been treated much better than were those who took part in the Boer war. I was opposed to the Boer war, but I never received much credit for my attitude until I visited SouthA f r i ca recently. promises made to the men who enlisted for that campaign were vilely broken, and bhe late Sir John Madden, Chief Justice of Victoria. was man enough to say that publicly. Thinking that it would be well to have his statement on record, I wrote to him a few years before his death, and I have the honour of possessing a letter from him in which he reiterates the declaration I have attributed to him. The soldiers in the great war fared better, but it is a degradation of an honourable profession to ask ii surgeon or physician to probe for a pre-war origin of soldiers' disabilities. Those doctors are being asked to indict their fellow practitioners of in competence for having passed men who were not physically fit. My motion asks that this matter shall be settled once and finally, and that all men who offered their services, were accepted after examination, and have suffered disabilities, shall be entitled to repatriation benefits. Many of these soldiers are limbless, and the' Bulletin of 30th March, 1922, published an appealing cartoon under the heading ' ' I u the Name of ANZAC."" The words beneath the cartoon wereThe khaki tliat onee brought glory to Auson grounds of pre-war disability after tralia is now used chiefly to bring small coins being passed as medically fit at the time of to the hands of musicians, who pervade tbe enlistment. streets of Australian cities, and those of Sydney That is typical of many letters I have rein particular.

I am reminded of that glorious episode of the Crimean war to illnesses from which which Tennyson immortalized' in those In stirring verses, "" The Charge of the Light. Brigade."" How were the Crimean veterans treated ? Many died in the workhouse, and it was only when Sir George Newnes, the famous newspaper projn-ietor, raised a subscription that to The undertakings that were live in comfort for their remaining days. When I was a medical student in EnglandI collected sixpences from fellow students for the purchase .of Certainly the a wheeled chair for a soldier who was without feet.

"" I have a list of the number of Crimean veterans who died in the workhouse during my student years, and up to the time. I l e f t London. The treatment, of those soldiers was a stain on the British nation, and I am. sure that if the opinion of the British people had been sought they would never have permitted such a thing to happen. Every organization, of sailors or soldiers throughout Australia approves of my motion, and agrees that it is u n just to probe into a man's past history in order to ascertain if he had latent pre-war disease, w i th a view to enabling the Commonwealth to escape the payment of a paltry pension. A f t e r all, how insignificant is the total pensions b ill in comparison with the millions of pounds that the Commonwealth spends in other ways? In any case, the number of the pensioners is being reduced almost daily. I quote this letter from the Beechworth sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of AustraliaI have been instructed to inform you that the members of my hranch unanimously support you in your protest against the medical board of review in refusing pensions to men At times the medical profession is very hard to move. A notable instance is its refusal to recognize the celebrated joint manipulator, Sir Herbert Barker. The Archbishop of Canterbury arranged a large deputation of members of the House of Lords in order to get recognition of that great man's valuable services from the British Medical Association, but without avail, so the King conferred upon him the honour of knighthood. A few weeks ago I quoted one of the most glaring instances in medical history of the fallibility of doctors. Queen Victoria would not have ascended the throne of England but for the blundering of the men who, in 1821, stood highest in the medical profession in England. daughter of George IV., was giving birth to a child that, had it lived, would have been King of England, and was experiencing the pains incidental to the expulsion of the child from the womb, the doctors took from her a pint of blood, and, because the pain continued, another pint of blood. The mother was actually bled to death, and, of course, the child also died. In his memoirs Baron Stockmar, a medical man who had been sent by the Court of Prussia to control the Court of England, and did, in fact, exertive interference, December, 1916, declared percise a great influence over Queen Victoria for many years, said he could not understand why a healthy young woman, when her body was performing a natural function, should be bled and bled. If the highest lady in the land lost her life through the ignorance of the most eminent accoucheurs, of that day, we can readily understand what might happen to ot rroXXol Professional ' etiquette sealed Baron Stockmar's lips when he could possibly have saved the lives of both mother and child. Let me refer to the case of Gunner Perry. man, on tbe second or third day of the trial, was sent to the observation ward of mittee in general and the Deputy Commissioner a lunatic asylum, where he was detained for six months, under the charge of Dr. Godfrey, one of God's best men. When I asked Dr. Godfreyi f Gunner Perry was a malingerer, he replied, "" Do you think that if he had been I would have kept him there one day after I had made the discovery?"" Perry afterwards went to Queensland, where he was again accepted by the Defence Department as a recruiting agent. Later, when the authorities ascertained that he was the man who had been involved in the law case, he was dismissed. Subsequently, he persuaded some foolish girl to go through the form of marriage with him; but when she found in his possession a letter from his real wife, and mentioned the matter, he gave her a thrashing. Both then disappeared, probably to commit suicide; and because the Department cannot find him, and his wife cannot prove that he is not dead, her pension has been taken away. I cannot understand an action of that character. When Princess Charlotte, dren ? adopted child, who also has been deprived of her pension.

I recommended liim. to an hospital for surgical treatment. He died as the result of this trouble. To my personal knowledge he was the main support of his mother. Tlie mother raeeived the following, letter from theRepatriation Commission:With reference to your recent application for tlie payment of a war pension in respect to the death of. your son. above described, I have to inform you that your case has now received careful consideration, ami as from the medical evidence your son's death, bears aa connection to* bis war service, the State Repatriation Board Has accordingly directed that your application be disallowed.

In consequence of that reduction, she had to give up her home. I could multiply these casesmany times.. This is. not a party question. I appeal to the Goveru-ment to regard the decisions of the medical officers who passed' men as fit for active service asi the decisions of honourable men who did their duty to the best of their ability,, to act on the assumption that every soldier who enlisted was. a healthy man at the time, and not to allow itself to be diverted from the right path by the shrewd detective tactics of present-day surgeons ancl physicians what say that the disabilities of these soldiers were due to pre-war causes. seconding the motion, Tdesire fa say a few words of commendation: of itsterms axdt of tbe wealth of argument and. illustration which, the honourable member for Melbourne CDi: Maloney)has submitted in its support.

It is true that, in accordance with the policy of the timey it was? considered that there was urgent need for men, but I remember that, notwithstanding that, intending recruits for active service had to submit, to' very searching examinations, and many were rejected for apparently trifling causes-; I mention this because it is au argument in favour of the view that when men, were passed, and accepted for active service it was upon no merely cursory examdnationj. but as the result of deliberate audi careful examination by competent doetors, and those who were accepted unist. betaken to have been at the time int a. good physical condition, and fit for active service.

Whatever credit members of the profession may take for ability to discover disease, no one knows better than does the honourable member for Melbourne, whose experience is life-long, that asthma is a disease which no examination will reveal. before enlistment might have suffered innumerable attacks, and be totally unfitted for service. During an attack he would be unfitted for service in civil life. It was found that 589 men were discharged on account of this disease, and 241 had had repeated attacks of asthma, ancl were returned and discharged without I w ill deal now with mental cases. I in this House, and particularly the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), has said at some time or other concerning some one, "" He ought not to be at liberty."" We frequently hear it said in civil life about some one with whom the speaker is not on very friendly terms, "" It would be better if he were placed under control."" The honourable the age of member for Melbourne, in his long and varied experience, must have met many cases which needed to be so dealt with. Mental disabilities will not always be revealed by the most carefully conducted During the examination. How could we think of going back, as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) suggested, seven years, to the beginning of the war, to ascertain the condition then of certain men who volunteered ? Of the mentally defective men who volunteered and were passed as fit, 591 saw service-whe n I say "" saw service,"" I mean that they went somewhere in the vicinity of the line, to the base at Havre or Boulogne -and 26.1 did not see service. A large number of those men had previously been under control in asylums. However much honourable members may believe in the skill of medical practitioners, I say that it is impossible, without the help of the person examined, for a medical man to say with certainty, "" You are perfectly healthy."" All that any medical practitioner can say after the most carefully conducted examination is, "" I do not find any evidence of disease."" It would not follow that the person exI t did not amined was healthy. This is particularly true of persons suffering from asthma, mental diseases, and particularly rheumatism. No clinician could possibly diagnose rheumatism which was not manifested by some joint deformity, unless the patient gave him some assistance. No insurance company could last for more than a decade if it insured persons merely on the results of a medical examination. Every person who desires to An applicant for examination take out an insurance policy must not only be examined, but must also give written answers to definite questions, which he signs in the presence of a medical practitioner. As1 have said, a medical examination would not reveal chronic rheumatism or arthritis the presence of which was not indicated by joint deformity. Of the men who enlisted while suffering from these troubles, 4,461 saw any service in a war zone. service, but 1,257 were not in the line for a single day.

I consider that many of the sufferersfrom this trouble deliberately defrauded the countiy. A considerable majority of them must have known of their trouble. Possibly their attaeks occurred during their childhood and at night time, but they must have been -medically treated at that time, and their parents must have informed them of their condition. In most of these cases the men were deliberately dishonest in tha* they did not render the medical officer who examined them the least assistance. We found 661 cases of epilepsy among men who enlisted and embarked, In every case in which even a minor war injury might have .been said to have contributed to the epilepsy the sufferers were sympathetically dealt with and were granted a pension, but no matter how sympathetically the act might be administered, it would be grossly unfair to the -country to grant pensions to 277 of those cases who saw no active service. Seeing that the medical practitioners who examined these men could not possibly have detected their condition without their help, and that the men deliberately withheld this, it would bo unfair to the public to grant them a pension. They wilfully deceived the examiners in not disclosing the details of their health, and they are not entitled to any pension except the ordinary invalid pension. It has to be remembered tnat there are two parties to be considered in the granting of pensions. On the one hand there is the ex-soldier or his dependants, and on the other there is the great body of men and women who remained at home, but who, in many cases, carried out duties equally as arduous as those performed by some of those who went abroad. The honourable member for Melbourne 'knows very well what was promised from the public platform. The first -promise was that so far as 1 possible medical attention equal to that which would have been available had the man remained at home would be provided for him abroad. I can honestly say that I have heard very little reflection upon the medical service rendered OTSHTseas. The second promise was that every the most deliberately dissympathetically in regard to every conmen, from .the health ceivable disability that could be considered to be the result of war service, and that consideration would also be given to any aggravation of pre-war disabilities. Mr 3. FRANCES -Will the Minister tell us what steps have been taken to ascertain the extent of aggravation of pre-war disabilities? every ease in which a pre-war disability has been materially aggravated, a pension is granted. When I say ""materially aggravated,"" I think I am touching another point referred to by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). He said that the whole question of aggravation was governed by the spirit in which the act was administered. If the act is -administered with sympathy and justice, those men will get, the benefit of any doubt that exists. Lately, in respect of numerous cases that have come up for medical opinion, the medical men have said, "" We cannot find any reasonable cause, but as there is some shadow of doubt, the patient should get the benefit of it . "" The benefit .of the doubt was in this way recently given in the case of a returned soldier who died in an asylum.. policy to be to give the benefit of thp doubt to the claimants? . sured the House that during the time that I have the honour to control the Repatriation Department the benefit of the doubt will be given in every case submitted to me. Tubercular cases are probably the most difficult to deal with. 1 gave as an illustration that of a man who had been for three or six months in a sanatorium.. He was able to pass a medical examination, and to go away on service. This man actually got to the front, and his application for a pension was accepted, despite the fact that he must have intentionally deceived the examining medical officer.

76,Sir Neville Howse,"I have as to me, say, "" If you will look at this case from a sympathetic point of view, this man will get a pension."" I cannot possibly do so. As the Minister controlling the Repatriation Department, I have to administer the act, and I obey the instruction of the Government to administer it liberally. I assure honourable members that it is impossible to go beyond that. If honourable members wish -tliese 60,000 men to receive a pension, it is for them to amend the act, but there is no justification whatever for its amendment. It is the most liberal measure of its kind in force in -any country in the world. The men are treated with sympathy. Every care and attention is given to those who are ill in hospital, and .every effort is made to administer the act so as to carry out the promises which every Government has given since the commencement of the war. Governments of both political parties Are concerned in these promises. It will be remembered that the greatest number of the men who went away enlisted when a Labour Government was in power, and the promises of that Government, the preceding Government, and the Governments that have followed, have been carried out to the letter. Before proposing to amend the act, I should like honourable members to review the matter with great care. The honourable member for Melbourne suffers from only one disability. He has in his chest an organ called the' heart, which shoidd weigh about 11 ounces, but, judging from my experience of him, must weigh 11 lbs. only wish that those examining the returned soldiers had the kind heart that the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) possesses, because the men treatment. The Minister referred to the 20,000 men who travelled only as far as England. when they reached England, had to live under army conditions. I -am not complaining of those conditions, because they were as good as could possibly be obtained at that time. But the great majority of the men were not used to them. ferent from that of Australia, and I can quite imagine, without being a doctor, that a man when in England might display symptoms of tuberculosis that -would never have appeared,had he remained in Australia. Many of those men contracted meningitis i i i England and on the troopships. Many of the 40,000 men that remained in Australia were also victims of meningitis. As one honourable member stated, some of the things affecting bhe aggravation of diseases may not be known to medical men. I agree with what the Minister said about the excellent servioe rendered by the medical ofiicers abroad. I do not think that the soldiers could have received better treatment than they did at their hands, and it would not be possible to find a better body of men than those who devoted their lives to tbe medical treatment of the members of the Australian Imperial Force. All soldiers were inoculated and vaccinated. could not affect the honourable member's constitution. about the after -effects of inoculation. It is quite possible that many of the men aTe to-day suffering from the effects of inoculation. The morning when I left for FranceI could not get my arm in my coat sleeve. I thought that the swelling would never go down. Inoculation affects people differently. All that we are pleading for is more sympathetic treatment. We are not asking for pensions for men who were in asylums prior to enlistment, and became mental after their return, although they must have been sane when they offered their lives for their country. Quitej , number of returned soldiers axe not treated sympathetically by the doctors. Again and again it is stated that certain persons are suffering from pre-war disabilities. Tuberculosis or asthma may be in the family, but it is possible that the would then get sympathetic disease would not have developed had the sufferer not enlisted. It may have been aggravated by climatic conditions, by Those men, living in trenches and dug-outs, by long and arduous marches, by the food consumed, and a thousand and one other things. Many of these men had they stayed at home would probably now be enjoying the best of health. They aTe receiving the most unsympathetic treatment, and the pledges made on the reThe climate was entirely difcruiting platforms are not being carried out. Now that seven years have elapsed since the war, I ask the Minister not to accept the statement that a man is suffering from a pre-war disability.

The cost will not be very great, because we are not asking for an increased pension for those who wilfully deceived the examining officers. I am speaking on behalf of those who went away in the best of health, but through some unknown cause are now suffering from infirmity, and are consequently unable to earn their living. It is for these men that the honourable member for Melbourne has moved the motion this afternoon, and I have much pleasure iu supporting it . The motion submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne introduces for discussion the most complicated question troubling the Repatriation Department to-day, namely, whether the disability from which a soldier is suffering is due to war service or to soni6 pre-war disease. Undoubtedly the health of every one who served in the field during the war was affected in some way or other, and in consequence his life has been shortened. I a layman, without fear of contradiction. I have held for some time the view that the application of any man who served in any theatre of war with his unit should be accepted for consideration without the slightest hesitation or further inquiry. has pointed out that if the motion were agreed to 60,000 extra people would be entitled to pensions. do not doubt that. I have previously said that those who did serve in any actual theatre of war, whether it was Gallipoli, France. Flanders, Egypt, or Palestine, should be granted a pension regardless of any trace of pre-war disability. examined in Ballarat, another examinaHonorable members will agree that the provisions of the Repatriation Act are It was promised that it generous. The act has been amended repeatedly at the request of the organizations of the returned soldiers themselves and of honourable members on both sides of the House. It has been amended also to conform with various decisions of the Government to make its provisions more generous. I agree with the honourable members for Ballarat and Batman that the real crux of the question is the symam sure that no honourable member asks for more than that. I should like to refer to one case in particular, which makes me hop'eful that there will be sympathetic administration of the act so long as the present Minister remains in office. I have endeavoured for years to get an increased pension for an unfortunate widow whose husband died in an asylum. I believe that the Minister referred to this case. It was maintained that his death was dut to a pre-war disability. He served for years in the Australian Imperial Eorce, and for a period in the trenches in France, and even if he had this pre-war disability I cannot see how it could be maintained that it was not aggravated by war service. His widowwas certainly entitled to an adequate pension, and, to my great pleasure, she has now received one retrospective to the date of the death of her husband. Everything depends on the sympathetic administration of the Repatriation Department, and I am satisfied that the present Minister will do his best for the men whose disabilities have arisen from, or have been aggravated by, war service. was pleased to hear that the Minister proposes to amend the act to enable certain men, whose applications were previously rejected, to receive a pension. I have fresh in my mind the case of a returned soldier named James Millen, and I want an assurance from the Minister that he The Minister will receive better treatment. Before enlistment he was a strong, healthy man, who, although a native of Scotland, had I lived in Australia for many years. He was doing very hard work when he was medically examined.

84,"Make That Statement, Even As Mr Mcneill (Wannon) [4.5]","ITherefore, each soldier must have passed several severe examinations before he embarked from Australia. This man travelled only as far as Egypt. I have interviewed several of his colleagues who during which he contracted a cold while sleeping on the sands of Egypt. He was returned to Australia as unfit for further service, and has been receiving a pension that has been reduced to about £ 1 a week. Recently he became ill , and started for Melbourne in order to seek admission to the sanatorium, but when he reached Ballarat his condition was such that he had to enter the local hospital. The honourable membei for Ballarat( Mr. McGrath) and I interviewed the Deputy Repatriation Commissioner (M. ajor Ryan), ! who, although very sympathetic, said that the act was so rigid that there was no possibility of that man being admitted to the sanatorium. That young fellow's days are numbered. He did his best-h e offered his life-and , having been accepted by the military authorities for active service, he is entitled to exnect the country to look after him for the remainder of his days. He is incapacitated for work, and if he desires to become an inmate of the sanatorium, he surely should be eligible for admission I ask the Minister for an assurance that this and similar cases will receive his sympathetic consideration. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that every man who went to the front, and who was returned to Australia in impaired health, is entitled to assistance in accordance with the promise made to the soldiers when they enlisted, that their country would never allow them to want. It is our bounden duty to see that these men receive the sympathy and assistance they need, and I hope the Minister will introduce an amendment of tbe act to enable that to be done. When I first saw this notice of motion on the business-paper, it recalled to my mind several discussions that have taken place regarding this subject. to mean that any man who was accepted for active service must be presumed to have been in good health at the time of enlistment. The Minister has shown that that is not so, and those who served in the Australian Imperial Force know that many men were passed as fit who knew that they were not in sound health. I , for instance, would never have passed the medical examination had I not resorted to a subterfuge. Honourable members will recollect that in the early days of the war it was not expected to last long, and those who desired to go to the f r o n t were were with him on the night anxious to be accepted for military service as soon as possible. Although the great majority of the men who enlisted actually desired to see active service, we unfortunately cannot shut our eyes to certain facts, and I know of many men who joined the Expeditionary Force without any intention of narticipating in the fighting. That statement crnnot be gainsaid, although I , as a member of the Australian Imperial Force, am reluctant to make it . Some who went as far as England"" swung the lead,"" or "" worked their nut,"" so that they were not sent to France, or, at any rate, became merely ""base wallahs"" a long way behind the line. Amongst those who enlisted were men who came originally from the United Kingdom, and desired to revisit their relatives there after a long absence; they would not be likely to disclose to the medical officer their ailments. If the medical officer passed them, they were very pleased, because they were able to get a trip to their native land. There they disclosed their complaints to the camp medical officer in the hope that they would not be sent to France, but would either be left in. the United Kingdom or returned to Australia. Unfortunately, such instances came under my notice as a camp adjutant in England. In that camp we had a couple-of thousand men newly arrived from Australia, and immediately on arrival they obtained the usual disembarkation leave. As soon as they returned from leave some of them went on sick parade. Their object in going overseas had been attained. The enlistments in Australia totalled 416,S09, of which 331,946 embarked for service overseas. It w ill be seen that 84,863 men who joined the Australian Imperial ForceI interpret it did not leave Australia. Does the honourable member for Melbourne desire that those men shall be able to claim a pension in respect of any disability from which they now suffer? A pension is intended to be a recompense for disability caused through war service, in order to make the income of the recipient approximate the earning capacity of a man in",27,Neville Howse Tha T Can Be Pathetic Administration Of The Act And I

I consider that if a man of that age was prepared to fight for his country, he should be entitled to any pension which in other circumstances would' bepayable to him. From the remarks' of honorable members, if would appear that they have, generally-, been successful in their dealings with the officers of the Repatriation Department in connection with cases in which they have interested themselves. My experience has been different. Recently, when in the country, I met a returned soldier who was wounded so badly, and had undergone so many operations,, that he still had two suppurating wounds in Ms body. When I saw him he was still wearing bandages. With difficulty, he can drive a motor car, and because some employer, in a desire to help him; gave him employment as a motor driver, the department! reduced hispension very considerably. That is dealing with soldiers on a commercial basis. Tne man referred to fs not likely to recover, and he should be entitled to his f u l l pension.

At one time the Executive Council had very little power. Its members met for a conference, but they had no power. The Executive Council of the island has today, and has had for some time past, the power to make suggestions for new ordinances or the alteration of existing ordinances. gestions only to the Administrator. is bound to forward them to the Government, and I am satisfied that the Government, no matter to which party it might belong, would give the best consideration to any suggestions made. ' made to stop the aggregation of land? For many years past the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders have claimed, as they do now, that the island was given to them, and they have a right to do as they like with it. Neither the Government of New South Wales nor the Commonwealth Government has ever conceded that claim. tended powers to the Executive Council is merely an experiment to gauge the ability of the residents of Norfolk Island to manage their own affairs. The granting to them of f u l l powers. of local government will be decided in the light of the experience gained. The honourable entitled to a pension under the act? member for New England stated that the local clerk of petty sessions informed him that he is dissatisfied with the treatresidents of a territory of the Commonment he has received as a servant of the wealth. Commonwealth Government. This officer was in the office of the administration when the territory was transferred to the Commonwealth. At that time he was in receipt of a salary of £104 per annum, ancl since the territory has been under the control of the Commonwealth his salary has been increased to £370 per annum, so that it cannot be said that he has been altogether forgotten. he received only £104? junior officer when he received that salary, but he is now in receipt of a salary of £370 from the Commonwealth Government. It will not be contended that that is a very large salary, but honourable members must be aware that the cost of livingis very much lower in Norfolk Island than it is in Australia. The honourable member for New England referred to a communication he received from a member of the progress association of the island to the effect that it was rumoured that Mr Wilson, the new clerk being sent there, is there for the purpose of ""gathering information,"" and asking whether it would be safe to confide in him the business of the association. Mr Wilson is the man to whom I have just referred as the officer who has been seconded from, the Home aud Territories Department. He will remain on the island for two years. He has been sent there, not to "" gather information,"" but to fill a position rendered vacant by the retirement of an officer. When his two years are up another will be appointed from the department to take his place. The honourable member asked why old age pensions could not be paid on the island. According to the act, these pensions can only be paid in the Commonwealth. If an old-age pensioner leaves the Commonwealth his pension automatically ceases. The Government and the pension authorities are taking into consideration a proposal that if old-age pensioners care to take up their residence on Norfolk Island their pensions will be continued to them.",30,Norfolk Island Administration

The Pacific Gable Board at one time supplied the islanders with a news service, but owing to a different roufceing of messages the staff the honourable member for New England at Norfolk Island was decreased, and the Pacific Cable Board said that it could not supply the news scsrvice any longer unless the islanders contributed a certain amount towards the cost. The islanders would not consider any payment towards the cost, and the Government took the matter into consideration and supplies the islanders Avith a weekly news service through the publicity branch of the Prime Minister's Department.

I have no desire to present time, nothwithstanding the allecast aspersions upon the present head of gations which the honourable member has that department. He is a very capable made. work of a royal commission to find out what, the islanders want. all possible, it is the duty of members of this Parliament to visit the island, as has done, in order to obtain first-hand information concerning the conditions there. I might suggest to honourable members opposite that a good time for them to visit the island would be during the next elections. The honourable member for New England, having brought under our notice some alleged disabilities of the Norfolk Islanders, has done his duty to them and to the House. He has given us the benefit of the experience he gained on his trip, and honourable members listened to his remarks with interest. I am sorry that the Government cannot see its way to grant the commission for which he asks, and I hope that, having ventilated the grievances of the islanders, he will be satisfied with the reply of the Home and Territories Department. people of Norfolk Island.

114,Mr Maee,"I will say thai, if it is at",32,Norfolk Island Administration
115,Mr Thompson (New England),"that he ia utterly steeped ia the traditions of red tapeism. The very fact that the Government turned down the request of the Administrator for a wireless receiving sel!, with which to supply items of news to the islanders, and said that the matter must stand over until next year's Estimates, when the expense would be a mere bagatelle, proves that the Minister does not take a great deal of interest in the island., simple matter to accede to so reasonable a request by the Administrator. When the Government, without any valid reason, turns down the request of the people of Norfolk Island,, as conveyed through me, there is very little inducement for Pederal. members to travel far afield to gather information for the sympathetic consideration of this House. To accede to my request would not involve the Commonwealth in any great expenditure. I am satisfied that there are members on both aides of this House who would be glad to visit the island for health reasons, as well as from a desire to obtain information about its conditions. The reply of the Government to the request that has been made: is to say to the islanders, "" We cannot be bothered with you. There is nothing wrong in the island."" The islanders believe that many thingsare wrong there; and the refusal of the Government to accede to their request for a commission of inquiry is an affront, not only to: the people of the island, but also to the intelligence of members of this House. Persons who have never been to the island, and know nothing about it, tell those who have been there that they do not know what they are talking about. They say, "" These people have asked you to secure the appointment of a commission to inquire into their grievancesbut we know that them The Minister said that if the commission is appointed the people will probably find a lot of grievances. The doctrine of ""Let things' slide,"" surely will not appeal to honourable members. The petition that was presented to Parliament may not contain such serious complaints as we are accustomed to have submitted by 1 petition, but there can be no doubt that the people regard their circumstances with grave disfavour. Their complaint about the liquor traffic would, alone, justify the appointment of a commission. The 760 people on this island are of mixed racial origin. Mr Thompson. square miles of country, and are practically isolated. As the liquor traffic there is under government control, their complaints should certainly be investigated. If such allegations were made from any other territory of the Commonwealth no time would be lost in looking into them. Liquor is imported to Norfolk Island and held in bond by the Government, but apIt should have been a very parently there is not a sufficient measure of control and abuses are occurring. The ravages of whisky, gin and other liquor in such a community might seriously hinder the physical and moral development of the people. The Minister referred to the Executive Council. The circumstances in that connection are quite unsatisfactory. The council is a kind of plaything, given to the people to keep them quiet. The administrator is practically a dictator. Included in his duties are those of magistrate and judge. A l though he has had no judicial training, he haa to interpret the law, and the islanders are very dissatisfied with some of his decisions. That is inevitable in all cases, in which a layman without the requisite training, is obliged to determine complicated points of law. appeal from his decisions ? right, under their ordinances, to appeal to the Governor General, but the conditions governing the appeal are not satisfactory. When I was on the island a man who had been mulcted in £80 damages by the Administrator asked me what course he should take to appeal against the decision. I understand that the casewas determined on affidavits furnished the best we can do for from Australia. I told the man that he is to leave them alone."" had the right to appeal to the Governor General. He immediately lodged his appeal in the proper way, but did not receive even an acknowledgment of its receipt* For nine months he was engaged in the ridiculous and time-wasting business of writing or cabling to the Minister about the matter. I believe that just recently he was notified that as the verdict against him was for an amount less than XI00 he has no right of appeal. The council consists of six persons nominated by the Administrator and six elected by the people. Naturally the Administrator takes care to nominate only those persons They are cooped up in 13 who will support his views. I do not blame him for doing so.

117,Mr Thompson,"They have thestated tlrat the council has all the powers 1 of a shire council, but, on the information that I have, I must disagree with him. the advisory boards in tlie mandated territories. see its only power is to placard the island with notifications to the male population of the labour conditions. The only money on the island is brought to it by tourists, or spent by the administration. Every man between the ages of 21 and 56 is liable to' give fifteen days to tbe administration every year for road work. It is quite apparent, however, that the labour conditions are not taken seriously. Such conscription of labour is always hateful to a spirited community. The condition of the roads indicates quite clearly that very little work is done. If the Minister considers that the council has any real power, he must have a queer understanding of what power is. Quite recently, in consequence of the dissatisfaction expressed by the people, an ordinance has been issued which confers upon the council f h e . r i g h t to make suggestions. But all such suggestions must first be submitted to the administrator in order that he may make his comments upon them before forwarding them to the Government. It can be easily understood in those circumstances that the Government is. not likely to be influenced very greatly by any suggestion which is not favourably considered by the administrator. There are quite a number of matters that a royal commission could give attention to. Among them is the population problem. 760 people on the island are descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty. They represent about twelve families which are continually intermarrying. There is no outlet for the energy of the young people on the island. The land question shoufd also be investigated. The islanders are under the impression that the island was given to them by Queen Victoria, and that it is theirs in perpetuity. The Minister has said that this is a delusion. In that, case the sooner a royal commission investigates the position the better. The trade of the island also merits attention. We have Jbeen told that the Government is doing everything possible for these people, but the available figures do not support the statement. Figuresi n the last annual report of the administrator show that whereas in 1919-20 the imports were valued at £16,932, and the exports at £13,727 , the It has the same powers as imports for 1923-4 were valued at £22,000, and the exports at only £3,170. A reduction of nearly £10,000 in three years in the exports from thei island is serious, and does not bear out the Minister's statement. I was glad to hear that the Government is taking steps to provide the islanders w it l t a news service. A t present they take) no interest in any affairs but their own It is high time that the position and powers of the administrator werej -nwwe clearly defined. His work would be much easier if he had a proper charter of power. Under existing circumstances he may be a benefactor or a tyrant. I wish it to be understood that I am not making any accusations against him> I ' am merely pointing out the defects of the position. The pewplte have grievances which should be remedied. I consider that the tourist traffic w ill become very important to Norfolk Island in the futurei f a reasonable steamship service is provided. The prevailing service is shocking. Th© Burns-Philp Line sends one boat there in every five weeks. I understand that 1 hundreds of people inquire every year whether they can .take at holiday trip to Norfolk Island, but they are unable to ! do so because steamers are not available. The Burns-Philp Company is prepared to provide an adequate shipping service if it is granted some encouragement by the Commonwealth Government. The Government has said that it is opposed to the appointment of a royal commission, but I ask honourable members not to The majority of the allow that to dissuade them from voting for the morion. 1 realize that it is impracticable for a commission to visit the island immediately, but I have no doubt that if the motion is carried a commission could visit, it after the elections, and make an investigation along the lines I have suggested. If the existing problems there are neglected for another ten 1 years they w ill become practically in soluble. I trust, therefore, that the motion will be carried.

For that reason I -was pleased to be able to place the files -on the table so that he could ascertain the true position. In regard to my own statement, honourable members will recall that, when I spoke on the BankB ill last year, I made no reflection the whole course of the war, and when upon previous administrations. Anstey, by interjection, asked me when the agreement with the associated hanks was made, and I said I thought it was in 1915. Subsequently,, having had an opportunity to consult the files, I amended that statement,, and said that it was made .on the Sth November, 1914, and was signed by Mr Eisher. I think that the honourable member for iBmu&e will bear me out in this. The Mansard report of that year also shows .conclusively that on the three occasions when the isubject was brought up in the House both Mr accuracy of the Treasurer's allegation (now Sir Joseph) Cook and Mr that the arrangement had been made by fisher indicated that it had been discussed at the conference between representatives of the Government and all parties concerned. arrangement was made subsequently by Mr Fisher as stated. The recital of the history of the inflation of the note issue in my speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill last year shows clearly that I made no specific reference to earlier administrareferring to the 1914 agreement, which, tions. I .simply mentioned in its order this three to one arrangement, which I said was the most questionable of all the financial negotiations arising out yf war conditions. The point I made last Thursday was that the agreement was in a different category, from the point of view of the public interest, from that made by the bank with the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited. I am very glad indeed that the honourable member for Bourke has so graciously exculpated the Secretary to the Treasury from suspicion of double dealing in connection with the information supplied. make it clear that my examination <©f A e files has exculpated Mr Fisher as well as Mr Collins. Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) is of course pleased that the honourable member for I felt sure that, when he last Bourke( Mr Anstey) has withdrawn any implication regarding Mr Collins, but he cannot .escape the charge that his own speech on this subject left a wrong impression on the minds of honourable members.

Instead of answering the charges made by the honourable member for Eeid, he spoke of the arrangement made, or confirmed, by ' tbe Fisher Government in 1914.

132,Mr Manni Ng (Macquarie) [5.32],"at any time to build a 4-ft. 8|-in. line from Broken Hill to the border, and 1 have no .doubt that the present government in New South Wales will be equally ready to do so. The distance from the border to Port Augusta is about 200 miles, and if that line were constructed there would be a railway on the 4-ft. 8^-in. Kalgoorlie to Sydney. A 4-ft. 8^-in. line from Grafton to Brisbane is now in course of construction, and if the project I am advocating be carried out, we shall have a uniform gauge from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane. Such a line would bring the eastern and western States into closer contact, and its value could be further increased by connecting it with two New South Wales lines. A line of about 20 miles could be built either from Hillston or Cargellico towards Mount Hope, and another link of about 40 miles could be constructed from Ungarie to Condobolin. joyed a succession of good seasons, my mind goes back to 1919-20, when New South Wales was in the throes of a very severe drought, and fodder from South Australia had to be conveyed over congested lines. The difficulties of transport were increased by the break of gauge, and every siding between Melbourne and Albury was blocked with trucks of chaff. The srraziers' stock and the farmers' horses in New South Wales were dying because they could not get South chaff quickly enough, that an extra siding was built at Albury, and the traffic was worked day and night. If the Broken Hill to Port Augusta connection were made, South fodder could be brought to New South Wales more conveniently, and by means of the twoshort connecting lines distributed throughout the southern portion of the Mother State. dobolin to Broken Hill is being built with heavy rails to carry fast traffic and big loads, in accordance with the recommendations of the New South Wales Railways Commissioners and the Public Works Committee that any but a heavy and permanent line would be practically useless. The Broken Hill to Port Augusta connection would promote decentralization, bring a lot of traffic across the continent, our people's knowledge of their country. Another line that is essential to the development of Australia is one northwards Mr Manning. from Bourke, either to connect with the western termini of existing Queensland railways, or to follow a more westerly route to Camooweal, proceeding thence to the Barkly Tablelands. Some advocates of that line have, inadvisedly, I think, suggested that it should be built in lieu of the north-south line, from Adelaide to gauge from the Northern Territory. The two proposals should not be regarded as alternative or competitive. One line cannot serve the whole of that interior country, and a railway built from South Australia into western Queensland, and thence into the Northern Territory wo aid have only a limited usefulness. The mere suggestion that such a route is an alternative to the direct north-south line arouses antagonism to both proposals. These lines should be regarded as independent, rather than. alternative propositions. The southern Although we have recently enStates have frequently experienced a shortage of beef. But never has the whole of the country between the Murray River and the Barkly Tablelands suffered from drought at the same time. On many occasions' New South Wales graziers would have been able to save large numbers of stock by shifting them into the pastures further north. In 1914, when southern Australia was experiencing probably the worse drought in its history, a great deal of the Australian country that would be traversed by a line notwithstanding from Bourke to Camooweal was waving with rich pastures. About eighteen months later the conditions were reversed, and Queensland graziers were losing Australian stock, whilst in the south feed was abundant. I remember Sir George Fuller admitting to a deputation regarding the railway extension from Condobolin to BrokenH ill that many times in The line from Conthe history of New South Wales the absence of a few miles of connecting railway had been responsible for losses of stock greatly exceeding in value thc cost of such connexions. In the northern area that would be served by a line running from Bourke to Camooweal cattle can be bred much more cheaply than in southern Australia, but at the present time, owing to the lack of railway communication, they must be fairly and extend matured before they can be started on the eight-months' journey into New South Wales. At the end of the journey they are absolutely hard, and f u l l y another eight or nine months is required to restore them to k ill i ng condition. Instead of the people being able to get young beef, which, incidentally, is more profitable to the grower, these cattle are marketed in southern markets nearly two years later than they would be if railway transport were available. Only about two years ago, cattle were imported into Victoriaf r o m New Zealand, whilst simultaneously cattle in the north of Australia were practically valueless. Camooweal railway been in existence, such an anomaly would not have been possible. I urge the Commonwealth GovcrnrnOTit to adopt a far-sighted policy, and to enter into negotiations with the States concerned for the construction of a railway northwards from Bourke towards the Barkly Tablelands. Government of New South ""Wales, was prepared to build the line from Bourke to the Queensland border. I am sure that the present Government w ill adopt the same attitude. Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect the Government of Queensland to bear the whole of the cost of a line through central Queensland. An honourable member interjected regarding the objections of Sydney people to the extension of Victorian lines into New South Wales. No doubt, similar objections w ill be urged by Brisbane to a line that w ill connect the New South Wales markets with the cattle areas of the north. Those who cannot see beyond their noses w ill declare that such a line would mean a loss of trade to Brisbane. Probably Brisbane would lose trade, but the whole State, including the capital city, would be advantaged by the greater prosperity that would arise fro m the development of the hinterland. In the past, parochial considerations have influenced too much the railway construction policy of the Australian -States, and I hope that the suggestions I have made w ill receive early consideration from the Commonwealth Cabinet, and that a policy w ill be adopted which w ill make for the more complete and systematic development of the country, and by increasing the prosperity of our people, make them more f it to carry their heavy burden of debt. I desire to protest against the attitude of certain Commonwealth departments towards Federal awards. Those departments should set an example to other employers of labour, but, instead of doing so, they are evading their obligations to certain of their employees. RecentlyI have interested myself in the case of certain employees in the Postmaster-General's Department in the pole yard at Keswick, South Australia. Men are employed there as labourers, and were unti l recently receiving a wage even less than that which the Federal court has decided H a d the Bourke to shall be the basic wage. They are deprived of the opportunity to benefit by the Commonwealth child endowment scheme. under a State award ? that the department is withholding from The late the men the superior conditions that are provided by the Federal award. men ? ployed in the service for at least twelve months. Technically, they are not recognized as permanent employees. The Acting Deputy Postmaster-Generali n Adelaide some time since informed me that the men were working under a State award, and receiving the State basic wage. That led me to conclude that they must be receiving a higher rate than was provided for under the Federal basic wage decision. But when I inquired as to the relative values of the two awards I learned that the State award was lowpr than the Federal! These men. therefore, were not only being deprived of recreation leave and child endowment, but also were receiving a lower rate of wage than the Federal basic rate. A Commonwealth department should not evade the decisions of Federal courts. Eecently the State basic rate has been revised and increased. I personally interviewed Mr Mason, the Deputy Postmaster-Generali n Adelaide, in whom we have every confidence, and of whom we have the kindliest thoughts. I believe that he is a most efficient officer. He, no doubt, recognized that an undesirable and difficult precedent had been established, and he endeavoured to overcome it on the best terms. He sent me the following letter:With 'reference to the personal representa-tions made by you on the 18th August, 1920, respecting the wages paid to labourers employed at the departmental pole yard, I have",38,Service Homes Had Been Entered Into By The Labour Party

One of the men is named Montgomery. has been employed by the department for some years. Earlier he was classed as a lineman that man's rate of wage and given tion leave.

I then went to head-quarters, and presented the case to the Postmaster-General. From families him I received the' intimation that these homes. men were not employed under the proof the Deputy Postvisions of the Public Service Act, and that to a man with one therefore they were paid according to the State basic rate.

I can assure the Minister that I shall not rest content until these men are paid the Federal basic wage, and receive just treatment in other respects. Minister is not prepared to put matters right now, he will hear more from me on future occasions. I am not prepared to allow, without protest, these men to be unjustly treated. So long as I remain in this Parliament, or until their wrongs are righted, I shall continue to urge their ments of the public to the same extent claims. I hope, however, that the Minister will realize that they should be paid according to the work which they perform, and that they will soon receive the same treatment as that accorded to the permanent employees. To labour this question further at this stage would be unwise. I have already presented the case to the Minister personally, and I hope that he will not longer delay in doing the right thing by men who may rightly be regarded as permanent officers. I submit their claim, and trust that honourable members generally will support it. I desire to refer to the treatment meted out by the Postmaster-General's Department to those persons who for many years have been selling postage stamps on commission. It appears that, in accordance with a recent decision, one person in a street or locality is now allowed to sell stamps, while others in the same locality are denied that right. Why are such distinctions made ? Is this a new rule which has been introduced by the Director of Postal Services? shabbiest action ever taken by the deI challenge partment. is that some persons are prepared to sell rhe stamps without charging commission. I understand that since the new arrangement came into operation all applicants If the Government for licences to sell stamps are informed commission they will be granted the privilege of selling the stamps. I know of one or two cases in which that reply has been received by applicants. One case to which I desire to refer is that of a news vendor who has been refused a licence to sell postage stamps while a competitor has been granted a licence. He objects, not to payment of commission being refused, but to a distinction being made between individuals. shop close? that make? at 9 o'clock and his closes at 6 o'clock, he would not be able to meet the requireas his competitor. for increasing the hours of work. If all places of business closed at 6 o'clock, there would be no reduction in the number of postage stamps sold: Can the Minister inform me whether postage stamps are still sold at railway stations? stamps at a railway station after the ordinary business premises were closed was a great convenience. I have always been under the impression that the Commonwealth Constitution provides that there shall be no distinction between States or the people within States, but the Postal Department in granting stamp licences makes distinctions between individuals. could with as much reason say that the department should not have the right to choose its employees; the vendor? of stamps are practically employees of the department.",41,Service Homes Had Been Entered Into By The Labour Party

It is pleasing to find that interstate jealousy no longer exists in auy marked degree, and that portions of New South Wales are now served -by the Victorian railway system. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to S p.m. my opinion, the railway from Hay to Port Augusta proposed by the Commissioner and his officers is a better proposition from a revenue point of view than is the line suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie. that attention is now being given to a more modest proposal, with a view to making the railway journey from Adelaide to Port Augusta more easy than it is at present. The Commonwealth is concerned in railway construction between Kyogle and South Brisbane, and if we are to embark upon still further railway construction 1 wish to direct particular attention to a proposed line in which I take a very great interest. In the earlier stages of my political career, I very bitterly opposed the transference of the Federal Capital to Canberra. stances and the voting of majorities have settled that matter, and we are now going ahead with the construction of the Federal Capital at Canberra. I always said that there was oue thing connected with the establishment of the Capital at Canberra which appealed to me, and that was that we should have about 1,01)0 square miles of country which could be retained for all time as the property of the Commonwealth, and in which the leasehold system of land tenure would prevail. I suppose that with one or two exceptions the members of this Parliament are favorable to the continuance of the leasehold system in the Federal Capital Territory. That territory being a part of the people's property, I am prepared to view ably any proposed railway construction which may enhance its value. I in this House the construction, of a railway from Orbost to Bombala. I believe that such a line would materially assist in the development of the Federal Capital territory. I have travelled over the Victorian railways as far as Orbost, but 1 have not had the pleasure of travelling over the country between Orbost and Bombala. I am informed by those who have been over that country that a motor trip from Sydney through Bombala and the south-eastern portion of New South Wales, and thence through Gippsland to Melbourne, is one of the most delightful trips that could be made. If the Federal Government is to launch out into new proposals for railway construction such a line as I have suggested should be the I have said that, in next considered. Victorians know that a line extending from Orbost through the north-eastern parts of the State would be very desirable, both from a developmental and a tourist point of view. Those who know anything about I understand the south-eastern portion of New South Wales, which such a line as I have suggested would traverse, are aware that it is a very f r u it f u l land and that a good port could be established at no great distance from the railway. I was very pleased to see in the newspapers recently a report of the deputation, of which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr. Paterson) was one, that waited upon the Victorian Minister for Railways and pointed out the advautages of this particular line. 1 understand that a favorable reply was given to the deputation. CircumI t was mentioned that if the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth Governments united to build the line there is no reason why it should not be under construction at an early date. Its construction would complete a link in what would be practically a coast line which should be of great advantage from a defence point of view. I believe it is not included in what military experts regard as a strategical railway system for Australia, but I do not know that we should accept their verdict absolutely. I think that this line would be found of great advantage from a defence point of view should trouble come to Australia. From the developmental point of view the line has strong claims upon the Federal Government and very favorthe State Governments concerned. If the three Governments united each contributing a quota to the cost of construcwas one of the first to suggest tion, the completion of the line would link up the railway system from Fremantle to Adelaide and Melbourne through Gippsland, past the Federal Capital Territory, on to Sydney; thence to Brisbane, and from Brisbane northwards to beyond Cairns. I believe that the line I have suggested would pay handsomely at no distant, date, and I am prepared to use all the influence I can to have it constructed.",43,Service Homes Had Been Entered Into By The Labour Party
159,Mr Fenton,"Sir Monaro) [8.10] I was very pleased to listen to the statement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) as to the advantages likely to accrue from the construction of the railway to which he has referred. The honourable member, however, did not mention one important factor in support of the proposal, and that is the importance of the district which would be traversed by the line as a source of power for the generation of electricity. The power which might be derived from the Snowy River would be sufficient for the generation of a supply of electricity which could be carried south through Gippsland to Melbourne and north to Sydney. of the district passes renders the water supply of the Snowy River inexhaustible, and it is difficult even to imagine the volume of electric power which might be derived from the district through which the proposed line would be taken. It is not unexplored country. are known to scientists and capitalists. The opening up of the avenues of wealth presented by the district would provide means for the employment of many people. proposed line would go through my electorate its construction naturally appeals to me, but there must be a means of communication provided between Canberra and Melbourne, and, as I have said, the proposed line would give access to a reservoir of power which might be utilized to convert what are now practically empty spaces into hives of industry. I trust that the picture drawn by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) will be actually realized, and that big industries will develop at Canberra. The question will undoubtedly arise as to whether we should not make a good port on the spaboard, which is some 50 miles from the Federal Capital. Many of our most sagacious people have already purchased home sites at Canberra, and I have no doubt that some t me in the future we ; shall"" also have to give serious consideration to whether or not the present leasehold titles to the land there shall not be converted into freehold titles. There are murmurings even now against the leasehold system. Personally, I favour it , but it is well known that the Englishman, by reason of the fact that he holds his land under a freehold title, regards his home being made at Canberra that those honourable members who have not been -there for some time will be astonished the next time they visit it . If a big electrical power scheme can be developed for Canberra, it will make a tremsndo is difference to the : city.

I trust . that in time it w ill become the great city that it ought to be. wish to direct the attention of the Government to two or three matters. The The ice fields first concerns the Taxation Department. through which it There is a lack of uniformitv in applying the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act to trade union social gatherings. As a rule, every trade union holds a social gathering once a year, not for the purpose of making profits, but to gather the members together for social intercourse. Its resources Frequently these functions result in a financial loss. Generally speaking, they are exempt from the entertainments tax, but the department recently made a notable exception in the case of the It might be suggested that as the Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. I do not know why the annual outing of that union should be taxed ; perhaps the Treasurer will be able to tell me. Prior to my illness I had taken up this matter with the department with a view to securing a refund of the amount paid by the association. While I was indisposed, Senator J. Grant kindly continued the negotiations.* So far, however, we have obtained no satisfaction. I feel sure that when the Entertainments Tax Act was passed by Parliament there was no intention to tax this class of gathering. It. is not an entertainment in the ordinary sense of the word, and certainly it is not organized to make a profit. I trust that the Treasurer will inquire into the matter, ascertain the reasons for the imposition of the tax on this union when other unions are exempt, and instruct the department to refund the amount charged. A couple of months ago I introduced to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) a deputation from the Writers and Artists Association.

171,The Writers And Mr Mann,"OB a point of order, Ithat the procedure to be observed in respect of any question arising out of a newspaper article, and debated as a matter of privilege, is specially dealt w it h under the Standing Orders. I ask you, sir, whether the honourable member for Dalley is presenting this matter in conformity with the Standing Orders. W a t t ) to determine the attitude of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). Standing Order 285 provides that if an honourable member complains of a statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege he must be prepared to produce a copy of the newspaper itself, to name its printer and publisher, and to conclude with a motion. If this question is raised as a matter of privilege, a point which I able member proceeds, dure must stage, however, the honourable member's remarks are not sufficiently developed to permit me to determine what course should be taken. I ought to say, further, that while the Chair decides the considerations that ought to be dealt with by the House as a matter of privilege, the House itself determines whether or not a breach of privilege has been committe.d. ments from the honourable member for Dalley. raise this question as a matter of privilege. I raised it as a matter of public interest under cover of this grievance motion. The article points out that certain large importing interests in Melbourne and Sydney engaged in the importation of pianos and player-pianos from Germany especially are endeavouring to use pressure to prevent any increase of the duty upon those instruments. A letter appearing in this journal points out that the best way to prevent an increased duty being placed upon imported pianos is to fight for a reduction of the existing duty. It is remarkable that in the new tariff schedule there is no increase in the duties on pianos or player-pianos, even though the Australian industry is being seriously affected by the competition of German cheap-labour products. ber will, of course, avoid discussing the tariff. pursue that subject. The following letter appears in the article:Melbourne, 14th August, 1925. Dear Mr Preston, In connection with the opposition to the increase in duties on pianos and player-pianos, it is suggested that a letter be sent to each member of the Country party in the House, and also to all Nationalists, except those who are known to be rabid Protectionists. . I am scarcely able at this stage Mr Hagelthorn suggests that such a letter, if sent, should go out under the auspices of his union (the Town and Country Union). This, of course, would be for the interested parties to deride, hut, so far as Melbourne is concerned, Allan, Reed (Aeolian), Brash, and ourselves all agree that it would be best for this letter to go through the Town and Country Union. Hagelthorn and Mann, M.H.R., go to Sydney on Sunday, and are stopping at Usher's. I am enclosing to you a letter of introduction to Hagelthorn, as being better than a letter shall determine as the honorof introduction from Hagelthorn to yourself. that proceThe object of their visit to Sydney is to be adopted. A t this address the Sydne}' Branch of the Town and Country Union, or whatever name it goes under. They have been invited over specially for the purpose. Now the best suggestion that Hagelthorn has made is that, instead of simply trying to stop the increase of duty, we should go baldheaded for a reduction. Hagelthorn as an old campaigner maintains that by going for something more than you are prepared to accept you are more likely to achieve thc main object of this present agitation. I feel certain that in this you will agree with him. I shall await further developIf there is to be any tight put up on the floor of the House, or beforehand at any meeting of the Country party or Nationalist party, there is far more prospect of stopping tlie inI certainly did not crease.

Mr Hagelthorn is anxious to have from you copy of the letter which we propose to issue, and also the main points, no^ only for no increase of duty, but also for a reduction in same, so that he may make use of these in his opening address to the Sydney union. Thc next point is that it is important that we should receive back in Melbourne from you, on Monday, the draft of the letter which you yourself think should go out from the Town and Country Union's office. For this reason we intend telegraphing you to be sure and get our mail before leaving the city on Saturday. To do this you must post on Sunday night.

This journal, in addition to publishing a facsimile of certain of the paragraphs of typewritten communications, has given a description of the gentlemen concerned. The article continuesNow who is ""Dear Mr Preston""? Let Smith's Weekly tell you. Maximilian Peter Pollak, since known as Preston-Pollak, or as Preston, was bora in Pru^ui. from 4.5 to 50 years ago. Prague is now in the Czecho-Slovak Republic, but during the war Pollak, or Preston, ranked as an Austrian subject. At present he is in the importing firm of NormanU Burnell and Company Limited, 350 Kent-street, Sydney. This is the class of person that the Prime Minister was condemning the other night at Dandenong. The paragraph furthe r saysBefore coming to Australia, Pollak (or Preston) was a trader in Hamburg, London, Paris, and Brussels; he came to Australia in 11)04., and first managed J. L. Lennard's busithe leaders of German importers, who are ness in Brisbane. He wa3 subsequently in Sydney and Adelaide. When the war began, Preston-Pollak was in Adelaide as manager of the business of John Beckman (senior partner in the firm of Weber and Company, Hamburg, Germany). Immediately before the outbreak of war, Preston-Pollak assigned the business to Samuel Fiddian, his clerk, and left himself without legal assets; and, in September. 1014, the business appeared as a companv entitled Preston Limited, Indentors and Importers. Now we know all about this "" dear Mr Preston,"" who was to do the pushing at the Sydney end of the business. before the Deportation Board. moreIn 1915, Preston was interned as a prisonei of war along with tlie Germans in Holdsworthy Camp, New South VVales. Evidently he is still doing a bit of pushing for GermanyAfter his release from internment, Preston stayed awhile in Adelaide, then came to Sydney; and, in 1921, was registered the business of Preston and Company, at Kent-street, Svd. ney. Samuel Fiddian, who sent the communication to "" Mr Preston,"" was Preston, Pollak's clerk in Adelaide. His name appears throughout the extract which I have just read. These things should not be passed over lightly. Either they are true or untrue. If true, we should know all about them,. If persons of this class are in Australia, I agree with the Prime The party to which I belong will give the Prime Minister every assistance to deal with these enemies of Australia and of Great Britain. There will be no doubt about our stand towards people who showed their enmity to Australia and Great Britain during the war and who are still displaying enmity in a more insidious way. Where is the money coming from ? More German gold ? Did we not hear during the war something about the clink of German gold in the palm of the hand, and of the whispering of German tongues in the ear] W h a t about the clink of German gold now? W ill the Prime Minister apply the deportation law to these gentlemen ? Surely there is ample warrant to bring these people before the board. trades union leaders. doing all they can to smash the piano and piano-player industry in Australia.

We ought to have an explanation from the Minister for Trade and Customs as to why this languishing industry is not receiving adequate protection.

"" Of course, every honourable inember knows quite well that my name has been associated with it .

Has he done so? Not at all. It is clear, then, that after all he was not concerned about the honour of members of this House or the protection of its privileges. O He simply set out to cast ridicule and obloquy upon a political movement with which he is not in agreement. The mere fact that he associated my name with it is beside the question. He is afraid of this political movement. that the honourable member senses a growing feeling amongst the people of Australia against certain provisions of our laws in their relation to our industrial and economic life.

Honourable members, I suppose, expect letters to be carried without postage, and all sorts of work to be done without spending money. childish and ridiculous that no sensible man would attach the slightest importance to it . If what the Town and Country Union has done be wrong, what right has any organization, which is agitating, not for a reduction of Customs duties, but for an increase of them, to collect and spend funds for the promotion of its objects? That policy, when adopted by protectionists, is, I suppose, laudable in the opinion of honourable members opposite. But my view is that it is more creditable to collect money for propaganda to reduce the burdens of the comto do so, munity than to collect funds for an organization to increase them. I as lending colour to the think I have sufficiently explained my connection with this business. I know nothing about the lett er _ that has been quoted. Until I read it in the press I did not know that such a communication had been sent. As for negotiations of the slimy character indiOf course, the honourable cated by the honourable' member for Dalley, I know nothing of them, and I He knows that he would utterly repudiate any association with them. I do not pretend to know what is ment by the phrase "" financial pressure."" To my mind it is a very clumsy phrase; it may mean any of two or three things; but, of course, the honourable member has been pleased to place upon it that construction which is most agreeable to his own mind. Those who are associated with me in this charge, and whose characters have been maligned, are not here, and cannot speak for themselves, but I do say of Mr Hagelthorn, that any man who equals him in public spirit, selfsacrifice, and hard labour for what he considers a public cause, has reason So far from his having received any so-called "" German gold."" I know that he is working at the sacrifice of his private business. I can assert positively that no improper negotiations or suggestions have been made by either the Town and Country Unionto Mr Fiddian, or Mr Fiddian to the Town and Country Union. What significance is there in the statement that if the union succeeded in getting a reduction of certain duties the piano trade would contribute to its funds? Honourable members wiU at least notice that no contribution was to be made until the work was done. The Town and Country Union was undertaking this work unSuch a notion is so selfishly, and in the public, interest, and without knowledge that it would receive any financial contribution, but if it. succeeded, and were offered a financial acknowledgment of its services, it would be entitled to accept it What happens in connection with protectionist propaganda?

Like the bandar-log mentioned in K i p lings Jungle Book, the one thing some persons cannot suffer is not to be treated seriously, or thought worthy of notice. We all must sympathize more or less with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann). He spoke feelingly, and showed that the honourable member' for Dalley( Mr Mahony) had, at least, succeeded in arousing his interest in this public matter. I scarcely know what is the gravamen of the charge against the honourable member for Dalley. newspaper' passages regarding the public activities of public men and asked for an expression of opinion-a n explanation, if honourable member for Perth has been good enough to state his opiniona little heatedly, perhaps, so far as his remarks related to my honourable colleague, still it is gratifying to know that the matter has aroused a certain amount of public interest. member for Perth that no political party can succeed without funds. Both parties and individuals have an acquired or inherited craving for those good things which can be had only by the judicious use of money. But the portion of the honourable member's speech that most impressed me was his disclosure that, although for a long time we were under the impression that all the roubles from Moscow and the marks from Germany were flowing into the coffers of the Labour party, the great bulk of that money is now being misdirected into the coffers of the National and Country parties! That is a most disquieting discovery. We find I think the honourable that at the very moment when the Prime Minister was busying himself in the peaceful hamlet of Dandenong, about twenty miles from Melbourne, in explainI scorn to descend to ing to the people of that sylvan and rural locality the evils of the foreign influence unin the Labour party, that influence was Both the newsoperating in the interests of the freethat published the article trade Country party and the colleagues of the honourable member who the right honourable gentleman.

Certainly the Nationalist party could not live an ho'ur without the money bags it possesses. On its merits as a political party it would have been condemned to death in its in fancy, but having those undoubted resources to which the honourable member so feelingly referred, it lives on, in a halting and not very convincing way, but still to a-certain extent animate and articulate. My mention of the Prime Minister recalls to my mind the real object for which I rose. Most honourable members will have observed that while the House was sitting, and when the Prime Minister's duty was to be in his place in this chamber, he was making frantic efforts to defend his reputation in the heart of his electorate. I do not blame h i m ; on the contrary, I quite He merely quoted certain realize the necessities of his situation.

Still, the Prime Minister has said that the board is an independent, non-political body discharging judicial functions in a judicial way.

It is an amazing fact that, although he has made that public declaration here and elsewhere, he is perambulating the country endeavouring to poison the minds of the public, and incidentally the board, against these men. politically speaking, is about the most in tified by the facto. If we cannot induce decent thing that I have known a Prime .Minister of this country to do, and I am not at all surprised that his action has evoked a most spirited condemnation from the learned King's Counsel whose duty it is to defend these men before that t r i bunal. May I be permitted to quote the words of that learned gentleman, as reported in the Argus of the 7th September, 1925, under the heading "" Deportation Board,"" "" A t t a c k on Mr Bruce.""? Like the honourable member for DalleyI do not father statements that I find in the Argus, the Age, or the Melbourne press generally. My experience has taught me that on matters of opinion they are almost., always entirely wrong rather than slightly right. But on a question of fact I think that they can sometimes be relied upon; and this is a question of undisputed fact. The report reads as follows:Mr Watt, KC, said tliat no reason had been given to him for the resumption. "" I noticed by the press this morning,"" he said, ""that'a certain gentleman who is Prime Minister of this Commonwealth has taken upon himself to make public utterances which ?re absolutely slanderous, false, and improper. He docs that even in face of his creation of this board."" Watt) -Order! I think that the honourable member is aware of the ancient parliamentary rule that no member may read from a newspaper an extract containing unparliamentary terms. Had the honourable member himself endeavoured in this House to give expression to the terms alleged to have been used by the King's Counsel, he would not have been permitted to do so. ing, sir, that the words that I have read are not parliamentary. I quite appreciate the propriety of the standing order and practice in that regard, and I merely awaited your decision as to whether the words were or were not parliamentary. The report continues"" As this is not a court, we cannot ask you excuse that he was acting in a time of to deal with Mr Bruce for slander."" Bruce to speak to him. Although we are unable to have him dealt with, we hope that he will have the public decency to refrain from committing contempt of court. Those words are, at all events, restrained, That, and I think that they are absolutely justhis Chamber and the public to restrain the right honourable gentleman from continuing these grave and gross contempts, apparently we have no other means of redress; but upon individual members of this House there lies the duty of calling attention to what I regard as a gravely indecent political practice on the part of the Prime Minister. So tar from being dissuaded from continuing on this course, we find him repeating the offence. In this evening's Herald there is the following report: "" One of the matters whicli might have compelled us to take one definite step,"" said Mr Watt, "" is the way in which the Prime Minister is disregarding his duty to this board, to the public, and to us who are charged with the defence of these men. I have always been taught to believe that when a light was on the ring was to be kept clear."" MrW a t t was interrupted at that, stage. Later he said"" Mr Bruce has instructed that this man should 'be hauled before the board, and he is now interfering with the board's functions. Ho does not say it in so many words,"" Mr Watt went on, ""but while he has appointed this board and instructed his responsible Minister to act on its recommendation, he is determined that this man Sliall leave the country."" I remember that during the war-and that fact should be noted-the ex-Prime Minister( Mr WM . Hughes), who subl sequently "" dropped his bundle,"" which was avidly seized by the right honourable gentleman who is now carrying it , had a playful way of launching criminal prosecutions against his political opponents in the morning, and addressing public meetings in the evening, as though in the meantime he had convicted them of the I accept your ruloffences with which he had charged them. So little regard had he for the best traditions of the high office that be held, and for the duty that rests upon every man, but especially a Minister of the Crown, to respect the rights and privileges of a person who is charged with a criminal offence that he resorted to such tactics. He, at least, had the war, and under what the militarists are",51,Austin Chapman Eden As His Castle Such Great Progress Is

Therefore, Mr Hughes frequently suspended the principles of justice in order that he might air his political prejudices and preoccupations.

Honourable members on this side know that it is not. but that, on the contrary, it has been appointed to deport and not to t r y men. I su?gest. to the Prime Minister that if he continues in the course of actipn that he is now following, and endeavours to secure his political position at the expense of his reputation as a M i nister of the Crown, he will eventually drive the board into acouitring the men, and thus defeat the object for which it was appointed. Such a result, from the point of view of the Government, would be a catastrophe of no mean order, and should be avoided at all costs. In reply to the honourable member for Dalley tn-dnv. the Prime Minister said that he bad used his publicity department to disseminate throughout the Commonwealth the sneech that he delivered at Dandenong. He claimed that in that action he h=>d observed the best traditions of Nationalist governments, and I am quite prepared to believe that he did WhatI want to know is, why he "" stole the thunder"" of the honourable member for FawknerC Mr MaxwellV Why did he go to Dandenong, and repeat seriously the excellent jests that the honourable member for Fawkner had already made in this House, and which were appropriately received by honourable members sitting on this side of the House? When the right honourable gentleman disseminates his policy speech, it ought to be an original one, and, from the point of view of accuracy as to facts, if possible, it should be better than that which he delivered at Dandenong last nighty He displayed keen anxiety about the "" pernicious foreign influences."" I observe that he traced the malign influence of the Labour party in the disturbances that are occurring not only in Egypt, China, and Afghanistan, but also in India, Moscow, and even amongst the Riffisi n Morocco. All those disturbances he attributes to the influence of the Labour party, through its agents the communists, The Prime backed up by whatever foreign funds were l e f t over after the Free Trade party in the corner had helped itself to them. I a time of peace-no t exactly have been reminded by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) of a very interesting fact in connection w if h the seamen's strike. The authorities thoughtI fit to arrest a number of seamen, among whom were Albert Dean and Alfred Spencer. Those appear to be perfectly innocuous English names, one of themAlbert-bein g closelv associated with the Royal Family, and, therefore, above suspicion. But the person who laid the in formation against these men, the master of the Port Kembla, from which vessel they are alleged to have deserted, was Mr Chris van der Berg! One wonders if some foreign influence, and perhaps foreign money, is not being disseminated amongst the masters of vessels who are prosecuting these men, rather than amongst men who bear these highly respectable English names. The Prime Minister has assumed a new role. He now appears as one appointed to safeguard the sacred principles of trade unionism ; it is rumoured that he has accepted a position as organizer of a militan t trade union in this country at a satisfactory salary. It is curious to note the anxiety of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), and other honourable members opposite, who are at the present time in a state of extreme perturbation, not on the country's behalf, or even on their own behalf, but entirely on behalf of the Labour party and the great unionist movement.

As there are in the parties forming the coalition two apparently eminent medical men, I suggest to those honorahle members who are so perturbed that they should apply to those medical men for a prescription containing some useful solvent and sedative to enable them to sleep soundly in their beds at night, and awaken in the morning with their minds clarified, so that they may have a saner view of the relative importance of communism and the Labour movement in this country. My final words to the Government are that, whatever their anxiety regarding the sacred principles of the trade union movement, they should at least endeavour to observe ordinary political dei-ency and f a i r play in regard to men on trial. That was my principal object in rising. It may be that the Prime Minister is not familiar with the practice in regard to these matters, that he has to make concessions to those who drive him forward, keep his ear to the ground, and have his newspaper read to him every morning"" in order to obtain directions regarding his political activities for the day. But, being a Britisher above all things-muc h more a Britisher than an Australian-and being much more concerned with the strikes of Englishmen than the strikes of Australians, I suggest that whether or not he is familiar with the practice in these matters, he should make himself familiar with the best traditions of the judiciary in the administration of the criminal and other laws of this country, and abstain from making these aspersions on others for political purposes. great deal has to be conceded to him because of political necessity, and the fact that he endeavoured to fire a shot which proved to be a "" squib."" He threatened the people with an election, but the people discovered that, he was merely trying to create political turmoil in order to have an election at a time which he thought would be favorable to the Nationalists.

I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General and the M i nister for Defence certain matters which I think they could, by collaboration, easily rectify. I refer to the arrangements for soldiers to obtain their pensions in country districts. When a soldier is granted a pension the money has to be paid to h i m at a post office, which is also a money order office. Not all post offices come within that category; many do not issue money orders. In such cases, although a soldier may live in close proximity to a post office, he may be forced to travel a considerable distance to reach a money order office to obtain his pension. In many instances the journey is a long one. In my own case 1. had to traA el 13 miles each way, which r meant a journey of 26 miles on each occasion. Moreover, .1. had to provide my cwn conveyance, as there were no trams or trains available. It must be remembered also that those who are drawing pensions draw them because of physical disabilities. To such meu travelling is a greater burden than to others. I suggest that the Minister concerned should endeavour to devise some better system than that now in operation. Shouldi t be found after consultation that no better system can be devised for the payment of the pensions in cash, I suggest that payments be made by cheques, or, where the amounts are small, by postal notes. An y storekeeper would willingly cash such cheques or postal notes. I make no excuse for bringing this matter forward. I know that a It has been discussed by various branches of the Returned 'Sailors and SoldiersI m perial League throughout Australia. It must be apparent to every honourable member that it is wrong to force an in capacitated soldier to travel long distances to receive his pension. I know of one man who has to travel 31 miles each way to obtain his pension. I point out also that no allowance for fares is made in such cases.",53,Austin Chapman Eden As His Castle Such Great Progress Is

If Mr Collins thinks that their presence in the streets is objectionable to the public he has totally misconstrued the feelings of the populace towajjds these people. vidious distinctions, but, after hearing the excellent case made out by thp Blind Association in New South Wales, Mr Theggie, the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in that State, was in sympathy with the proposal. TheggieI think we have one of the finest, officers in the service of the Commonwealth, and one in every way suited for the position which he occupies. I do not know why Mr Collins has acted in such an arbitrary way under the discretionary powers which he is allowed to exercise. Many of these people are young, and are quite able to augment their income by selling the articles I have mentioned. The blind sellers of newspapers are not prohibited from receiving the pension. The reason given for the distinction is that it is a simple matter for the Pensions Department to trace from the newspaper offices the incomes derived by sellers of newspapers, and that it is not so simple to determine the incomes of those selling tobacco and matches. In consequence of this, it is said that they would probably be able to submit a return that could not be relied upon by the department. do not think it matters in the slightest whether the department can trace the actual income of either section to which I have referred, because the amount would be so small that it would not affect, to any great extent, the total amount of pensions now paid. I do not think it f a i r for the Commissioner of Pensions to impose such conditions, and the matter is one which should be brought before the House by a member of the Government.

I am astonished at the action of the departmental officers in refusing to pay the pension to men and women so afflicted if they engage in such work. My view is that these people should be encouraged to assist themselves as far as possible. this principle should be applied, not only to blind pensioners, but. to all pensioners. The practice we have of treating the pension as a charitable dole given, if not for the purpose, certainly with tjie effect, of pauperizing the pensioners, is entirely wrong. can add but very little to their pensions by their earnings. In their declining years and condition of physical incapacity they should be encouraged to augment the assistance given them by the State by suoh earnings as they can gain in lawful occupations. Before the session closes I hope that the Treasurer will look into the matter, will liberalize the regulations for the payment of pensions, and, should it be necessary, will introduce an amendment of the act to meet the objection which has been raised. I am entirely in sympathy with the remarks of the honourable member for New England. I hope that the Treasurer will take serious notice of them with a view to doing something in the direction indicated. should like to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs a matter of vital importance to Tasmania. Owing to extensive importations of timber, from abroad at the present time, the timber industry in Tasmania is absolutely languishing. Commonwealth generally. ticularly to Tasmania, because I am well acquainted with the position there. The mill owners cannot compete with the importations under existing conditions. Mills are being closed down and numbers of people are being thrown out of employment. The reasons for the present condition of the timber industry in Tasmania are that freights on timber from abroad are lower than interstate freights. Tasmania is injuriously affected by the Navigation Act ; the industry has to pay wages in accordance with Arbitration Court awards, and the duty on imported timber is insufficient. If we enact laws for the fixing of wages and legislation governing shipping, we must increase the duty on importations if those engaged in the timber industry in Tasmania are to live. I want to know what the intentions of the Government are in this matter. The position of the timber industry is imperilled, although the Tasmanian I go further, and say that timbers are second to none. There are splendid blackwoods and hardwoods in bhat State.

They should teach us the lesson that the officer in charge of this department should devote the whole of his attention to it . garding what is happening under this department in New South Wales, but I wish, if possible, to avoid raising, questions of the kind to-night. satisfied with the present administration. In my new, the officials of the department are much more severe in their treatment of returned soldiers than private owners of property would be. I could submit many cases in support of that view. We must have some one at the head of the department who will devote the whole of .his energies to the work, and w ill , see that those employed under him in sub-departments, while keeping in view the interests of the Commonwealth, shall temper their administration with humanity. Tbey should endeavour as far as possible to meet the circum' stances of every case. Of the large number of returned meu who have secured homes under the War Service Homes Act, it is but reasonable to expect that some wil l have difficulty in making their repayments. A man can never say when illness will overtake him, or when, through unemployment, he may find himself unable to keep up his payments, and the department in such cases should be as liberal as possible. me last Sunday who had been in arrears with his repayments. about the merits of his case, because I do not know the whole of the facts, but he assured me that he was served with a notice of ejectment and prosecuted, and a barrister was sent up f r om Sydney to Newcastle in connection with the case. .. The case was settled out of court, but .the barrister charged the returned soldier twenty guineas for appearing,, and said he had let him down lightly. able members w ill agree that there was no occasion to send a highly-briefed [100] man. up f r om Sydney to appear for the depurtioent in such a case. It is about rime lhat the head of this deI t is as necessary tiow as it was partment ceased doing that kind of thin^. I sympathize with this' man. The case was settled by him agreeing to pay £ 4 Is. 9d. a month to the department. He paid it for some lime. A t the end of July he paid an instalment of £ 1 , and' four days afterwards paid £ 3 Is. 9d., and so fulfilled his monthly obligation, but two weeks afterwards he received a letter from the department calling upon him to nay his arrears. OnI could say much reno grounds whatever can we justify that kind of treatment of the men who fought for us overseas. Having already loaded the man with twenty guineas of unnecesI .am not sary legal expenses, the department ought not to have harassed him when he had. done all that he undertook to do. the details of that case. the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), who now has them, intends to 'make them available to the Minister. I could give quite a number of instances, of the same kind. This department ought to be administered in a more sympathetic way. We cannot treat the soldiers who are purchasing war service homes in exactly the same manner as we treat old-age and invalid pensioners, for in the one case the money is loan, and has to be repaid, whereas in the other case no repayments are required; but I say unhesitatingly we ought to' be sympathetic. If I owned some of the tenements that the soldiers occupy, I should treat them much more liberally than the war service homes authorities are doing. . The War Service Homes Commissioner should not be responsible for any other duties, but should A man came to devote the whole of his rime to war service homes work. He-should be in close I Bay nothing touch with the deputy commissioners in the respective States. His policy ought to be clearly denned, and he ought to be devoting the whole of his attention to the task of making it effective. There are instances in which the men who occupy war service homes are not making any attempt to fulfil their obligations, but there are many more cases in which the men have improved their properties, by laying .out Honorgardens, putting down paths, and so on. These should be given every consideration.",57,Warservi Ce Homes Bill
