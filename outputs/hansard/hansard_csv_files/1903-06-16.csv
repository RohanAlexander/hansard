It seems to me, after a perusal of duties upon such goods. But that would the figures put before us by the Treasurer, be very difficult.

I think it will be recognised at once that Such an arrangement would be unfair to distinction between the two classes of sugar, Queensland, and to New South ""Wales, or and it is therefore impossible, without hamto any other producing State. Furtherpering trade operations to an extent that more, in dealing with this matter, we would be very undesirable, to trace the must not confine our attention to the source from which the sugar comes when it present producers, because the Excise reaches the ultimate point of delivery.

If the amount white-grown sugar.

If the excise were to white-grown sugar, they were losing the be collected as it is at the present time, and £ 2 per ton rebate, they would t r y to the consuming States got credit for it, while come to an understanding with the refiners the producing State was debited with the that the white-grown sugar produced by amount paid for rebate, certain States them should be used to supply the requirewould be getting £ 3 a ton upon the sugar ments of other States, which would, thereconsumed by them and grown in Queensfore, lose the £ 2 per ton.

18,Sir George Turner,It cannot be traced,15,Turner
19,Mr Thomson,"Quite so ; there is nothe operation of duties is shown most distinctly in the application now being made to the House for a different method of ad j ustnient. It is quite evident that the price labour in free competition with the imported of sugar in each State is regulated, except to the extent of a slight shade of difference, by the cost at which similar sugar from abroad can be landed, duty paid. There is practically no difference' in the price charged in the different States, because refined sugar from abroad can be landedin almost every one of them at the same price. ditions in which the production does not overtake the demand. ber has anticipated what I intended to add. Any one in favour of protective duties would say that the present production of sugar is much below the requirements of the Commonwealth, and that ' different results will follow when local consumption is overtaken; that as soon as the local production rises to an export level the price will come down to the value of the article for the purposes of export. It has been proved, however-for the sugar industry is not a new one-that cane sugar cannot be grown here at a profit in open competition with the imported article. When locally-grown sugar is exposed to free competition with sugar from abroad, and has to come down to world prices, production is immediately checked. We cannot escape this fact in connection with our sugar industry. On the other hand, when this check operates, and as soon as the production drops to any degree below the requirements of tlie Commonwealth, the price of the local article immediately rises to the value of the imported sugar after payment of the duty. with regard to white-grown sugar. give a rebate of £ 2 per ton in order to encourage the employment of white labour in sugar growing, and it is considered desirable that all sugar should be grown by white labour, that affords sufficient proof that local growers cannot compete with the black-grown sugarproducedin other countries. simply to enable the growers to get over the transition period. the difficulty will be felt during the transition period only. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Bland believes that after the transition period has passed we shall be able to grow .sugar with white article. the only question raised by the Bill under discussion is whether the sugar rebate shall be charged to the States in one way or another. The fiscal question, or the desirability or otherwise of the white Australia policy, or any matters connected with either of these two questions, are not raised, and therefore I could not permit the discussion of them under the B ill. ingly to raise a question that is not in order, but I wish to point out that I am introducing this matter in a way that makes it entirely relevant to the point at issue. time in order to ascertain the trend of the honourable member's remarks. if it could be shown that by the protection given under the Tariff the internal price of sugar would be reduced by £ 2 per ton, there would be no necessity for an adjustment, because the rebate the consumer would be called upon to pay would be balanced by the reduction in price. able member was proceeding on those lines, of course, I raised no objection. of argument, I submit, with all due deference to you, Mr Speaker, that I had to Show that it was not likely that such a result would follow. However, I only wish to point out, further, that we are at present losing through the excise duty and the rebates, as compared with the import duty, £336,000 per annum. If the excise duty, and consequently the rebate, are removed in 1907, and only white-grown sugar is produced and consumed in Australia, we shall then lose an additional £787,000, or in all £1,123,000 annually, representing a capital value of £22,460,000, at 5 per cent. That is a tremendous pi-ice to pay for the industry. However, I shall now leave that branch of the subject. Coming back to the other argument, which I was at first inclined to favour, that New South Wales and Queensland would gain an undue advantage under the arrangement proposed. I find there is no such advantage.",15,Turner

45,Mr Ewing (Richmond),"I take it ,whether this .is a State or a national matter. AmI right thus far ? ruled, nor should I rule, that the question before the House is one of whether this is a national nr a State matter. I merely called attention to the scope of the Bill, and intimated that I should be obliged to rule throughout that in discussing it honourable members must not go beyond its scope. a protest from the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland against the method adopted by the Customs Department for the payment of the sugar rebate. Stripped of all technicality, it is perfectly clear that, had the original proposal of the Government been persevered in the payment of that rebate to secure a white Australia would have partaken of the nature rather of a State matter than of a national one. the rebate out of the consolidated revenue upon a population basis. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members purely to that aspect of the case. The honourable member for North 'Sydney made a reference to the similarity which exists between the consumption of sugar by the States throughout Australia. But I would point out that the consumption per head of the different States varies very considerably. It is remarkable-possibl y honourable members may be able to furnish their own explanations for tlie difference which obtains-that whilst New South Wales consumes 107 lbs. per head, the consumption in Victoria is only 93 lbs. per head, whilst in Queensland it is 123 lbs. per head. merely the result of guess-work. States deducted from their total production the quantities exported, and concluded that they had consumed the balance. quoting are taken from Coghlan. South Australia consumes 100 lbs. of sugar per head of the population, Western Australia 114 lbs., and Tasmania 90 lbs. The mean consumption of the Commonwealth, therefore, is 103 lbs. Honourable members will observe that, at first sight, these variations appear somewhat remarkable. But they are not difficult of explanation, although, in deference to Mr Speaker's ruling, I must not attempt to furnish that explanation. It will be noted that in Tasmania the I quantity of sugar used falls 10 per cent, below the mean consumption, whilst in I certainly have not Queensland it is 20 per cent, above it. If , therefore, it is conceded that this is a national, and not a State matter, it would nobbe possible to secure a more satisfactory method for distributing the rebate than that which is proposed under the Bill. Let us. turn to another aspect of the case. Every honourable member is familiar with the population of the. various States. In New South Walesi t numbers 1,350,000, in Victoria. 1,200,000, in Queensland 500,000, in South Australia 360,000, in Western Australia 180,000, and in Tasmania, approximately, 180,000,making a totalof 3,800,000. The annual consumption of sugar within the Commonwealth is 177,000 tons. If , as the honourable member for North Sydney mentioned, the States paid an import duty of £ 6 per ton upon their total consumption,' It is now proposed to pay the revenue thus derived-assumin g that-, no sugar were produced in Australiawould be approximately £1,100,000. I ask honourable members to note the enigmas connected' with the sugar trade which are brought about by the oversea trade, by the contiguity of the producing States, by production, and the presence of refineries. If Australia received tlie revenue I have indicated from the sugar required for its own consumption, and that revenue were distributed amongst the Statesi n proportion to their population, the New South Wales Treasury would benefit approximately by £ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0; that of Victoria by £ 3 6 0 , 0 0 0 ; Queensland by £150,000 ; South Australia by £108,000 ; Western Australia by £ 5 4 , 0 0 0; and Tasmania by £54,000. That is how the figures would work out, approximately, assuming that none of the States were producing The sugar, but all were importing it from abroad. I am leaving out of consideration what may be termed the "" accidents"" of trade. But what is the present position ? Instead of receiving these amounts the revenue upon imported sugar benefits the New South Wales Treasury by only £66,000, instead of £ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0 ; . Victoria by £282,000, instead of £360,000 ; Queensland by £6,000, instead of £150,000; South Australia by £96,000, instead of £108,000 ; Western Australia by £42,000, instead of £ 5 4 , 0 0 0; and Tasmania by £21,000, instead of £54,000. Honourable members must see at once that if there were no sugar produced in Australia,",17,Turner
46,Mr Speaker,,18,Turner
47,Mr Ewing,This matter originated in,18,Turner
48,Sir George Turner,Thos e figures are,18,Turner
49,Mr Ewing,"The figures which I amNew South Wales would receive £390,000 as revenue from that source, and Victoria£ 3 6 0 , 0 0 0 ; whereas New South Wales receives £282,000. These facts conclusively prove that this is a special matter, and one which requires special consideration. Let us take the case of one State as an example. I have seen it asserted by a South Australian that this is purely a State matter, and that the Commonwealth has no right to pay the sugar rebate out of the consolidated revenue. That statement was made by a representative of a State which-althoug h its population is one third less than that of Queensland-receive s a revenue of £96,000 from imported sugar as against £6,000 received by Queensland from that source. Yet, despite the great disadvantage under which the Treasury of Queensland is placed in regard to import duties, that State is coolly informed that the payment of the sugar rebate is purely a Queensland matter, and should not have come before, this Parliament. question, I submit that this never could have been a State matter. question of the rebate is controlled-and the payment of a bonus, also, must ever be controlled-by the Commonwealth Parliament. The action which the Treasurer has taken is the only one possible under the provisions of the Constitution. If a High Court had been in existence, tlie right honourable gentleman could not have saddled tlie sugar-producing States-and that would have been the result of the action previously contemplated by him-wit h more than their fair share of the payment of the rebate upon the basis of population. To me that point appears perfectly clear. Sub-section (3) of section 51 of the Constitution says that the Parliament shall have power to niake laws "" with respect to bounties on the production or export, of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth."" Tlie power to pay these bounties, therefore, is specifically taken away from the States. All the States must be treated upon an absolute equality. Had the Treasurerinfluenced by any of the States-bee n sufficiently mean to suggest that the payment involved was a State and not a national obligation, it would have been speedily ruled that such was not the case. ber think that the States which produce the grower that he must use white labour, that sugar should alone bear the burden of the payment of the rebate ? only £66,000, and Victoria deal with that aspect of the case. I have already pointed out that under the Constitution all power in connection with this matter has been taken from the States. When the people of the Commonwealth approved of the Constitution, they approved of a Constitution which makes it clear that all bonuses or rebates must be paid by the Commonwealth Government and not by the States. An y attempt to saddle any State with special responsibility in connection therewith must be constitutionally wrong. I hope that the honourable and learned member grasps that point. did the honourable member support the original proposal of the Government t volved was one of whether any rebate should be'paid. I supported that proposal in the first instance, because I 'believedRegarding that phase of the as I still believe-that it was the right policy to adopt. But this is a question of The whole the method in which the payment shall be made. It is a question of whether the burden shall be distributed upon a national or State basis. the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and myself pointed out the trouble that was bound to ensue. the impression that New South Wales has had nothing to do in order to obtain the payment of this rebate, but that State is as much concerned in the matter, in proportion to the area of land under cultivation with sugar-cane, as is Queensland. According to the number of acres under cultivation with sugar-cane, the number of coloured men employed in Queensland is 1 to S 7, and in New South Walesi t is about 1 to 8 8 The New South Wales people therefore on the face of it would appear to have as much to do with this matter as the Queenslanders. under cultivation we had, and that is sometimes forgotten. be punished. punished.

The growers of sugar are very much concerned in the matter, so much concerned, indeed, that some people engaged in the industry in the State of Queensland protest very loudly that the proposals which have been made will ruin the industry. It must be remembered therefore that the sugar growers are not getting this rebate for nothing.

In dealing with bhe question whether this is a State or a national question, I would ask what it is proposed bhab this bonus should be given for? The honourable member for Soubh Australia, Mr Babchelor, will granb bhab ib is given for bhe subsbibubion of Ausbralian workmen for alien workmen. I have no desire. now to discuss bhe probective policy at large, but when that policy was before us for discussion, what was bhe basis of bhe whole of bhe arguments submitted in support of that policy? Wasi t not that it was intended to substitute bhe work of Ausbralian workmen for thab of bhe workmen in obher parbs of bhe world ? Is thab a Sbabe or national mabter ? Honourable members know bhab we never asked whether certain indusbries were esbablished at Foobscray or Hobarb. Possibly, with bhe one exception When the honourable of bhe salb industry, no one ever asked where any indusbry was carried on. We regarded bhe question as a national one, and protective duties were agreed to in order bo secure bhe substibubion of Ausbralian for foreign labour. The same argument applies in this case. When bhe honourable member for Soubh Ausbralia, Mr Babchelor, vobed for protective duties, he did so wibh bhat end in view. He agreed bhab ib was a national mabber, and thab ib should be our objecb bo esbablish Australian workmen here, and bo do away with bhe work of tlie alien and bhe foreigner. I heard the honourable member say these or similar words over'and over again. This mabber of bhe sugar bonus is in exactly the same category. The imposition of protective duties was a national matber, and bhis is a national mabter, for the object sought is the subsbibubion of white labour for alien and foreign labour. If bhe honourable member for South Ausbralia, Mr Batchelor, justifies probecbion from bhe stand-point of labour, he musbgive his vobe for bhis proposal. We are dealing only wibh ber going bo vote for it 1 that that might have been clear even to bhe honourable member for Kennedy.

65,Mr Ewing,"I am inclined bo thinkMi. CAMERON -Every honourable member 1 will not. ought to do so. I believe tliat every honourable member ought to hold that view. I am justified in making the statement that every representative of any portion of the Australian people will feel that he has done a great national work in purging various portions of Australia from black labour. If that be so, if the action taken has been national, and if it has been taken in compliance with a mandate from our constituents that was also national, how can any one now contend that this is a matter for the States? How can it be contended that we should accept the honour and the prestige .that conies from honour, and refuse to accept the responsibility t If this is a national matter the nation,-and not particular States, must pay for it . The whole idea of federation from the first has been the destruction 'of small State interests, and the establishment of a national ideal, the building up of something approaching responsibility, Dot to a particular State, but to the whole continent. If this be not a case in which we get far beyond State responsibility, and if it be not a case in which the nation is interested as a nation, then no such case has yet existed. I believe that morally the Treasurer has done the only thing he could have done, and I believe that, constitutionally, no otber had pursued a strong Australian policy. course was open to him. 1 shall, therefore, be prepared to support the proposal now before us. that usually in financial matters I am only too glad to follow the Treasurer. In view of the position which the right honourable gentleman has held in the past in Victoria, and which he holds in this House, and speaking for myself as a supporter of the Ministry of which he is a member, I am usually only too ready to follow his lead, feeling that the right honourable gentleman will do his best not only for Australia, but for his own State. But, in bringing this Bill forward, I think that the Government and the Treasurer have for the first time raised the question of State rights. Andi n dealing with the question they are not looking to the rights of the four States who have to pay, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia, so much as to the State rights and privileges, as I think I may call them, of tlie State of New South Wales. When we remember tliat New South Wales has really done her best on every occasion to thwart the wishes of the whole of the rest of Australia, and that the cry of the leader of the Opposition, when he was trying to defeat the Commonwealth Bill, was that the other wretched insolvent States of Australia were going to ruin New South Wales, it is very strange to find that that State under the Treasurer's proposal will receive some £22,758. The representatives of that State come to us and the Premier of New South Wales tells us that he requires that Victoria shall pay to New South Wales some £ 1 6 , 2 8 6; South Australia, £ 5 , 6 5 8 ; Queensland, £ S 6 2 ; and Western Australia £846. That is surely a complete reversal of the position as it has been previously stated to us. When we remember that this rebate of £ 2 per ton upon sugar is, under the Braddon sections of the Constitution, to be paid to the New South Wales Treasurer, it is all the more remarkable that this Bill should have been brought forward at all. It is now proposed to alter the Tariff schedule in such a way that the whole of the amount paid in rebate, upon sugar grown by white labour, shall be paid by the whole of the people of Australia upon a population basis. I desire to point out to honourable members that for years before the establishment of federation, Victoria Without bringing the matter into a Commonwealth balance-sheet, and asking that the whole of the Commonwealth should pay for it, Victoria for years before federation supported Australian grown sugar by taxing her own people. ' We imposed a duty of £ 1 2 per ton upon all beet sugar coming from the continent of Europe. labour. ported at a duty of £ 6 per ton only, the desire being to encourage the growth of sugar by white labour in Queensland. Victoria at no time asked for any consideration for this action. The first movement in that direction comes very strangely from New South Wales, which State is to get the whole of the benefit of the rebate paid to growers in that State. New South Wales comes to the other States, who were said by its leaders to be almost insolvent before federation, and is the first to ask that the Commonwealth shall return money collected under",20,Turner

We have bhe sbabemenb from the looks upon last year as a phenomenal one, and Treasurer bhab nexb year Vicboria will nob considers that afterwards. the importations import so much. will not be so large. If , however, the people of Victoria do not import sugar, the State will lose the revenue to be derived from the duty of £ 6 per ton, and which is very necessary in the present condition of Victorian State finances. I tun speaking particTreasurer it was that this was a phenomenal ularly of Victoria, but this applies equally to year. Referring to Victoria and New South Australia and Western Australia.

This, probably be derived from bhe same source in in my opinion, is unfair. I think that if ordinary j'ears. Victoria chooses to pay £ 6 per ton on sugar I take it that when he made that statement through the Customs, that is quite enough he knew what he was talking about, and to ask the people of that State to pay. The honourable, member for Melbourne Ports need not think that I am nob speaking from a Commonwealth stand-point. member is speaking from a very narrow -stand-point. not bhink bhis is a fair proposal so long as bhab section exisbs by which duties bhab are collected in one Sbabe have bo be credibed bo that Sbabe. While bhab lasbs, we cannot regard the Commonwealth as an entity, bub as deparbmenbs. bhe Sbabe revenues, and I think an injustice -is being done to Victoria, Queensland, and Wesbern Ausbralia in bhe mabber. There is another way in which Vicboria, and I suppose every other Sbabe, would have an equal -claim on bhe Commonwealbh. The claim of New Soubh Wales is that because a certain policy has been adopted-that of paying higher wages bo white men-bherefor e the ""Commonwealbh should come bo ibs rescue.' yeb. menb that ran through the speech of the It has been the good fortune of these two States receive a very large amount of revenue from imported sugar, an amount far more than I antithat nexb year Vicboria will nob import so much sugar. upon whab Queensland produces. nob import so much sugar, bhen ib means thab it will have less revenue from bhat source. I .am speaking of Victoria only; bub I mighb say bhat all bhe Sbabes excepb New Soubh Wales will import less sugar, with the consequence bhab bhey will get less revenue; bhat more imported sugar may go bo New Soubh Wales, and yeb all the time, although we are suffering bhis loss of revenue, we are paying a yearly increasing amounb of rebabe bo bhab Sbabe. Thab means bhab all bhe obher The section has an effect on Sbabes will geb no increase in revenue, but will have bo pay bhe rebabe. There is another point which, I think, ought bo be considered-bha b ib is a far bebber bhing to have white men in the Sbate bhan black men. That is admitted by the facb of a wbibe Australia policy having been adopbed. A white man uses far mors taxable articles than does a black man. Mr IJ. E.

77,Mr Crouch,"Yes. If Victoria doesi t is the only reason I wish to use now. If there are a number of white men where previously black men were employed-and that is what the rebate has done for New South Wales-it means that those white men will use far more taxable articles than were previously used, and, although New South Wales may lose upon the rebate which she has to pay to white men, it will get customs duties from the articles which will have to be imported to supply those men, and which black men would not use. For instance, although white men use whisky, black men will not use so much -On this occasion the Opposition are, I kills them a little more quickly. perience of my honourable friend, I will say that the black men use only as much whisky as their wages will permit; that their wages are not so large as are those of white people, and that, therefore, they cannot use so much whisky as white people do. Although the State may lose slightly through the rebate, it will get a large adout of the £ 3 per ton levied by way of exvantage from the use by white men of taxable articles. Yet we are proposing to pay a rebate equal to that which was paid last year on white-grown sugar-£36,000 . am sorry I cannot agree with the Treasurer. If the Commonwealth pools the rebate, it should pool the imports. The Treasurerknows that he cannot do that under the Constitution Act. do that in the interests of Victoria. thing. my honourable and learned friend has not seen the figures. I can give them to him if he likes. figures to be given. If we are to look at this question from a Commonwealth standpoint on one side, we must look at it from the same stand-point on the other side. It does not matter to me whether Victoria loses or gains, so long as it is fairly treated all round. It does not matter . to me if South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland gain so long 'as they are treated fairly in both directions. But if New South Wales is to get the rebate she should also throw into a common pool the I'evenue which she receives from the importation of sugar. That is the only way in which it is possible to meet this position fairly. These facts have been missed in the previous discussion. Strong advocates of the Bill have submitted their views, and, although, of course, I would not vote against the second reading, I think that the views I have expressed should be considered by honourable members. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to show that he has weighed these matters, and is dealing fairly, not only with the Richmond River district of New South Wales, but with the rest of the Commonwealth. It hope, going to assist the Government out of a mess which they have got themselves into in some inexplicable way, to which I need notrefer. We passed a Bill which provided that this matter should be dealt with by way of a rebate, and then it dawned upon Ministers that there was no possible way to pay the rebate, as, indeed, I think, was obvious enough, inasmuch as it was not possible to thein to hand back £ 2 cise without infringing the Constitution. We are now asked to do this thing by way of a bonus, the cost of which is to be cast on I the States without regard to the extent to which they consume black-grown or whitegrown sugar. We, on this side, recognise that this is a price which the various States have to pay for a white Australia, and which can only be paid, as the honourable' member for North Sydney has said, equitably by being paid ratably at so much per head. We have to pay this as the price for a white Australia, not, I hope, the sort I am afraid that of white Australia which the last speaker referred toa white Australia which was to be encouraged by imposing a duty of £ 1 3 per ton on white-grown sugar, and a duty of £ 6 per ton on sugar produced by coloured labour. That is what the honourable and learned member proposed as a splendid way of facilitating the white labour movement. I heard from him, as I have heard from other members, some curious things about that section in the Constitution with which my name is associated. I have heard all sorts of things said about that sectionthat it prevented this thing and the other thing from being done. The Prime Minister has himself said a great many things of that sort, casting the blame and the odium, if there is any, on that unfortunate provision. The honourable and learned",22,Turner

There is nothing in the section which prevents the expenditure revenue in any direction whatever. does is to limit the amount of expenditure within the bounds therein laid down. I presume that the Treasurer has not at his disposal funds to meet this charge out of one-fourth of the net revenue 1 to hear that at the present time there will be ample funds. Sir another million and a half without running against the section, I think. so ab present, bub can the right honourable and learned gentleman say thab will be so while bhe production of white-grown sugar increases, and proporbionabely bhe consumption of black-grown imported sugar decreases ?

What we now have to consider is .a fair method of apportioning bhe rebabe which, until bhe .year 1907, is granted. After considering the matter carefully, I cannot see how it can be done in any head of population. We musb look upon ib from a federal poinb of view. We cannob say, because Queensland and New South Wales are bhe only Sbabes affected by the sugar question-the y will benefit by £61,267 bhis year by way of rebates-that they shall pay the full amount themselves. That would I am be an absurd position.

We are bound, as bhis is a Federal mabber, however obnoxious bhe If produced ab all, principle may. be, bo deal wibh ib per head of population. A t the same time.

The only true method upon which this mabber could have been decided was bo make bhe import duby and bhe excise duby exacbly bhe same during bhe period bebween now and bhe year 1907. I think that honourable members will agree with me upon bhab point if they consider the matter a little. The difficulty ab present is bhis, as has been poinbed out by bhe Treasurer and bhe honourable member for Norbh Sydney : Soubh Ausbralia gebs credib for £ 6 per bon on all her consumption of sugar, except about 500 tons.

94,Mr Glynn (South Australia,") -Posthe amount of the rebate. The honourable member for North Sydney said that tlie amount for which New South Wales gets credit is about £ 3 3s. per ton after having credited the rebate. But at the present time, as we do not take this into account, probably New South Wales gets credit on her consumption for more than £ 3 3s. per ton. We in South Australia get credit for about £ 6 per ton. But we shall under this Bill get credit for £ 5 12s., although the average credit for the States is £ 4 2s. That is to say, we shall get credit for about 30s. more than"" the average credit for the States, while New South Wales will get credit for about 25s. under that average. So that, although South Australia really hands over something like £5,658 this year, it must not be forgotten that owing to the way the GovernmentI will not say made a mess of the matter originally but led us into a diffieultv, we in South Australia are getting something like £30,000 or £40,000 a year from sugar more than we should have done under the-old conditions. Our revenue from/sugar only averaged about £54,000 a yea/, and we are getting £96,000 this year, simply because we are getting the f u l l rate, while the other States only get on an average £ 4 2s. per ton. The whole difficulty would have been got over had the Government proposed that the excise duty should be £ 6 per ton, when the import duty was fixed at £ 6 per ton, and, had they granted a bonus on the production of sugar by white labour. There would have been no necessity to follow up the sugar when once it left the factory. All that the Treasurer had to say was"" Here is the sugar produced by white labour; we give you a bonus of £ 5 per ton for its production,"" which amount would be equivalent to the rebate of £ 2 per ton on an excise of £ 3 , and would be perfectly uniform, inasmuch as New South Wales would get credit for £ 6 per ton on her total consumption, Victoria would get credit for £ 6 per ton, and South Australia and the other States would also get credit for £ 6 per ton, while the bonus expenditure would be debited per capita. We ridiculous position of South Australia being credited with £ 6 per ton, whilst the otherStates on an average were credited with £ 4 2s. The difficulty that has been created was caused by the mistake made by the Government in their leadership of the House, and it is our duty to help them to geb out of bhe muddle. AlbhoughI am strongly opposed bo the proposed abolibion of the excise in 1907-whic h is a matter for future consideration-still , to adjust the matter in the meantime, I shall vote for"" this Bill. A t the present time. I believe that the States are entitled, on the basis of consumption, to receive amounts which the Treasurer holds for them in trust. He was bound under.the Constibubion bo pay bhem bhis money from monbh to month. That is clear under section 89, which says*' The Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance, if any, in favour of the State. But what has the Treasurer done ? Instead of paying bhe Sbabes monbh by monbh, as the Constibubion prescribes, their surplus of bhe sugar duties collecbed according bo consumption bhroughoub bhe States, he has kept the money in hand, and has asked us to revise the Tariff which Parliament passed. After two years, he is asking us to cancel the constitutional duty which he found he was unable to perform, because it was unfair. That is a bad principle bo adopb. This is really ex x>ost faeto legislation. We are all bo some extent responsible in nob having made bhe legislation in question satisfactory, but still it is a bad thing for bhis Parliamenb bo pass an A ct which is retrospective bo bhe extent of eighteen months in regard to money which ought to have been allotted from month to monbh, which belongs bo the States, which is held in trust for. them by the Treasurer, and which, under tlie Constibubion, he oughb bo have paid over to them. But under all bhe circumstances I consider that it is my duby to vote for the Bill. object of this Bill is concerned I do not wish to say very much, except that I believe ib was the idea of most honourable members when we gave legislative effect to the principle of the payment of rebabe under bhe ExciseA ct that the rebate would be borne by the whole Commonwealth. Ab any rate, several honourable members to whom I have spoken have expressed that should not then have had the view, and I myself certainly bhonghb thab the rebabe would be a charge upon bhe whole Commonwealbh, and nob upon the bwo Stabes of Queensland and New South Wales.

95,Mr Clarke (Cowper),"As far as the way from the stand-point of one who is in favour of the principle of a white Australia, I ' think, that the House will be in agreement with the principle underlying this measure."" ""WhatI rose for chiefly was to express the hope that when the regulations are being framed, the basis of the past year's crushing will be carefully looked into. doing that now. that, and I hope as a result there will be a more equitable distribution of what will now become the bonus. Althoughi t is recosrnised that an honest effort has been made to deal with this complicated question, some sugar-cane growers are not quite satisfied with the distribution, or rather with the way in which the rebate has been apportioned. That is to say, their yield has been of a higher average than that on which they have been paid. 1 trust that that matter will be looked into, and that as far as possible the growers will get the full benefit of the rebate-o r bonus as it will then be-in the future. 1 have no hesitation in supporting the measure, and am glad to notice that honourable members are receiving it in such a cordial manner. fore us is, I am bound to say, one of the results of the ill-considered legislation that has been introduced, and I submit that it is a matterf or which Ministers are entirely responsible. It is a great pity that at the very inception of federation so little care was taken in considering legislation from the point of view from which statesmen ought to consider it, and of making the measures passed as elastic as possible. Difficulties of this sort were pointed out when the question was first raised. It was also pointed out that the rebate to be given exceeded the amount that was paid in labour for cutting bhe cane. I .find from Coghlan thab there is a difference of somebhing like 6d. bo 7d. per bon between-the cosb of cubbing cane by black labour and whibe. The figures are respectively 2s. l i d . and 3s. 5d. per ton. But say that the difference is quite Is. per ton. The rebate formerly proposed was 4s. per ton, taking the cane to average 10 per cent, of sugar. Advantage -has not been taken of the fact that the bonus might have been brought down from 4s. to Is. bo cover bhis difference. When we are considering bhe way bhe other Sbabes are affected it must be remembered bhat ib is nob ab all improbable bhab the full amount of sugar used for local consumption in Australia will be locally produced. I find that a tobal of 194,000 bons of sugar have been raised in one year in Ausbralia, and bhat exceeds the present consumption of something like 180,000 bons. When the is B ill gets into Committee I shall raise a protest against the retrospective clauses of it . I am pleased to hear I do not bhink thab we are legally entibled to pass bhem. As far as bhe Treasurer is concerned, it seems to me that the proposal now brought forward is bebber in many respecbs bhan bhe former .one. Ab all evenbs it enables each State to know exactly the price it is paying. That is one great advantage thab will resulb from ibs passage. As to one question raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, I think bhab under the Constitution there will be considerable difficulty in allowing mabbers to remain as they are at present. When the ifligh Court is established-o r even now, if ^Federal jurisdiction were given to bhe local courtsif an application were made by any Sbate interested, the money held by bhe Treasurer would have bo be paid over. I do nob bhink that bhe facb bhat bhe Treasurer holds certain moneys would enable him at any fubure time bo rebain bhese moneys as againsb bhe Sbate.

It is satisfactor)'to those who supported the white Australia policy in the beginning to find that it is now being largely endorsed. In my opinion, our enactments will produce good fruit, and will prove to be for the welfare, not only of Queensland and New South Wales, but of the whole Commonwealth. I do not agree with the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, that the B ill should not be retrospective. I would rather enlarge its scope than restrict it , and therefore I hope that the Treasurer will take power to enable him to pay bonuses from year to year as the planters increase the areas cultivated by white labour. It is no doubt the wish of honourable members that all bhe sugar grown in Australia shall be grown by white labour, and I think that such an alteration of the Bill as I suggest will help bo more quickly achieve thab end. I regreb bhe tone which has been adopted by some of the representatives of Vicboria who have spoken upon the Bill. Although originally Queensland was called upon bo pay mosb heavily for a whibe Ausbralia, I , as the representative of a Queensland consbibuency, nevertheless cheerfully supporbed bhe proposal to granb bhe rebabe upon beeb sugar grown by whibe labour which bhe Vicborian represenbabives, selfish above those of every other Sbabe, desired. I am nob parochial, however, in regard bo this mabber. I bhink bhere is nob a State in A ustriilia which cannot produce sugar, and I should like to see Victoria underbake bhe production of beeb sugar. Then we shall have a bruly national policy which every one of us can support. I am exceedingly pleased bhat bhe Governmenb proposal has been so well received, and I venbure bo bhink bhab ib will be more equitable than bhe arrangemenb which has prevailed in the past. The admirable speech of the honourable member for North Sydney on bhe subjecb, however', leaves practically nobhing more bo be said. Many of us plainly saw, in the firsb insbance, bhab bhe original arrangement could, by an understanding between bhe sugar-growers and bhe manufacburers, be made bo work distinctly againsb bhe inberesbs of particular States. Victorian representatives should remember, however, that while under the present arrangement their State will be £16,2S6 to the bad, it mighb have been nexb year, under the old arrangemenb, twice That was not as much to the bad.

244,Mr Thomson,"It would enable him tohostility in regard to the employment of white labour in the sugar-fields. But now a change has come over the minds of the growers. We find that at places like Mackay, and other leading sugar centres, the growers are taking up the position that they should endeavour to make the white Australia policy a success. I notice with pleasure that Mr Philp has given that advice-that the sugar-growers should do all they can to take advantage of the provisions of the Commonwealth Act, and to make the poliey of a white Australia a success if possible. The point is, therefore, whether, as a Parliament, we should endeavour to give them every assistance we can, in order to carry out the policy we desire to see promoted. Here was a large national industry in Queensland, in which coloured labour had been employed. Our desire was to have -that industry carried on without any coloured labour being employed in it . When the growers themselves are expressing a desire to come under these provisions, if we can in framing this B ill give would be able bo pub inbo or take oub of bhe to the Minister power to enable him to further the policy we desire, it is our duty to do so. The proposal is perfectly reasonable, and does not ask us to take out of the hands of Parliament any power which it now possesses. cover what is proposed. MrL . E. GROOM I submit that is all that is proposed under the Bill. As the Treasurer has pointed out, under the operation of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, the importation of Kanakas will diminish every year, and finally cease ; and we know, further, that these coloured men are continually leaving the Commonwealth. There were a certain number of contracts in existence prior to the passing of that Act, and those contracts from time to time expire. What is desired is to enable planters, as their contracts expire, to set aside, under regulation, certain specified lands which they declare will in tlie future be worked by white labour only. As contracts expire it becomes more difficult to get coloured labour; and if planters are desirous of making an honest effort to carry on with white labour we ought to extend a helping hand and preserve the sugaiindustry for Australia as a whole. There is no proposal to deprive the House of any power : on the contrary, there is an attempt to honestly and justly carry into effect the existing law.. We ought not to do anything to place obstacles in the way of a policy to which we are pledged and which we desire to see carried into eJfect. All thab the Treasurer proposes are such powers as will enable the Minister, after eohsulbabion wibh his officers, bo fix a dabe which will bend to the efficient carrying oub of bhe policy. I hope bhe Commibbee will granb bhe powers asked for, because I am sure bhey will render valuable assistance bo bhe indusbry, not only in Queensland, bub bhroughoub the Commonwealth. have no objection to give the Minister any powers which we cannot properly define ourselves. So long, however, as we can accurabfly define bhe powers we desire bo see exercised, we have no righb bo place in bhe hands of a Minisber, who may now or in bhe fubure adminisber bhe Acb, any such option as bhab proposed. By bhe change of a single day bhe Minisber, under bhis Bill, pockebs of bhe people in bhis community thousands'of pounds. There are honourable membersonbobh sides of bhe Commibbee whose inbenbion is similar and easily defined ; and we have no right to remibexbraordinary powers bo any Minisber when our inbenbion can be made clear in words. The honourable member for Richmond desires bhe. removal of any resbriction which would prevent bhe bonus being paid in bhe case of a crop produced by white labour but grown from roots which, it may be, had lain in bhe ground for four or five years. Thab is my desire, and bhe desire, I believe, of other honourable members who may object bo bhe proposal as ib appears in bhe Bill. We have, in the words of the honourable member for Richmond, given absolution in the case of a crop partly produced or grown by coloured labour prior to February, 1902. But I am againsb giving bhe bonus in bhe case of any crop-by bhis I do hob mean bhe roob or sbool from which bhe crop is grown-o n which black labour has been employed after that date.

Such powers ought not to be given unless absolutely necessary; and they are not necessary in the present case.. The proposal of the Minister would seem to mean that only four months of white labour need be given to earn the bonus; and, if that be so, it is a most extrordinary proceeding to which I do not see my way to agree. It will be an acknowledgment of incapacity if we are not capable of expressing our meaning in the Bill. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney, that if we can possibly express in the Bill what we mean we should do so, and not give power to any Minister to make regulations for carrying out what are the main principles of the measure. My suggestion is that we should leave the clause precisely as at present only adding the following words :Provided that, after the coming into operation of this Act, bhe grower registers his intention to when dealing with the Bill, which was grow wibh whibe labour only twelve months prior to such delivery. The season varies in different parts of Australia, and each grower knows when his season commences. the grower in Northern Queensland and the grower on the Manning River; and, under my suggestion, it would be left open to them to register twelve months before delivery. But we certainly should ask the Government to put into the measure some guarantee, because I can assure the Committee that I have suffered more heavily, perhaps, than any man in the Commonwealth from the operation of the "" white Australia policy."" I am not prepared to make that sacrifice again for growers who employ black labour to within four months of the delivery of the cane to the mill. It may be that, as the Bill makes no provision for registration, it will be necessary to insert in it a clause providing for registration under the regulations. Tlie wordsProvided that after the coming into operation . of bhis Acb apply only to future cases.

Both the excise and import duties were settled on the basis of that. agreement, and therefore introduced merely to alter the manner of payment by substituting a bonus for a rebate, we should not try to alter the original arrangement.

There seems to be great difference 3 02 I feel certain of opinion as to what is the proper form for the proposed amendment, and I , for one, should not like to vote on the question this evening. I doubt, indeed, whether it is wise to amend the Bill at all. I think it would be better to confine its provisions to their original scope, and let this new matter standi over. I object to the granting of bonuses to those who go on growing cane for a considerable time with black labour. There will be great difficulty in obtaining support in the sacrifice which we are making to create a white Australia if growers who employ black labour up to within a short time of the delivery of their cane are to be allowed to obtain a bonus. with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that it would be as well if the Committee had more time to consider the amendment.

297,Mr Fisher,"Fo r bhe reason which Ithat black labour had been employed in the cultivation of the cane up to a certain point, the growers had registered on the 30th March and had been able to secure the rebate. In view of these circumstances such restrictions should be imposed that if planters desire to earn the bonus they must cultivate their cane wholly by means of white labour. Upon all the plantations a large area, is annually set out for a new crop, and if growers' desire to obtain the rebate they can start by employing white labour solely upon the newly planted area. Then they will obviate the necessity of having to plough out the results of previous cultivation. I was very much surprised when it was pointed out to me that it was possible to cultivate cane with black labour, and still to obtain the rebate. I thought that was simply ridiculous, and when the instances mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert were quoted, I was perfectly staggered. I know that this cannot be clone now under the regulations, but it has been done. We should put our foot down very firnnty, and make the planters understand that they must use white labour wholly in the cultivation of sugar upon which'any rebate is to be claimed. that it was principally through my intercession with the Minister for Trade and Customs that the time for registration was extended to 1st March last. When I was in Northern Queensland during the recess, I was waited upon at Cairns and other places by planters, who asked me if I would use my influence with the Minister to have this concession granted. I consented to do so, but told them plainly that, so far as I was personally concerned, I would not go one day beyond 1st March. I told them tliat they were'not entitled to any further extension of time; that they had had every opportunity of taking advantage of the provisions of the Act, if they had chosen to do so, but that they were so wedded to black labour . that they would not give it up. Therefore, I said that if they wanted the rebate they would have to make another start. I hold that view still.

If a promise such as that to which I have referred has been given, and if people have .acted upon the faith of it, Parliament might feel bound to give effect to it . But I am very dubious of the propriety of adopting any such amendment as that suggested by the Treasuror, which would vest tlie Minister with power to fix dates, so that the bonus might be claimed upon sugar which had been worked by white labour only after those dates. It seems to me that under such an arrangement it would be possible for a great many growers-seein g that thej' cut their cane at different periods-to cultivate it by black labour t ill it had reached a very advanced stage, and then to cut it by white labour, so that they might claim the bonus upon it . the date fixed by the Minister.

That is the danger against which we have to guard. The Committee have been taken by surprise by the proposal to extend the terms of the bargain which was made at the time that the Excise TariffA c t was passedNo question of this kind was then raised.

They should understand distinctly that according to CogMcm they are being asked to' contribute just eight times as much as is necessary to cover the difference in the cost of production between the employment of white and black labour. to New South Wales only. the position is slightly worse for Queensland than it is for New South Wales, because he shows that in the total cost of production of a ton of sugar there is a difference of 39s. in favour of Queensland as against New South Wales. He points out that this is partly due to tlie difference in the cost of labour, and is due also to one or two other considerations. A t that rate Queensland could afford to take 3s. 6d. per ton less. member will perhaps explain to the Committee that Cog/dan is dealing only with the growing of the cane, and not with the cutting and crushing. Goglda/n deal with the growing and cutting, not with the treatment in the mill, but with the total cost up to the time the cane is received in the mill. The honourable and learned member will probably recollect that Cog/dan includes in his figures something like 9d. per ton of cane as the cost of transport from the field to the mill. He explains that the cost of transport is less in Queensland owing to the better facilities there provided by small railways and tramways and the proximity of central mills. He gives figures showing a cost of something like 12s. 2d. for Queensland and 16s. 3d. for New South Wales. the cane. the cane and its whole treatment until it reaches the mill, and the figures given include the price paid for the cane, which is something like 10s. or l is . per ton. growing of the cane, and do not embrace thrashing and cutting in which black labour is employed. learned member will again refer to Coghlan he will find that his figures cover the cost of thrashing and cutting and the transport of the cane to the mill. He points out that 2s. l i d . is the lower rate for black labour, and 3s. od. is the rate for white labour, the difference being 6d. per ton. In this Bill we are asked to vote as a bonus eight times that amount. If we say that instead of 6d. the difference in cost between sugar produced by white labour and that produced by black labour is Is. per ton, we are then being asked to vote four times as much as we should.

349,Sir George Turner,"I sliall try to meetMrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I intimated when speaking upon the second reading of this Bill, that I think it proposes the introduction of a very bad system in our legislation. Utterly irrespective of the sentimental aspect given to the question by some honourable members, it is misleading to make a surcharge virtually upon the various States for sums of money which they have received, and which should be contributed by them towards making up this rebate of excise duty. Some honourable members have said that when the rebate was proposed, they were under the impression that it was to be divided per capita amongst the people of the Commonwealth as the establishment of a white Australia and the encouragement of white labour on our sugar-fields was a national question, and to this extent I have no doubt that many honourable members did consider that some sacrifice on the part of the States was necessary. It is pointed out in the papers which the Treasurer has kindly handed to us that one of the States which would be in a somewhat bad position owing to the existing system of making a reduction in the rate of excise merely on whitegrown sugar, is New South Walesa State which from the figures before us appears to have consumed by far the largest quantity of Australian-grown sugar. I would point out that when the Excise Tariff Bill was before us the question of the relative contributions by the States under its provisions did not arise. Those States which were likely to consume, and have consumed, the greater portion of the white-grown sugar of Queensland have been placed in this position-that instead of receiving a credit of £ 3 per ton excise duty on blackgrown sugar, or £ 6 per ton Customs duty on imported white-grown sugar, they have received a credit to their revenue of only £ 1 per ton excise duty on white-grown sugar. I am not aware of the method which has been adopted by the Treasurer in the payment or distribution of this rebate to the growers. The Excise TariffA c t distinctly saysThe rebate to be allowed at the rate of ton on the sugar-giving contents of the beet. AU rebates to be allowed at the time of delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment in manner prescribed of the sugar-giving contents. The word "" rebate "" has a common every day meaning. It is simply an allowance in respect of white-grown sugar, and instead of charging £ 3 per ton excise duty to the grower, or producer, or manufacturer-that is, to the man who last handled it-as we do on black-grown sugar, we charge only £ 1 per ton. We charge £ 3 per ton virtually, but we make an allowance of £ 2 per ton, and that allowance was to be calculated on its sugar contents when the sugarwas brought to the mill. I am a little in the Government now think the dark by reason of the fact that I missed hearing a portion of the Treasurer's, speech the other day, and I do not think that he has really explained the modus operandi which has been adopted with regard to the rebates. It appears to me that the clear reading of the Excise Tariff' Act is that, having ascertained when the sugar-cane or beet was brought to the mill for treatment, and discovered by analysis thesugar contents of the sugar-cane or beet, it is then a question of whether its owner should pay an excise duty of £ 3 a ton, or whetherhe should pay an excise duty of £ 3 per ton with a rebate of £ 2 per ton-in other words, £ 1 per ton on the ascertained sugar contents. Whatever may have been understood by some honourable members, whatever may have been thought of"" the mode in which this loss of revenue by States consuming the white-grown sugarwas to be regulated, it was not embodied in the Act, and the proposal to go back upon that legislation, and to ask the States to pay a sum of £60,000 in order to recoup to the States which have used thewhite-grown sugar the sum of £ 2 per ton rebate on that sugar seems to me grossly unjust. It is a bad departure in principle. It is extremely dangerous to go back on a legislative enactment which has been on the statute-book for twelvemonths, and under which certain suras have been paid and certain accounts have been adjusted with regularity between the States, and ask those States, for a surcharge provided for by new legislation. It is a departure which, asregards the past, I cannot understand, but which, as regards the future, may beperfectly just, now that the question is. raised for the first time in Parliament. -£2 per That appears to me to be a strong point. I .should like the Treasurer, by interjection, toenlighten me as to the manner in which therebates have been paid or allowed. It is. clear that the Excise TariffA ct contemplated a mere rebate or virtually thecollection of £ 1 per ton on the sugar contents instead of £ 3 per ton. It provides that the rebate shall be allowed at the rate of £ 2 per ton on the sugar-giving contents of the cane or beet, at the time of the delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment of the sugar-giving contents in the manner prescribed. Where is the delivery of the cane or beet to be made? Undoubtedly it is to be made to tlie mill or place of treatment where the sugar contents are to be ascertained, and the excise duty of £ 1 per ton collected from the producer of the sugar, which would give him the advantage of a protection of 5 per ton against foreign sugar. That was considered by many honourable members on this side to be a very high rate of protectionsuch a rate as would encourage the growth and production of sugar by European labour. Section 93 of the Constitution Act distinctly says thatThe duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State, and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall he taken to have been collected, not in the former but in the latter State. That is to say, that the State where a ton of this sugar is consumed shall be credited with the excise duty. What excise duty ? Surely the Treasurer will not tell me that he has first credited the States with the £ 3 per ton excise duty, and then debited them with the £ 2 per ton rebate-that a host of financial operations have had to be gone through, instead ""of .the simple operation contemplated by the Excise TariffA c t of collecting and crediting to . the States only £ 1 per ton on the sugar contents of white-grown cane, instead of £ 3 . I cannot understand the Government not seeing that-whethe r this policy is one which Australia will approve of in the future or not-it is an injustice to pass retrospective legislation, and to go back on our previous legislation. I trust that the good sense of the Committee will see that it is inadvisable and unfair at this very early stage of our existence, not only to amend our legislation, but to go in for a retrospective surcharge on the various States, which will be a tax on some of their revenues. of fixing the mode of dealing with the rebate, as it was unfortunately called, on whitegrown sugar gave the Blouse a considerable amount of trouble. We were all anxious that the rebate should go to the grower of the cane, and we knew well that, if we had an excise duty paid by the manufacturer of the sugar and allowed the rebate off the duty, then there might be a little difficulty about the whole of the rebate getting back to the grower. The Act provides for an excise duty of £ 3 per ton on the manufactured sugar, and we are bound to collect that sum. We cannot collect only £ 1 per ton. The Act tells us that on the manufactured sugar we are to collect the excise duty. My honourable friend opposite seems to think that we ought to collect the excise duty from the grower when he takes his cane to the mill, but that would be utterly impracticable. MrY . L . SOLOMON -O r from the mill. the Excise, duty when the sugar produced from the cane goes into consumption, and it is not collected for many months after we have had to pay the rebate to the growers-in some cases probably fifteen or eighteen months, because a considerable stock is carried over from one year to the other. bate paid ? Sir. GEORGE TURNER -We pay the rebate to the grower immediately the sugar cane is delivered at the mill. Our authorised officers at the mill give a certificate which is equal to cash. It is cashed on presentation at the Treasury or other convenient places throughout the State. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The rebate is paid on a sum which has not been collected ? ' "" Rebate"" may not have been the right word to use, but it was very difficult to find a word which would have better answered our purpose. But the object was perfectly clearthat the grower immediately he delivered his cane at the mill should be entitled to receive his certificate, and to get that certificate cashed as quickly as possible afterwards. The mode adopted in administration has enabled him to get that money within a day or two of the delivery of his cane at the mill. The excise itself can only be collected on the sugar produced from the cane, and that is collected from persons entirely different from those who grow the cane.

Consequently, it would be better to deal with matters of substance as they arise, and to afterwards alter this clause to agree with the final determination of the Committee. the Attorney-General not to postpone this clause unless he also consents to postpone clause 3, which fixes the number of Judges who shall constitute the High Court. There is far more in the motion of the Attorney General than will perhaps be at once grasped by honourable members. Unless we at once raise the question of the jurisdiction we are to vest in the Court, we cannot determine the number of Judges, and the Attorney General, probably feeling that, asks us to It is only take the extraordinary course of postponing the clause in order to prevent the possibility of the question of jurisdiction being raised at this stage. I desire to propose an amendment on clause 1, with a view of testing the question of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, but I shall not do so at this stage if clause 3 be also postponed. In the absence of any promise as to the postponement of the latter clause, the sooner we test the question of the. original jurisdiction the better. would, in any case like to see the question of the original jurisdiction raised on clause on motion by Sir GEOBGE 75. amendment on clause 1 which will immediately raise the question of the original jurisdiction, and this may have something to do with the anxiety of the Attorney-General to have the clause postponed. When the B ill was before us last week, the Attorney General was particularly anxious that clause 1 should be passed at once as a merely formal clause, but I immediately asked that it should be discussed, with a view to its improvement by the omission of certain words. The amendment of which I have given notice would have the effect of confining the original jurisdiction of the High Court to the matters contemplated by section 75 of the Constitution the jurisdiction. clause on which to do so. entirely in the hands of the Committee. If honourable members are of opinion that we are in a position to deal with the questions raised on this purely index clause, I am prepared to deal with it, though to me that course appears most undesirable. When the Bill was last before us, I regarded it as a clause which might have been passed without question, because it must necessarily be amended to correspond with any alterations the Committee may make in other parts of the Bill. If clauses are altered substantially, the index to the B ill must necessarily be altered, and consequently I then regarded it as a matter of no importance.

If we deal with -the question of jurisdiction, surely we had better deal with it on the clauses which :specifically endow the court. to them. If the Committee prefer, however, to deal with the question of jurisdiction before touching the question of the number of Judges, I am prepared to postpone clause 3 along with clause 1. But I do not. think that the most desirable method of procedure. I fear that the Connexion or proportion to be established between the jurisdiction and the strength of the Bench cannot, even in the minds of professional members, be clear and beyond dispute. It is a matter on which every two professional men, in the Chamber or out of it, may well entertain different opinions. One professional man might say that if we gave the whole original jurisdiction asked for, it would mean another Judge or another two Judges, while a second professional man of equal experience might be of opinion that we could give that jurisdiction without adding a single member to the Bench. So far as I can judge, the discussion of tlie jurisdiction, and we must discuss it -the Bill-is not likely to effect the minds of honourable members in regard tcf the strength of the Bench in any precise way. bow to the decision of the Committee; but my own opinion is that the discussion will not and cannot have such an effect. I will take no unfair advantage of the Committee, even though honourable members are under what appears to me to be a misapprehension. Therefore, if it be the general desire, I will agree to the postponementof clause 3 until the clauses dealing with the jurisdiction have been disposed of. If honourable members believe that the consideration of those clauses will afford them a better foundation for a specific decision as to the number of Judges to be appointed, I bow to their wish, though I think they are mistaken. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -Before we determine the number of J udges to be [16 JUNE, 1903.] Bill. 951 appointed, we should make up our minds as to the amount of work which they are to be called upon to perform. It is of no use to decide to appoint five Judges, and then to determine what work they shall do; we must determine the work to be done before we say how many Judges are to be appointed. I disagree with the Attorney General when he says that the number of the Judges is not relevant to the amount of clause 1 work to be assigned to the Court. Sir JOHN QUICK If 'we assign to the Court only the constitutional original jurisdiction and an appellate jurisdiction, it will not have the same amount of work to perform as if the additional and optional jurisdiction relating not only to Federal matters, but to such matters as Admiralty cases and disputes between residents of the States, which belong absolutely to the States Courts, were assigned to it . The Bill also provides for the removal of suits in Federal matters from the States Courts to the High Court. that provision. Sir JOHN QUICK If that provision is not omitted, and power to try criminal cases is also given to the Court, the Judges will have to be even more numerous than is now proposed. Five Judges will not be enough, and before the end of a year there would be a demand for an addition to their number. test the question of jurisdiction upon this clause? Sir JOHN QUICK I do not think it If so, I am prepared to would be convenient to do so. clause, it will be necessary to postpone a great many clauses. Sir JOHN QUICK I suggest the postponing of clauses 1, 2, and 3. Before we proceed further, we should deal with the question of jurisdiction. Afterwards we can decide how many Judges will be required. of the view put forward by the Attorney General, I would remind the Committee that if we come to a decision as soon as possible as to whether the Court is to be merely an appellate court or a court of large original jurisdiction as well, we shall know how to deal with a number of subsequent clauses. I think we cannot too soon determine the jurisdiction of the Court. If",54,Judiciary Bill

It will, however, be difficult to consider many of the clauses until we know what the jurisdiction of the Court is to be. I can understand honourable members saying that five Judges would be required even for an appellate court, on the ground that it would be betterthat the Judges should have a certain amount of spare time than that suitors should practically be denied justice by the delay and consequent .expense in hearing causes. On the other hand, if the jurisdiction provided for by clause 40 is conferred, five Judges cannot be enough. If the Committee intend to determine the question of jurisdiction on clause 1, well and good. Buti f before dealing with the question of jurisdiction it is decided to limit the nnmber of Judges, a great many of the clauses will have to be re-drafted, and the Attorney-General could not be expected to say on the spur of the moment what clauses should and what clauses should not be amended. other honourable members that the question of jurisdiction is the vital substance of the Bill, upon which its other provisions hinge, and I suggest to the Attorney-General that, to get at the root of the matter, PartsI . , I I . , and III . , should be postponed, and that disposition to determine the questions raised we should commence at clause 31 in Part IV. proper places, so far as the' drafting of the Bil l is concerned, they involve a hundred questions our decisions upon which will depend upon our determination in regard to Part IV . the Attorney-General .to accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella.

I am' sure that we do not think that he would take advantage of the Committee, but it is known that the question of jurisdiction and the number of the Judges are both agitating the minds of many honourable members, and as, if we decide to limit the jurisdiction of the Court and to reduce the number of the Judges, the reconstruction of a large portion of the Bill will be necessary, I think it would be well to postpone all clauses which might require redrafting until we have dealt with those questions. the legend inscribed on the pavement in the vestibule-""In the multitude of counsellors there is safety,"" but that saying is not borne out by what we have seen this evening. I am anxious to do what is right in connection with this Bill, but the conflicting counsels of the legal members of the Committee leave me very much in a quandary. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that if the Court were merely an appellate one there would not be enough work for five Judges, because my experience of Judges is that they are always overworked, and that the Bench is always undermanned. I think it would be better to decide the question at issue now, and thus save the waste of time which would be involved by dealing with clauses which might afterwards have to be re-considered.

The proposal is to allow the Judges of the High Court to deal with the subject-matters set forth in the clause, but not to exclude the (States Courts from dealing with them. The original jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 75 of the Constitution is printed in small type at the foot of page 7. It is not competent for us to either reduce or alter that jurisdiction. But section 76 gives us the right to extend it by adding the subject-matters set forth in the clause. Our first intention was to give to the High Court all the original jurisdiction with which it was possible to endow it ; but, upon further consideration, and having regard to the debate upon the second reading, I propose to move the omission of paragrapli («), which confers jurisdiction in respect of Admiralty and Maritime causes. The effect of the amendment will be that all such cases must be commenced, in four of the States in the Supreme Courts, and, in New South Wales and Victoria., in Admiralty Courts. We realize, even in regard to the provision allowing the power of removal from the States Courts to the High Court, the arguments for leaving Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction-whic h may involve the detention of a ship, and should be exercised with extreme rapidity-wit h the States Courts. It is true that, even if paragraph (c) remained in the clause, the States Courts would not be -deprived of their jurisdiction in respect to those matters, but the arguments of honourable members, when the second reading was under discussion, showed that, in their opinion, the States Courts are so circumstanced that they are well able to deal with this class of cases, and the omission of the paragraph does not amount to more than a convenient reduction of the original jurisdiction of theHigh Court. But I hope the Committee will not strike out the remainder of the clause, because all that it does is to provide that when we 3P have a High Court in existence litigants may commence suits of this kind before any of the jurisdiction at present existing in the States Courts, but leaves litigants free to take their choice. taken away by clause 41. Committee to strike out clauses 42 and 43, and. the greater part of clause 44, retaining only such parts as it may be necessary to ' attach to the remaining clauses. I want the Committee to carefully consider before they amend the clause, what will be the effect of their action. They will prevent the Judges of the High Court from dealing in the first instance with cases whioh arise under the Constitution, or which involve its interpretation, or cases which arise under the laws of the Commonwealth, or cases which.relate to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of the different States.

466,Mr Glynn,"If we follow the lead ofis original jurisdiction given to a Federal Court in America. Federal laws. Mr O'MALLEY -The Circuit Courts have original jurisdiction. ginal jurisdiction given to the Supreme Qourt of America. Original jurisdiction is given to the Federal Circuit Courts for reasons which are not applicable here. In America, there was no power under the Constitution to confer Federal jurisdiction upon States Courts, and for that reason they were obliged in the first year, I think in 17S9, at the same time as they created the Supreme Court of America, to create a series of-Federal Courts to localize justice. But under our Constitution, anticipating that there would be no necessity for many years to come to create Federal Courts, power is expressly taken, to vest jurisdiction in the States Courts. Stilli t is true that the Supreme Court of America has original jurisdiction in exceedingly few cases. We have, b}' our Constitution, given original jurisdiction to the High Court in those cases, and in one or two more. Surelyi t will not be said that the efficiency of our existing courts is not adequate for the discharge of original matters that may arise 1 Surelyi t would be far better for honourable members to allow the Supreme Court of a State, for instance, to hear an appeal from a court of summary jurisdiction upon a matter involving some point arising under the CustomsA c t 1 Whether we give original jurisdiction or not to the High Court in matters arising under section 76 of the Constitution summary jurisdiction will .still remain in the summary courts of the States, so that a Customs information would be heard, not by a Federal Court, but the court of summary jurisdiction. Wouldi t not be better, therefore, that in the first instance an appeal from a conviction in a Customs case should be heard by the Supreme Court of a State than by a Federal Circuit Jndgegoingonce in four or six months to a State to hear cases ? In the first place we should get the point decided by three Judges, and the chances would then be that unless there was a divergence between the decisions of various States upon some -question the matter would not be taken to the High Court of Australia. But, if the matter is taken before a single Federal Judge on circuit, in nine cases out of ten the chances are that it will go on to the High Court. Cases arising out of MrO ' MALLEY No , it is the other way according to the experience of America. is again bringing in the experience of In no other cases is oriAmerica, forgetting that under our system we shall have one circuit Judge, whilst in America the Circuit Court consists of three Judges. In America tlie Circuit Court is practically a court of final appeal. of the Supreme Court of America1 the Supreme Court of America, but the Circuit Courts act as courts of appeal and courts of original jurisdiction. I think there are three Judges sitting at these Circuit Courts the District Judge and two Judges of the Supreme Court of America. In all cases where they do not certify that a point ought to be reservedor unless the Supreme Court of America on special application, as of grace, grants an appeal, which very seldom occurs, the decision of the Circuit Courti n America is final. So that really in America the Circuit Court would be equal to our proposed High Court. as I have mentioned in nine cases out of ten an appeal would not go -beyond the Circuit Court. Mi-. DEAKIN -That does not make it equal. it would be of equal ability, but that it would be equal in point of efficiency, which means expedition and cheapness. The question of ability is a matter of the personnel of the court, and we cannot predicate that the Australian Court will be better than the American Court or, say, tliat the American Court is better than the Australian Court will be. Before we can speak upon that point we must wait until we see the calibre of the Judges appointed to the High Court, and the less political such appointments are the better they are, as a rule. jurisdiction. equal in that respect, because they have not the ultimate appellate power.

Nearly all the removals there are from District Courts -which are Federal Courts or from States Courts, which are allowed to exercise Federal jurisdiction under certain conditions, to the Circuit Courts. This shows tliat they are tribunals of almost equal importance to the High Court which we propose to establish. America these tribunals promote the decentralization of justice. It is certain that if we allow original jurisdiction here we allow it to be exercised by a single Judge upon circuit, and the cases must wait until the circuit is made, which in America occurs only once in six months. Consequently if the decision is to be that of a single Judge in a majority of cases it will mean the carrying of the cases on to the High Court with consequent additional expense. The Attorney-General will surely be influenced by an authority such as Cooley on this question. Cooley is a writer on purely constitutional measures, not like Story and some others who are general writers on American laws, and who incidentally deal with constitutional questions. Books which are directed purely to matters of constitutional interpretation and constitutional rights will, I think, be admitted as authorities of greater weight than those in which such matters are incidentally referred to in a general discourse upon law. After mentioning that as an interpreter of the Constitution that must be a Court of Appeal, that the Supreme Court is necessary to secure uniformity as an appellate tribunal, and that the same principle does not apply to original jurisdiction, Cooley says :These reasons do not, however, apply to the original jurisdiction over a case, but only to the formal application in the case of the rule of law that shall govern it. The full purpose of the Pederal jurisdiction is subserved if the case, though first heai-d in the State Court, may be removed at the option of bhe parties, for final determination, to the Courts of the States. That is the opinion of one of the chief constitutional writers' in America on the working of their Constitution, and surely honourable members will accept that as a weighty authority-that cept in a few matters arising the Constitution, Mr Glynn. States Courts. There is another authority, who should to some extent influence the Attorney-General, and thab is Mr Garran. I am not referring now to the work which has so justly merited the eulogium of every one who has looked at it-Messrs. Quick and Garran's work on the Constitutionbut to a little work entitled 27ie Coming Commomvealth, published before the inauguration of the Commonwealth, by Mr. Garran, who is now secretary to the Attorney-General, and who probably has had It is shown also that in something to do with the framing of these Judiciary and Procedure Bills. What does Mr Garran say?In practice it will probably be found that the original jurisdiction will only be required in a limited class of cases; for instance, where the Commonwealth is a partj', where one State is proceeding against another, or where the representatives of other countries are affected. These are, of course, cases in which original jurisdiction is given under section 75 of the Constitution. Mr Garran goes on to sayIu other Ciises it will probably be better to leave the original jurisdiction wholly to the State Courts subject to the right of appeal to tlie Pederal Court. That is what we are asking for, and J. give it on the authority of the Secretary to the Attorney-General. That appears in a book published just before the Convention began to sit in order to influence the judicial provisions of bhe Constitution. bhoughbs. thoughts happen to be his best thoughts in this case. Let us look at what would be the effecb of conferring bhis jurisdiction upon bhe Sbates Courts. It would mean that in every case where legislation had been passed under section 51 of the Constitution the Federal Circuit Judge would have equal power to hear disputes with State Judges. Thab would include all baxabion matters MrL . E.

481,Mr Glynn,"Origina l jurisdiction is the Customs Act, and-force d upon them by the House-in the Post and Telegraph Act. It was a jurisdiction, as at first proposed, only conferred until the High Court was created. Surely honourable members will remember that in several Bills-the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Bill, tlie Post and Telegraph Bill, and others-the Government proposed to give only temporary jurisdiction to the States Courts, and that the provision was that automatically on the establishment of the High Court the Federal jurisdiction conferred on the States Courts was to cease? The Government have not proposed to give the States Courts the f u l l jurisdiction. As a matter of fact, I believe that the States Courts have jurisdiction, in spite of them ; but bhey have shown a disinclination to absolutely confer the jurisdiction so that it should be beyond all doubt. If we confer this original jurisdiction on theHigh Court, and a question on a promissory nobe arises, bhe jurisdiction will be vesbed in bhe Circuib Courbs as well as bhe Sbabes Courbs. . I ask honourable members bo say how can rnabters of Insolvency and Bankrupbcy be determined by a Circuib Judge? It is not an 1 ordinary issue, to be determined at a single sitbing. Ib is nob a question of facb which goes before a jury. Bankruptcy proceedings extend over months. There are the adjudication, the firsb hearing, various examinations before receivers and accounbants, occasional references to the Bankruptcy Judges, and the final hearing. Generally tlie proceedings extend over many months, and require very elaborate machinery. How, then, can it be said bhab in a mabber of bhab sorb the Federal jurisdiction can be properly exercised by the Federal Circuit Court? It cannot be done unless you go to the High Court. The result will then be as has been indicateda complete centralization of jurisdiction. So far as the Bill is alleged to give more efficient decisions in Federal matters, or to expedite proceedings, or to secure economy, it is a perfect farce. It will be inefficient for the reasons I have mentioned j it must be more expensive, and as tlie. J udges cannot go on circuit more than, perhaps, once in six months without delaying the appellate jurisdiction, it will lead to considerable delay in the meting oub of justice. I should like bo refer the Attorney-General to a very recent authority. In the Annals of t/te American Academy o j Social and Political Science for March lasta volume which only came out by the last postI find a very excellent article by Professor Harrison Moore, who has already published a very fair work on our Constibubion. which I have read. honourable and learned gentleman had not an opportunity to read the article last week. If he had then thought it an admirable article he would have proved his conviction by not bringing in the Bill. Professor Harrison Moore points out, as we have endeavoured to do, that there is no immediate necessity to create the High Court; at all events to arm it with very exbensive jurisdiction.

483,Mr Glynn,"I am sorry that theLet us not be led too much by this excessive eulogy which has been given to the High Court, and imagine that the States Courts are not likely to be free from undue influence in coming to their decisions. We know that the Supreme Court of America, for ten years after Marshall's time, a democratic Government being in power, gave decisions that were purely democratic. I have not endeavoured to impugn the purity of the Federal Court, but whenever the States Courts are mentioned, we are immediately met with the statement that we cannot trust the interpretation of the Federal laws to them. When honourable members use. that class of argument, I ask them to prove the assertion tliat the Federal Court is likely to be purer than the States Courts in the administration of justice. When I go to authorities in America, I find that the Supreme Court there has not been so absolutely pure. Being a single court, and having a final voice, it did of course reconcile decisions. Whether the judgment was sound or unsound, it had to give the last word, and therefore it did lay down finally what was the interpretation of the law, but it was sometimes affected by the prevailing opinion of the party in power-in Marshall's time by Federal views, and for ten j'ears afterwards by purely democratic views. That is a class of argument which we have not used, but it has been used by tlie Government, and for that reason I refer to it . I hope that honourable members will excise the clause, and confine the original jurisdiction of the High Court to matters arising under Section 75 of the Constitution. By doing so they will justif}' a smaller Bench, expedite justice, render it cheaper, and, on the whole, secure the requisite Federal efficiency. that the Conimittee will not eliminate the clause except to the extent which the A t torney-General has indicated. I think we ought to consider also some of the concluding words. I do not know whether he really intended to include the question Of removals in his observations with regard to some later clauses. I think it is rather consequential on what he said. mittee to retain the power of removal for special cause-that is why I did not mention those-bu t to delete the power of removal as of right. learned gentleman does not mean that he is going to retain the concluding words with regard to removals-at all events, in their present form 1 tions to the substance of this clause, I think it is only right that it should be retained. Under the Constitution the High Court has original jurisdiction in all mattersArising under any treaty. Tliat is to say, no' matter between whom they may arise or under what circumstancesAffecting Consuls or other representatives of other countries. In which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued pn behalf of the Commonwealth is a party. No matter what the question is or under what law it arises-whethe r it arises under the Customs Act, or the Post and Telegraph Act, oithe Excise Act, or under the Constitution itself-if the Commonwealth or any person representing the Commonwealth sues an individual, the High Court will have original jurisdiction, and vice versa., if any individual sues the Commonwealth under any circumstances the High Court will have original jurisdiction. So that nearly all the cases with which we have been familiar in the past under Federal law will be within the original jurisdiction of the High Court, whether we give this additional .jurisdiction or not. Honourable members will not eliminate original jurisdiction if they strike out this clause. We shall require to have the opportunities for deciding these cases; we shall require to have the Judges in sufficient numberwhether it be three, four, or five-and with sufficient opportunities to decide I sincerely hope these cases, and all that these other clauses do, as far as I can see, is to give the same opportunity to private individuals as between themselves or between corporations and private individuals,'to go to the High Court to get decisions that an individual suing the Government, . or the Government suing an individual. would have. Therefore, I think it means very little difference, if any, so far as I can I propose to ask the Comsee as regards expense.

Whetheri t is a civil or a criminal matter, we cannot deprive the High Court of the jurisdiction, and we must furnish it with the means of deciding the cases. Supposing that we have the High Court; supposing that we have a Judge there with inalienable power to decide these cases as between the Commonwealth and the individual, we are not increasing the expense, so far as I can see, by one penny by saying that the same Judge, with the same opportunities before him, shall decide any similar question between two private individuals.

502,Mr Isaacs,"I must try to keepuntil we had decided the work that they would have to do. My honourable and learned friend now wants to draw me into a discussion upon clause 3, irrespective of that. I am prepared to discuss the question of the number of the Judges if we are in order in doing so. As to that, I agree with the Attorney-General, that to do the work set out by the Attorney-General himself, we cannot do with less than five Judges. We cannot do justice to the smaller States without that number. It seems to me that to say that there shall be three Judges sitting in one of the larger States, and that people shall be compelled to bring their appeals to that Court, will be wrong to the other States. To make the High Court a peripatetic Court of three Judges, wandering around without doing other work, is almost impossible to contemplate. When we come to the clause in question, I shall be prepared to deal with it , but I am talking of this question of jurisdiction ; and it seems to me that we do not sufficiently' recollect the new jurisdiction that already exists by virtue of tlie Constitution. It is not as though we were taking a class of cases-sa y cases arising under Pederal Acts of Parliament or under the Constitution-and giving them absolutely to the High Court for the first time; beeause, as I have pointed out, the vast number of these cases, perhaps the majority of them, will be within the grasp of the High Court whenever it is constituted. matters of summary jurisdiction-unde r section 75, sub-section (3) for instance. learned member mean cases in which the Commonwealth is a party? Surely that embraces all cases in which those conditions occur. of individuals. may be cases of great importance where, say, under the Customs Act, a person sues for a refund of customs duties paid. MrG LYNN -Many of them are matters concerning individuals. in one or two cases myself, and I know perfectly well their nature. MrL . E. GROOM There may also be cases for the recovery of duties paid under the Escise Act. the majority of them are otherwise. majority of such cases will be. I know that there are a number of important actions pending now, in which the High Court would have jurisdiction. Therefore, I say that by voting against this clause, honourable . members will be cutting away the rights of individuals in suits between themselves, whereas we cannot help giving the right we are in presence of a right which we cannot take away-in cases where an individual is a party on the one side or the other, and the Commonwealth is the opposite party. Then there are cases between States and the Commonwealth in which a writ of mandamus or injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. That is a matter in which the High Court will have jurisdiction in any event, and it is a class of case in which the Commonwealth ought to be represented as a Commonwealth. It seems to me that we shall be doing a wrong, and doing something anomalous unless we pass this clause. Without referring to the larger consideration to which the Attorney General alluded it seems to me that we should not be doing right if we did. not permit the High Court-the grand expositor of this Constitution in Federal matters-to have the opportunity of hearing cases if litigants choose to come to that tribunal and say"" We desire to have this matter determined by the High Court."" Thelitigants may be perfectly ready to abide by the judgment of one Judge of the High Court. They may not want to go any further. tent. my honourable friend is right. But both parties may be content, and may not want to go any further with the case. Persons are very often satisfied, and s a y "" I have had this case fairly fought out; I am satisfied to have had a judgment of a Judge of the High Court,"" and no appeal is taken. I think that the extra expense involved is infinitesimal. That is the view which I wish to put before the Committee.

511,Mr Isaacs,"Of course in one sensetit issue between the two parties in connection with this clause. He has really not only been assuming that it is desirable to give to the High Court what we cannot stop it from having, the original jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution ; but also to put that jurisdiction into active operation by providing courts and Judges to hear these suits, and thereby, so far as possible, taking the jurisdiction away from the States Courts, to whom we can give original jurisdiction at the present time. ing of the Bil l assume that ? MrM c CAY far as I am concerned. MrL . E. GKOOM -Does the honourable and learned member contemplate a court without original jurisdiction? MrM c CAY out a High Court for the present. The second reading of the Bill has affirmed the principle that there shall be a High Court, but this Committee has a perfectly free hand to decide what the character of that Court shall be, within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. WhatI say is, that if we are to have a High Court, let us limit it to the functions so magnificently described during the second-reading debate, when we were told that the Commonwealth Court was to be constituted to harmonize all the conflicting currents of judicial decision throughout Australia. We want only an appellate court to do that; and not a court of original jurisdiction, where the jurisdiction is exercised by individual Judges. To. say that we are giving the High Court original jurisdiction in these matters, is not correct. We cannot help the High Court from having that jurisdiction. But the Court may be so constituted that the original jurisdiction will not, as a matter of fact, be exercised by it , but primarily by the Supreme Courts of the States, if we give the jurisdiction to them have the opportunity of going to the High Court in tlie first instance if they choose. to go to the High Courti n 99 cases out of 100 unless it is as convenient to them as the Supreme Court of their State will be. That Court for all practical purposes is at the door of most litigants, and continually at their demand; and unless you make the High Court of Australia as available as the Supreme Court of a Statei t will not get the original jurisdiction. Suits involving original jurisdiction will not be brought before it . Every additional piece of jurisdiction you confer upon the High Court means a very considerable increase of expense to the Commonwealththat is, to the States and to their constituents. Unless you are going to say that the Judges of the High Court exercising original jurisdiction are to be such a superior class of persons as compared with the Supreme Court Judges of the States, that their deciI t did not assume it as sions will be accepted as final without appeal, there will be no new benefit offered to litigants going to the High Courti n the first instance. The Attorney-General is on the horns of a dilemma in this matter. wrong horn. MrM c CAY If he has five Judges of the Supreme Court he will not be able to provide enough Circuit Courts to make the attendance of the High Court Judges sufficiently frequent to enable them to compete-othe r things being equal-wit h the States Courts so far as the personal convenience of litigants is concerned. equal. The honourable and learned member is looking only to Victoria. wrong if he refers to the calibre of the Judges. number. MrM c CAY In South Australia they have only three Judges. population in either South Australia or Tasmania, and three Judges for the latter State form a larger proportion than do five or six Judges for Victoria. If we are to have sufficient Judges to make the visits of the High Court to the various portions of the Commonwealth sufficiently frequent to 'suit litigants, I am afraid that five Judges will not be enough, assuming, as the A t torney-General seems to assume, that all the business will flow to the High Court. If , on the other hand, there are not sufficient Judges to provide sufficiently frequent Circuit Courts, the business will not flow to the High Court.

I am influenced by the view I take of the Bill as a whole; and, although the second reading has been carried, we are still in a position to question the extent of the jurisdiction. Every additional piece of original jurisdiction is an additional excuse for increasing the expense, either with regard to the number of Judges or with regard to the frequency of the Circuit Courts, with, if I may be permitted to use a forbidden word, all their ""paraphernalia."" It is quite true, as the honourable and learned member .for In d i pointed out, that a very large number of the cases which occur are already within the original jurisdiction of the High Court under the Constitution. So far as one is able to judge, I should say that, at any rate, two-thirds of the cases up to the present-are within that original jurisdiction. cases have been dealt with by the States Courts, and I have not heard any excessive complaining about the decisions given. The point has been emphasized that a .State Court might decide one way, whilst another State Court decided another way. decisions; but it is not original jurisdiction, but appellate jurisdiction which is required to cure that difficulty, always assuming that appeals will go to the High Court and not to the Privy Council. For myself I do not think that appeals will go to the High Courti n preference to the Privy Council, but I am assuming they will, for the purpose of argument. If it be urged that, considering all the original jurisbe deprived of the right to commence an diction already conferred on the High Court, it will not matter much if we do confer a little more, that must be on the assumption that courts of sufficient frequency and suffiable to give security on appeal to the ciently widely distributed are to be provided in order to transact all the business instead of leaving it to the States Courts. The argument is that, with all this jurisdiction, more Judges are proper question ought to be-What is the least number of Judges with which we can do ? There is no need to provide for frequent Circuit Courts to enable the jurisdiction to be exercised, so long as we have States Courts able to exercise it, and so long as the financial circumstances of the States are as at present. We should be exercising a wise discretion if we did not confer extra jurisdiction, not so much from the point of view of the expense, as from the point of view of the excuse for expense that would be offered. We have heard a great deal about the mandatory character of the section in the Constitution as to the establishment of the High Court; but there is nothing mandatory as to the . constitution of the Court. It seems to me thatevery option the Constitution gives, is being exercised in connection with this .Bill, except the option of dehiying until a convenient time the establishment of the High Court. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -There is a saying to the effect that-""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."" It seems to me that the specially organized aud particular opponents of this Bill, who voted against its second reading, are determined to make the measure as inefficacious as possible. ' HonorThese able members from New South Wales would appear to know a tremendous lot about the working of such courts as that under discussion, but I venture to wager £ 5 0 that no man here has been in a Federal Court, or had a law suit there, except myself. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, described the American Supreme Court as poisoned by political influences before its construction. But we ought to remember that Lord Salisbury, the late Prime Minister of England, said that if there was one thing he envied America, it was her Supreme Court; and I heard Lord Rosebery, one of the ablest men to-day in England, express similar sentiments in Pittsburg years ago. Why should I or any other citizen of the Commonwealth action in a Federal Court? Isi t because my legal friends wish me to run up such a bill in a State Court that I shall not be H i g h Court? Why should litigants, say, on the West Coast of Tasmania, be deprived of the right to have their cases heard in the Federal Circuit Courti n preference to the wanted. The Supreme Court of that State? In the case of SarahH ill against Shan-on, heard in the Supreme Court, California, the plaintiff was successful in having herself declared the wife of the defendant, and on that decision would have participated in the division of over five millions of money. Mr Justice Field, of the United States Supreme Court, came to Sacramento and upset",69,Mclean Then Proceedings

522,Mr Mccay,"There have been differingthat decision. counsel for plaintiff; appeal to Washington ? No ; he at once surrendered on the ground that as the question had been decided by one of the United States Judges, it was not worthwhile appealing. one Judge or three Judges? Mr O'MALLEY -The court consisted of one Judge from Washington. Then honourable members may remember the case of the United States marshal who shot Terry, because the latter threatened to shoot the Judge. Legal members, with very few exceptions, know nothing about Federal judicial power. In the United States, in case of doubt, the Supreme Court always overrides the State Court. The whole must be greater than the part, and the State is only a part; but the great misfortune is that the majority of Victorian representatives still believe that Victoria runs the Commonwealth, and do not seem able to reason beyond the bounds of that State. In Western America we had land cases, horse-stealing eases, murder cases, and constitutional cases tried in these Circuit Courts, and I have never known a case which was presided over by a Judge from Washington appealed' against. My contention has been that Federal jurisdiction ought to be given to the States Supreme Courts, and that three Judges are all that is necessary for the High Court; but, if in the judgment of the Committee five High Court Judges are necessary, I am not going to stand in the way of their appointment. I u the United States, if a citizen of Arkansas has a law suit with a citizen of Texas, he takes it into the Federal Circuit Court. Why? Because he knows 'that when he gets a decision it will, be to the satisfaction of both parties. But some honourable members want the democrats of Australia to fight their cases through every State Court before bringing them to the High Court. Many a man, however, would be too poor to be able to put up the requisite security for an appeal to the High Court, although he could get an attorney to appear for him if he could go to the Court direct, and it would be a denial of a fundamental right of democracy to prevent him from doing so. Surely, every one of the J udges whom the Ministry appoint will have tlie confidence of the people? The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, Did Mr Terry, the spoke of men being biased, but. do honourable members remember the Dred Scott case in America1 A t that time the people of the States were almost in arms, and there was immense excitement. Charles Sumner, Wendall Phillips, and others declared in the grand old Fanuel Hall in Boston, where hang the pictures of Washington, Hancock, and Otis, that they would never surrender a fugitive slave, but Chief Justice Taney, of, the Supreme Court, decided that they must send the niggers bock from Massachusetts. Was that an instance of yielding to popular clamour? And the same firmness has been shown in many other instances. Such a case occurred only the other day. The Goulds, the Rockfellers, the Vanderbilts, and the Pierpont Morgans-peopl e who could buy up Australia, and yet have enough afterwards to be rich-forme d a syndicate called the Northern Securities Company, but when the legality of such a trust was questioned before Judge Thayer, he upset the whole business, though the States Courts were afraid to tackle the case. All the newspapers in the States, with the exception of Randolph Hearst's, are in their hands, yet this Judge gave a decision in a case involving billions against the monopolists and in favour of the people. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa is trying to upset an institution which will be the climax of the Federation. We must have the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judiciary to complete the Commonwealth power. The present Chief Justice Fuller gave up a practice of £30,000 to accept his present position at £2,100. All the Judges of the United States Courts are men who were successful practitioners for at least 25 years. Perhaps some of our friends here think that they are men who could be bought for a £5-note. There is the feeling in some countries that if you are an American you can be bought. Only the other day a big business man told me that President Roosevelt could be bought for a few thousand pounds, and yet I suppose the President could buy and sell any five men in Victoria, and have money enough left to throw at the birds. I hope that honourable members will awake from their parochialism and their narrow provincialism, and stand up for a High Court Which will be a credit to the whole Commonwealth.
