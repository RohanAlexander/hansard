Petition received. Health a question. Does he recall the assurance he gave me in a letter on 9th May that 'should any instances occur in the future where publicity directed to purely political objectives is undertaken or financed by any registered medical or hospital benefit priate action is taken'? I now ask him whether his attention has been drawn to reports that the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia and other health insurance organisations registered with his Department intend to participate actively in the coming House of Representatives election and to appropriate contributors' funds for this purpose. Will he reiterate his undertaking to take action against political activities by these organisations to which people of all political views must at present contribute if they are to receive assistance from the Commonwealth in meeting their health costs? Dr FORBESI did give the honourable member the assurance that he sought, and I took an earlier opportunity at the last meeting of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Council to reiterate and explain the views that the Government and I hold today has not been brought to my attention. If it is, I will look at it. I think the House should take into account that the executives and boards of the health insurance funds are composed of a lot of honourable men who perform selfless work, many in an honorary capacity. They have been subjected to a tirade of abuse and misrepresentation by the honourable gentleman and bis colleagues in the Labor Party over a long period of time simply to serve the political purposes of honourable members opposite.

Can the Minister advise how this statement came to be made? Was it founded on fact? Was this claim repeated on 24th July in an article published report is also completely unfounded. in 'Broadside'? Will the Minister advise the House and the country of the truth of these statements? to comment on this matter. It is certainly disaffected. Undoubtedly the two instances true that some currency was given to reports of unfounded rumours to which I have rethat troops of Southern Command were on ferred are but part of this attack and it is stand-by to prepare for and to control well that the House should be aware of the demonstrations which had been planned to situation. be held against the Vietnam war on 4th July 1969. I take this opportunity to assure the House that the reports were completely unfounded. I understand that they were the Minister for Health. Did he say on 3rd generated as a result of a planned proAugust that the Australian Labor Party's gramme of political propaganda directed at alternative national health programme 'is the Army through the Melbourne news completely dependent on the co-operation media by left wing dissident groups which of the medical profession in using a fixed were involved in the demonstrations.

Did the Nimmo Cominformation of the disposition of troops in Southern Command was given to most of mittee conclude that the element of certhe Melbourne news media but when this tainty as to costs to be met by insurance is information was referred to Headquarters, vital to any system of health insurance? Is Southern Command, it was immediately it not then a fact that the present system denied by that Headquarters.

A denial of the claim was later carried by most Melbourne news media. I express concern that a national television network should release material of this kind without endeavouring to authenticate it with responsible authorities.

The Nimmo Committee did put forward a proposal related to a most common fee which is a very different matter from imposing a fixed schedule of fees on the medical profession which, as I understand it, is what is contained in the proposal of the Australian Labor Party. But the Australian Labor Party's proposal goes further than that. It is not only utterly dependent on doctors agreeing to a fixed schedule of fees, negotiated somehow or otherI would imagine, imposed on thembut also utterly dependent for its workability on doctors being prepared to send their bills direct to the health insurance funds and to accept 85% of the schedule of fees, which they probably have had imposed on them anyway. The only point that I make in answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that the Nimmo Committee's recommendations and the Australian Labor Party's proposal are utterly different. MR MAXWELL NEWTON Mr ST. JOHN-My question is directed evidence of an offence, but in fact set out to the Attorney-General. It relates to the that the Justice of the Peace had been search ordered by Cabinet and conducted informed by an officer of the police force by Commonwealth Police, acting under that there were reasonable grounds for suswhat we now know to be invalid warrants, pecting that an offence had been committed. of the premises owned and occupied by Mr and Mrs Maxwell Newton on 23rd May of this year. Is it a fact, as has been aUeged, that the warrant was general in its terms and that some of the documents seized and some did not specify that the search should be for of the information obtained by the Comdocuments relating to a specified offence, monwealth Police had no relation to the for instance the offence of the disclosure possible commission of any offence of the of the Paris cable about which evidence kind described in the warrants? Have any of had been given before the Justice of the those documents or has any of that informaPeace. This was the main objection on tion been conveyed to the Prime Minister or which the warrants were held invalid, but any other Minister? Finally, I ask the I should point out that the authorities show Attorney-General: Wbat does tbe Governthat even if the warrants had been so rement propose to do to make amends to stricted, had the search disclosed documents Mr and Mrs Newton for the unlawful in which might have revealed other offences the vasion of the privacy of their home and the officers would have been permitted to take illegal seizure of their private papers? of warrants, I think perhaps I should point Therefore I think it is quite premature to out that no form of warrant is prescribed be asking me what amends should be made. under section 10 of the Crimes Act. That No doubt the law provides adequate section, under which warrants are issued, remedies if anyone has been injured and I is perfectly general in its terms. The pardo not think I should be asked to answer ticular form used is one which has been questions along these lines. in use since 1943 when Dr Evatt was Attorney-General. It is true that Mr Justice Fox has held that the form of the warrants was bad. Now, we are considering at the moment whether we should seek a further clarification of the law on this subject in a higher place. But, accepting for the moment the decision of His Honour, I think that I should put some things into perspective. There is no question, on His Honour's findings, that the evidence which the police took to the Justice of the Peace to ask for a warrant was sufficient to entitle them to a search warrant. There is no question that they could have got a warrant in the proper form. If they had, what they in fact did might have been done under a warrant in proper form. Nevertheless, the warrant issued was incorrect in two respects according to Mr Justice Fox; , firstly because it did not contain a correct recital of the fact that the Justice of the Peace was satisfied by the evidence that he had heard that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting there was in any house or place anything as to which there were reasonable grounds for believing that it would afford But, more importantly, His Honour held those other documents. There would therefore have been that degree of correspon-",16,Health

I ask the honourable gentleman whether he recalls the Nimmo Committee reporting that: For many years 'fee schedules' have been probeen made possible because space which vided by the medical profession in Canada and have been adhered to by almost all doctors in their charges to patients . . . we know of no valid reason why the medical profession here should refuse to follow the example of their opposite numbers in Canada, with the same beneficial results. Has the President of the New South Wales Branch of the AustraUan Medical Association attributed the Association's rejection of the fee schedule to the Minister's own administration of the pensioner medical service? Can the Minister give any other valid reason for the Australian Medical Association's rejection of a fee schedule? Dr FORBESI answered the question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as he asked it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition attempted to suggest that the Nimmo Committee proposed a schedule of fees. It is, of course, the policy of the Australian Labor Party to impose a schedule of fees on the medical profession. I said that the Committee did not propose a schedule of fees but a system based on a most common fee approach, which is a very different matter and is regarded as such by the medical profession. That was a factual answer. If the honourable gentleman wants to know the attitude of the Australian Medical Association to these things and its reason for having that attitude I suggest he ask the Australian Medical Association.

The time for delivery of first class mail from the post box to the soldier is between 3 and 6 days, depending on where the mail is posted. This mail, of course, is carried free of charge. There has been no change in the carriage of second class mail, which is carried by RAAF courier or charter aircraft at parcel post rates. Thc delivery time from post box to soldier is about 14 days.

Is it his responsibility to see that the amounts approMinister now inform the House when this priated for operating expenses by registered health benefit organisations do not exceed a prescribed percentage of their contribution income? Has his Department restrained certain of the more economically efficient organisations from increasing benefits out of proportion to those offered by smaller and less efficient organisations? What action has his Department taken or initiated to remedy these anomalies? Dr FORBES1 am aware of those comments and recommendations, as well as the other recommendations of the Nimmo Committee. They are under review by the Government at the present time. The Government has not yet made a final decision on them, but they are being, examined. In view of the statement he made, I remind the honourable gentleman that the Nimmo Committee pointed out that on the whole and for various reasons it was not the large funds which were the most economic but the small ones, particularly the small closed funds. The suggestion which is being assiduously fed out by the Australian Labor Party that there would be economies of operation if all health insurance contributors were pushed into one great monolithic fund member rephrases his question he will be in order. ter has reaffirmed the determination of the Government to establish such a corporation?

I have no knowledge whatsoever of Jindivik aircraft being manufactured in England. Australia has sold a number of Jindivik aircraft in Europe, both to Sweden and the United Kingdom. One would assume that repairs are made in England to aircraft flown by the United Kingdom Government.

What will be necessary, of course, is that if-and this is a big 'if-ther e is to be on the part of the United States a specific, definite and drawn out plan for withdrawal, then Australian troops would need to be phased into that plan. That is all I have to say to the honourable member at the moment. the Prime Minister. Has any invitation been extended to or any arrangement made for the successful astronauts-Armstrong , Aldrin and Collins-to visit this country at a later date? If so, will an opportunity be given to them, should they require to take it, to visit the radio telescope at Parkes, an instrument which played such a critical part in telecommunications in this completely outstanding event? but I cannot be quite sure and definite while talking to the House at this stage-that it is quite likely that the astronauts will be visitsimilar to that in force in the United ing Australia. What they would see when they came to Australia would, I have no doubt, cover those installations, such as the Parkes telescope and other tracking installations, which would have been connected with this great adventure of man going to the moon. But that is contingent upon my being accurate in my recollection that this visit may take place. Treasurer. Is the decision by the Reserve Bank to reduce liquidity and to increase interest rates an all embracing decision? In other words, does it apply to every sector of the economy? If it does, will the Treasurer exempt from these recent restrictive moves by the Reserve Bank the whole segement of primary industry, which is already heavily mortgaged, which is quite unable to meet further high interest rates for its carry-on finance and which faces lower incomes from overseas sales in the next 12 months? this matter in the Budget speech tonight, but I think I could tell the honourable gentleman that it would be extremely difficult to exclude particular sections of the economy from Reserve Bank decisions. Minister for Civil Aviation been drawn to strong criticisms that have been levelled by the Executive Secretary of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents against alleged non-competitive activities and the overrationalisation of services provided by Australia's two major domestic airlines? By way of support, I remind the Minister that on two recent occasions I have witnessed overbooking of seats by Trans-Australia Airlines in Sydney, to the great inconvenience of certain people. This inconvenience is aggravated by the parallel scheduling by both major airlines out of Sydney airport. In view of the many criticisms that are being expressed about this parallel scheduling and the overbooking of flights, has the Minister considered instituting a system wherein the over-booking of airline seats by Australian airlines will be subject to a type of penalty States of America, where heavy fines are imposed upon domestic airlines which are guilty of over-booking of seats? to which the honourable gentleman refers, but in relation to the comment about our two airline system which applies to the major trunk routes in Australia. I point out that it is rather unusual to have major criticism of the services which are provided, because constantly I receive requests from other countries for information regarding the system which we operate in Australia. In fact, on several occasions I have had requests for people to visit Australia in order to study our system with a view to trying to implement it in their own country because they feel that it would be an improvement. But having said that, of course, it is realised that no system can be perfect, and no doubt there are some faults associated with the present system.

The question of over-bookings has not been drawn definitely to my attention, except on casual occasions in correspondence, but I will certainly arrange for some investigation to be made. I may say that our system of bookings in Australia is in keeping with the best standards in the world. Most of this work now has been changed over to computers. Possibly some problems are arising in the changeover.

This has been so for a very long time, the theory being that there is the interposition of someone who is independent of the police or any authority seeking the warrant.

A report on this same matter did not appear in the early editions of the 'Sunday Telegraph' of the same date, but it appeared in the late editions of that publication, ln the week following these publications I commenced legal action in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against John Fairfax and Sons Ltd, publishers of the 'Sun-Herald'. I also commenced action against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd, publishers of the 'Sunday Telegraph'. In the first trial against both the 'Sunday Teleber for Barton. The speech of the honourgraph' and the 'Sun-Herald' I received substantial verdicts on all counts. In fact, I received a verdict in my favour on all counts in all three jury trials, with the exception of one count against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. On that count a new trial was ordered, but it did not eventuate. A settlement was made out of court with John Fairfax and Sons Ltd several years ago. A public apology had earlier been published on the front page of the 'Sun-Herald'. Australian Consolidated Press Ltd apologised in the 'Sunday Telegraph* on 20th July 1969. The case against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd had a long journey through the courts. First of all, the case was heard before a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in reference to the declaration. An appeal was then heard before the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, following which the matter came before a jury of twelve in a trial which lasted for 13 days. An appeal against the verdict in this trial again went before the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. A further appeal was heard before the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia and then before the Privy Council in London. A second trial was granted and it lasted for 7 days. A further appeal was then made to the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the hearing lasted for a week. On one count the Supreme Court of New South Wales awarded a third trial, a jury trial, which did not eventuate. The matter has now been settled out of court with Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. This has been the first opportunity for me to raise this matter in the House. For the past 64 years it has been sub judice. The inspiration for the libel which was published arose from a speech made in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of this House on 29th November 1962 by the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin). At that time he was a member of the Government's back bench. There were interesting aspects of the honourable member's contribution. Firstly, he read from a prepared speech, which at that time was contrary to the Standing Orders of the House. A point of order was raised by Mr Reynolds who was then honourable memable member for Ballaarat lasted for only 5 minutes, notwithstanding that he was entitled to speak for 10 minutes. His charges were that I was inspired by Mr Ivan Skripov, a first secretary of the Soviet Embassy. The honourable member's speech is recorded at page 2820 of Hansard of 29th November 1962. In part he said: . . . I ask why certain members of the staff of the Russian Embassy, particularly one Mr Ivan Skripov, a first secretary of the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has been a regular visitor to this House and has been cultivating the friendship of certain members of the Australian Labor Party, in particular fhe honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) The honourable member also referred to two other honourable members and continued: Have these members been inspired by this Soviet diplomat to ask questions on a number of sensitive foreign policy issues, and have they been briefed for foreign policy debates. The honourable member also said: . . . the visit to this House yesterday by Mr Skripov. . . and having in mind also the sinister remarks in the debate last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, by the honourable members for Parkes and Reid concerning the proposed American base on the north-west coast of Australia, I suggest that we again have evidence that these honourable members are being directly inspired by Soviet Embassy officials. I rose to speak in the debate-it was a Thursday evening-bu t as I had spoken the night before on the motion to adjourn the HouseI was unable to get the call. At the conclusion of the following week the House adjourned for the Christmas recess. For some weeks prior to the termination of the sittings the House had been sitting, with the exception of Tuesday evening, into the early",22,Taxation

The newspaper article of 16th July Costa) was gagged when he sought to speak on the motion to adjourn the House. The sitting of Thursday, 6th December continued until later than 3 a.m. on Friday, 7th December. The only honourable members to participate in the valedictory were Sir Robert Menzies, who was Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr made on the adjournment by the honourWhitlam) and that old warrior Mr E. J. Ward-the only back bench member to speak. We all know his attitude towards valedictory speeches. At this time articles had already appeared in the Brisbane Telegraph* and the 'Daily Mirror' debunking the speech of the honourable member for Ballaarat and condemning McCarthyism. I regret that at the time. I did not use the forms of the House to make a personal explanation and to dissociate myself from the statements made by the honourable member for Ballaarat. I will not allow sucb an incident to occur again without employing the forms of the House to answer the statements made. On 7th February 1963, before the Parliathe remainder of the newspaper article as ment reassembled, Skripov was pronounced the theme for his prepared speech on 29th persona non grata. Three days later the November or Mr Bennetts wrote the speech libellous article appeared in the 'Sunfor the honourable member for Ballaarat so Herald' and the 'Sunday Telegraph'.

I was inspired-or , should I say, on 29th November 1962. In fact, some paragraphs of the article and the speech are and the honourable member's speech of 29th November had a similar style. It appeared as though Mr Bennett's had written both items. It differed in that the newspaper article of 16th July 1962 mentioned only 'a number of back-bench members of Federal Parliament*. The speech able member for Ballaarat mentioned two honourable members as well as naming myself. Mr Bennetts was so prompt in having the names of all three honourable members published in the newspaper he represented that his paper, excluding one other, was the only morning newspaper on 30th November, outside of Canberra, that ran this smear article. Mr Bennetts published this smear under the protection of claiming that he was reporting what was happening in Parliament. I have come to the conclusion that two things may have happened: Either the 'diligent, efficient honourable member for Ballaarat' copied word for word some of Mr Bennett's newspaper article and utilised In regard to the allegations made by the prompted-to ask my first question on the proposed North West Cape base of the then Minister for Defence, Mr Athol Townley, on 16th March 1961 by what I read in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 28th February 1961. This is mteresting. It is a little dumbfounding for the 'Sydney Morning Herald' that I sued the Fairfax organisation while my source of information on this matter was the 'Sydney Morning Herald*. The House went into recess. During that recess, I saw another newspaper article on this subject. Again, it was in the 'Sydney Morning Herald'. When Parliament resumed, I asked a second question on this subject of Mr Townley on 15th August 1961. Again, my source of information was the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 21st July 1961.

Ministerial Statement External Speaker, this statement is concerned with the recent incidents near Kieta, Bougainville, in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, in connection with the provision of land for the Bougainville copper project. On 31st July a lease was issued to Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd under the Territory Mining Ordinance over 175 acres of land at Rorovana. On 1st August, surveyors commenced marking the boundary of this land. In view of reports that there might be violence 100 police were sent to the area in three groups. A group of approximately 20 women crowded around police guarding a concrete survey peg. The police did not use force and eventually the peg was removed and carried away by the women. Clearing and marking of the area continued on 2nd and 4th August without interference. On 5th August a bulldozer clearing scrub for the survey team was confronted by a group of approximately 65 men and women. There were approximately 70 police present. The officer in charge warned the people to disperse on at least two occasions. He then ordered a group of 15 police carrying shields and batons to move in front of the bulldozer and attempt to push the crowd away with their shields. There was a general melee and at this point the officer in charge Administrator's proposals for further direct decided to attempt to disperse the crowd with tear gas. The tear gas used is nontoxic. It was only partially effective. After Ordinance or by compulsory acquisition further warnings police were ordered to use their batons about the legs of the natives and after a very short time the crowd dispersed. There were no injuries other than one man who appeared to have grazed his leg falling over a log. No-one was injured by the police. Minimum force was used. The members of the Papua and New Guinea constabulary acquitted themselves with distinction in these incidents, behaving with the greatest restraint and discipline. Their actions were at all times fully in accordance with the fine traditions of this force. These are the facts of the incidents. I turn now to the situation behind them. For many years there has been some knowledge of the mineral wealth at Bougainville Island but it was not until 1960 that an Administration geologist reported the possibility of a major low-grade copper deposit. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd began prospecting the area in 1964. In 1967 Territories)-by leaveMr after more than 12 months of negotiation an agreement was signed between the company and the Administration. This agreement was tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament. It was debated in the Territory House of Assembly and a ratifying Ordinance was passed by the House. The House consisted of 54 elected and 10 official members. The House also amended the Territory mining legislation so as to provide that 5% of all royalties for minerals should be paid to the owners of the land from which the minerals were taken. This was accepted by the Government. In June of this year the Territory House of Assembly (now consisting of 84 elected and 10 official members) debated a comprehensive White Paper on the Bougainville project and again endorsed it. The motion passed by the House on this occasion described the project as 'a major and essential development in the economic future of the Territory'. In relation to the situation at Rorovana as well as at Arawa, the Administrator consulted the Administrator's Executive Council, which has a majority of elected members of the House of Assembly. The Council gave unanimous support to the consultation with the people, to be followed if unsuccessful by leasing under the Mining under the Lands Ordinance, and endorsed the employment of police if necessary to ensure protection of those going about thenlawful business in the area. The Council",25,Newspaper Reports
54,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson,"Minister foralso expressed an earnest wish that the Rorovana and Arawa villagers would sell their land to the Administration. The Bougainville copper project offers gigantic benefits to the Territory as a whole. These benefits will include jobs for 2,500 New Guineans within the next 5 years, a township of 10,000 people, a $2m training programme for indigenous people during the period to 1973, revenue to the Administration of between $200m and $300m in the first 10 years of operation, and export income in excess of SlOOm per annum. In addition, the Administration, on behalf of the people of the Territory, has the option of a 20% equity interest in the project. CRA has indicated that it may also provide opportunities for individual equity participation by the people of Bougainville. The project therefore offers a tremendous opportunity for the Territory to lift itself up however, proposed that the town be sited on out of the field of competition of low priced tropical products in international trade, and to make a giant stride towards economic self-reliance. In view of its importance to the Territory and in view of the nature of the problems involved, the Government and the Administration approached this whole question with great and careful consideration of the problems extending over many months. Advice regarding particular aspects of the attitude of the local people from expert anthropologists and psychologists has been carefully examined and the whole matter has been the subject of the most careful study. Certain difficulties were experienced in 1966 and 1967 in the actual area of mining operations at Panguna, where the open pit mine, the concentrate plant, the mine town and a location for stacking waste rock will be sited. The 10,000 acres of this land is covered by a special mining lease. The people of Guava, Moroni and in the interests of the Territory. The TerriDapera who occupy or own land in this tory gets more out of the copper project lease were originally antagonistic to the than the company, does. The project will project as are the coastal people of Roronot be on full stream until about 1980. vana and Arawa now. The problems were When that happens, however, the following handled patiently and sympathetically. points apply: These inland people are now reconciled to the mining operation. They are receiving full compensation for loss of housing and gardens and there will also be annual cash payments for the loss of use of land and for royalties. In summary there are about 1,000 men, women and children involved and when the mine is fully in operation cash payments are expected to total approximately $100,000 per year. Not all the compensation for loss of houses and gardens, et cetera, has yet been determined by the mining warden but some fifty people in the village of Moroni have been awarded cash and kind compensation valued at approximately $40,000. Other leases required for roads, disposal of tailings, sources of aggregate and limestone et cetera may total up to 40,000 acres. Much of this area will be swamp. It is not expected that village dwellings will be involved. The incidents on 1st and 5th August that I have referred to above relate only to requirements for the port. The company had, the coast in an area of some 2,000 acres south of the site proposed for the port. This location would have deprived some 650 villagers of their houses, gardens and economic crops. To avoid this the Administration decided to locate the town at Arawa plantation of 998 acres and to supplement this area with some 640 acres of adjacent sparsely planted village land which contained no village houses. The arrangements for land for the port and for the town that were decided upon were chosen so as to cause the least disturbance to the minimum number of native people. The land is uninhabited. No homes are lost. No villages are displaced. The people have other land. Full compensation will be paid. If need be, however, the Administration will also make other land available. In providing land for the port or for the town associated with the copper project the Administration is acting first and foremost (a) 50% of the taxable income goes to the Territory Treasury; (b) royalties are payable to the Territory Treasury in accordance with tbe Mining Ordinance scale; (c) if the Administration's option on 20% of the equity is taken up then one-fifth of the dividends paid or profits accumulated but not distriselves visited the District Headquarters at buted will accrue to the Territory. Quite apart from these financial considerations and the indirect tax benefits flowing from the huge payroll that will be financed by the project there are the jobs, training and development benefits I have already referred to. The people of Bougainville have known for years that the project would require substantial areas of land but until the detailed investigations were completed it was not possible to specify the particular areas. In March of this year the company applied for its special mining lease. port area. The Rorovana people number This brought into operation major aspects of the Agreement, including the obligation by the Administration to provide land. For over 3 years the Administration has used all poseconomic livelihood. They have been offered sible means to explain to the people of Bougainville the nature and implications of the mining project. The construction of Radio Kieta was expedited in 1967 to facilitate communications with the native people. Since mid-1966 over forty Administration patrols have been made in the area affected by the mining project. A primary objective of these patrols has been to explain to the people the nature of the project and how it would affect them. In addition, individual officers have spent in the aggregate hundreds of days visiting villages and individual families for this same purpose. The Administrator himself visited Bougainville earlier this year and spoke to the people and talked over Radio Bougainville. Last month an Assistant Administrator led a special mission to the Island and held meetings in the villages most affected. This mission included indigenous ministerial members of the House of Assembly and all three Bougainville members of the House. Radio and news sheets have been used extensively and the elected members for Bougainville have been given every opportunity and encouragement to inform themselves and their people of the project and the consideration it had been given by the House of Assembly. As an example of the detailed and painstaking effort on the part of the Administration and CRA which the Commonwealth tion to achieve communication with the local people I refer to the fact that the Assistant District Commissioner of the area visited Rorovana four times in the past 4 months and the people of Rorovana themKieta 12 times in the past 5 months for discussions. There have also been frequent discussions with the Councillors of the Rorovana Council and the Council President. It appears that the opposition of the Rorovana people to the sale of their land to the Administration is not related to lack of information nor, indeed, to the amount of compensation offered to them. Some 175 acres of Rorovana land is required for the some 450 and they have total land of approximately 1,600 acres. The loss of this 175 acres will not seriously affect their a good price and alternative productive land. There has never been any real indication that they would sell at any price. On the other hand, not all the native people are opposed. At the village of Lonsiro only a few miles from Rorovana, one native landholding family concluded arrangements with the Administration under which they were paid $5,600 for a 42-year lease of 49 acres of land. The Administration's position in relation to negotiations for land for such public purposes as ports, town sites, airfields and so on has to take account of the need for these public facilities throughout the Territory. The proposed port for which the Rorovana land is required will be for public and not just for company use. The legal authority for compulsory acquisition or lease of land exists in the Territory as in other countries to avoid the need for excessive payments out of the public purse, that is, to serve the interests of the public as a whole. Compulsory acquisition is an essential power in all communities. It is used in Australia more freely than in the Territory. Individuals or small groups are not allowed to hold the whole community up. In the Territory as here the amount of compensation is in the last resort subject to law. The Agreement between the AdministraGovernment is backing is modern in its approach and enlightened in its ideas. There will be adequate return to the Territory Government in terms of taxes, royalties and dividends from the profits of the operation. There are those who would accept the merits of the Bougainville Copper Agreement but who would criticise the way in which the Government or the Administration had handled the matter. This is easily done. Nevertheless it ignores the tremendous difficulties of communication and of comprehension which have confronted the Administration in this matter. I have explained the painstaking nature of the Administration communication activity. There has been no effort spared. The basic difficulty has been that people of this area are living in one world and the problems of development and the requirements of development confront them with another world. In the absence of skill and patience and moderation on the part of the Administration, especially its field officers, we could easily have had a much worse situation than that which confronts us. As it is we cannot expect easy solutions. We must understand that what happened at Rorovana and what may happen elsewhere reflect the problems of transition into a modern world and a modern society. These cannot be sidestepped by an Administration that must act in the interests of the Territory as a whole. The Government, however, is grateful to the officers of the Administration for the extent to which their efforts have so far contained the problem. The Government makes no apology for tbe Agreement. It considers that the Agreement is a spectacular contribution to harnessing the interests of private capital and the skills of the large corporation to the development requirements of the Territory. Not many developing countries are fortunate enough to have the prospect of so large and so remunerative a development within their boundaries. In this, confidence plays a major part. The investment of $300m demands confidence. In this case the investors are showing their confidence not only in the Commonwealth Government but in the people of the Territory themselves because the mining project looks ahead to the time when the people will be running their own affairs. In this respect the projected investment is an act of imagination and confidence. There are many who seek to knock it but it has the backing of the Territory people through their House of Assembly. It will survive. The Government considers the Administration's actions are fully in accordance with the law. Action has been taken in Papua and New Guinea to test the law. The Government will welcome an authoritative and definitive judicial interpretation of the legal position. Since 1964, the Government has made available to the Territory by way of grant in aid sums totalling $400m. The Government and the House of Assembly have last year jointly backed a 5-year $ 1,000m development programme for the Territory. The Bougainville project offers a unique opportunity for the Territory to make a dramatic advance towards these objectives of development. The attitude of a handful of people may attract our sympathy, and we may go to considerable lengths to resolve their problems. But in the last resort we cannot allow them to block this great prospect and. thus throw into doubt the policies on which the futures of more than 2 million people depend. In the structure of ignorance, superstition and prejudice, persuasion and explanations are not easy but with other expatriate influences working in the opposite direction-som e not without prestige in native eyes-difficultie s become great. The present choice before the people of this Territory is whether to drift in a primitive and backward situation in close dependency on the generosity of the Australian taxpayer to provide a modicum towards health, education and the preservation of law and order and burdened by their ancient customs or whether to advance as a modern state financed substantially by its own resources. These resources lie dormant and will continue that way under traditional attitudes. Developed they will provide the revenues for the hospitals, the schools, the better standard of life and most important a nation not only able to stand on its own feet economically but able to opt for a meaningful independence should this be desired. This progressive transition has been the way chosen by the people of the Territory; its achievement needs sympathy and understanding from us in Australia as well as our continuing support. to move that the paper be noted?

NEW GUINEA-SELF-GOVERNMEN T House that I have received from the Speaker of the House of Assembly of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea a letter forwarding the text of a resolution agreed to by that House on 14th May 1969. The resolution is as follows: (1) This House has noted the Resolution passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 18th December, 1968 that the Assembly: 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Papua and New Guinea to self-determination and . independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). 2. Regrets the fact that the Administering power has not yet fully implemented the provisions of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions relating to Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea. 3. CaUs upon the administering power to implement fully resolution 1514 (XV) and, to this end, to take the following measures in particular: (A) Fix an early date for self-determination and independence in accordance expressed wishes of the people of fhe Territories. 03) Hold free elections under United Nations supervision on the basis of universal adult suffrage in order to transfer effective power to the Tepresentatives of the people of the Territories. 4. Requests the administering power to report to the trusteeship council and the special committee on the situation with regard to the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples on the action taken in this regard. 5. Requests the trusteeship council and the special committee to continue lo examine this question and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth session, and also the more reaUstic Resolution sponsored by Liberia that the Assembly: 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the trusteeship agreement of 13th December, 1946. 2. Takes note of the report of the trusteeship councU and recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations visiting mission to the Trust Territory of New Guinea (1968). 3. CaUs upon the administering power to take steps to transfer effective powers in the executive and legislative branches of Government to the elected representatives of the people. 4. Requests the administering power to accelerate the indtgenisation of the PubUc Service and to give local personnel greater administrative responsibility in the Governmental structure. 5. Decides that the United Nations should render all help to the people of Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea in their efforts freely to decide their own future. (2) This House wishes to make it clear to the United Nations and interested panics that the elected members of this House are already elected in free elections on Ihe basis of universal suffrage and that the Resolution passed by the General Assembly is thus already out-of-date and repeats and reaffirms the terms of the Resolution passed by this House on 2nd September, 1964: That we the elected representatives of the people of Papua and New Guinea desire to convey to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Trusteeship CouncU and the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation, the expressed wish of the people that they, tbe people, and they alone, be aUowed with the freely to decide when the time is ripe for self-government in Papua and New Guinea, and the form that such government wUl take and the people's further firm conviction that tbe road to self-government can best be travelled with one guide-and that guide the Administering Authority, and that undue pressure from without can lead only to that disruption, chaos and bloodshed which the people have observed with great alarm in certain newly independent countries.

Discussion of Matter of Public Importance from the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely. The urgent need, in view of the deterioration in relations between the Australian Administration and the people of .the Territory of Papua and New Guinea arising out of rhe methods used to resume land on Bougainville Island and to enforce that resumption, to appoint a Joint Select Committee of the Australian ParUament to inquire into and report upon the most appropriate system of tenure, registration, leasing and resumption of land on a harmonious plane with the eventual in the Territory. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) Suspension of Standing Orders agreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the discussion on the matter of public importance being interrupted and resumed at a later hour this day. Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition, the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the people of Australia, I have the grave responsibility of proposing that the following matter of vital public importance be discussed: The urgent need, in view of the deterioration in relations between the Australian Administration and the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea arising out of the methods used to resume land on BougainviUe Island and to enforce that resumption, to appoint a Joint Select CommiUee of the Australian Parliament to inquire into and report upon the most appropriate system of tenure, registration, leasing and resumption of land in the Territory. The Opposition is compelled to take this action in an earnest endeavour to save the reputation of Australia in the eyes of the world, but more particularly, in the hearts and minds of the 2t million indigenous people of the Territory of. Papua and New Guinea. The happenings on Bougainville Island in the past few weeks are the cause of our concern. Never did we think that any Australian government or Australian administration would allow its judgment, its tolerance, its responsibility, its understanding, its patience and its reputation to be so easily shattered by acts that could have the effect of turning against us the people over whom we have been appointed trustees. A continuation of the course being followed on Bougainville Island will smash all the good work Australia has done in the Territory since the end of the Second World War. The Opposition believes that Australia enjoyed the understanding and friendship of the people of the Territory and that our relations in the future would have continued self-government and independence of Papua and New Guinea. But the actions on Bougainville Island, with the compulsory acquisition of land from primitive people and the enforcement by force of that resumption has done Australia great harm. It may be many years before the total cost is known. It could easily be that Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd, the company the Administration set out to please, will be tbe first to feel the effects of our loss of prestige and trust. The blame for the whole deplorable incident must be firstly the responsibility of the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Barnes), secondly, Cabinet and, thirdly, every member of the Government parties. inherent Liberal and Country Party philosophy to place private profits before people which allowed the situation to develop.",32,Exchange Sydney New South Projects Throughout Australia And That At Wales

75,Mr Stewart (Lang) [5.13],"Mr Not one of them escapes-it was theVery few Australians would disagree with the words of Mr A. P. J. Newman, M.H.A., the Acting Assistant Administrator (Economic Affairs) who, speaking in the House of Assembly at Port Moresby on 16th June 1969, described the Boungainville project as: 'an event of unprecedented economic and social significance in the history of the Territory'. But as few would agree with his further statement that The Administration intends to fulfil its obligations under its agreement with the company and take all steps necessary to bring this great national asset into production' if 'all steps necessary' means the trampling on years of land traditions of the native people and the use of force to fulfil obligations which are not understood by the same people-obligation s which were entered into by the Administration, after little, it any, consultation with the native land owners. Newman delivered in the House of Assembly on 16th June to give members the background to the project not one word is said of any negotiations with the land owners. On page 3 of his speech, Mr Assembly in Port Moresby has made Newman said: After much discussion between the Company, the Administration and the Department of External Territories, an Agreement was signed on 6th June 1967 between the Company and the Adrninistration. The Agreement sets out the various things was not until mid-1966 that you bothered that the Company and the Administration would guarantee to each other. A few minutes ago the Minister for External Territories delivered a thirteen-page statement in the House. His speech lasted for about 22 minutes. He also gave to the members of this House some of the background to the negotiations on the Bougainvill copper project and also some of the details of the happenings earlier this month.

Nobody suggests that the Administration under its mining ordinance, land ordinance or water resources ordinance did not have authority to sign the agreement and to resume any land which Boungainville Copper Pty Ltd desired for its purposes to carry out the project to a successful conclusion.

I submit that every member of the Government has a case to answera case which has caused a great deal of embarrassment to all Australians. honourable member's time has expired. able member for Lang( Mr Stewart) said that the present position in Bougainville has arisen because the Government places profits before the welfare of the people of New Guinea. That is a statement which I will shortly prove to be completely false. The honourable member for Lang lays the blame for the present position on the Minister for External Territories ( Mr First, freehold land has not been taken at Barnes), the Cabinet and every member of the Government Parties. I believe that the blame for what has happened at Bougainville can be laid at the door of those Europeans who have a vested interest in stirring up trouble and unrest. The speech which has been made by the honourable member for Lang has done nothing to help the position in Bougainville. I want to make it clear at the outset that whatever I have to say will be said as a result of first hand knowledge of what is going on in Bougainville. It is less than 3 weeks since I returned from a visit there. I do not believe that the honourable member for Lang, who just spoke, has been therecertainly not in recent times. With members of the Government Panies Mining Committee I visited Panguna, Kieta and Rorovana and talked to Administration officials, to officers of the mining company and to Paul Lapun, the local member for Bougainville. We talked to villagers of Rorovana at a public meeting which was chaired by Paul Lapun. We talked to the head of the largest mission in that area and also to a man named McKillop, whose property at Arawa probably will be taken over. We talked, too, to another gentleman whose reputation would be known to the honourable member for Langa man named Middlemiss. I believe that members of the Committee received a balanced picture of what is actually going on. But one would gather from the publicity which has been given to this subject that everything associated with the venture is of a minus nature. There are plenty of pluses. Quite a number of people in Australia feel very strongly about this whole episode, but I believe that in many cases their opinions are based on misleading and incomplete information. They cannot be blamed for forming the opinions that they have, because they can form their opinions only on what they are told. All that the public has been told by the Press is that Bougainvillians are losing their land by compulsory acquisition. This is just a bald statement; it is only part of the story and a very misleading part at that. I believe that many critics would change their views if they knew the facts. It is time that someone gave the facts, and I want to do so. The facts are these: all. The land that has been taken is on a leasehold basis. The people whose land has been resumed will be provided with an equivalent area of land if they wish it. They will be paid an annual occupation fee of 5% of the unimproved value of the land or $2 an acre, whichever is the greater. They will be paid a minimum of $2 for every tree on their land, whether it be a coconut tree or a cocoa tree. They may be paid a greater amount but it will not be less than $2. They will be provided, on the new land given to them, with the same number of trees that they have at present, and the company will see that because a coconut tree takes 10 years to bear they will be provided with the equivalent amount of fruit that they would have taken from trees on their own land for 10 years. If they do not want to go and pick that fruit on another block provided for them, the company will deliver the friut to them in bags. The company has undertaken-and I have the company's authority to say thisthat when other land is provided for these people the company will erect for them on that land not grass huts, to which they have been accustomed, but European type houses. They will not be five-room brick houses but fibro houses with a water supply attached. At the mine site $50,000 already has been paid for the village site. The company has undertaken to rebuild the village on a new site which is satisfactory to the natives. It is actually the site on which the village existed 50 years ago. These people will be receiving $20,000 per annum in occupation fees and $80,000 per annum in royalties.",35,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Lan D Tenure
86,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The,36,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Lan D Tenure
87,Mr Fox (Henty) [5.29],"The honourThe people from that village will receive $100,000 annually from the company as long as copper is being mined there. The Administration in New Guinea has been offered the right to take up, on behalf of the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, 20% of the capital investment in the area. The company itself is being given tax freedom for 3 years after which it will be taxed on a rising scale until about 1980 when the taxation will be at the rate of 50%. Let us look at what the Territorians will receive. They will receive royalties with relation to the value of the copper which is being taken. They will get 20% of the profits. They will get 50% of the pronts by way of taxation ultimately and they will get occupation fees. In addition to this the comfitable for such an amount to be spent. pany is providing employment for quite a number of the natives. I understand that already more than 600 are employed by the company. We went into the assay room at Panguna where already very sophisticated equipment is being used for assaying the minerals that are being taken. This equipment is being operated by the native people. They are being checked each morning but the officer checking them said that there is no need for this because they are nearly always accurate. This is a useful skill that they are being taught. Development roads will be built and a new port will be provided as will be new schools and a hospital. A co-operative company is being set up with a 50% native ownership. In not many years, the total ownership will be given to the natives. The company already has spent more than $21m on exploration, and it will spend a total of $300m on capital works. It expects by the mid-1970s to be earning about $50m annually. This will be the largest amount that the Administration of New Guinea or the people of Papua and New Guinea will receive from any source other than from the taxpayers of Australia. Many people who live in Bougainville have been upset, but they have been stirred by people with vested interests in creating trouble. It is easy to stir up trouble. We have only to look at the trouble that has been created in some Australian universities and at what happened outside the United States Embassy with the burning of flags and the breaking of windows. If the right type of people are doing the stirring, it is easy to upset people. The people of Papua and New Guinea have been told to wait for independence when they will get the whole amount and not 20%, but actually they are not getting 20% but more than half of the profits, as I have indicated. The company is training these people to take over gradually the operations of the company so that when the time finally arrives they will be able to run everything efficiently for themselves. If they want to go on with it straight away, where would they get the $300m to do it? If they wait until independence comes-wheneve r that may be, and <I am not putting a time on it -the y will still need the ability to finance the project and they have no guarantee that the price of copper then will make it proNone of us knows whether there will be a demand for copper in a few years time. The honourable member for Lang has talked about these people being upset and our upsetting the people of Papua and New Guinea. In addition to visiting Bougainville we visited a place called Maprik, which is about 50 miles west of Wewak. Native gold miners came to talk to us. Their attitude was: 'Why cannot the company come up here and search in our area so that we can get some of the benefits that are going to Bougainville?' These people have not been stirred up by trouble makers. If the Opposition really wants to help the people of the Territory it would do better to point out to the people the great advantages that will result to them from a successful operation by the company and the fact that they would be better prepared for independence, which this Government wants to be successful. The Liberal-Country Party Government wants to develop a strong New Guinea. We want a united people and a New Guinea strong enough financially to resist infiltration and aggression from quarters which have a vested interest in their making a failure of independence. Opposition's proposal is not in protest against the development of mineral resources on the island of Bougainville. It is a protest at the way in which certain aspects associated with that development have been handled by the Administration of the Territory which, of course, is backed up by the Department of External Territories and the",36,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Lan D Tenure
88,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [5.38],"Th eMinister for External Territories ( Mr The Minister for External Territories has Barnes). What we are protesting at is the naked viciousness of our materialism as we have seen it displayed in Kieta in recent times. The agreement at Kieta is being enforced by tear gas, batons and the use of a para-military force. The Minister for External Territories has suggested that this is emotionalism, but after all we all become emotional about something. Indeed, some people become emotionally concerned about the welfare of race horses. I would suggest that people such as those should not be too critical about those who become emotionally concerned with the welfare of human beings. Surely to God we should have learned a lesson from the Suez debacle. This Governmenta new face on the same carcaseunder Prime Minister Menzies was an enthusiastic supporter of armed intervention by the United Kingdom in Suez against the Arab States. What was the result of that armed intervention? It achieved no acquisition for the British Government, but an area of Arab countries which previously had been within the sphere of British influence is now within the sphere of Russian influence. Surely there is a lesson for the Government to learn from this in its handling of the situation in Bougainville. This is an area of long standing disaffection with the Administration. It has been a centre of the cargo cult, as a result of which on many occasions it has come into sharp conflict with the Administration. The people on the island of Bougainville vary the conditions of any lease. This is are black skinned Bukas. They are very vitally important in the discussion in which proud of the fact that they have black skin; we are now engaged. In fact, it is the that they are different from the copper Administration itself making the decisions skinned people on the main island of about the variation of leases for the absorpPapua and New Guinea.

The facts are that in the discusislanders. There is already a strong breaksions in the House of Assembly at Port away movement at Bougainville to form a Moresby there was quite clearly confusion new nation with the British Solomon in members' minds as to the implications of islanders. The very things for which the the legislation which they had before them. Government is responsible today and for Mr Grove, Director of Lands, Surveys and which it tries to foist responsibility on to the Mines, at page 2,408 of the House of House of Assembly at Port Moresby are Assembly debates on 8th June 1967 calculated, not intentionally but through admitted that the agreement was a long and incompetence, to undermine and destroy the complicated document. Paul Lapun, one of Government's announced objective of nathe members representing the island of tional unity in Papua and New Guinea. Bougainville in the House of Assembly, s$M made the claim on a number of occasions that the House of Assembly at Port Moresby is responsible for the agreement which is being enforced at the present time. This is altogether too facile an explanation of what bas transpired. In the first place, the Minister uses the House of Assembly at Port Moresby as a mask to cover his own ineptitude, that of his Government and that of certain people who work, in University Avenue in this city. Let us look at some of the facts about the House of Assembly at.Port Moresby. It is quite remote geographically from the people of Bougainville. There are eight: three members in the House of Assembly. Only three of them come from Bougainville. So given the standard of understanding of nationhood existing in Papua and New Guinea at the present time-it is practically non-existent-it is quite wrong for the Minister to suggest that this has been a responsible decision by the House of Assembly after careful consideration of all the facts involved. Does the Minister suggest that the use of tear gas and batons at Rorovana, and no doubt to be repeated at Arawa if necessary, has resulted from a decision of the House of Assembly at Port Moresby? Of course it has not. It has been a decision of the Administration, and no doubt the instructions have come from Canberra. If one looks at the agreement and the ""Act related to this matter one finds that the Administration has tremendous powers to at page 2,556 of the House of Assembly debates on 30th August 1967 that he had discovered that not only native members of the House of Assembly but expatriate members too had experienced extreme difficulty in understanding the agreement. It is little wonder. It is an involved and lengthy legal document. To have some of the sections interpreted in the articles of the agreement I had to seek the advice of some of the legal practitioners who are members of this House. So how can one reasonably expect members of the House of Assembly and more especially the native members who have had, I expect, no experience in legal matters, to interpret this involved, long and difficult document? I said that there was confusion. There was also misunderstanding on the part of native members of the House of Assembly. Mr Lapun, at page 2556 of the House of Assembly debates on the same date that I mentioned earlier, said that he was happy to accept the agreement because he believed that the undertakings which it covered were restricted to Panguna. He did not conceive that there would be any extension of activities to Arawa, Rorovana or any other places in the Kieta district, as is generally being anticipated at the present time. Mr this agreement. Clearly these few snippets Grove, the Director of Lands, Surveys and Mines, on 8th June 1967 made a statement which clearly implied that the agreement would be restricted to Panguna. Let us not have any strict technical interpretations along the lines of semantics of what he said, because clearly the gist of what he said implied that the agreement would be restricted to development at Panguna. He said: It is almost certain that, if the mining operaat an experimental stage with their parliation commences at Panguna, a modern town with new houses, water and electric power will start to grow. He then went on to indicate the sorts of benefits which would obtain as a result of this development. Mr Lapun made his statement in the House of Assembly some 2 months after Mr Grove made that statement. I can find no evidence anywhere in the House of Assembly debates that Mr Lapun's misconception of how this agreement was to be applied was corrected by responsible officials in the House of Assembly. Then we have the insensitiveness of the Minister for External Territories who, according to Mr Paul Lapun in the debates on 23rd November 1966 on the Mining (New Guinea) Bill (No. 2) 1966, after outlining a long list of causes for discontent and disaffection among the people at Bougainville as the result of this mining project, said: A third thing, Sir, which makes my people antigovernment. When the Minister for Territories, Mr Barnes, visited us, he was asked if part of the royalties could be given to the Bougainville District Development Fund and if another portion could go to the owners of the land and, thirdly, if what remained could go to the Government. The Minister told the people that they had to observe Australian law, which is that royalties for minerals go to the Government and not to the owners of the land. The Government uses this money to develop the entire country. When they heard that all of the royalties would go to Port Moresby and none of them remain in Bougainville, the people asked themselves how then could Kieta become a large township. This finally made them of the opinion that they could believe nobody at aa The implications of this are clear. There is confusion and misunderstanding and, even worse, there is lack of trust on the part of the native people towards the Administration. This is the sort of record for which the Government is responsible. The Minister is trying to claim that the House of Assembly freely, and with full information available, made a decision on -the y are all I can quote in my restricted time-indicat e that there was confusion, especially in the minds of the native members of the House of Assembly. Therefore, the decision they arrived at certainly cannot be regarded as a reliable one. In this sort of situation we ought to bend the normal parliamentary procedures, because this is not a fully developed country. It is an under-developed country and they are still mentary procedures. This matter should be returned to the House of Assembly so that the people can discuss it and hammer these issues out. In any event, we ought to set up the Australian parliamentary committee which we have proposed with the objective of retrieving a situation which is worsening and which could become irretrievable unless something positive is soon done. Dr MACKAY (Evans) [5.48]-We have heard a speech from the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) in which he set out the physical facts of the situation at Bougainville in such a way that no Australian studying them could help but come to the conclusion that something has happened in Bougainville, and therefore in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, which is providential for the future of the people with whom we are concerned. The overall picture in the past years has been one of deep rooted concern that a nation which was moving towards independence might one day be hamstrung in that independence because it would not have within it the economic potential for self reliance and its own viability. This situation has been changed dramatically and rapidly in the past few years because an enormous deposit of very low grade copper and a smattering of gold which has been examined over the years by modern methods and which, because of the tremendous scale of development can now be considered to be commercial, can bring these people to a position in world society which they might not otherwise have achieved for a very long time to come. This is the positive side of the picture. At the same time it must be realised that in the island of Bougainville there is a race of very primitive and most unsophisticated people. Most of these people have never seen a road of any size, let alone a town of any size. They have absolutely no concept of what is meant by a major mining venture such as is to come to their country. Descrippeople. Contrary to what the honourable tion or explanation to these people is almost impossible without illustration. Contrary to what has been said by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) I believe that since the first glimmerings of viability emerged, not in I960 or 1964 as the honourable member sought to suggest, but when the company first became aware of the fact that this venture could be commercial-for a long time this did not appear likely-ther e have been unceasing efforts to explain to the people what is involved in the setting up of a city which will be the capital city of Bougainville-the capital of that part of the world; deliberately stirred up on the admission of bigger than Lae or Rabaul. The establishment of this city will be a major contribution to the entire development of the Territory. Now a situation has emerged which has brought about a state of confusion and fuss and bother in the area. One wonders why this has come about. 1 believe that the answer is most simply given by a Christian gentleman, I would this area on two occasions the 'Pour have the honourable member for Lang Corners' team has gone, with one objective understand; by a member of his own faith, -to highlight divisions and differences He is a missionary who has lived there virtually all his life. He told me that the people have been stirred up in about ten villages by one European, who is manager of a local plantation. He told me that before that happened things were very quiet. As far as he was able to ascertain the people had accepted the fact that the town would be there. He was not referring to the mine at Panguna, which the honourable member for Oxtey( Mr Hayden) claims is the only development which the natives expected. The missionary told me that the people accepted the fact that the town was to be there, in the Rorovana area in Kieta. It was only when this matter was stirred up that the people began to turn. Those are the words of the missionary; they are not the words of my committee, which took evidence from a large cross section of people. It is my belief that a deliberate attempt has been made to create trouble and to exploit problems, firstly, by vested interests in the Arawa-the white man's plantation. This is a magnificent piece of territory. It has been efficiently run. Tn anybody's eyes it is a shame to see these lovely trees destroyed, but this is to make way for something so valuable to 2£ million member for Lang has said, the hearts and minds of 2£ million people in Papua and New Guinea have not been estranged by what is going on. As the honourable member for Henty pointed out, we were besieged by inquiries as to how soon similar things might take place in other parts of the Territory because the advantages of what was happening were obvious to people with a little more sophistication. It is laughable for the honourable member for Lang to suggest that this land has been resumed by force. What has been done by force, if you like, has been that a few policemen have acted against one or two people who were this person who went about ceaselessly from village to village encouraging the people, as we were told in evidence, by offering to supply them with arms and to fight alongside them if they would stand out against the Administration. This is the kind of stirring that has been going on. But there has been more, because into between races. Here and now 1 accuse the 'Four Corners' team of deliberate and calculated distortion. I accuse it of the attempted creation of racial clashes. We were given evidence of those whom the team approached with a view to creating demonstrations which it could photograph to show to the Australian people. We were told of the suppression of facts given to the 'Four Corners' team by the news sources of the Territory. We were told by reporters that they had offered facts to the team which would have presented a very different picture from the one presented to the Australian public on its television screens. These facts were rejected out of hand by the 'Four Corners', team. Other facts relating to the harmony and co-operation that existed between the Administration and the native people were given to the 'Four Corners' team but were rejected as not being within the charter which the team was in the Territory to pursue. I believe that the 'Four Corners' team went to the Territory to produce a series of programmes designed to destroy good relations between white and black people and especially to undermine the Administration. It is one thing for the Government and particularly the Postmaster General to defend the Australian Broadcasting Commission against political pressure. It is quite another thing to defend it when it seeks to stir up hatred and violence that could endanger the lives of devoted Australian public servants who would serve a government of the opposite persuasion to the present Government just as faithfully as they serve this Government. I believe that this has been done. When people have been stirred in this way at the point of their deepest emotions-thei r land-ho w do you get them to accept facts of the kind presented by the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Barnes) and the bonourable member for Henty? I believe that there is need for a firm decision to be made. What is the alternative? Should we allow a minority to set back the tremendous opportunity presented to millions of people in the Territory? The analogy that comes to mind is that of parents with a child who has a club foot. That child has been frightened by tales of what happens in hospital and so cries that it does not want an operation to restore it to full health and enable it to become a responsible and capable person in its adult years. I believe that a similar situaon the Chairman of Committees to take the tion has emerged in the Territory. Many times I have discussed with my colleagues the invidious position in which Australia is placed. On the one hand we ask why we should get the kicks for something which for the most part will benefit the islanders or the company concerned. But this is not all: Should we leave these people to be exploited by those who, for their own objectives, political or financial, want to stir them up? What of Australia's financial outlay in the Territory? Are we prepared to deny Australians schools, pensions and development of all kinds while we exploit our own ore resources in this country and not ask the Territory to share the burden? What alternatives does the Opposition propose? The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) went briefly into the area. He proposes that the company delay its operations until the Territory has produced its own trained engineers and geologists. This would take 10 or 20 years, during which time, of course, Australian taxpayers would bear the burden. This is not the answer. Nor is the appointment of a select committee from this House the answer. A select committee there may well be. and should be, but I believe that it should be a committee appointed by the indigenous members of the House of Assembly. If they do not consider that it is necessary to have an inquiry, what kind of colonialist arrogance lies behind the suggestion that in this House we should override the decision of the House of Assembly and move into the Territory with our own inquiry into something which the House of Assembly itself has supported and which I believe still supports to a man? I think that the Opposition's suggestion is arrogant in the extreme. discussion is interrupted and will be resumed at a later hour.

If other countries can get 4% increase in gross With the expectation that there will be of gross national expenditure Spending by Governments and their Last year this expenditure increased by The other main branch of expenditure is private investment. Another year of large scale private capital outlay seems certain. How strongly this expenditure will be supported by capital inflow is one of the uncertainties we have to allow for. Present conditions in capital markets abroad suggest that it would be prudent to allow for a reduction in capital inflow this year. If that occurred, it could have a direct effect on capital expenditure and would tend to modify the influences adding to monetary liquidity. At present, however, capital expenditure economic conditions, including likely moveis imposing a considerable strain on the ments in monetary liquidity, ln last year's economy.

This effect would be strengthened light destroyers for the Navy as replaceto the extent that net sales of Commonwealth securities were made to the nonbank public in Australia. Less buoyant liquidity conditions will, of course, help to contain increases in spending from local borrowings or other capital raisings in the Australian market. I now turn to the expenditure estimates and the main policy decisions affecting them. To avoid wearisome detail, I shall give only the costs in 1969-70 of new expenditure proposals. In many instances their full-year costs will be considerably greater. Detailed analyses will be found in the statements attached to this Speech. Defence The Defence vote will falj this year to an estimated $l,104m or about 5% less than last year's defence expenditure of $l,165m. Defence expenditure overseas is expected to be about $243m or $87m less than last year. The financial requirement is somewhat smaller mainly because parts of the major equipment programme have been completed and for some projects some of the expenditure is being spread into later years. It does not amount to a reduction in our defence effort As my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has announced, the defence programmes of the future will not be limited to set 3-year periods but will always look 5 years ahead and be kept under constant welfare constitute the largest single item in review. In accordance with this concept, the Budget. They include expenditure on studies have been undertaken in the Defence social services, repatriation, health and Department and equipment and works prohousing and are estimated to rise this year posals have been brought forward and by $ 192m to total $ 1,659m. approved for inclusion in this Budget. Studies are continuing on other projects and continued to give a great deal of attention as these are approved they will be admitted to this area. In a wide and searching to the programme. Tbe projects so far examination of the needs of the less forapproved include ship construction and tunate members of the community, we have various items of capital works and equipment. The ship construction programme will include a fast combat support ship, a hydrographic ship and an oceanographic ship for the Navy and heavy landing craft for the Army. It is also proposed to put in hand a preliminary design study for new ments for some of the R:A.N.'s existing destroyers. There will be technical items of equipment ordered for all Services. The Army will be authorised to enter into forward commitments this year with the object of acquiring additional arms and armaments. This authorisation could involve expenditure of up to $60m next year but, as the orders placed will include long leadtime items, there will be a continuing commitment for expenditure in later years. A decision has also been taken to proceed with major airfield works at Learmonth, Western Australia; it is unlikely that there will be any expenditure on the project in 1969-70. Al) of these proposals, about which the Minister for Defence will give details in the course of the Budget debate, will add substantially to our defence capability. Further additions to the strength of the Forces are planned for the year ahead. It is expected that, by the end of this financial year, the strength of the Navy will have risen from'16,943 to 17,360, of the Army from 46,525 to 48,010 and of the Air Force from 22,712 to 23,660. These additional numbers are required to man new ships and aircraft coming into service, meet operational commitments overseas and provide supporting elements in Australia. The Citizen Military Force is expected to increase from 34,256 to 36,000. 1 turn now to one of the most important features of the Budget and that is social welfare. Social Welfare The expenditures grouped under social, Over the past year, the Government has had the assistance of the Welfare Committee of Cabinet under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health. The proposals that I shall now outline-give relief to the aged and our needier people and at thc same time give positive incentives to thrift and self-reliance.

Liberalisation of the Means TestI now come to the liberalisation of the Under present pension arrangements,",42,Economic Context
93,Mr Mcmahon,"Wait a moment andprovision does not provide any incentive to earn or provide for additional income. The Government proposes, therefore, to introduce a 'tapered' means test under which additional means in excess of the 'free' limits to which I have referred will, in future, reduce rhe age, invalid, widow's or service pension by only 30 cents for each additional dollar of means. As a direct consequence of this change, single pensioners with means in excess of $10 per week will all receive increased pensions and eligibility in the case of adults or married minors and for some pension will not cut out until their means reaches $40 a week instead of $24-the cut-off point at the existing pension rate. In the case of married couples, both being pensioners, eligibility for some pension will continue until their joint means reach a level of $70 per week. When I come to the revenue estimates I shall outline additional concessions we propose to give under the Income Tax Age Allowance to take account of the 'tapered' means test. It is expected that approximately 250,000 persons will become eligible either for pension for the first time or for increased pensions under the proposed 'tapered' means test. Aged Persons Homes Scheme We propose also to introduce a new proposals I have announced is estimated to allowance of $5 a week for persons of 80 be $73m in 1969-70. In consequence, total years of age or over who receive approved expenditure on social services this year will personal care while living in hostel type be $999m. accommodation provided by organisations eligible under the Aged Persons Homes Act.

It is now proposed to persons' homes organisation prior to 1957 provide free health insurance benefits equal has been excluded from the capital cost for the purposes of determining the amount granted by the Commonwealth towards the benefits forerection of a new home. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits The rates of benefit payable to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries will be raised. In the case of a married minor or adult the rate will be increased by $1.75 to $10 per week and the allowance for a dependent wife by $1 to $7 per week. Where there are children in the family of an unemployed or sickness beneficiary, the allowance for children under 16 will be raised by $1 to $2.50 a week in the case of a first child under 16 and by $2 to $3.50 a week for second and subsequent children. Appropriate increases will be made in the allowance payable to unmarried minors. Where they have no parent living in Australia they will receive the adult rate of benefit. At the same time the amount of income which may be received without affecting entitlement to the full rate of benefit is to be increased by $2 to S6 a week from $2 to $3 per week in the case of unmarried minors. In order to relieve hardship in cases where there are frequent periods of unemployment or recurrent sickness, beneficiaries will in future need to serve only once in any period of 13 consecutive weeks the waiting period of 7 days before unemployment or sickness benefit can be paid. The Director-General of Social Services will also be authorised to exercise a discretion to waive recovery of all or part of sickness benefit in cases of hardship or special circumstances such as where inadequate compensation or damages are obtained. At present full recovery is mandatory. The total cost of all of the social service Health Benefits In regard to health benefits, another to standard fund and Commonwealth family groups of at least two units, excepting those of pensionable age, where the family cash income does not exceed $39 a week; all unemployment and sickness beneficiaries for the period for which they are on benefit plus four weeks-bu t if tbey are not insured whenfirstentitled to benefit, there will be a waiting period of two weeks; all migrants for a period of two months after arrival in Australia. Details of the machinery imder which these benefits will be made available will be announced shortly by the Minister for Health. Housing The Commonwealth is already assisting in the provision of housing for the aged, particularly through the Aged Persons Homes Scheme. Nevertheless, we recognise that the housing of some single age and service pensioners with little or no means apart from their pension is below acceptable standards and the rentals they are required to pay are excessive. The States are already providing self-contained dwelling units including units for single age penimportant element in this Budget-in fact, sioners at reasonable rentals. We believe that more should be done and therefore propose to offer to the States non-repayable grants of $25m over 5 years, beginning this year, so that building of this type of dwelling can be expedited. Repatriation Benefits We propose a number of improvements in repatriation pensions and benefits. The pension payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioner will be increased by $2.50 per week to $36 per week. Last year we introduced a new form of assistancea special compensation allowance payable to certain of the more seriously incapacitated general rate pensioners. We propose to increase this allowance by $2 per week so that a general rate pensioner who qualifies for the allowance will receive $17 per week where his incapacity is assessed at 100 per cent and $12.75 where the assessment is at 75 per cent. The rate of pension payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently because of a war-caused disability-the intermediate rate-wil l be increased by $2.25 to $26*50 a week. War widows' pension will be increased by $1 to $15 a week and, in addition, the domestic allowance payable to most war widows will be. increased by 50 cents a week. In total, then, a war widow receiving domestic allowance will receive an increase of $1.50 per week, bringing her total basic pension to $22.50 a week. Although they were increased last year, we propose to increase again the allowances payable to certain war pensioners in respect of attendants. The recreation transport allowance and the allowance to assist in meeting the rurming expenses of a specially equipped gift car will each be increased. War Service Homes An extra $5m is to be provided for War Service Homes taking the total to $55m. This recognises the full-year effect of last year's increase from $7,000 to $8,000 in the maximum loan. Education I come to what I regard as another a very important element. Increasingly in recent years the Commonwealth appropriation for education has grown. In a country dedicated to growth, the breadth and quality of education must be a critical element. As well, education and cultural development are objectives in their own right. The Commonwealth has progressively increased the scale and broadened the scope of its financial support for education. Through specific purpose payments and general financial grants assistance is being provided at all levels and for all types of schools. Over $265m will be appropriated in the Budget for education this year, or 38% more than last year's expenditure. Within the total, payments to the States specifically for education will increase by 53% to $l65m. Payments will include' the full-year cost of the new programmes of capital grants for secondary school libraries and pre-school teachers colleges introduced last year. Provision is being made for the programme of development of Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education in prospect for the 1970-1972 triennium, as well for other new policy proposals, to which I shall refer shortly. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, will be making detailed statements about education including the recommendations of the Australian Universities Commission and the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education for the 1970-1972 triennium. Broadly stated, the triennial programmes are based on the expectation that by 1972 total student enrolment, full and part-time, in Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education will be more than 45,000 greater than in the current academic year. To meet this expected demand, these institutions will need better capital facilities and greater appropriations for recurrent costs. The recommended programmes for these institutions in the 1970-1972 triennium aggregate 3910m-a n increase of $263m on the programmes for the 1967-1969 triennium. The recommended programmes for university students Later for Colleges of Advanced Education will 2,000 to 4,000.

Last year we decided to extend to October 1971 the operation of the authorising legislation and to increase the standard rate of subsidy to $8 a ton with effect from 14 August 1968. This year we have decided to increase the rate of subsidy still further. As from tomorrow the standard rate will be SI2 per ton. At the new rate the subsidy is expected to cost $50m this year or $19m more than last year. In August 1966 we introduced a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, for which the authorising legislation is due to expire in October 1969. We have now decided to continue the subsidy for a further three years at an estimated cost in 1969-70 of $ 15m or $4m more than last year. Wool Research and Promotion To afford further assistance to the woolgrowing industry, the Government has decided to offer the industry a more generous arrangement for the financing of wool research and promotion. For three years commencing 1 July 1970, the growers' levy would be reduced from two to one per cent and the Government would meet the balance of the expenditure required for research and promotion, provided its contribution does not exceed an average of $27m per annuni. In effect, the growers' levy would be halved and the Government's contribution approximately doubled. The Government's offer will have to be negotiated with the Australian Wool Industry Conference together with any changes that might be required in the areas of responsibility for the administration of wool research and promotion by virtue of the increased financial commitment assumed by the Government Wheat Industry Stabilization Scheme Since 1960-61 the Commonwealth has each year made payments to the wheat industry to enable returns to growers to be raised to the guaranteed price in respect of specified quantities of exported wheat. In 1968-69 the payment involved was $43m. This enabled the return to growers tp be raised by more than 28 cents to $1.64 per bushel f.o.r. on 150m bushels of export wheat in respect of the 1967-68 season. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1968 provides a guaranteed price on exports of up to 200 million bushels in respect of each of the five wheat seasons 1968-69 to 1972-73. For the first of these seasons the guaranteed price is $1.45 per bushel f.o.b. and for subsequent seasons it will be adjusted in accordance with movements in cash costs. It is expected that a wheat stabilisation payment in respect of the 1968-69 crop will be made in 1970-71. No provision will be needed for a payment this year. Drought Bonds The main features of the Government's Drought Bonds scheme were outlined in a statement which I made in the House on 1 May 1969. Legislation authorising their issue will be introduced shortly, with a view to the first series of Drought Bonds being available for subscription on 1 November next. Industrial Research and Development Grants Grants are made by the Commonwealth to encourage additional expenditure by Australian manufacturing and mining companies on research and development. Expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to double, increasing to $10.8m from $5.3m in 1968-69. Post Office Well over half the item Advances for Capital Purposes comprises the provision of new capital for the Post Office, mainly to assist in financing expansion and improvement of telephone services. The provision this year for the Post Office is $229m. This compares with a provision last year of $222m and actual advances of $204.5m. The latterfigurewas only $lm greater than in 1967-68. The increase in this year's provision over actual advances in 1968-69 is due in substantial measure to two special circumstances; first, in 1968-69 the Post Office was able to achieve a greater improvement in its net cash operating surplus than is expected in 1969-70 and second, payments on some large equipment orders, which were expected to fall due last year, now have to be met in 1969-70 instead of last year. The Post Office expects to be able during the year to make 290,000 telephone connections involving new lines or equipment and to hold the numbers awaiting service at about the current figure of 55,000. Other Expenditures The largest absolute increase in any of the main classes of expenditure is the rise of $186m in payments to or for the States. This will bring the total amount to an estimated $l,643m, an increase of 12.8%. Within this total, grants and payments of a revenue nature will increase by nearly $117m to approximately $l,274m. Payments of a capital nature will rise by $69m to close on $369m. In addition to, and distinct from, the payments just mentioned, the State works and housing programmes will increase by $48m to $7S8m. Of this amount $132m has been allocated under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements. There are a number of other figures here which I feel it is not necessary, to read out. Consequently, T ask for leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. no objection, leave is granted. expenses are estimated to increase by $43m to nearly $443m, or 10.6% higher than last year's expenditure. Close to $19m of this increase is attributed to higher rates of pay, over expenditure in 1968-69. The Ausincluding the increase in Third Division salaries granted as from 17th July 1969. External economic aid will be increased by $13m, or 9.3%, to total more than $150m. This figure includes $96m for assistance to Papua and New Guinea, which will be $9m, or 10.3%, greater than last year. In addition, it is estimated that Commonwealth departments and non-commercial instrumentalities will spend about $22.6m in the Territory. If the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank needs more capital funds this year, the Government will consider assisting the Administration to make an additional contribution. Commonwealth payments to industry will, on present estimates exceed $200m, a decrease on last year of $10.3m. As I have said, no wheat stabilisation payment is expected this year. Last year the cost was $43m. Devaluation compensation for primary industries is estimated at S29m, a reduction of $6m. Partly offsetting these decreases arc the increased subsidies on superphosphate and nitrogenous, fertilizers, and the increased grants for industrial research and development to which I referred earlier. Bounty payments for the protection of a number of manufacturing industries are estimated to increase. In the case of the shipbuilding subsidy the estimated cost is $ 16.6m, or $4m more than last year. We propose to pay a further amount of approximately $7.2m to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to meet special expenditure in 1969-70, in particular in the fields of health, education and housing. The balance of about $1.3m in the Trust Account at 30 June 1969 will be used to meet outstanding commitments under similar programmes commenced last year; expenditure in 1968-69 on these programmes was approximately $4.0m. Of the $10m appropriated to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account last year, $4.7m was subsequently paid to the Commonwealth Capital Fund established under the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968. It is not expected that any substantial addition to this Fund will be required in 1969-70. This year we are seeking an appropriation of $2.85m for grants in support of the performing arts, an increase of $1.2m tralian Council for the Arts, now in its second year, has provided valuable advice to the Government. Details of the assistance to be provided in 1969-70 will be announced shortly. I now turn to thefinancingof this expenditure from revenue and other sources. Another year of high and rising incomes and buoyant expenditure in all sectors of the economy is expected and we have based our revenue estimates on this expectation. Receipts from all sources except borrowing are estimated to rise to $6,954m-a n increase of 13.5% on last year's receipts. Total taxation revenue is estimated to be $6,237m, an increase of 14.7% on last year. Details of these estimates are given in Statement No. 3 attached to this Speech. With a large increase of revenues in prospect we considered, in the overall budget strategy, whether greater expenditures than those proposed could have been financed or whether we could have given greater tax concessions than those I am about to mention.",46,Expenditure Estimates 1969 70
94,Mr Deputy Speaker,There being,51,Revenue Estimates 1969 70
95,Mr Mcmahon,"Departmenta l runningThe essence of the situation we face is that, if our revenues rise as much as expected, it will be largely because of highly expansive economic conditions. If there were, in these circumstances, greater increases in expenditure than those proposed, we would have added further to demand on resources already under some strain. It would be much the same if we reduced taxation substantially. The consequent rise in disposable incomes and spending power would increase both demand and liquidity and would inevitably give a greater stimulus to inflationary tendencies. We have not therefore considered it prudent to give general concessions in taxation. We have, however, thought it desirable, in order to deal with special circumstances, to propose some changes in taxes and rates of charges. I shall now outline these changes. Income Tax-Ag e Allowance We propose a further liberalisation of subscriptions of capital to certain kinds of the income tax age allowance granted to companies can, for some taxpayers, confer residents of Australia who are of qualifying unjustified benefits. age, that is, sixty-five years for men and sixty for women. Under the present age allowance an aged expenditure is authorised by more than person is exempt from tax if his or her own one provision only one deduction is allowed. taxable income does not exceed $1,248 There is under the existing law an exception while a married aged person is exempt if to this principle, with the effect that where the combined taxable income of husband certain shares are sold by a share dealer, and wife does not exceed $2,184. For 1969-70 no tax wUl be payable by exploration an aged person whose taxable income does not exceed $1,300 or by a married aged in calculating the profit or loss on sale. In person unless the combined taxable income effect, a taxable profit on a sale of the shares of husband and wife exceeds $2,262. In order to cushion the transition from deductible loss on a sale is likewise complete exemption to taxation at ordinary increased. In some cases, thc reduction in rates of tax, the age allowance provisions tax liabilities can be as great as the total include 'shading-in''arrangements to limit the cost of the shares. amount of tax payable by an aged person with a taxable income somewhat in excess of the exemption levels. To take account income tax law so that dealers in shares of the new 'tapering' provisions for age will be allowed only one deduction for pensions to which I have already referred, capital subscribed to mining or afforestation we propose to reduce the tax payable under companies. The amendment will affect these limiting provisions and to extend moneys paid on shares after today, except the ranges of income within which the where the dealer owned the shares on or limitation confers a benefit. Convertible Notes We propose also to amend the income who are not regarded as dealers for tax tax law as it now applies to convertible purposes will not be affected by the securities. In 1960, the income tax law was amendment. amended to disallow the deduction of interest payable by companies on convertible securities. This action was taken because it was evident that convertible notes were being used largely as a means of avoiding taxation. In many cases, the convertible notes were essentially deferred issues of shares. The Government recognises that convertible issues can serve legitimate business purposes. It has therefore been decided to restore deductibility of interest for income tax purposes on convertible issues but this will be made subject to conditions designed to minimise tax avoidance. This proposal will be fully explained when amending legislation is brought in. Capital Subscriptions to Mining and Other Companies The Government has also decided that the present law granting tax deductions for It is a general principle of the tax law that where a deduction for an amount of deductions granted with the general aim of facilitating the financing of mineral or afforestation are disregarded is reduced through the allowance of two deductions for the cost of the shares and a It is proposed to amend section 82 of the before today, or became the owner after today pursuant to an application lodged, or an agreement made, by today. People Primary Producers I return to the Government's frequently expressed intention to assist primary producers. At present the cost of some structural improvements made by primary producers for conserving water or fodder-suc h as tanks, silos and hay sheds-is deductible for airway costs and revenues, we propose to income tax purposes by way of depreciation allowances over five years. The cost of other structural improvements-suc h as dams, underground tanks and bores-mad e for these purposes is deductible in full in the year in which it is incurred. It is proposed that, as to expenditure in the income year 1969-70 and subsequent years, the cost of all structural improvements of this nature will qualify for deduction in full in the year in which it is incurred. Mr Coy tin-The poor old cocky. will not leave him quite so poor. Estate Duty The Government has also decided that some relief should be granted from estate duty in the case of the estates of primary producers. In reaching this decision we had in mind the desirability of providing assistundoubtedly contributed to the rise of ance to discourage the breaking-up of economic rural holdings because of the need to pay estate duty. Relief will be granted in two ways. The existing exemption levels will,' for primary production estates, be raised by 20%. Some additional relief from duty will be granted in respect of land and other assets normally used in primary production such as livestock and farm plant and machinery. In broad terms, an estate will qualify for these reliefs when the assets are predominantly of the kind I have mentioned and the income of the deceased person was derived over the preceding five years principally from primary production. Relief will be granted for estates of a net value of less than $250,000. The relief will apply to estates of persons who die after the authorising legislation has been assented to. As a complementary measure some administrative requirements of the estate duty law are to be relaxed. The necessity to lodge security in order to obtain an extension of time for payment of duty is to be eliminated and the statutory limit of two years on extensions of time is to be removed. Air Navigation Charges Consistent wilh the Government's policy of narrowing the gap between airport and increase by 10% the rates of air navigation charges payable by the air transport industry for the use of airport and airway facilities provided by the Commonwealth. The new scale will apply only to domestic flights. As for international flights, international operators have claimed that they are already meeting a relatively high proportion of costs. A study is currently being under taken of airport and airway costs and revenues and the Government will give further consideration to charges for international flights. Last year, despite a domestic surplus of about $200m in the Budget, the money supply increased by SI, 169m. The rate of change in. bank customers' accounts suggests that the turnover of funds, or velocity of circulation, also increased. As I have already said these monetary influences inflationary pressures. This year we expect the Budget to produce a domestic surplus of about $500m. This would withdraw a similar amount from the money supply. Against that, receipts will exceed payments in private transactions abroad-possibl y by much the same amount-and this will add an equivalent amount lo the money supply. Further additions to the money supply will be made from other sources. In particular, the Reserve Bank will again add to Rural Credit advances outstanding as it finances payments on delivery of wheat and other commodities pending sale: though the net injection of liquidity from Rural Credits will be smaller than last year when a record harvest followed a year of drought Loans and advances by the banks will again add to the money supply. Action has been taken to moderate the rate at which the banks increase their lending. Trading banks are being called upon to transfer to their Statutory Reserve Deposits an additional amount equivalent to 1% ol",51,Revenue Estimates 1969 70
96,Mr Mcmahoni Hope The Next One,"their deposits. This will leave them with much the same ratio of liquid assets and government securities to deposits as they had a year ago. This action has been accompanied by a rise of 0.2S% in maximum trading bank fixed deposit and maximum overdraft rates of interest. A new maximum rate of 5% now applies to both fixed deposit and certificates of deposit and within this maximum the term and rate structure has been made more flexible. On the one hand, the higher interest rates will assist the trading banks to attract funds into fixed deposits or certificates of deposit and, to that extent, to compete more effectively with other operators in the money market. On the other hand, the higher overdraft rates should induce bank customers to reduce the call they make on funds borrowed from thc banks. To counter the influences which add to monetary liquidity, the Reserve Bank has been a net seller of Commonwealth securities in its open-market operations. In 1967-68, its net purchases of securities amounted to $178m. Last year it made net sales of about $78m. A new pattern of rates emerged and was reflected in the Commonwealth loan floated last month, with the yield on the long-dated securities rising from 5.4 to 6%. We have aimed at consolidating the strength of Commonwealtb securities in the market. These measures are part of a precautionary move against inflationary trends. They will not in any way inhibit the real growth of the economy. The fact is that a large volume of monetary liquidity has been carried over from the past financial year. In the interests of stability and sound growth, we must limit the amount that will be added to liquidity this year. The real problem is to keep the increase within safe bounds and to prevent it becoming excessive. This financial year will take us over the threshold of the next decade, the 1970's. From an economic point of view, the prospects are basically favourable. The new resources being opened up must add increasand, if 1 may again interpolate, I think it is ingly to output both for domestic use and one of the best Budget. I have known to be for export. Our productivity has risen and introduced in the 20 years that I have been will continue to rise. Migrants are pouring in the House. in and the work force is building UD rapidly. We are attracting a good flow of capital from overseas. Our reserves are reasonably strong and, despite monetary and trade disturbances abroad, our exports are growing, diversifying and reaching out into still wider markets. This provides a margin of safety. It gives us some scope and time for any adjustments needed to keep the economy on a sure and steady course ahead. The broad promise, of future growth does not however reduce, or change essentially, the continuing problem, of economic management, that is, of keeping the national effort close to the limit of available resources but not allowing it to exceed this limit. The problem is with us this year in characteristic form. Rapidly though our supplies of labour, equipment and materials are increasing, demand is right up with them and is growing fast. There is a clear possibility that excess demand, helped by excess liquidity could upset the balance of the economy. This Budget, in its economic : aspect, together with the monetary measures taken lately, is primarily directed to minimising this risk. But budgets are much more than instruments of economic policy. This Budget is designed to share some, of our growing wealth with the less fortunate, to provide still better educational facilities for the young, to help rural industries improve their productivity and tb meet competition abroad, and to expand great developmental works in many parts of the country. Although economic feasibility will, in tbe end, set limits to what can be done in any field, economic.purposes will have little meaning unless they contribute to personal and .humane values. It is the physical and intellectual progress of the community and of the individual human beings in it that ultimately counts. It will be seen that humane values are in the forefront of the purposes this Budget is designed to achieve. I commend it to honourable members The Budget estimates for 1969-70, in 'conventional' terms, provide for: .. an increase of $469 million, or 7.2 per cent, in Commonwealth expenditures, following an increase of $415 million, or 6.8 per cent, in 1968-69; .. an increase of $825 million, or 13.5 per cent, in Commonwealth receipts, after allowing for new revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech, which are estimated to reduce receipts by a net $14 million in 1969-70. In 1968-69, Commonwealth receipts increased by $672 million, or 12.3 per cent; that increase included the effects of measures announced in the Budget Speech for 1968-69, which were estimated to add a net $94 million to revenue for that year; and .. a reduction of $356 million in the budget deficit-fro m $385 million in 1968-69 to $30 million in 1969-70. In national accounting form, the estimates imply: .. an increase of 8.0 per cent in total outlays, following increases of 6.1 per cent in 1968-69 and 10.3 per cent in 1967-68. Expenditures on goods and services areestimated to increase by 1.2 per cent in 1969-70, following an increase of 7.8 per cent in 1968-69; .. an increase of 9.6 per cent in outlays within Australia, following increases of 7.6 per cent in 1968-69 and 8.5 per cent in 1967-68; .. a further reduction of 8.0 per cent in Commonwealth outlays overseas, following a reduction of 6.8 per cent in 1968-69 and an increase of 27.5 per cent in 1967-68; and .. an increase of 14.5 per cent in receipts on the basis of existing rates of taxation and other charges, and 14.3 per cent after taking account of the revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech. In 1968-69, receipts rose by 11.4 per cent and in 1967-68 by 9.6 per cent. With the estimated reduction of $356 million in the Budget deficit to $30 million (the same under both classifications), it is estimated that there will be an increase of about $300 million in. the surplus of Commonwealth receipts over expenditures within Australia. THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT The Budget for 1969-70 has been prepared in the expectation that 1969-70 will be a year of strong growth in both output and spending. The year just past, 1968-69, saw record growth of over 8.5 per cent in Gross National Product at constant prices. About2 percentage points of this increase reflected recovery in rural industry and about 6.5 percentage points continued vigorous expansion in the nonfarm sector. Estimates of the main components of Gross National Product and Gross National Expenditure in 1968-69 are given in detail in the document 'National Income and Expenditure 1968-69' presented with the Budget papers. In current price terms, these estimates show the following main changes from 1967-68: .. an increase of 12.3 per cent in Gross National Product at factor cost, comprising an increase of 11.0 per cent in the gross value of non-farm output and an increase of 27.5 per cent in the gross value of farm output; ., an increase of 10.9 per cent in Gross National Expenditure, including increases of 6.7 percent in personal consumption, 12.7percent in private grossfixedinvestment, and 8.8 per cent in public expenditure on goods and services; and .. a decrease from $570 million in 1967-68 to $347 million in the excess of imports over exports of goods and services. Also, in 1968-69: .. the rise in money wages and in consumer prices (other than for food) became steeper; .. liquidity and the money supply expanded faster than in earlier years; .. a significant part-§40 7 million-of the increase in Gross National Product was added to farm stocks; and .. there was, in the second half of the year, a persistent tightening in the labour market. In 1969-70, on the assumption that activity is maintained at full employment level, Gross National Product at constant prices is expected to increase by at least 6 percent, with average employment and productivity each some 3 per cent higher than in 1968-69. Although lower than the abnormally large increase of over 8.5 per cent in Gross National Product at constant prices in 1968-69. the expected rate of growth in 1969-70 is high in terms of past average experience. On the demand side, the private sector seems likely to continue to increase its spending substantially in 1969-70. With personal incomes generally increasing strongly, consumer spending seems likely to be more buoyant in 1969-70. In particular, money wages have been on a steep upgrade for some time. Spending by wage and salary earners is likely to increase strongly although, to the extent that money wages continue to rise too fast, the money and 'real' (constant price) increases in consumer spending could diverge further. Private fixed investment also seems likely to continue on its strong growth path. The State sector is expected to maintain a solid rate of expansion in its current and capital expenditures. In brief, the Budget has been framed in the context of the economy moving, and being likely to continue to move, on a strong expansionary course. 'CONVENTIONAL' BUDGET FIGURES The following table sets out in 'conventional' form the Budget estimates for 1969-70 and actual receipts and expenditures in 1968-69.

In 1968-69, the increase of $49 million, or 4.4 per cent, in expenditure on Defence Services was a good deal smaller than it had been for some years. Over the preceding three years, expenditure on Defence Services increased by $507 million, or 83.3 per cent, the average annual increase in that period being $169 million. The estimated increase of 10.8 per cent in Payments to or for the States and in State Works and Housing Programmes reflects mainly the prospective increase in nnanciai assistance grants in 1969-70, the large estimated increase in specific purpose grants of a capital nature and the increase in State Works and Housing Programmes agreed to at the Loan Council meeting in June. The estimated increase of 12.7 per cent in the Payment to the National Welfare Fund and Repatriation Services arises in part from the new measures announced in the Budget Speech. Further details of the 1969-70 estimates of expenditures are given in Statement No. 2. Before taking into account the proposed revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to increase by $839 million, or 13.7 per cent, in 1969-70 This increase includes $814 million which is estimated to come from increased taxation collections on the basis of existing legislation. This very high rate of increase in estimated receipts reflects assumptions made as to trends in economic activity in the year ahead, the recovery in primary producers' incomes in 1968-69, and the substantial increase in 1968-69 in incomes of companies and individuals in business, the professions, etc. The following proposed revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce revenue by a net $14 million in 1969-70 and $26 million in a full year: Income taxage allowance structural improvements for water and fodder conservation. 0.2 Estate duty-concession s for primary producers Air navigation charges .. After taking account of tbe effects of these proposed changes, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to amount to $6,954 million, which would be $825 million, or 13.5 per cent, more than in 1968-69.

Actual$ million Domestic outlay Overseas outlay Total outlay Total Receipts Deficit Domestic outlays are estimated to increase more rapidly and overseas outlays to decline more rapidly than in 1968-69. The estimated increase of 8.0 per cent in total outlays compares with increases of 6.1 per cent in 1968-69 and 10.3 per cent in 1967-68. In national accounting terms, Commonwealth receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 per cent in 1969-70, following on increases of 11.4 per cent in 1968-69 and 9.6 per cent in 1967-68. THE BUDGET DEFICIT The Budget deficit is estimated to decrease by $356 million to $30 million in 1969-70. In 1968-69, the deficit declined by $257 million to $385 million. In 1968-69, the net result of Commonwealth receipts and expenditures within Australia was a surplus of close to $200 million following a small deficit in 1967-68. The estimates imply that the surplus within Australia may increase by a further $300 million or thereabouts in 1969-70. The financing of the deficit in 1968-69 and prospects for financing the deficit in 1969-70 are the subject of Statement No. 4. 1968-69 1969-70 Change o a 1967-68 Estimate Change o n 1968-69 $ million Per cent $ million 8 million Per cent 5,959 + 419 + 7.6 6,533 + 574 + 9.6 600 44 6.8 552 48 8.0 6,559 + 375 + 6.1 7,085 + 526 + 8.0 6,174 + 632 + 11.4 7,055 + 881 + 14.3 385 257 30 356 .

Expenditure on aircraft projects is expected to decline by $74,109,000, on arms, armament and equipment for the Army by 822,421,000, and on Naval ship construction by $10431,000. These decreases will be offset by an estimated increase of 532,820,000 in pay, salaries, administrative expenses and general services for all departments in the Defence Croup, including recently-announced increases in officers' pay and the salaries of officers of the Third Division of tbe Public Service. Provision is also made for estimated increased strengths of the Permanent Forces as follows: Strengths at 30 June 1969 Estimated strengths at 30 June 1970 The estimated increase of $4,447,000 ncludcs the cost of additional aid to Malaysia of $1,108,000 resulting from costs associated wUh the gift of Sabre aircraft. The increase of $1,775,000 <a 'other' elements includes $1,202,000 for new works projects. The estimated increase of $894,000 ih salaries and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to an expected growth in civil strength from 1,348 to 1.492 iu 1969-70 and to salary increasesforofficers of the Public Service. The vote provides for an increase of $9,455,000 for accommodation and technical facilities (including an increase of $1,984,000 in the provision of married quarters under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement) and an increase of $2,365,000 for the repair and maintenance of ships and aircraft of thc R.A.N. The expected decrease of $10,231,000 iri expenditure on naval construction represents the approaching completion of the current shipbuilding programme. Provision is made for the commencement of a programme of new shipbuilding projects The estimated net decrease of $7,523,000 allows for a reduction of $22,421,000 in respect of arms, armament and equipment principally because of a change in the composition of capital equipment programmes to long lead-time items and to revised requirements for replacement and maintenance items. The estimated net decline of $1,475,000 in expenditure on accommodation and technical facilities reflects a decrease in expenditure on building works of $2,200,000 which is due to the approaching completion of several major barracks projects and a decrease of $2,260,000 in advances to the States under the Commonwealth-Stat e Housing Agreement. That reduction is partly offset by an increase of $2,075,000 in repairs and maintenance to buildings and other facilities. There will be an estimated increase of $15,989,000 for pay, salaries, administrative expenses and general services. Tbis reflects expected increases in strengths of both Service and civilian staffs and pay and salary rises. The estimated increases in administrative expenses and general services totalling $4,487,000 include $1,012,000 for higher costs and numbers of rations, $999,000 for extra freight and cartage and $742,000 for increased travelling and subsistence related to increased numbers and charges. Expenditure on aircraft purchase and manufacture is expected to decrease by $73,507,000 and on accommodation and technical facilities by $6,443,000. This will be partly offset by an increase of $8,450,000 in pay, salaries, administrative expenses and general services, which mainly reflects forecast increased Service and civilian strengths and pay and salary rises. Most of the estimated decline in expenditure on accommodation and technical facilities relates to a decrease of $6,436,000 in building works mainly because of the approaching completion of major projects commenced in the Defence Programme 1964-65-1967-68 . Expenditure in 1968-69 included the cost of acquisition ($4,450,000) of the Edinburgh Base and there will be no comparable expenditure in 1969-70. These decreases are partly offset by increased expenditure of $3,767,000 on the provision of married quarters under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The estimated net increase in expenditure in 1969-70 of $2,053,000 results from an increase of $2,353,000 for accommodation and technical facilities which includes $1,500,000 towards the cost of relocating at St Mary's the Central Storage Depot at present located at Heffron Park, New South Wales. An additional amount of $1,498,000 is included for increased and revised provisions of machinery and plant at Government factories and establishments to provide expanded and/or new capacity for munitions manufacture. The principal offset of $2,318,000 represents the decline in the need for additional working capital at Government factories in 1969-70. Navy Army Air Force_ ... 16,943 46,525 22,712 _ 17,360 48,010 23,660 Defence : Navy Army Air Supply The principal estimated increase of 31,615,000 is for interest on Defence loans raised in the United States of America tofinancepurchases of defence equipment. An increase of $424,000 is provided in respect of re-establishment benefits for discharged national servicemen and the extension of similar benefits to discharged National Service personnel who .have voluntarily extended their service by up to two years. Defence Expenditure-Overseas Expenditure overseas in 1969-70 is estimated to be $243,000,000 against actual expenditure of $330,000,000 in 1968-69. During 1968-69, payments were continued on current aircraft projects such as Tracker and Skyhawk for the R.A.N, and the F-111C, Orion, Mirage and Macchi for the RAAF., on other capital items including the Chas. F. Adams class (DDG) destroyers and the Oberon class submarines, and on the maintenance of forces overseas. The foregoing figures do not include defence expenditure in Papua and New Guinea or Defence Aid for Malaysia and Singapore. The decline in 1969-70 is due mainly to the approaching completion of some capital equipment projects. Defence expenditure overseas includes the following payments for material and equipment financed under credit arrangements with the United States of America authorised by the Loan (Defence) Acts 1966 and 1968.

General revenue grants are estimated to increase by a net $95,415,000; financial assistance grants payable under the States Grants Act 1965-1968, including a special payment of $15,500,000 to Western Australia in lieu of a special grant, are estimated to increase by $104,907,000; and the special grant to Tasmania is estimated to be $5,090,000 greater than in 1968-69. No provision has been made for payment of special revenue assistance in 1969-70; in 1968-69, an amount of $14,000,000 was provided to help the States meet budget difficulties. Specific purpose payments of a revenue nature are estimated to be $21,819,000 greater than in 1968-69. Estimated increases of $26,579,000 in payments to the States for education purposes and of $1,621,000 in sinking fund on State debts are partly offset by an estimated decline of $7,699,000 in natural disaster payments of a revenue nature. The increase in payments to the States for education purposes reflects the estimated cost-$16,000,00 0 in 1969-70-of the new policy proposal, announced in the Budget Speech, of support for the running costs of independent schools. Specific purpose payments of a capital nature are estimated to increase by $68,821,000. This includes estimated increases of $30,334,000 in payments to the States for education, $23,000,000 in Commonwealth Aid Roads grants payable under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969, and $11,500,000 in the payment to Tasmania to assist infinancinga hydro-electric scheme. It also includes S5,000,000 on account of the proposal, announced in the Budget Speech, to provide $25,000,000 overfiveyears commencing 1969-70 for the construction of self-contained dwelling units for certain single age pensioners. Other amounts to be made available to the States for new projects in 1969-70 include an estimated $5,750,000 for the Copeton Dam (New South Wales) and $1,500,000 for the Tailem Bend to Keith pipeline (South Australia). It is estimated that the amount to be made available to South Australia to assist infinancingthe construction of a natural gas pipeline will be $10,000,000 less than in 1968-69, and that natural disaster payments of a capital nature will be $5,789,000 less than in 1968-69. ITEM No. 3-STAT E WORKS AND HOUSING PROGRAMMES At its meeting in June 1969, the Loan Council approved a government borrowing programme for 1969-70 of which $758,000,000 was for State Works and Housing. The Loan Council approved borrowing' programmes of $372,000,000 for State semi-government and local authorities with programmes in excess of $300,000 in 1969-70, and $8,960,000 for Commonwealth authorities. The Loan Council also decided that no overall limit should be placed on borrowings by authorities for which the State Governments approve individual programmes of not more than $300,000 in 1969-70. The approved allocations for State Works and Housing in 1969-70 compare as follows with the actual allocations for 1968-69: CommonwealthFor housingfa) StatesNew South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania. .

Interest-Commonwealt h Inscribed Stock Act, etc. Interest payments under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act are estimated to be $4,538,000 greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. This increase is due mainly to ihe difference between the rates of interest at which the Commonwealth borrows overseas and the rates charged by the Commonwealth on advances made under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements. Higher interest rates offered in Australia on new securities issued by the Commonwealth, including Treasury Notes, are also expected to contribute lo the increase. There are some offsetting savings resulting from thc reduction of debt by the National Debt Sinking Fund and tbe Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. Sinking Fund. These payments represent a 4 per cent contribution on specified debt, as set out in the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966. The estimated decrease of $7,332,000 in contributions for 1969-70 reflects two factors. Net debt, on which the 4 per cent contribution is calculated, decreased by $210,000,000 in 1968-69, resulting in a decreased contribution of $8,400,000. Also, under the Act, the payment to the Sinking Fund from Consolidated Revenue is reduced by interest earned from investments of the Sinking Fund. Interest income is expected to be lower in 1969-70, and the estimated payment from Consolidated Revenue correspondingly greater.

The main factors giving rise to the estimated increase of 512,068,000 are: Australian National University. Payments to the Australian National University are estimated to be $2,454,000 higher than in 1968-69. These payments are based on the level of grants recommended by the Australian Universities Commission for the last calendar year of the 1967-1969 triennium, adjusted to take account of increases in academic and other salaries in that year, and on the level of grants recommended by the Commission for the first calendar year of the 1970-1972 triennium. Commonwealth Scholarship Schemes. The estimated increase of $3,701,000 includes $1,112,000 for post-graduate awards, $1,932,000 for university scholarships and $499,000 for advanced education scholarships. The increase in the cost of university and advanced education scholarships reflects an increase in the number of awards to apply from 1 January 1970, as announced in the Budget Speech. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Of the estimated increase of $3,019,000 to be paid to the Organization in 1969-70, approximately $2,200,000 is attributable to increases in salaries and administrative expenses and to research projects previously endorsed by the Government. Other. Ofthe estimated increase of $1,162,000 in these expenditures, $777,000 relates to the Canberra College of Advanced Education. This estimate is based on the level of expenditure estimated to be required in the last six months of 1969 and on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education as they affect thefirstcalendar year of the 1970-1972 triennium. Assisted Passage Schemes. In 1968-69, the number of migrants assisted was about 124,000. The programme for 1969-70 is for 119,000 assisted'migrants and, as a result, payments under the assisted-passage immigration schemes are estimated to be $603,000 less in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. Contributions to Commonwealth Hostels Limited. Contributions to Commonwealth Hostels Limited are estimated to be $365,000 greater in 1969-70, mainly because of an expected increase in salaries, the introduction of a welfare service, and increased heating costs. These estimated increases in expenditure will be partly offset by tariff increases. Stevedoring Industry. Expenditure under this heading represents the payment to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority of the proceeds of the stevedoring industry charge levied on the industry. This expenditure is estimated to be $1,422,000 less in 1969-70 than in 1968-69 as a result of an expected reduction in man-hours worked on the waterfront. Overseas Telecommunications Commission. In 1968-69, $600,000 was paid to the Commission in respect of the sale of Commission-owned land to the Western Australian State Government at a concessional price. No provision is made for a similar payment in 1969-70. Wheat Research. Wheat research isfinancedfrom the proceeds of an industry levy and Commonwealth contributions. Total payments in 1969-70 are expected to decline by $361,000, mainly because the proceeds of the levy are estimated to be less following the introduction of the quota arrangements. Wool Promotion and Research. Total payments are estimated to decline by $434,000. The Commonwealth contribution is estimated to be $1,116,000 less as carry-over commitments are smaller this year than last year. As, however, a larger wool clip is expected in 1969-70, the industry contribution is estimated to increase by $682,000. ' Canned Fruits-Promotion , etc. This expenditure isfinancedfrom the proceeds of industry levies and excise duties. Expenditure is estimated to decline by $1,695,000 in 1969-70, mainly as a result of the amendment in March 1969 of the Excise Tariff Act which provided for reductions in the level of excise payable on canned deciduous fruits. War Service Land Settlement. Payments to the agent States under the States Grants (.War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952-1953 for the acquisition and development of properties and for the provision of credit facilities to soldier settlers arefinancedfrom loan moneys and amounted to $4,294,000 in 1968-69. Of the estimated payment of $4,500,000 in 1969-70, approximately $4,005,000 will be in respect of the provision of credit facilities. The estimated increase in expenditure of $206,000 in 1969-70 arises mainly from the cost of work of a developmental nature in relation to farms allotted to ex-servicemen. The table which follows compares, on a State basis, estimated expenditure in 1969-70 with actual expenditure in 1967-68 and 1968-69. Education and Science Immigration Labour and National Service Postmaster-General's Primary Industry South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total .. In addition, administrative expenses under this scheme, to be met from annual appropriations, were $679,000 in 1968-69 and are estimated to total $760,000 in 1969-70. Aboriginal Advancement. Of the $10,000,000 appropriated to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account in 1968-69, $4,650,000 was paid out of the Trust Account to the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises under the authority of the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968. Against the balance of $5,350,000, expenditure on approved programmes of Aboriginal Advancement amounted to about $4,000,000, of which grants to the States totalled $3,650,000. It is not expected that any substantial supplementation of the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises will be required in 1969-70. An appropriatton of $7,160,000 js being sought for payment to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account ia 1969-70. This, together with the unexpended balance remaining in the Trust Account at 30 June 1969, will provide funds for expenditure of about $8,500,000 in 1969-70 on programmes against which expenditure of $4,000,000 was actually incurred in 1968-69. Other. Expenditure under this heading is estimated to increase by $4,508,000 in 1969-70, thc main reason being the provision of $4,000,000 for expenditure associated with the Australian pavilion at the Universal and International Exhibition to be held in Osaka, which is $2,741,000 more than expenditure in 1968-69. Provision has also been made for an increase of $1,286,000 for assistance to the arts, the greater part of the increase being in respect of the Commonwealth's support for the performing arts. Homes for Aged Persons. Expenditure under the Aged Persons Homes Act 1954-1967 is estimated to increase by $720,000 in 1969-70. The increase reflects provision for instalments of thc two largest grants yet made to eligible organizations under the Act. Superannuation. An increase in the number of recipients of pensions under the Superannuation Act 1922-1968 is estimated to result in an increase of $2,290,000 in Government contributions to the Superannuation Fund. Payments in respect of former Post Office employees are estimated to increase by SI,135,000, and payments in respect of other pensioners by $1,155,000. Currency-Transitio n to Decimal Currency. Payments associated with the transition to decimal currency are expected to decline by $701,000 as the conversion programme is virtually complete.

Comments on the main changes giving rise to this increase are set out below. Post Office. The increase of $24,500,000 in the provision of new capital for the Post Oflice arises mainly because the Post Office was able to achieve a greater improvement in its net cash operating surplus in 1968-69 than is expected in 1969-70 and because payments on some large equipment orders, which were expected lo fall due last year, now have to be met in 1969-70. Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It is estimated that the advance to the Commission will increase by $5,000,000 to $14,000,000 in 1969-70. Approximately $8,000,000 of the advance is to assist in financing the purchase of two container ships and other expenditure associated with the entry of the Australian National Line into the Australia-United Kingdom and Europe trade and the Australia-United States of America trade. The remaining $6,000,000 is to provide funds for shipbuilding and terminal development for the coastal trade and the ship being constructed for operation by the Line in the Australia-Japan trade. Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The estimated increase of $2,282,000 in the advance to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority reflects an increase in the incidence of contractual payments in respect of permanent plant and major contracts. War Service Homes. Expenditure on War Service Homes is estimated to increase by $5,000,000 mainly on account of the full-year effect of the increase in the maximum loan from $7,000 to $8,000, which waa announced in the 1968-69 Budget and came into effect in November 1968, and an expected rise in the number of applicants for loans. Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Limited. Advances to the Australian National Airlines Commission are estimated to decrease by $126,000 while those to Qantas Airways Limited are estimated to increase by $15,519,000. These advances are for expenditure on current aircraft-purchasing programmes.

Expenditure on Other Capital Works and Services is estimated to increase by $1,930,000 to $195,449,000 in 1969-70. This change is the net result of a number of variations. The estimated reduction of $1,733,000 in 1969-70 is attributable mainly to the lower incidence of payments in respect of equipment on long-term order. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The estimated increase of $415,000 is mainly for increased expenditure on ancillary computer equipment for the Organization. Other. Included in the estimated increase of $2,113,000 in 1969-70 are increases of $1,260,000 for works and services in respect of the Canberra College of Advanced Education, $737,000 for construction and associated works of the Anglo-Australian optical telescope and $117,000 forresidentialcolleges affiliated with the Australian National University. 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 + Increase Actual Actual Estimate Decrease («) on 1968-69 $'000 SO ' OO S'000 8""000 134 -«134 6,907 7,733 6,000 1.733 76 53 117 + 64 5,570 5,500 5,000 500 1,412 1,250 1.665 + ' 415 1,925 1,883 3,996 + 2,113 2,763 5.216 1,237 3,979 679 679 775 + 96 382 833 1,000 + 167 3,677 5,817 5,874 + 57 7,681 11,590 4,283 7,307 1,351 1,680 2,060 + 380 1,245 1,062 1,711 + 649 4,012 4,754 4,228 526 40 S3 85 + 1,809 32 13,667 12,191 14,000 + 83 88 110 + 22 325 1,299 1,150 149 833 838 42 796 26 484 430 54 3,170 1,123 1,123 530 826 320 506 . 2,326 2,671 1,815 856 3,641 2,304 1,240 1.064 22,274 28.990 29,500 + 510 3,217 2,254 3,000 + 746 813 344 391 + 47 44 2,678 3,200 + 522 2,467 4,357 5,430 + 1.073 770 478 1,040 + 562 5,293 6,404 5,648 756 48,951 51,014 54,781 + 3,767 27 168 40 128 62 1 + 1 27,250 26,820 35,147 + 8,327 246 84 84 173,737 193,519 195,449 + 1,930 Civil Aviation Education and Science Expenditure on capital works and services for the Department of External Affairs is estimated to decrease by $3,979,000 because of the completion of the Washington Chancery project. Expenditure on capital works and services by the Department of the Interior is estimated to decrease by $7,307,000 in 1969-70. There were exceptionally large outlays in 1968-69 which are not expected to be repeated this year. These outlays included $4,700,000 for the purchase of the Cromwell Building ia Melbourne and $600,000 for the acquisition of a building site in Hobart. Expenditure on Stage II of the computer complex for the Bureau of Meteorology is estimated to decrease by $836,000 as this project is near completion. Broadcasting and Television. The reduction of $526,000 in estimated expenditure is mainly the result of an estimated reduction of $861,000 in expenditure on equipment for the Radio Australia booster station at Darwin and an estimated increase of $400,000 in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's requirements for technical equipment. Railways. The estimated increase of $1,809,000 is mainly for rolling stock replacements and additions for the Central Australia and North Australia Railways to meet increasing traffic needs. Other factors contributing to this increase include the upgrading of the North Australia Railway to meet the requirements of heavy iron-ore traffic and the upgrading of the Trans-Australian Railway. Bureau of Census and Statistics. Expenditure is estimated to decrease by $1,123,000 as a result of tbe completion of expenditure on additional computer equipment. Plant and Equipment. Expenditure on plant and equipment by the Department of Works is estimated to decrease by $856,000 mainly because of a reduced workload in South Australia, particularly at Woomera, and a reduction in civil engineering projects in Papua and New Guinea. Civil Works Programme. Expenditure under the civil works programme is estimated to increase by $1,640,000 to $49,449,000 in 1969-70. The largest increase is $1,073,000 for the Department of the Interior, mainly for expenditure on the new Commonwealth Offices in Perth and for the commencement of the new Commonwealth Offices in Brisbane. Other estimated increases include $746,000 for expenditure on laboratory projects for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, $562,000 for the Department of Social Services in connection with alterations to Australia House in Sydney and for rehabilitation centres in Victoria and Western Australia, and $522,000 for new migrant hostels in New South Wales and Victoria for the Department of Immigration. Expenditure on Broadcasting and Television works is estimated to decrease by $1,064,000 because of the near-completion of the Radio Australia booster station at Darwin and of television studio works in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. Australian Capital Territory. Of the estimated increase of $3,767,000 in expenditure on capital works and services in the Australian Capital Territory in 1969-70, $2,452,000 relates to an increased allocation for the National Capital Development Commission's 1969-70 construction programme. Northern Territory. The mcreased provision for the Northern Territory in 1969-70 is mainly in respect of higher cash requirements for work in progress under the civil works programme such as Stage4 of the Darwin steam power station, sub-division works in Darwin and beef roads construction. It also includes provision for an increase in expenditure on new works including works for the Aboriginal education programme in 1969-70. External Affairs Interior Postmaster-General's Shipping and Transport Treasury Works Territories In the absence of any changes in existing taxes and other charges, it is estimated that total receipts in 1969-70 would amount to $6,967,447,000, which would be $838,837,000, or 13.7 per cent, more than total receipts in 1968-69. After taking into account revenue proposals announced in the Budget Speech, total receipts in 1969-70 are estimated at $6,953,547,000, an increase of $824,937,000, or 13.5 per cent. In 1968-69, total receipts increased by $672,318,000, or 12.3 per cent. That increase included the effects of changes in taxation rates and other charges announced in the 1968-69 Budget, which were estimated to yield about $94,400,000 during 1968-69. The following table compares estimated receipts in 1969-70 with actual receipts in the two preceding financial years.

Total taxation revenue in 1969-70 is estimated to be $6,236,800,000. This is an increase of $799,540,000, or 14.7 per cent over 1968-69. The main changes in estimated taxation collections are discussed in the following notes. Customs Duty. Collections of customs duty in 1969-70 are estimated at $395,000,000, $47,254,000 more than in 1968-69. This estimate allows for a further increase in recorded imports in 1969-70 and for some further increase in the proportion of imports dutiable at higher rates. Excise Duty. The estimate of excise duty collections is based on the assumption that consumer spending wiil continue to increase strongly in 1969-70.

In 1968-69, excise collections increased by $47,456,000, or 5.6 per cent. The main components of the estimate for 1969-70 are as follows: Beer Tobacco products Motor spirit Other Sales Tax. Sales tax collections are estimated at $567,000,000 in 1969-70, an increase of $72,937,000, or 14.8 per cent. The estimate assumes that the value of sales of goods subject to sales tax will increase at a more rapid rate in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. Collections in 1969-70 will also reflect the full-year effects of the increase in the general rate of sales tax from IH per cent to 15 per cent announced in the 1968-69 Budget. Income Tax-Individuals . It is estimated that, on the basis of existing legislation, collections of income tax from individuals in 1969-70 would total $2,855,000,000, an increase of $475,534,000, or 20.0 per cent, on collections in 1968-69. (a) Pay-as-you-earn Instalment Deductions. On the basis of existing legislation, gross pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions in 1969-70 are estimated at $2,475,000,000, or $351,143,000 more than in 1968-69. In 1968-69, average weekly earnings increased by about 7.25 per cent and average employment by more than 3 percent. Average employment in 1969-70 is assumed to be 3 per cent greater than in 1968-69. For the purpose of setting down a figure for pay-as-you-earn collections, an increase of 7 per cent has been assumed as the mcrease in average earnings in 1969-70 compared with 1968-69. This assumption, which takes account of therisein average weekly earnings which has already occurred, does not imply that the trend in earnings from this point of time can be forecast with any reliability. Nor does its use imply that it is a Budget objective. Refunds of tax instalment deductions are estimated to increase by $43,432,000 so that, at existing rates of taxation, net payas-you-earn collections are estimated to increase by $307,710,000 to $2,035,000,000. (b) Other. Collections on assessments of individuals are estimated to increase by $167,824,000 to $820,000,000 on the basis of existing legislation. This reflects the increase in incomes of primary producers in 1968-69 (about 37.5 per cent), following recovery from the drought in 1967-68, and increases in 1968-69 in incomes of other individuals subject to provisional tax. These 1968-69 incomes are subject to tax in 1969-70. The measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce income tax collections from individuals by $13,200,000 in 1969-70 and $21,000,000 in a full year. After allowing for these changes, it is estimated that income tax collections from individuals will increase by $462,334,000 to $2,841,800,000 in 1969-70. Income Tax-Companies . Incomes of companies in 1968-69, which are subject to tax in 1969-70, are estimated to have increased by about 13 per cent following an increase of about 15 per cent in 1967-68. At existing rates of tax, collections of income tax from companies in 1969-70 are estimated at $1,140,000,000, an increase of $133,457,000, or 13.3 per cent. Pay-roll Tax. On the basis of the assumptions adopted as regards employment and average weekly earnings for the estimate of gross pay-as-you-earn collections, it is estimated that gross pay-roll tax collections will total $260,000,000 in 1969-70, an increase of $25,476,000. As pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme are estimated to increase by $8,043,000, net pay-roll tax collections are estimated to increase by $17,432,000 to $223,000,000 in 1969-70. Estate Duty. The estimate of estate duty collections reflects the expected growth in the value of estate duty returns available for assessment in 1969-70. On the basis of existing 1968-69 1969-70 Preliminary Estimate Change $'000 $'000 S'000 355,001 373,748 +18,747 240,928 251,063 +10,135 244,763 265,449 +20,686 60,322 69,740 + 9,418 901,014 960,000 + 58,986 legislation, estate duty collections are estimated to increase by $2,274,000 to $63,000,000. As the proposals announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce collections by $1,000,000 in 1969-70 and $5,300,000 in a full year, collections in 1969-70, after allowing for these proposals, are estimated at $62,000,000, an increase of $1,274,000.

The main variations from 1968-69 are: Air Navigation Charges. It is estimated that collections from these charges will increase by $2,076,000 in 1969-70 as a result of growth in air traffic, the full-year effects of increased rates applicable from 1 January 1969 and the increase in charges for domestic traffic announced in the Budget Speech. The latter increase, which is to apply from 1 January 1970, is estimated to yield $700,000 in a full year. War Service Homes-Repayment s of Interest and Principal. The estimated increase in revenue of $2,072,000 largely reflects an expected rise in the discharge of outstanding advances under the scheme. Mainly because of expected lower returns from tbe sale of surplus property and materials, revenue is estimated to decrease by $1,640,000 in 1969-70. Labour and National Service Stevedoring Industry Charge. Collections are estimated to decrease by $1,130,000. It is expected that a lower number of man-hours will be worked on Australian wharves during 1969-70, mainly because of the increased volume of goods being handled through container ships. National Development Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority-Interest. Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority interest payments to the Commonwealth are estimated to increase by $2,401,000 in 1969-70 mainly as a result of the full-year effects of capital expenditure brought to account on 1 January 1969. The Authority also expects to bring Blowering Dam expenditure to account on 1 December 1969. War Service Land Settlement. Revenue from War Service Land Settlement is estimated to decrease by $2,711,000 largely because of an estimated decline of $1,644,000 in repayments by settlers. In 1968-69, receipts were affected by heavy repayments in full of settlers' advances. Shipping and Transport Commonwealth Railways. The estimated increase in the net receipts of the Commonwealth Railways is $2,359,000. Gross receipts are estimated to increase by $3,048,000 because of an expected increase in traffic on the Trans-Australian Railway and increased carriage of iron-ore on the North AustraUa Railway. Working expenses, which are offset against gross receipts, are expected to increase by $689,000. Other. The estimated increase of $2,951,000 includes $1,487,000 of interest to be received on loans made to the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, and an increase of $1,008,000 in repayments under the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act 1961. Distribution of International Monetary Fund Net Income. In October 1968, Australia received $1,052,000 as its share of part of the net income of the International Monetary Fund. This distribution of income was made by the Fund to its members who were in a 'net creditor' position in the year ended 30 April 1968. No receipt of income from the Fund is expected in 1969-70. Overseas Telecommunications Commission-Repayment of Advances. In 1968-69, the Commission repaid Treasury advances to the extent of 85,000,000; no advances are to be repaid io 1969-70. Civil Aviation Housing Interior Primary Industry Treasury Overseas Telecommunications Commission-Payment in the Nature of a Dividend. It is estimated that a payment of $6,400,000 in the nature of a dividend will be received from the Commission in 1969-70 in lieu of interest payments on Treasury advances. Post Office-Interest on Capital. It is estimated that, as a result of the growth in the amount of capital advanced to the Post Office, interest from the Post Office will increase by $12,409,000 in 1969-70. Off-shore Petroleum Royalties. It is estimated that, under the off-shore petroleum legislation, $2,000,000 will be received as the Commonwealth's share of royalties on production in Bass Strait in 1969-70. Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duties. Stamp duties on a range of instruments and transactions within and connected with the Australian Capital Territory were introduced to operate from 1 July 1969, and are estimated to yield $1,200,000 in 1969-70. Repayments of Principal-Australia n National Airlines Commission. Repayments by the Australian National Airlines Commission are estimated to increase by $1,334,000 in 1969-70, reflecting loans drawn in 1968-69. Repayments of Principal-Qantas Airways Limited. Repayments in 1969-70 by Qantas Airways Limited are estimated to decline by $1,206,000 because the repayment of its 19621968 loan was completed in 1968-69. The estimated decrease of $752,000 is partly the result of estimated lower proceeds from the disposal of plant in 1969-70. In addition, accumulated profits from industrial undertakings in the Australian Capital Territory were paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1968-69; no such payments are expected to be received in 1969-70 In 1968-69, the receipts of the Department of the Navy included refunds of expenditure incurred in previous years on the purchase of communications equipment and armament in the United States of America; largely because no allowance for refunds has been made in 1969-70, the Budget estimate is $1,165,000 less than in 1968-69. Receipts of the Department of the Army are estimated to decline by $1,897,000 in 1969-70. These receipts were inflated in 1968-69 by a large refund from the Commissioner of Taxation. No similar refund is expected in 1969-70. Receipts in 1968-69 included a refund of payments on aircraft purchases in the United States of America amounting to $1,300,000. Largely because no allowance has been made for a similar refund in 1969-70, the estimate of receipts is $1,832,000 lower. Other. Revenue under this heading is estimated to be $6,340,000 less in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. Receipts in 1968-69 included proceeds from the transfer of Edinburgh airfield to the RAAF. Australian Capital Territory. An estimated increase of $2,202,000 in collections of premiums on lease sales is the main reason for the estimated increase of $4,196,000 in revenue from the Australian Capital Territory. Other estimated increases include $1,433,000 from municipal-type rates and land rents levied throughout the Territory and rents paid by tenants of Government-owned dwellings. Interest and capital repayments on advances to the Australian Capital Territory Housing Commissioner and local building societies, together with proceeds from sales of Government houses, are estimated to increase by $858,000 in 1969-70. Northern Territory. The estimated increase of $1,186,000 in revenue from the Northern Territory includes an increase of $588,000 for land rent and rents paid by tenants of Administration-owned dwellings. Works Navy Army Air Supply Territories Details of the estimated receipts of the National Debt Sinking Fund are shown in the following table. CommonwealthPercentage contributionsConsolidated Revenue Fund Interest on investments Repayments of Loan Fund advances fbr housing .. Other repayments Total Receipts from Commonwealth.. Receipts in respect of State DebtContributions by Commonwealth Contributions by States Interest on investments Total Receipts Percentage Contributions-ConsoUdated Revenue Fund and Interest on investments. The percentage contributions from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the National Debt Sinking Fund and the interest income of the Sinking Fund are estimated to total 829,900,000 in 1969-70, $8,400,000 less than in 1968-69. This amount is equal to 4 per cent on net Commonwealth debt at 30 June 1969 subject to contribution. The reduction of $8,400,000 is due to a fall of $210,000,000 in 1968-69 in net debt subject to contribution. The National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966-1967 provides for the contribution from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be reduced by an amount equal to income from investments of Commonwealth balances in the Fund. This income is estimated to be $1,102,000 lower than in 1968-69 and the contribution from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be correspondingly greater because of the sale of investments tofinanceredemptions. Repayments of Loan Fund Advances for Housing. Repayments to the Sinking Fund of housing advances to the States under the various Housing Agreement Acts increase with the growth in these advances. They are estimated to be $1,154,000 greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. Other Repayments. Other repayments to the Sinking Fund include repayments made under the Railway Agreement (Queensland) Acts 1961 and 1968, the Loan (Emergency Wheat Storage) Act 1955 and the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act 1945. Receipts in respect of State Debt Contributions by Commonwealth and States. Contributions by the Commonwealth and the States in respect of State debt are estimated to be $6,176,000 greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. This increase reflects the continued growth of State debt. Interest on Investments. The increased interest income on investment of the States' Sinking Fund balances reflects the accumulation of these balances to meet large redemptions in July and August 1969. NET INCREASE IN OTHER BALANCES OF THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE TRUST FUND The estimated increase U 1969-70 of $7,853,000 is attributable mainly to an expected increase in the interest on investments held by the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 4Increase Actual Actual Estimate Decrease on 1968-69 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 25,421 32,798 25,500 7,298 7.665 5,502 4,400 1,102 11,981 13,046 14.200 + 1,154 1,792 1,897 2,000 + 103 46,859 53,243 46.100 7,143 20,387 21,619 23,240 + 1,621 73,702 78,945 83,500 + 4,555 68 94 870 + 964 141,016 153,713 153,710 3 Commonwealth In 1969-70, Commonwealth receipts are estimated to be less than Commonwealth expenditures by $30 million. The estimated deficit compares with deficits of $385 million in 1968-69 and $642 million in 1967-68. The following table shows how the deficits in 1967-68 and 1968-69 were financed.

(o) Includes State domestic loan raisings. tc) Includes amounts available to the Commonwealth from funds obtained from coinage and bullion transactions, amounts borrowed by Commonwealth trust accounts, and amounts available from moneys held in trust. W) Commonwealth cash balances changed by less than $500,000 in each year. In 1968-69, $142 million was available from overseas sources towards the financing of the deficit Net drawings under the credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States of America were $55 million; total drawings amounted to $91 million, and repayments to $37 million. Apart from the defence credit arrangements, gross loan raisings overseas amounted to $183 million; after allowing for redemptions and repurchases amounting to $96 million, a net amount of $88 million was available from these raisings. Borrowings overseas to finance advances to Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission for the purchase of aircraft amounted to $15 million, while repayments of borrowings of this type amounted to $27 million, exceeding the borrowings by $12 million. The proceeds of other loans overseas amounted to $169 million, exceeding redemptions and other expenditure on the reduction of debt overseas by $100 million. After providing $5 million tofinancedrawings in Australian currency from the Internationa) Monetary Fund, an amount of $248 millionremainedto befinancedin Australia. Gross proceeds from loans raised in Australia (including $13 million from State domestic loan raisings) amounted to $616 million; and redemptions and other expenditure on the reduction of debt amounted to $235 million. There was also a net reduction of $68 million in the amount of Treasury Notes on issue. Thus, the net amount produced by these loan operations in Australia was $313 million. An amount of $62 million was available from otherfinancingtransactions, including drawings on balances available to the Commonwealth and amounts available in respect of coinage transactions. These transactions meant that $127 million was available to redeem Treasury Bills on issue to the Reserve Bank. 1967-68 1968-69 S million $ million 118 55 14 88 132 142 -59 5 297 381 184 -68 480 313 37 62 51 -127 642 385 In 1968-69, very large amounts of liquidity were injected into the domestic economy from overseas transactions and through Rural Credits advances. As far as the Budget was concerned, receipts in Australia, which subtract from uquidity, were some 8200 million greater than domestic expenditures, which add to liquidity. This domestic surplus, whicb followed a sniall domestic deficit in 1967-68, helped to moderate the build-up in liquidity in 1968-69. Holdings of Commonwealth securities outside the banking system increased in 1968-69 by $181 million, following an increase of $240 million in 1967-68. This also helped to absorb some of the increase in liquidity arising from other sources. With redemption ot $127 million of Treasury Bills on issue to the Reserve Bank and the net sale of $67 million of other Commonwealth securities by the Reserve Bank, there was little net change in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the banking system in 1968-69. In 1967-68, holdings of securities by the banking system increased by $291 million. The following table shows changes in holdings of Commonwealth securities redeemable in Australia in 1967-68 and in 1968-69. Reserve Bank-Treasury Bills, . Other Trading banks Savings banks Total-bankin g system . . Other(6) TotaI(W (a) Figures for banking system are in terms of face value of securities; the total is in terms of cash value of securities; and an adjustment for the difference between face value and cash value of securities is included in other changes in holdings of securities. (o) Excludes subscriptions to special loans, cancellations and changes in internal Treasury Bills. In 1969-70, the Commonwealth's deficit is estimated to be $30 million. Drawings under the credit arrangements for purchases of defence equipment in the United States of America are expected to be $51 million while repayments are expected to be $52 million. Maturing securities of other overseas loans, which will have to be redeemed in 1969-70, and other payments to reduce indebtedness overseas may amount to about $200 million as compared with $96 million in 1968-69. It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount that might be raised by new borrowings abroad. In view, however, of the present state of international money markets, it is unlikely that it will be possible to raise in 1969-70 as much as the record amount of $183 million obtained in 1968-69. There may, therefore, be net repayments overseas in 1969-70, in contrast to the net borrowings of $142 million in 1968-69. On that basis, the amount to befinancedin Australia would be greater than the estimated deficit of $30 million. Net loan proceeds and the change in the Treasury Note issue in Australia cannot be estimated in. advance with any degree of assurance. Nor is it possible to predict what changes will occur in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the public, on the one hand, and by the banking system, on the other. These will reflect monetary and other developments during the course of the year. It is relevant, however, that at the beginning of 1969-70 the 1967-68 1968-69 Preliminary (a) (a) $ million i million + 51 127 + 175 67 7 + 164 .. + 72 + 35 + 291 + 5 + 240 + 181 + 531 + 186 value of maturing securities held in non-official hands amounted to about $486 million, whereas the correspondingfigureat the commencement of 1968-69 was $278 million. This suggests that redemptions could be substantially greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. In the cash and conversion loan in July, new cash proceeds were only slightly greater than redemptions of maturing securities. The economy remains highly liquid as a result of the build-up in liquidity in 1968-69. Further additions to Uquidity in the private sector, both from overseas transactions and from net additions to Rural Credits advances during the year, are expected. Against this, with the reduction in the Budget deficit in 1969-70, there will be an increase in the Commonwealth's domestic surplus (the excess of the Commonwealth's domestic receipts over its domestic expenditures). On present estimates, the increase in the domestic surplus will be about $300 million. This will help to offset the effects of factors, including bank lending, likely to add to domestic liquidity during the year. How holdings of Commonwealtb securities by the non-bank public may change is not predictable; any increase in sucb holdings would also operate to subtract from liquidity in the domestic economy but any decrease would add to liquidity. The overall trends in liquidity during the year will depend on many factors, in addition to the Budget and the Commonwealth's debt operations, which affect the monetary situation. On balance, however, it seems likely that any increase in the money supply this year will be smaller than last year. In 1968-69, the Commonwealth Budget deficit was $385 million. This was $161 million less than the Budget estimate. Expenditures, receipts and the deficit in 1968-69 compare as follows with the Budget estimates: Deficit (a) Because of an accounting change, thefiguresshown above for the 1968-69 Budget estimates of expenditures and receipts are both $14 miltion less than the estimates published in the Statements attached to the 1968-69 Budget Speech. The estimated deficit is unchanged. This accounting change is reflected in the tables of Expenditures and Receipts set out in later sections of this Statement. The differences between actual expenditures in 1968-69 and the Budget estimates for that year are summarised in the following table.

Expenditure on Defence Services was $52 million less than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on the purchase and manufacture of aircraft was $43 million less than estimated as a result of savings on Orion aircraft and rephasing of payments on Fl1 IC aircraft. In addition, there was a shortfaU of $15 million in expenditure on equipment and stores for the RAAF. attributable to delays in delivery and in ordering. Defence Aid for Malaysia and Singapore was $3 million less than estimated and, because of reduced activity, there was a shortfaU of $2 million in expenditure on the British/Australian Joint Project. Expenditure on pay and allowances of members of the Forces and on other salaries and administrative expenses was $10 million greater than estimated. Payments to or for the States. In total, these payments were a net $9 milUon less than the Budget estimate. There were, however, some sizable variations in a number of items. Payments of general revenue grants were $28 milUon greater than the Budget estimate. Fmancial assistance grants were $14 milUon greater, mainly because average wages for the year ended March 1969 were higher than had been estimated at the time of the Budget. In addition, special revenue assistance totalling $14 milUon, for which no allowance was made in the Budget, was paid to the States to assist them in meeting budget difficulties is 1968-69. Specific purpose payments of a revenue nature were about $3 milUon greater than the Budget estimate, mainly because natural disaster relief payments were greater than had been estimated. There was a net shortfall of $40 million in expenditure on specific purpose payments of a capital nature. Assistance to Tasmania for a hydro-electric scheme was $11 miUion less than the Budget estimate, capital grants to the States for universities $7 milUon less, the amounts provided for assistance to teachers coUeges $4 million less, and payments for railway projects $4 miUion less. Advances to South AustraUa to assist in the financing of the construction of a natural gas pipeline were $4 million less than estimated, mainly because of the use of alternative sources offinancefor the project. Payments in respect of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme were $3 million greater than the Budget estimate. National Welfare Fund. The payment to the National Welfare Fund was $2 milUon greater than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits (including benefits for pensioners) was $8 million greater, reflecting an increase in the number of prescriptions issued. The largest shortfall was $6 million in expenditure on age and invaUd pensions, largely the result of a smaller-than-estimated increase in the number of pensioners. Departmental Running Expenses. Departmental Running Expenses were $16 million greater than the Budget estimate, largely as a result of the decision of the Arbitration Commission in the National Wage Case and other increases in wage and salary awards made after the Budget was presented. Increases in staff numbers and in general administrative costs also contributed to the increase. External Economic Aid (including Papua and New Guinea). Expenditure on externa) economic aid was $6 million less than the Budget estimate. Shortfalls included $6 million in payments to the International Development Association, $2 milUon in expenditures under the Colombo Plan, most of which related to Indonesia, and $1 million in expenditure on the Indus Waters Scheme. Payments to the Asian Development Bank were $4 million greater than estimated. Commonwealth Payments to Industry. Commonwealth Payments to Industry were $5 miUion less than the Budget estimate. Payments of phosphate fertilizers bounty and nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy were, respectively, $5 million and $3 million less than the Budget estimate. An aUowance of $1 miUion was made in the Budget for the marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme, but no expenditure was incurred in 1968-69. Payments of raw cotton bounty and net shipbuilding subsidy payments were $3 million and $2 million, respectively, greater than estimated. Other Expenditures. Expenditures under this heading were $11 million greater than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on assisted-passage immigration schemes exceeded the Budget estimate by $5 miUion because of a greater-than-estimated intake of assisted migrants in 1968-69. Payments to the Stevedoring Industry Authority and expenditure on wool promotion and research were each $2 million greater than had been estimated. Advances for Capital Purposes. In total, these payments fell short of the Budget estimate by $27 million. The advance to the Post Office was $18 million less because of operating economies and reduced commitments due to the deferment of payment for some large equipment orders. Advances to Qantas Airways Limited and to the Australian National Airlines Commission were $6 million and $3 million, respectively, less than had been estimated. The main differences between actual receipts in 1968-69 and the Budget estimates for the year are shown in the following table. Taxation RevenueCustoms Duty Excise Duty. .

Collections of customs duty exceeded the Budget estimate by $18 million because the proportion of imports subject to comparatively high rates of duty was larger than had been expected at the time of the Budget. Excise Duty. Excise duty collections were $1 million greater than estimated. Although the increase in clearances of beer, tobacco products and diesel fuel was greater, the increase in clearances of motor spirit was smaller than had been estimated. Income Tax-individuals-Pay-as-you-earn . Net collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions exceeded the Budget estimate by about $19 million. Gross collections were $45 million greater, mainly because the rate of increase in average earnings was greater than the rate assumed for purposes of the Budget estimate of P.A.Y.E. collections, but 1968-69 1968-69 Change on Budget Actual Budget Estimate Estimate$ million $ million $ million .. .. .. 330 348 + 18 900 901 + 1 -*«»« *49S 494 1 2,079 2,124 + 45 .. .. .. 370 397 + 27 1,709 1,727 + 19 .. .. .. .. .. 670 652 17 970 1,007 + 37 .. 24 28 + 4 4 4 .. 227 235 + 8 ., ,. 30 29 1 197 206 + 9 60 61 + 1 9 9 ., ., 5.367 5,437 + 71 457 482 + 26 153 154 + 1 54 55 + I 6.030 6,129 + 98 refunds of P.A.Y.E. collections were $27 million greater than estimated. The latter appears to have been the product of failure by employers to adjust tax instalment deductions from 1 October 1967 to take account of the increases in dependants' allowances introduced in the 1967-68 Budget, and of a larger-than-expected increase in the average size of claims for other concessional deductions in 1968-69. Income Tax-Individuals-CoUections on Assessments. Collections on assessments of individuals fell short of the estimate by $17 million. Incomes earned by primary producers in 1967-^8-whic h were taxable in 1968-69-decline d more than had been estimated and concessional deductions from 1967-68 incomes were greater than had been estimated.

Pay-roll Tax. Increases during 1968-69 in employment and in average earnings were greater than had been assumed for the purpose of the Budget estimate, with theresultthat gross pay-roll tax collections in 1968-69 were $8 miUion more than the Budget estimate. As rebates of pay-roll tax under the export incentive scheme were $1 million less than the Budget estimate, net pay-roll tax collections exceeded the estimate by $9 miUion. Other Revenue. Other Revenue exceeded the Budget estimate by $26 miUion. Revenue from the Defence departments was $7 million greater than the estimate,receiptsfrom the AustraUan Capital Territory $5 miUion greater, mainly on account of higher-than-estimated premiums on lease sales, and revenue from the Department of the Interior was $3 miUion greater. A number of other items exceeded the Budget estimate by relatively small amounts. The deficit of $385 million in 1968-69 wasfinancedas follows: Overseas Credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States of America (net).. Other overseas borrowings (net) (a) Funds provided for International Monetary Fund drawings in Australian currency AustraUa Net proceeds of loans raised in Australia^) Net change in Treasury Notes on issue Otherfinancingtransactions (net) (c) Residual financingBorrowings from Reserve Bank Use of cash balances Total Financing Transactions (a) Includes borrowings and repayments on behalf of Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission. (b) Includes State domestic loan raisings. (c) Includes amounts available to the Commonwealth from funds obtained from coinage and bullion transactions, amounts borrowed by Commonwealtb trust accounts, and amounts available from moneys held in trust. id) Less than $500,000. The foUowing are explanations of thefinancingtransactions: Credit Arrangements for Defence Purchases in the United States of America. In 1965 and 1966, arrangements were made for thefinancingon extended payment terms of defence equipment in the United States of America. These arrangements were authorised by the Loan (Defence) Act 1966 and by the Loan (Defence) Act 1968. In 1968-69,financeamounting to $91 miUion was obtained under these arrangements. Repayments amounted to $37 miUion. $ million 55 88 142 5 381 68 313 62 127 (d) 385 Other Overseas Borrowings. Three public cash loans raised overseas in 1968-69-on e in Switzerland for Sw Fr60 million and two in Germany totalling DM300 millionyielded $79 million. In addition, two private loans were raised in Germany yielding $67 miUion. Drawings on aircraft loans amounted to $15 milUon and proceeds of $22 milUon were received from an Export-Import Bank loan. Securities were repurchased to the value of $13 milUon in London and $18 miUion in New York. The only overseas loan which matured in 1968-69 was a Swiss loan, raised in 1953, for Sw Fr60 million, which was paid off at a cost of nearly $13 million. Repayments of $24 miUion were also made on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and $1 milUon was repaid on borrowings from the Netherlands and Canada. Repayments on aircraft loans amounted to $27 million, so that net other overseas borrowings amounted to $88 miUion. Funds Provided for I.M.F. Drawings in Australian Currency. An amount of $5 milUon was provided in 1968-69 tofinancedrawings of Australian currency from the International Monetary Fund. The Budget estimates made no provision for the transactions. Loan Raisings in Australia. Four Commonwealth public cash loans were raised in AustraUa in 1968-69. After excluding loan proceeds received before 30 June 1968, but including receipts in 1968-69 from outstanding instalments and advance subscriptions received up to 30 June 1969, proceeds from pubUc cash loans in the year were $529 milUon. Cash proceeds of $73 million from the sale of Special Bonds during the year, and proceeds of $13 miUion from State domestic raisings, brought total borrowing proceeds to $616 million during 1968-69. Of the $548 milUon securities maturing in AustraUa (other than Special Bonds) which were offered for conversion in 1968-69, securities amounting to $150 million were redeemed. In addition, redemptions of Special Bonds of all Series amounted to $57 million. Other redemptions, market repurchases and contractual repayments in Australia amounted to $28 miUion. Total redemptions and repurchases in Australia were $235 milUon, so that net loan raisings in Australia in 1968-69 were $381 million. Net Change in Treasury Notes on Issue. There was a net decrease of $68 milUon in Treasury Notes on issue during 1968-69. At 30 June 1969, Treasury Notes on issue amounted to $205,419,000. Other Financing Transactions. In 1968-69, an amount of $62 milUon was available from these sources. The largest item was an amount of $51 million in respect of coinage transactions, principally on account of the sale overseas of silver recovered from withdrawn coin. Residual Financing. As the amount available from the above-mentioned financing transactions exceeded the deficit by $127 milUon, this amount was applied to redeem Treasury Bills on issue to the Reserve Bank. Treasury Bills on issue, at 30 June 1969 amounted to $14 million. The presentation of receipts and outlay in national accounting form facilitates the analysis of relationships between the Budget and the economy as a whole. The following table summarizes in this form the actual outcome in 1968-69 and the prospective outcome for 1969-70. A more detailed table appears on page 42( ). Net expenditure on goods and services Transfer payments and net advances Total outlay . . Taxation Other receipts Total receipts Deficit The estimated increase of $526 million in total outlay in 1969-70 is $151 million greater than the actual increase of $375 miUion in 1968-69. In percentage terms the estimates imply an increase of 8.0 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of 6.1 per cent in 1968-69. Total receipts are estimated to increase by $881 million or 14.3 percent in 1969-70 compared with an increase of $632 million or 11.4 per cent in 1968-69. The effects on the economy of particular classes of outlays and receipts, within these totals, differ significantly one from another. The more important distinctions for purposes of assessing the impUcations of the Commonwealth's transactions for demand and incomes within Australia and for the balance of payments are considered in the following sections. ( ) A Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled 'National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority l Receipts and Expenditure', being published concurrently with the Budget, provides corresponding data for Commonwealtb authorities outside the Budget and additional information on various aspects of tbe national accounting presentation employed in this Statement. 1 Incr sases 1968-69 1969-70 Actual Estimate 1967-68 to 1968-69 to 1968-69 1969-70 $ million $ million S million $ million Outhy 1,925 1,949 139 24 4,634 5,136 235 502 6,559 7,085 375 526 Receiftts 5,489 6,289 572 800 685 766 60 81 6,174 7,055 632 881 Deficit 385 30 257 I 356 Payments in AustraUa and overseas On the outlay side of the Budget there is an important distinction between payments made within Australia and payments made overseas. The immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments!""); such outlays must therefore be deducted from total outlay as a step in the process of assessing the impact of the Budget on the domestic economy in the year immediately ahead. This is done in the following table: Total outlay Zeis-Overseas outlay Domestic outlay The table shows that the greater increase in total outlay this year is attributable to the trend in the domestic component. Following a decrease of $44 million in 1968-69, overseas outlays are estimated to decrease by a further $48 million in the current year.( ) After deducting overseas outlay the estimated increase in domestic outlay is $574 million compared with an actual increase of $419 million in 1968-69. This represents an estimated increase of 9.6 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of 7.6 per cent in 1968-69. Although the increase in Budget outlays within Australia is estimated to be considerably greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69, it is again substantially smaller than the concurrent increase in receipts. The implications of the domestic surplus for liquidity conditions are discussed in Statement No. 4. Composition of domestic outlay Within the domestic component of outlay there is a further basic distinction to be made between expenditure on goods and services, and transfers and advances from the Budget. Expenditure on goods and services adds directly to demand within the economy (gross national expenditure), while the impact on demand of transfers and advances depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients.( ) The following table compares, for each main component of domestic outlay, the estimated increase in 1969-70 with the actual increase in 1968-69. (') Such payments do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Payments within Australia may add indirectly to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content. Although it is not possible to makereliableestimates of the import content or Commonwealth expenditure within Australia, the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and Ihe next. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth mayfluctuatewidely between one year and another. (*) The main overseas components are shown separately in Table2 on page 9 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, entitled 'National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure', being published concurrently wilh thc Budget. (') Whether payments from the Commonwealth Budget are themselves a source of demand for domestic resources, or add to demand indirectly by transferring purchasing power to other public authorities or Ih: private sector, the initial impact on expenditure of Budget outlays can be expected to induce further increases which are financed out or the incomes earned in meeting the initial change in demand. As the relative sizes of the total increase in demand in two successive years would depend largely on the relative sizes of the initial increases which supported them, these 'multiplier' effects are not considered explicitly in the discussion which follows. 1 Increases 1968-69 1969-70 Actual Estimate 1967-68 to 1968-69 to 1968-69 1969-70 $ million $ million S million $ million 6,559 7,085 375 526 600 552 -44 -48 5,959 6,533 419 574 2 3 Net expenditure on goods and servicesWar and defence Other current expenditure . . Capital expenditure Total Transfer payments and net advancesto States Cash benefits to persons Post office Other Total Total domestic outlay The estimated percentage increase in domestic expenditure on goods and services is substantially less than in 1968-69. This is true also of each of the main components distinguished in the table-wa r and defence, other current expenditure and capital expenditure. A considerably larger increase than in 1968-69 is expected in domestic transfer payments aud net advances. As noted above, the impact of these payments on demand and incomes depends on the effects on the spending of the recipients. Grants and advances to the States are estimated to rise by 11.4 per cent in 1969-70, compared with 5.3 per cent in 1968-69. The comparison is affected to some extent by sugar industry assistance amounting to $24 million in 1967-68; apart from this item, the increase in payments to the States was 6.6 per cent in 1968-69. The much larger rise in these payments in 1969-70 will increase the funds available to finance the expenditures of the States and their authorities, which are predominantly expenditures on goods and services. Cash benefits to persons are estimated to increase by 13.2 per cent in 1969-70 compared with 8.7 per cent in 1968-69. For the purpose of judging the influence of such payments on rates of income or expenditure within a year, these increases should be adjusted to remove the effects of variations in the incidence of pay-days and to allow for the 'full-year* effects of changes in rates of benefitf, ). After these adjustments, the estimated increase in cash benefits in 1969-70 is 12.5 per cent compared with 9.9 per cent in 1968-69. These payments would largely be spent by the recipients on goods and services. The larger increase in the advance to the Post Office is attributable in part to a smaller prospective increase in its operating surplus in 1969-70. To this extent, the figures in the table cannot be taken as an indication of the trend in expenditure by the Post Office on goods and services'^). (') A table showing how this adjustment is derived appears on page 10 or the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin being published concurrently with the Budget. (') The capital expenditure of the Tost Office is included with that of other authorities in the non-budget sub-sector. See Table7 ot the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin being published concurrently with the Budget, Increases in Domestic Outlay$ million Per cent 1967-68 to 1968-69 to 1967-68 to 1968-69 to 1968-69 1969-70 1968-69 1969-70 38 39 8.0 5.0 66 61 13.1 10.7 13 12 9.1 6.7 140 112 10.0 7.3 103 234 5.3 11.4 112 185 8.7 13.2 2 24 1.0 11.7 62 18 8.7 2.3 279 461 6.7 10.4 419 574 7.6 9.6 1 Composition of Receipts On the receipts side of the Budget, there are also differences in the significance which different classes of receipts may have for prospective trends in the economy. The distinction drawn on the outlay side between transactions within Australia and transactions overseas does not have the same practical importance here. With relatively few exceptions, the budget receipts are derived from within Australia. Another distinction is between those receipts which will emerge as by-products of evolving trends in incomes and spending in the economy and those which will not be closely related to these trends but will be, as it were, superimposed on them. The former, being the result of prospective trends in economic activities, cannot be regarded as an independent factor influencing those trendsf ). The latter can be regarded as a source of influence on those trends. This distinction is not, in practice, an easy one to make. For the most part, gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, fall within the former class. The other class is most clearly exemplified by new revenue measures which involve changes in rates of taxation or in other charges. The position as regards taxation collections from companies and individuals subject to provisional tax is somewhat ambiguous; as noted below, this depends on the spending and saving habits of various classes of taxpayers. As in most years, the greater part of the increase in receipts in 1969-70 is expected to be induced by the prospective growth in expenditure and incomes in the economy. On the basis of existing legislation, gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises are estimated to increase in 1969-70 by $553 million or 13.3 per cent. In passing, it might be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective trends in some particular areas of activity which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough byfiscalor monetary means. An example relevant to the revenue estimates for 1969-70 is the very large increase which has been assumed in average earnings. Should average earningsriseless than assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and the budget deficit would be greater( ). It would not follow, however, that the Budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected by such a development; on the contrary, such a result would be more likely to serve the broad economic purposes to which budget policy is directed. Mainly because of the substantial increase which occurred in 1968-69 in the incomes of companies and of persons subject to provisional tax (especially primary producers), the increase in receipts not closely related to future trends in economic activity will be exceptionally large in 1969-70(). On the basis of existing legislation, taxation collections from com3 panies and individuals subject to provisional tax are estimated to increase by $307 million, or 18 per cent. As noted above, the effect of changes in these tax payments on the spending of the taxpayers in the year of payment cannot be assessed or predicted with any precision. It depends on many factors, including the extent to which the taxpayers concerned have made taxation provisions out of the previous year's income and the availability of funds for (') The prevailing structure of taxation does, of course, play a part in determining the total change in money income or expenditure which develops from a given initial change-in tbe same way, for example, as physical laws play a part in determining the increase in speed achieved by a car under given conditions. The retarding forces of friction and air resistance build up as the speed of a car increases; but being themselves a result of the increase in speed, these forces cannot be regarded as an independent influence. A decrease in the retardation attributable to air resistance would not be the cause of an increase in speed because it can only occur as a result of a decrease in speed; and vice versa. (*) The deficit would not be greater to the full extent of the shortfall in receipts, because some components of expenditure-for example,financialassistance grants to the States-coul d also be lower than estimated if average earnin gs rose more slowly than assumed. (*) Tbis increase consists mainly of the movements in receipts of certain taxes which arerelatedto incomes in the year prior to the collection of the tax, but includes also the changes in some minor hems of receipts. See August 1968 Supplement to the Treasury Infonnation Bulletin entitled 'National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure', pages 18 and 19. 1 2 expenditure in the year of payment. With respect to 1969-70, it is unlikely that a large proportion of these particular receipts would operate to offset the expansionary impact of budget outlays but there would be some elements of these receipts which would operate in this direction. The taxation measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce receipts by $21 million in a full year. By contrast, the revenue measures in the 1968-69 Budget were estimated to add $108 million to total receipts in a full year. The minor taxation concessions proposed for 1969-70 will, of course, have expansionary effects. Review The implications of Budget transactions, in terms of their initial impact on trends in expenditure and income in the economy, depend not on total outlays and receipts, but primarily on the change in domestic outlays, and on that part of the change in receipts which is not a mere result of prospective movements in the economy. The following considerations are therefore relevant to a comparison of the 1969-70 Budget with that of 1968-69: (a) The estimated increase of 7.3 per cent in domestic expenditure on goods and services is substantially less than the increase of 10.0 per cent in 1968-69; (b) The increase in transfer payments and net advances within Australia is estimated af 10.4 per cent in 1969-70 compared with 6.7 per cent in 1968-69. Though attributable in part to particular factors which should be set aside in assessing the impact of the Budget on demand and incomes, the much larger increase in transfer payments and net advances will have an expansionary impact on the rate of growth in expenditure on goods and services in 1969-70; (c) The divergent changes in rates of taxation in the 1968-69 and 1969-70 Budgets would also operate to make the initial impact of the 1969-70 Budget more expansionary than that of its predecessor; (d) Against this, some elements of the exceptionally large increase in receipts which are largely independent of prospective trends in the economy should have an influence in the other direction-bot h directly through their effect on the expenditure of the taxpayers concerned and indirectly through their effects on liquidity conditions; (e) Although the outlays and receipts of the Budget have an important influence on trends in the economy in the year ahead, the likely economic effects of a Budget can be assessed only in the context of all of the more important influences operating at the time in the economy as a whole.

Subject to the qualifications outlined later in this Statement, thefiguresare broadly consistent with thefiguresfor 1968-69 and the estimates for 1969-70 set out in Statements No. 1 to 5. Table3 on pages 50 and 51 showsfiguresfor each year since 1959-60 in national accounting form. In this form, transfers between different parts of the Commonwealth's accounts are eliminated so that thefiguresshown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government and the rest of the economy or overseas. These transactions are classified into economically significant categories, corresponding with those for which similar information is provided, in respect of past years, for the entire economy in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure. Thefigurescontained in this table are comparable with those set out in Statement No. 6. Notes on the composition of the figures are set out later in this Statement. Over the period 1959-60 to 1968-69, Commonwealth expenditures rose by 115 per cent. Within this increase, there was an increase of 199 per cent in expenditures on defence services while other expenditures rose by 103 per cent Total receipts and total taxation revenue were each 119 per cent greater in 1968-69 than in 1959-60. The largest single increase was in net pay-as-you-earn collections from wage and salary income which increased by 216 per cent over this period. Collections from this source rose as a proportion of total receipts from 19.3 per cent in 1959-60 to 28.0 per cent in 1968-69. Over the period, the size of the deficit varied considerably. In 1960-61, it amounted to $32 million; in 1967-68 it reached $642 million. In 1969-70, it is estimated to be $30 million. Thefinancialyear 1968-69 saw the highest level of net proceeds of borrowings overseas available towardsfinancingof the deficit. $142 million. Net proceeds of loans raised in Australia and of Treasury Notes were highest in 1962-63 when they exceeded $500 million. Commonwealth Budget outlays rose from 22.0 per cent of Gross National Product in 1959-60 to 25.6 per cent in 1967-68 and then declined slightly to 24.2 per cent in 1968-69. This implies that there was a relative increase over this period in the quantum of transactions passing through the Commonwealth Budget as compared with the growth in the value of goods and services produced in Australia. At the same time, it has to be recognised that a large part of Commonwealth outlays consists of transfer payments, mainly payments of pensions, subsidies, etc., to persons, and grants and advances to the States and to Commonwealth authorities outside the Budget. This is illustrated by the comparison in the following table of outlays in total and as a percentage of Gross National Product in 1959-60 and 1968-69. Net expendih tt on goods and servicesWar and defence Other Total Transfer payments;Cash benefits to persons Grants to States Other Total Net advancesto States to Commonwealth authorities to other sectors Total Total Outlay The table of Commonwealth receipts in national accounting terms shows a reduction in the proportion of Commonwealth receipts obtained from indirect taxes, which made up about 40 per cent of receipts in 1959-60 and 32 per cent in 1968-69. This decrease was almost precisely offset by an increase in the proportion of Commonwealth receipts obtained from pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions.

Some new classifications of expenditures were introduced and an identical concept of the Budget deficit was used in both the national accounting and the 'conventional' presentations of the Budgetfigures.Budgetfiguresfor the years 1966-67 and 1967-68 were also set out in this revised form. Tables1 and 2 below set out similarly revisedfiguresback to 1959-60. Numerous changes have been made in thefinancialaccounting arrangements of the Commonwealth Government since 1959-60. Thefiguresin the tables have been adjusted where possible to produce the greatest practicable degree of consistency, but it has not been possible to remove all inconsistencies. The more important inconsistencies that remain are: (a) since 1963-64, some credits, which in earlier years had been offset against expenditure, have been paid to revenue. The amount of these credits in 1963-64 was $26,445,000; (b) a revision of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act in 1966 reduced Debt Charges in 1966-67 by about $50,000,000 and the income of the National Debt Sinking Fund by about $82,000,000, and increased Other Revenue by about $32,000,000; (c) thefiguresfor the years 1966-67 and 1967-68 have been adjusted to remove the effects of accounting changes made in 1968-69. It has not been possible, however, to adjust thefiguresfor earlier years. The effect of these changes on the 1966-67 figures is to increase both expenditures and receipts by $12,904,000. Other inconsistencies remaining do not involve substantial sums and are unlikely to affect significantly the comparability of the figures. The figures for expenditures in Table1 exclude redemptions of savings certificates and Treasury Bills, etc., as well as redemptions of other public debt of the Commonwealth. They also exclude some transfers made to trust accounts such as transfers made to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. As a number of new classifications of expenditures have been introduced, most of thefiguresincluded in these tables differ from those which appeared in the Budget documents for earlier years. The following notes explain the larger adjustments which have been made to the figures of expenditures and receipts previously published: (a) thefiguresfor the years 1959-60 and 1960-61 have been adjusted to include the so-called 'self-balancing items' (mainly taxes and charges on commodities, the proceeds of which are appropriated for expenditure for specific purposes) which were not included as receipts and expenditures in those years; (b) thefiguresfor the years 1959-60 to 1967-68 have been adjusted because of the new accounting arrangements for the Post Oflice. Post Office revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenditures are no longer shown under separate headings but, instead, a single payment representing the net funds provided from the Consolidated Revenue Fund has been included under the heading Advances for Capital Purposes. The new Post Office accounting arrangements also result in changes to the figures for Other Expenditures and Other Revenue; (c) operating expenditures of the other Business Undertakings, the railways and broadcasting and television services, are no longer shown separately. They have been offset against revenue in order to show the net receipts from these business undertakings; (d) thefiguresshown against State Works and Housing Programmes are in gross form and include expenditure from the proceeds of State domestic loan raisings. Details of these works and housing programmes in each year are set out in Table No. 42 of the White Paper 'Commonwealth Payments to or for the States, 1969-70'; (e) The receipts heading 'Net Increase in Other Balances' used in the Budget documents for the years prior to 1968-69 has been dissected to distinguish between transactions which are in the nature offinancingitems and those which should be regarded as being in the nature of normal receipts and expenditures of the Commonwealth. The latter are included under the receipts heading 'Net Increase in Other Balances of the Commonwealth in the Trust Fund'. The following notes explain the composition of the main headings in Table2 which summarises the Commonwealth'sfinancingtransactions: (a) the item 'Credit Arrangements for Defence Purchases in the United States of America' comprises drawings under these credit arrangements, which are in the nature of borrowings, and repayments of these credits from Consolidated Revenue Fund, which are in the nature of redemptions; (b) in the item 'Other Overseas Loan Proceeds', thefiguresof loan proceeds are the actual cash proceeds from loans, etc., credited to Loan Fund in each year including loans raised on behalf of Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission tofinanceaircraft purchases. Overseas 'refinancing' operations are treated as adding to both loan proceeds and redemptions where they involve receipts into Loan Fund and outlays from Loan Fund; (c) thefiguresof loan proceeds in Australia include the actual cash proceeds of loans, etc., credited to Loan Fund in each year plus amounts raised through State domestic loan raisings. They include the gross proceeds derived from the issue of Special Bonds. Amounts subscribed by the Commonwealth to special loans have, however, been excluded; (d) the redemption items, both 'Overseas' and 'Australia', consist of outlays incurred in reducing the amount of funded debt outstanding (that is, public debt other than temporary borrowings by way of Treasury Bills and Treasury Notes and drawings under the credit arrangements for the purchase of defence equipment in the United States of America). They include all outlays on redemptions, repurchases and repayments from the National Debt Sinking Fund and all outlays on redemptions, etc., from Loan Fund, from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (including repayments of loans raised on behalf of Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission) and from the Canadian and Swiss Loan Trust Accounts; (e) 'Other Financing Transactions' includes funds obtained from coinage and bullion transactions, amounts borrowed by Commonwealth trust accounts, net amounts available from Commonwealth trust account transactions in securities, and amounts available from moneys held in trust, etc.; (J) 'Residual Financing' items include net direct borrowing from the Reserve Bank through the issue of Treasury Bills or other securities and the use of cash balances held with the Bank. In the table, thefiguresshow the net change in Treasury Bills on issue after 'funding' operations under which other securities were substituted for Treasury Bills on issue. The securities issued in substitution for Treasury Bills are shown under the heading 'Net Issue of Other Securities to the Reserve Bank'. In 1964-65, 'funding' operations amounted to $100,000,000 and in 1966-67 they were $80,000,000. In addition, in 1966-67, $75,000,000 was borrowed from the Reserve Bank through the issue of Commonwealth securities to the Bank. Net expenditure on goods and services. This heading covers direct purchases of domestic output and imports, and includes wages and salaries of government employees and pay and allowances of defence forces. Any recoupments of such expenditures from other sectors of the economy or overseas are netted off. Current and capital expenditures are shown separately, and each is further classified by function. In accordance with national accounting conventions, all equipment purchased for defence purposes is classified as current expenditure. Transfer payments. Current payments to other parts ol the economy or overseas, other than payments for goods or services supplied, are listed in their various forms under this heading. Net advances. Loans, advances and additional capital made available by the Commonwealth are shown in the respective items under this heading. Repayments of loans and advances are deducted to arrive at the net figures. Taxation. This heading includes, in addition to the larger items listed under the item 'Taxation' in Table 1, some minor indirect taxes included in 'Other Revenue' in that table. Small amounts of expenditure are offset against receipts. Interest, rent and dividends. Interest on loans to the private sector is not included in this item, but is treated asfinancialenterprises income and included in the next item. Gross income oj public enterprises. This item represents gross income, less operating expenses, of enterprises whicb operate within the Budget, ft includes interest received on advances to the private sector, which is treated asfinancialenterprises income. Net sales of existing assets. Tbe principal components of this item are sales ol land, houses and other buildings, less acquisitions of sites and existing buildings. This item is the difference between total outlay and total receipts. It consists of net sales of Commonwealtb securities other than to Commonwealtb Government trust funds, less net purchases of other investments by Commonwealth Government trust funds, less the net increase in cash, less funds provided for the International Monetary Fund, plus minor changes in other liabilities.

Other Revenue was increased by $26,445,000. On the expenditure side. Defence Services were increased by $13,032,000, Other Expenditures by $9,176,000, Departmental Running Expenses by $3,237,000 and Repatriation Services by about $1,000,000. The revised accounting arrangements also involved minor changes as between certain items of expenditure, including most of those previously mentioned. $30,000,000 in Debt Charges, a reduction of $82,000,000 in the income of the National Debt Sinking Fund and an increase of about $32,000,000 in Other Revenue, all of which reflect the revision of tbe National Debt Sinking Fund Act. In addition, thefiguresfor 1966-67 and subsequent years have been adjusted to eliminate the effects of accounting changes which occurred in 1968-69. $91,212,000 and 1969-70$50,682,000 (estimated). under the credit arrangements for the purchase of defence equipment in the United States of America are included under Defence Services.

No allowance has been made in this table for the large subventions which the Commonwealth and State Governments make each year towardsfinancingvarious educational institutions in Australia which are attended by several thousands of private and officiallysponsored students from other countries. Moreover, thefiguresdo not allow for the fact that part of Australia's contributions to the regular budgets of certain international organizations not listed in the table is used tofinanceaid projects in developing countries. Nor do thefiguresinclude defence aid to Malaysia and Singapore, which is estimated to total $7,852,000 in 1969-70, compared with $6,243,000 in 1968-69. Various expenditures of a military nature incurred in Papua and New Guinea also help indirectly to promote economic development. Some brief comments on the more important items shown in the above table follow. International Development Association. Australia has pledged a total of $57,125,000 ($US63,980,000) to IDA since its inception. This sum comprises: an initial capital subscription of $US20,180,000, payable over thefiveyear period, 1960-1964; a contribution of $US19,800,000 towards the first replenishment of the Association's resources over the triennium 1965-1967; and an offer by the Government earlier this year voluntarily to contribute $US24 million to IDA over the next three years in anticipation of the coming into effect of the international agreement governing the second replenishment of IDA's resources. This agreement was negotiated early in 1968 and was originally intended to relate to the period 1968-1970 but, in the event, it did not come into effect until 23 July 1969. Contributions to EDA are initially made available in the form of non-negotiable, noninterest-bearing promissory notes which are cashed as and when the funds are required by IDA. Actual cash payments to IDA up to 30 June 1969 totalled $29,933,000. Because of the delay in implementing the second replenishment agreement, the calls made by IDA on its member countries in 1968-69 were lower than usual. Australia was called upon to make cash payments of only $2,020,000 to IDA in that year, compared with $7,134,000 in the previous year. In 1969-70, cash payments to IDA are estimated to total $5,510,000. Asian Development Bank. Australia agreed to subscribe $75,893,000 ($US85 million) to the capital stock of the Asian Development Bank, which has been set up in Manila to promote the economic growth of developing countries in the ECAFE region by providing loans, on both commercial and concessional terms, and technical assistance to these countries. Australia's subscription is the fourth largest after those of the United States and Japan (each $US200 million) and India ($US93 million). One-half is to remain at call as security for any borrowings which the Bank might make on international capital, markets to supplement its subscribed capital. The balance is payable infiveannual instalments, half in convertible currency and half in domestic currency. Use of the domestic currency portion is confined to the procurement of goods and services in Australia. The amount of $3,795,000 provided in the Budget represents the fourth annual instalment of the convertible currency portion of Australia's subscription. The corresponding domestic currency payment will be made in the form of a non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing promissory note which will be cashed as and when the Bank requires funds to purchase goods and services in Australia. Steps were taken in 1968-69 to encash one of these promissory notes. Apart from enabling the Bank to meet expenses associated with the Annual Meeting of its Board of Governors in Sydney last April, this action will help the Bank to increase the overall return which it obtains on its investments in Australia. As similar action is not envisaged in 1969-70, the payment to the Bank will be $3,794,000 less than last year. Other Multilateral Programmes. The estimates provide for increases in Australia's contributions to various multilateral aid schemes. The main increase relates to the UN Development Programme, to which Australia will contribute $US2 million in 1970, compared with $US1,451,000 in 1969. Australia's contribution to the UN High Commissioner's Programmes for Refugees will be increased by 30 per cent to $175,000 in 1969-70. Voluntary contributions of meteorological equipment totalling $40,000 will be made to developing countries in Asia in 1969-70 in connection with the World Weather Watch mounted by the World Meteorological Organization. The number of Australian experts participating in surveys and studies organized by the Asian Industrial Development Council to promote greater economic co-operation between countries in the ECAFE region is expected to increase markedly in 1969-70. Colombo Plan. This is by far Australia's largest bilateral aid programme. It covers a wide range of activities, including the training of numerous overseas students and officials in many different subjects in educational institutions, government services and private industry in Australia as well as the assignment of Australian experts in various fields to work and teach in developing countries overseas. At the present time, it also embraces the provision of heavy machinery and equipment for large construction projects (for example, highways, bridges, dams and town water supplies) undertaken in collaboration with foreign governments. In addition, it includes the installation of radio telecommunication systems, assistance in the rehabilitation of telephone and railway networks, and gifts of such diverse items as trucks, buses, landrovers, irrigation and farm equipment, railway wagons and sleepers, dredges, pumps, hospital and broadcasting equipment, wool, bakery equipment, and lathes and teaching aids for vocational training institutes. Various other commodities and manufactured goods have been given to developing countries under the Colombo Plan in the past. Further details of the present programme are given in various official publications by the Department of External Affairs. Since 1967-68, special emergency assistance has been provided to Indonesia under the Colombo Plan to help that country to stabilise and rehabilitate its economy. Most of this assistance has been used to finance what are, in effect, commercial exports to Indonesia of predominantly Australian-made goods on the 'Bonus Export' (B.E.) list which that country has drawn up to reflect its most pressing requirements. As such, it has served to provide general financial support to Indonesia's budgetary and balance of payments position. In 1968-69, this B.E. aid was supplemented with government-to-government gifts of flour, fertilizer, railway equipment and other commodities. The total amount of aid to be provided to Indonesia in 1969-70 is $15 million, compared with expenditure of $11,500,000 in 1968-69. This will be financed from various votes under the Colombo Plan and from the provision for Australia's food aid commitment under the International Grains Arrangement. Thus, it is envisaged that gifts offlourworth $4 million f.o.b. will be made to Indonesia in 1969-70. The comparablefigurefor 1968-69 was $3,541,000. The total provision for the Colombo Plan in 1969-70, at $23,500,000, is $4,683,000, or 25 per cent, greater than expenditure in 1968-69. Of this increase, $3,041,000 relates to aid to Indonesia. The estimates provide for a substantial increase in the number of training awards to overseas students and officials to study in Australia in 1969-70. International Grains Arrangement-Food Aid Convention. Provision has been made in the Budget to meet Australia's commitment under the International Grains Arrangement to provide 225,000 metric tons of wheat orflourequivalent as food aid to developing countries in 1969-70. The estimate is slightly below actual expenditure in 1968-69 because certain expenses incurred last year on freight and insurance costs associated with a shipment of wheat will be recouped in 1969-70. Countries which received gifts of wheat orflourfrom Australia in 1968-69 were India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Korea, Nigeria, Fiji and, as previously mentioned, Indonesia. The bulk of the food aid to be provided in 1969-70 is again expected to go to traditional recipients of aid from Australia in the Asian and Pacific regions. Indus Waters Scheme. Australia has undertaken to contribute a total of $23,269,000 to the Indus Basin Development Fund to helpfinancethe construction of dams, link canals and barrages on various tributaries of the Indus River designed to divide the waters between India and Pakistan in an equitable manner. Total expenditures for this purpose to 30 June 1969 amounted to $16,366,000. It is expected that the World Bank, which is responsible for administering this scheme, will call up $733,000 of Australia's outstanding commitment in 1969-70, compared with $2,137,000 in 1968-69. Other Bilateral Programmes. The estimates for all other bilateral aid items, with two exceptions, are greater than expenditures in 1968-69, in some cases significantly so. The estimates for the relatively new South Pacific Aid Programme and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan, for example, are both more than 20 per cent greater. The two exceptions are the Foreign Exchange Operations Fund in Laos, to which Australia made a supplementary contribution in 1968 greater than the amount by which its pledge for 1969 has been increased, and the contribution that Australia made to the appeal which the International Red Cross organized on behalf of refugees in Nigeria last year. Provision has been made in the Budget for two new items: an initial contribution of $13,500 by Australia towards the Food and Fertilizer Technology Centre to be established in Taipei under the auspices of the Asian and Pacific Council, and expenditure of up to $100,000 in 1969-70 on the establishment of a new aid scheme designed to enlist the services of selected universities in Australia in helping similar institutions in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia to tackle the twin problems of food production and population control confronting those countries. Papua and New Guinea. Provision has been made for a grant of $96 million to the Administration of Papua and New Guinea in 1969-70. This represents an increase of $9,006,000, or more than 10 per cent, on last year, and is designed to assist the continued economic and social development of the Territory in accordance with the overall economic development plan which has been drawn up in the light of the recommendations of general survey missions from the World Bank. Direct expenditures in Papua and New Guinea by various Commonwealth Departments are expected to decline this year. AS the following table reveals, Australia has provided nearly $1,300 million in official economic assistance to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, since the end of World War II. The Budget allows for a further $162 million to be provided in 1969-70. Thesefiguresdo not include defence aid, official assistance provided from extra-budgetary sources, indirect educational subsidies to overseas students, or Australia's contributions to the budgets of certain international organizations whichfinanceaid projects in developing countries as part of their regular activities. By the end of the currentfinancialyear, Australia will have provided considerably more than $500 million in official aid to developing countries apart from Papua and New Guinea. 18993/69-R-[4 ] Programmes Programmes New Guinea $'000 1945-46 to 1959-60 1960-61 1961-62 1962-63 7,652 10,058 1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 1968-69 Cumulative to 30 June 1969 1969-70 Estimate.. Although the annual rate of increase in aid expenditures slowed down in 1968-69, largely for reasons over which Australia had no control, aid expenditures have on the whole increased at a much faster rate than total government spending and National Income over the past decade. The fastest rate of increase has occurred in Australia's bilateral aid programmes, which are concentrated upon developing countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. Because of conceptual and statistical difficulties, international comparisons of aid efforts by different countries are subject to reservations or qualifications of one kind or another. Nevertheless, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development regularly publishes data on the aid performances of individual member countries which are sometimes used for comparative purposes. Thus, for example, the DAC publishes information on the totalflowsoffinancialresources from its members to developing countries each year; these statistics include not only official grants and loans but also private capitalflowswhich comprise both direct and portfolio investments and commercial and trade credits of more than twelve months' duration. It is very doubtful whether such disparate items can be aggregated in any meaningful sense. Nevertheless, all these items are included in the present definition of the 'aid' volume target of one per cent of Gross National Product to which developed countries have been asked to subscribe in international circles. At the same time, the target specifically allows for 'the special position of those countries which are net importers of capital*, such as Australia. In view of the shortcomings in these totalflowfiguresas a measure of aid effort and burden-sharing, the DAC also publishes data on officialflowsonly. Thesefiguresare subject to some reservations in that they include loans extended on commercial terms and for purposes other than aid. For example, net purchases by central monetary authorities of bonds issued by institutions like the World Bank are included. Moreover, these statistics fail to allow fully for the difference between grants and loans inasmuch as interest receipts are not deducted in calculating net flows.

The data for official development assistance provide a more suitable basis for comparing the aid efforts of other donor countries with that of Australia, although the problem of equating loans with grants still remains. On this basis, according to the DAC, Australia ranked among the first three countries in the world in 1968. Preliminaryfiguresfor individual donor countries showing their net official development assistance to developing countries in 1968 expressed as percentages of National Income and Gross National Product are set out in the following table: NET OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO Expressed as percentages of: France Australia Netherlands Germany United Kingdom Belgium United States of America Norway Canada Sweden Japan Italy Denmark Austria Switzerland(fl) All DAC countries(a) (a) Estimated. NOTE: Portugal has not yet submitted any statistical returns for 1968 but, when these are received, the DAC Secretariat expects that that country will be placed at the head ofboth lists. For purposes of comparison with Australia, which provides all of its official aid by way of grants, the data on which the above calculations have been based should be adjusted to take account of the interest payments received by donor countries which provide official aid in loan form. However, the additional information required to enable comparisons to be made on this basis is not yet available.

In addition, services and facilities are provided by the Commonwealth for which no charge is made or for which charges fall well short of covering the costs incurred. A large part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which it is estimated $37 million will be provided from Consolidated Revenue in 1969-70, is on activities undertaken for the benefit of Australian industry. Commonwealth Departments providing assistance in the form of services and facilities include Primary Industry, Trade and Industry (including the Australian Tourist Commission), National Development (Bureau of Mineral Resources, and Forestry and Timber Bureau), Civil Aviation and Labour and National Service. A number of the specific purpose grants to the States also assist primary industries-for instance, payments for beef cattle roads, brigalow lands development, water resources investigations, softwood forestry, and so on. In addition, a very considerable and rapidly increasing amonnt of assistance is being provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Commonwealth revenues and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients, are as much a call on the Budget as direct payments which add to expenditures. Assistance of this type is mainly provided by way of income tax concessions which permitfirmsand individuals to make deductions from their incomes for taxation purposes beyond those normally permitted under the income tax law. In total, the Commonwealth assistance specified under the following three headings, which does not include all the forms of assistance referred to above, amounted to $440 million in 1968-69. The following table sets out estimates of Commonwealth payments to (or on behalf of) industry in 1969-70 included under the heading 'Commonwealth Payments to Industry', Item No. 10 in Statement No. 2. These payments are estimated to amount to $201,621,000 in 1969-70 which compares with payments of about $80,000,000fiveyears ago (1964-65) and about $40,000,000 ten years ago (1959-60).

The estimated reduction of $1,020,000 in bounty payments on raw cotton results chiefly from an amendment made in 1969 to the Raw Cotton Bounty Act. 1967-38 1968-69 1969-70 + Increase Actual Actual Estimate Decrease on 1968-69 SO' OO SO' OO SO' OO $'000 4,027 4,620 3,600 1,020 15,508 42.870 42,870 .. .. 21,000 35,000 29,000 6,000 23,564 31,665 50.400 + 18,735 10,308 11,044 15,000 + 3,956 27,000 27.000 27,000 743 638 800 + ""l62 17,569 19,264 22,200 + 2,936 1,000 + 1,000 23,767 -143,486 172,101 149,000 23,101 -42,405 48,513 53,576 + 5,063 .. .. 30,793 35,962 37,000 + 1,038 11,612 12,551 16,576 + 4,025 800 + 800 2,480 2,249 2,200 49 565 430 1,210 + 780 163 424 625 + 201 220 179 286 + 107 12 1,286 ""988 780 ""208 654 5,300 10,800 + 5,500 .. .. 862 1,200 + 338 -16,992 22,984 34,477 + 11,493 -385 385 .. 11,711 12,497 14,300 + 1,803 4,362 1,791 1,800 + 9 16,073 14,673 16,100 + 1,427 .. ... 1,901 1,780 1,800 + 20 300 180 150 30 .. .. 150 141 94 47 400 68 68 -2,751 2,169 2,044 125 179,302 211,928 201,621 10,307 Rural Industries Tbis amendment reduced the ceiling on total bounty payments from $4,000,000 for 1969 to $3,000,000 for 1970. In addition, payments in 1968-69 were accelerated slightly as, during that year, the bounty became payable on a production rather than a sale basis. Wheat Industry Stabilization. It is not expected that there will be a wheat stabilization payment in 1969-70 as the 1968-69 season's crop, for which the stabilization payment would normally be made in 1969-70, is unlikely to be fully sold before 30 June 1970. Devaluation Compensation. Payments to be made to rural industries in 1969-70 in respect of reduced returns in Australian currency arising from the devaluation of sterling and other currencies in 1967 are estimated to be $29,000,000, $6,000,000 less than in 1968-69. The main reason for this reduction is that no payments in respect of forward exchange losses incurred at the time of devaluation will be made io 1969-70. Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty. As a result of a proposed increase from $8 to $12 per ton in the standard rate of bounty and an expected increase in sales, it is estimated that expenditure on the bounty in 1969-70 will increase by $18,735,000 to $50,400,000. Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy. With the proposed extension of the subsidy, expenditure is estimated at $15,000,000 in 1969-70, an increase of $3,956,000 on expenditure in 1968-69. Petroleum Products-Al l States and Northern Territory. The subsidy scheme is designed to reduce the prices of certain petroleum products in country areas. The increase of $2,936,000 expected in 1969-70 reflects a realignment of subsidy rates with current distribution costs and an expected increase in consumption. Marginal Dairy Farm Reconstruction Scheme. Provision has been made for the expenditure of $1,000,000 in 1969-70. . Manufacturing Industries Shipbuilding Subsidy. Ships are purchased by the Commonwealth and sold at prices of up to one-third below their cost. The expected increase of $5,063,000 in expenditure in 1969-70 is attributable to increased shipbuilding activity. Receipts are also estimated to increase in 1969-70, though not to the same extent as expenditure, mainly because receipts in 1968-69 included a higher-than-normal incidence of progress payments by purchasers of ships. The net subsidy is estimated to increase by $4,025,000. Book Bounty. As an interim measure of assistance, pending an inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, a bounty will be paid to the manufacturer on ali books of Australian production to the extent of 25 per cent of the invoiced price, as from 1 June 1969. It is estimated that payments of this bounty will amount to $800,000 in 1969-70. Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty. There are two reasons for the increase of $780,000 in expected expenditure in 1969-70. Payments in 1968-69 covered sales for a nine-months period only, whereas subsidy payments in 1969-70 will cover sales in a 15-months period, and price reductions by manufacturers are expected to lead to increased sales. Sulphuric Acid Bounty. Expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to be $208,000 lower than in 1968-69 because of reduced acid production from indigenous sulphur-bearing materials. Industrial Research and Development. The increase of $5,500,000 in estimated expenditure on industrial research and development grants in 1969-70 is expected to result mainly from an increase in eligible expenditure by companies. Pyrites Bounty. Because of the continued high price of imported sulphur, no payments have been made under the Pyrites Bounty Act since the quarter ended 30 June 1966. The 1968-69 expenditure of $385,000 was a special payment made on the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Petroleum Search Subsidy. The estimated increase of $1,803,000 is expected to result from revised administrative procedures accelerating subsidy payments. In addition to its direct support of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, the main contributions made by the Commonwealth to promotion and research (which are included in Items No. 7 and 11 in Statement No. 2) are shown below. The table sets out estimates of expenditure in 1969-70 and actual expenditure in 1967-68 and 1968-69. Wool promotion and research(a) Other rural research(a)Wheat Meat Dairy Tobacco Other Export promotion(c) Coal utilisation research (a) Does not include industry contributions (bough levies. (6) Includes $2,097,000 in respect of wool sold during 1967-68. (c) Includes trade promotion visits. The amount of revenue forgone in 1968-69 through the main concessions in the income tax field is estimated at no less than $177,000,000. The latest estimates for particular concessions which contribute to this total are given below. In addition to the concessions in the income tax law, there are numerous concessions in the sales taxfieldin the form of special exemptions to assist particular industries. In the case of the pay-roll tax, there is the export rebate scheme, which involved a cost to revenue of $29,000,000 in 1968-69 and is estimated to cost $37,000,000 in 1969-70. The relevant concessions in the income tax field have been grouped in three broad categories, namely: A those which allow the deduction of larger amounts than are authorized under the general provisions of the law; B those which allow certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and C those which exempt certain classes of income. Mining Industries 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 + Increase Actual Actual Estimate Decrease on 1968-69 $'000 $'000 $'000 $-000 13,039 (6) 15,116 14,000 -1,116 .. 850 885 900 + 15 1,120 1,541 1,250 291 443 314 390 + 76 300 400 400 280 272 302 + 30 3,197 3,359 3,850 + 491 260 260 260 19,489 22,147 21,352 795 The main provisions in each of these categories, and the estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1968-69 are: Category A: Investment allowanceManufacturing Primary production Export Market Development Allowance Certain capital expenditures on land used for 'primary production' and in timber operations (excluding items otherwise depreciable). Deductions for telephone lines allowed to 'primary producers' . . Expenditure on scientific research (excluding accelerated depreciation on plant) Moneys paid on sharesPetroleum exploration (Section 77A) Mining (Section 77AA) . . Calls (one-third of calls paid on mining and afforestation shares) Capital expenditure of certain mining enterprises (excluding deductions in respect of plant otherwise depreciable) Total CategoryA . . Category B: Special depreciation allowable to 'primary producers' Allowance of immediate deduction for fencing and underground piping instead of depreciation Special rate of depreciation on plant used for scientific research Deduction in year of purchase and/or appropriation of income for plant used in mining or exploration which would otherwise be subject only to depreciation Total CategoryB Category C: Exemption of certain mining profits Total CategoryC . Total all Categories (A) This estimate is based on the deductions allowable in the 1967-68 income year in respect of purchases and appropriations in that year less the depreciation that would have been allowable m lhat year on the relevant plant purchases or the plant in respect of which the appropriations were made. While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do tbe normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Commonwealth Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-freefinance,to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner theyreceivesavings than wonld he the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the nse of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayer! concerned with arevolvingcredit in their account with the taxation revenue. (e) Thb estimate is based on the exemption of income under Section 23(o)-gol d mining, Section 23(p)-sal e of rights to mine gold and other prescribed minerals, Section 23A-one-fift h exemption of income from the mining of prescribed metals and minerals and Section 23c-exemptio n of income from export of gold produced in Australia.

In particular, as the income from production of Australian petroleum grows, there will be an increasing cost to revenue of the special allowances permitted for petroleum-producing enterprises. These allowances effectively free from tax income from the sale of Australian petroleum and its products until the capital expenditure incurred infindingand recovering the petroleum and not, in effect, transferred for deduction against shareholders' income by reason of Section 77A, has been recouped out of the rnining profits. Dividends paid out of that tax-free income are exempt in the hands of shareholders of the mining companies. In the 1969-70 Budget, it is proposed that: (a) the income tax law be amended to allow full deduction in the year of expenditure in respect of all expenditure in the income year 1969-70 and subsequent years on structural improvements made by primary producers for the purpose of conserving water or fodder. The cost is estimated to be $200,000 in 1969-70 and $2,000,000 in a full year; (b) the estate duty law be amended to provide a measure of relief from duty on estates of primary producers at an estimated cost to revenue of $1,000,000 in 1969-70 and $5,300,000 in a full year; and (c) Section 82 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended so that dealers in shares will be allowed only one deduction for capital subscribed to mining or afforestation companies.

(a) Special rate pension (commonly referred to as the T.P.I, pension) is granted where an ex-serviceman is, because of incapacity accepted as due to war service, totally and permanently incapacitated-that is, to such an extent as to be precluded from earning other than a negligible percentage of a living wage-o r has been blinded as a result of war service. Where a serviceman is only temporarily totally incapacitated, special rate pension is payable only for the period for which h'e is so incapacitated. It may also be granted under certain conditions to an ex-serviceman who is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. (6) Intermediate rate pension is payable where an ex-serviceman, because of the severity of his warcaused disabilities, can work only part time or intermittently and therefore is unable to earn a living wage. (c) General rate pension is payable to an ex-serviceman whose war-caused disabilities do not prevent him from working, although they may reduce his earning capacity. Pension from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum general rate is payable according to the degree of incapacity as assessed by a Repatriation Board, the Repatriation Commission or an Assessment Appeal Tribunal. An additional pension (but not so that the total pension exceeds the rate of special pension) is payable for certain disabilities-mainl y in respect of amputations. The amount of additional' pension payable varies with the severity of the amputation. (</) A 'Special Compensation Allowance' is payable to certain general rate pensioners with assessed incapacity ranging from 75 per cent to 100 per cent. (e) Pension is payable to the widow of an ex-serviceman whose death has been accepted as due to bis war service or who has died from causes not due to war service but was receiving, at the time of his death, the special rate of war pension or the rate payable to double amputees. Domestic allowance is also payable to a war widow if she has a dependent child or children under 16 years, or is 50 years of age or over, or is permanently unemployable or has a child over 16 years who is undertaking education or training approved by the Department and who, in the opinion of the Department, is not receiving an adequate living wage. (/) War orphan's pension is paid for the children of an ex-serviceman whose death occurred in circumstances similar to those mentioned in (e) above and continues until they attain 16 years of age. Ig) An allowance for an attendant is payable to an ex-serviceman who owing to war service has: Higher Rate-tw o arms amputated; or been blinded and also afflicted with total loss of speech or total deafness. Lower Rate-tw o tegs and one arm amputated or two legs amputated above the knees; or been blinded or deemed by the Repatriation Commission to be in need of an, attendant. (h) Children of ex-servicemen are eligible under the Soldiers' Children Education Scheme where the ex-serviceman: .. died as a result of a disability accepted as due to war service; or .. is'receiving a special rate pension; or .. died from causes not due to war service but was receiving, at the time of his death, the special rate pension or the rate payable to double amputees; or .. is blinded as a result of war service; or .. is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and is receiving a pension at the special rate and who is likely to remain in receipt of such pension for a period of three years. (I) An allowance for recreation transport, at the rates shown, may be payable, to certain classes ol seriously disabled ex-servicemen, the rate of allowance depending on the degree of loss of locomotion.

(A;) Service pensions, which are broadly the equivalent of the age and invalid pensions payable to civilians, are payable, subject to means test, to an ex-serviceman who: .. is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis; or .. has served in a theatre of war (or in the case of a woman, served abroad or embarked for service abroad) and has attained, if a man, the age of 60 years, if a woman, 55 years; or is permanently unemployable. Where a service pension is granted to an ex-serviceman on the grounds that he is permanently unemployable or suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, or if there is an eligible child, service pension may also be paid to his wife and thefirstfour eligible children. Where the serviceman's wife is receiving a social service pension, a tuberculosis allowance or a service pension as a 'member of the forces', the rate payable to him is the married rate. Guardian's allowance may be payable to a service pensioner who is unmarried, widowed, divorced or married but separated and who has the custody, care and control of a child. Under a proposal announced in the Budget Speech, the allowance will be increased to $6.00 a week where there is a child under 6 years or an invalid child requiring full-time care. Supplementary assistance at a maximum rate of $2.00 per week is payable, subject to a means test, to a service pensioner if single (or if married, where his wife is not receiving a pension from the Department of Social Services, or a service pension as an ex-servicewoman) who pays rent.

No Government can give an tbe future. The Australian Government has unconditional guarantee to any company, no bungled its administration of this trusteeship area terribly and tragically over the last few weeks.

101,Mr Bryant (Wills) [9.16],"Mr Honourable members on the other side ofmatter how keenly and sincerely we feel about it, that its future in the Territory will be secure no matter what we do. The events which have taken place at Bougainville over the last few weeks have ensured that the people there will have a continuing resentment not only of the Administration but also of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. In handling affairs at Bougainville, the Government has committed the greatest act of folly in the 25 years since the war. On the whole there has been reasonable, though conservative and cautious, progress in Papua and New Guinea. I have been a fairly consistent critic of many of the things which have been done in Papua and New Guinea, but I have always paid tribute to any advances to which I think Australians ought to pay tribute. On the whole the Australian Government has performed better in New Guinea than any other Government has in comparable circumstances, but Australia has done itself a great disservice by its actions in recent weeks. A few weeks ago, as a result of inquiries opened up. Because of the way that we around my electorate, I visited Bougainville. are carrying out this operation I do not The Minister for External Territories, on believe that these people can be convinced television or in an interview somewhere in that we do not intend to take their land. his electorate, implied that I had gone to Bougainville and incited the people to revolt. IfI can incite people to revolt in a statement about what I had seen and a 1 day I am greater than Lenin. IfI were fortnight ago I went to the Prime Minister able to do that I would be the most revolu( Mr Gorton) and told him that so far as tionary character you have ever seen. But I was concerned I had done my duty as of course that is all nonsense. Part of the well as I was able, that I had no intention reason why the Minister does not see the of inciting anybody but that I was making facts of life is that he is trying to escape sure that I knew what I was answering for from them. I visited Papua and New as a member of this Parliament. I believe Guinea. I placed an advertisement in the that what is going on up there is a deep daily press. People throughout the Territory disgrace. I foresaw and prophesied that it saw the advertisement and people in the would happen. It has happened, and it will area under discussion saw it. I sent telego on unless we take steps to stop it. The grams to the local member of the House Prime Minister abdicated his responsibility of Assembly. I said that I would be there in the matter, as has the Minister for to hear what they had to say, and see things External Territories, who is now at the for myself, and that is what I did. I was concerned with what had happened. I had table. The fact is that we have a deep watched the operations of our Government trust in Papua and New Guinea. We do not with the Aboriginal people of the Northern own the place. We have no rights there; we Territory, so I went to Bougainville with have only duties. We have power in the an open mind but with grave doubts. I went to the area and I discussed the matter with the officials. I received absolute courtesy from them. They are dedicated people. They said to me that they were associated with the Solomon Islands or be going to enforce the law. I went up and an independent country in some different looked at the mine which is 13 or 15 miles up a very rough, dangerous and difficult road. The visit was worthwhile. I went down to the beach and sat for 3 hours with the people, including Mr Paul Lapun, who is their local member, and Mr Leo Hannett, who has been here, who is a member of the University of Papua and New Guinea and who had with him a tape recorder. Somewhere in Papua and New Guinea is a record of this meeting, if anyone cares to look for it. Those people said to me as we sat under the coconut palms on the beach that afternoon: 'If they come on to our land we will fight. We have nothing to fight with, but we will fight.' I was touched with the tragedy and pathos of the situation. These simple folk have nothing but their land and now, with all the power at our disposal, we intend to take that land from them. I had no resources which would enable me to convince them otherwise. I had no way of opening up their minds, if they are to be When I came back to Australia. I made Territory, but that does not give us the right to railroad people and to do what we like. Bougainville does not belong to us. In the future it might not even be part of a new Papua and New Guinea. It could be context altogether. If Nauru and Tonga To do what was. done on Bougainville can be independent, Bougainville also might in order to avoid disadvantage to a private be independent. In this area we have betrayed the trust for the Government of Australia to act as that has been placed upon us. We cannot agent for a private mining company in such act like this with these people. We do not an instance. It must be made clear to the own them. We treat them even more as people of Australia that what has happened foreigners than the people of Italy, France on Bougainville that has led to the trouble or Greece. People from those countries can has nothing to do with the mining of copsettle in Australia, but the people of per; it is part of the ancillary services. Bougainville are not permitted to do so. Alternative land is available if we have We have a trust; this is a tremendous prothe wit and the will to utilise it. We have ject. The point that has not been made abdicated our responsibilities. We have clear by Government supporters is that we breached our trust. We will sow the seeds of are not arguing today about the mining continuing resentment that will make it project. The facts are that the mining prodifficult for us to operate in tbe area for ject will proceed, that the mining land has years to come. Over the last 3 or 4 years been alienated, that the people are going the people have expressed their resentment to receive, I think, $2 per acre per year for about certain things. A man at Kieta was it and that they are going to be left with a sentenced to 2 months gaol last September hole in the ground about 8,000 feet long, because he resisted somebody chopping 4,000 feet wide and perhaps a half mile down trees on his land. The Commondeep. We are arguing about land for a wealth will spend millions of dollars on this housing estate-that is what it is. The Comproject for the company's advantage. It will monwealth is to buy land for a housing development. The Commonwealth is going build roads where it would not build them and take land from the Rorovana peoplenot for a mine, but for a town for other never had the money to build them for people.

When I sat on the beach on that afterAustralian engineers caq see that there are noon the people said to me: 'Why can't alternatives.

They were referring to the low-lying Government has acted with unbecoming land behind the beach. Honourable memviolence and in a manner completely unbers will find that land mentioned in the becoming an Australian and civilised comdebates in the House of Assembly and in munity. In my opinion this is one of the statements that have been made here and most disgraceful actions there. From the map, I would say that the area to which they referred covered 4 or 5 square miles. Of course the area would have to be filled in; but is there any great expired. difficulty in draining marshes or in filling in swamps? There will be about 30 million raise an issue such as this for discussion tons of overburden from the mine.

103,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. J. Aston),,127,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure
104,Mr Corbett (Maranoa) [9.27],"T oI , too, have recently been in Bougainville. I travelled around Uie area. Together with members of the Government Members Mining Committee I met a very comprehensive cross-section of the community. We were prepared to talk to everybody because it was our desire to ascertain the problems confronting the people of the area. In partigreat disservice in this matter. I say that cular we wanted to meet the indigenous people of the area. We wanted to ascertain their problems and to see what could be done to assist them if assistance could be given. Tonight the Opposition is trying only to make political capital out of a difficult situation. This debate will only add confusion in an area where already the greatest difficulty is being experienced in providing a proper picture of what the natives will eventually get from this project. The objective of the Administration in Papua and New Guinea is the progress and development of the area and the welfare of the people who live within its borders. honourable member for Wilmot will find out in a minute or two. Having regard to its objectives the Administration welcomed an investigation of the possibility of economic development of mineral resources in the area by a company with the financial resources and technical skills possessed by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. If those financial resources and technical skills had not been available to the company it is quite possible that this very valuable development would never have taken place because a great deal of investigation was required before the mineral deposits could be proved to be of economic significance. When it became obvious that this project was likely to eventuate the Administration's field officers in the area did all they could to explain the position to the natives. I would emphasise the tremendous difficulties with which those officers were confronted. No mention of these difficulties has been made. Reference has been made to the number of languages spoken in the area. There are some 700 over the whole of the Territory. It has been mentioned that there are 19 in Bougainville itself. People who live in quite the people who were managing the mine. close proximity to one another cannot converse except by the use of pidgin. Whilst pidgin has done a remarkable job in enabling communication to take place, it leaves a lot to be desired as a medium of communication when explaining something which is entirely new to these people. These were the problems which were faced by the Administration and its officers. The honourable member for Wills went on to say that we have done ourselves a the great disservice has been done by those people who were consistently-and to some effect-stirrin g up trouble in the area and trying to undermine the good work that has been done by the officers of the Administration. I know, and everyone knows who has been there, that these people have a very great love for their land. They do not want to be moved from it, but when the position is explained to them and when they have a reasonable conception of what is taking place they are prepared to co-operate as they did in relation to the 10,000 acres at Panguna where the mine is situated. The same problems arose there but they were overcome and the natives now are getting some of the benefits from this mining venture. They accepted the proposal because the disrupters did not have quite the same amount of time to get amongst them. It is very easy to convince these primitive people, particularly when you are quite untruthful, stop at nothing and use the tactics that they used to convince these people that the intentions of the Administration are not to benefit them. them in the area. Fortunately there were not more of them, otherwise there would have been more trouble. I will not name them. The honourable member was there and if he had looked around as I did he would know them and would not want me to name them. There is no need for me to name them. Anyone who has been there in recent times knows that there were not many of them but that they caused a good deal of trouble. As I have said, when we were there we tried to get an opinion from everyone we could interview. We went to the mission; we went to the mine; we went to the Administration officers; we went to We spoke to the native people wherever we had an opportunity to do so. We went to the Rorovana area and had a meeting with the people. The member for the area, Paul",127,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure

108,Mr Corbett,"There were enough ofLapun, was with us and acted as interpreter to convey our remarks to the native people. Our main objective was to learn the problems of the indigenes. At the meeting, which was attended by somefiftypeople, only one person asked questions although we gave everyone the opportunity to do so. This person, who had been mdoctrinated by the people who were trying to undermine the Administration, asked question after question untilfinallyI said: 'It is time someone else was given the opportunity to ask questions'. It appeared that one or two others wished to ask questions. Of the whole group only two others asked questions of us. There we were, members of the Australian Parliament, asking them to tell us their problems so that we could assist them in whatever way we could: We were anxious that they should approach us but they did not tell us of any of their problems. We learned too that they had had discussions with Administration officials who had been approached by the natives at all hours of the day and night-w e checked that particularly-and the officials were prepared to listen to the natives as long as the natives wanted to talk. The natives were given every opportunity. This was confirmed by the head of the mission in the area who said that over a considerable period the natives had been approaching him to have the objectives explained to them. There is no doubt that the co-operation which is being given to the Administration and to the company in the area of the mine would certainly have been given in the area where the land is needed for the supporting industries for this great project. I have not the time to deal with many of the aspects of the benefits that will accrue from this venture when it gets under way. I will quote one benefit as an example. I quote from an address given to the House of Assembly. Referring to the educational programme, the speaker stated: It is estimated that this programme, when fully very truthful things have been said about under way, will involve the company with an annual expenditure of about half a million doUars. various aspects of Australia's administraMany other benefits', including health Guinea and that particular part of the benefits, will come as a result of this Territory on which we focus our attention venture. I do want to emphasise the success that Minister for External Territories ( Mr the Administration has achieved. The Barnes) wfll follow me in this debate to sensations that we have seen in some of sum up and to reply from the point of the forms of mass media that provide view of the Government. I hope that, in information to the public show that the mass media have forgotten about the successes that have been achieved. The Administration is to be congratulated on what it has done particularly when its achievements are looked at against the background of the very great difficulties that it has experienced. I wish to congratulate the Administration on what it has achieved. The greatest need at this time is patience, tolerance, understanding and co-operation on the part, of all people who have an interest and a concern in this matter. i genuinely interested in the welfare of the natives of this area dp regret that any force has to be used.. But the blame for that is on the disrupters who have gone into the area. If the Administration had been given a reasonable opportunity to employ the methods that it was using to encourage the natives to co-operate with it, the problems would have been resolved. When this type of disruption comes into the situation, I suggest that the position becomes tremendously difficult. Tbe real need at this time, is an understanding of the position as well as the tolerance that is required to enable the natives to understand what will happen. Once the natives start to get some tangible benefit from this development, I am sure that we will see a repetition of what happened in the mining area in the area where land is being sought at the moment able member's time has expired. Speaker, a lot of heat has been engendered in this debate which has been brought before the Parliament today by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart).

111,Mr Speaker,Order! The honour,129,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure
112,Mr Cross (Brisbane) [9.37],"M rhis reply, with his knowledge of the Territory he will clear up some of the misapprehensions and some of the doubts that have been introduced in this debate. The Opposition has brought this matter before the Parliament not in order to make party political capital from the debate but to direct attention to our trusteeship of this number of speakers from the Government Territory. The trusteeship of this Territory was handed over to Australia by the League of Nations. We continue the administration of the Territory under trusteeship from the United Nations. It is a very responsible trust. Unhappily, certain incidents having occurred in the Territory in recent times, we are debating this matter in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. But the Opposition has brought this matter before the Parliament because we would be failing in our duty if these unfortunate incidents in which batons and tear gas have been used against the indigenous people of Bougainville were not discussed properly in this Parliament. We are asking for a clear statement on what the Government proposes to do. Quite frankly, every Australian is proud of the Australian Administration in Papua and New Guinea. In my time in this Parliament, which has been approximately 8 years, I do not recall any occasion on which the Opposition ever has suggested that the amount of expenditure in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea should not be increased. Indeed, on so many of these things, we are on common ground witb the Government. But this is an occasion when, these matters having been brought before the Parliament this afternoon and this evening, the Minister and the Government should not spell out their complacency. The Minister, of course, has not spoken in this debate yet. But we have heard from other Government speakers statements on what has happened, and on the great benefits that will accrue to the Territory. Many features of the Territory's administration we. ourselves support. But we are asking, in the light of what actually has happened, what the Government proposes to do now. I would like the Minister, in his reply, the Territory of Papua and to the people of to clear up some of the very loose statethe Trust Territory of New Guinea, but ments which have been made. He is realso that in the years ahead we will carry ported as saying that the situation has not a responsibility to the Australian taxpayer. been reported properly in the Australian Press. I hope that the Minister spells out those matters which have not been reported properly in the Australian Press and that he tells us the Government's objectives and in what way he, his Department and the Administration have been misrepresented. A side have spoken of stirrers and agitators who have gone there to stir up trouble. My friend the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett) rather suggested that I had been to Bougainville. Unfortunately, at this point of time. I have not. I would have liked to go with my colleague, the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), but commitments prevented me from going at that time. ments? replying to that. I and every member on this side of the House would resent any suggestion that tbe honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) and the honourable member for Oxley would be placed in this category of agitators and stirrers. I have known both of these gentlemen over a period of time. I have known of the interest of the honourable member for Wills in the land rights of Aboriginals at Yirrkala and the rights of the Gurindji people and others. These mysterious statements about agitators and stirrers stirring up trouble have been made by a number of members on the Government side, but we want a clear statement from the Government as to whether these people who are stirring up trouble in the Territory are members of the House of Assembly, missionaries or whatever they might be. Let the Government and the Minister cut aside this cloak of ambiguity and anonymity that shrouds these people and clearly state who is causing trouble in Bougainville. None of us debates the importance of this development for the Territory. I know we would be at variance in this Parliament as to whether or not we should leave these people completely alone. Every responsible member of Parliament realises not only that we carry a responsibility to the people of",129,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure
113,Mr Stewart,What were those commit,130,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure
114,Mr Cross,"Modesty prevents me fromtoo. The responsibility of advancing the Territory in the future is one that will become increasingly burdensome to this country. We meet this responsibility cheerfully because it is fairly small compared with the responsibility that Great Britain and other countries have met in the past. Notwithstanding that, the Australian Labor Party, which advocates far greater development in the Territory and the establishment of a far more equitable society in Australia, realises probably more than does any other political Party represented in this Parliament the need for the economy of New Guinea to be placed on a stable and sound basis. So we are not opposed to this niining development, but one has to look at the realities of the situation. A great deal of Australian and overseas capital is being placed into this venture. A great deal of risk capital is involved. I think we would alt commend the enterprise, the foresight and the courage of those entrepreneurs who are prepared to invest in an area like Bougainville-a n area of possible political instability. I remember that when I came here in 1961, in the aftermath of the Foot report, people said that we would like to be in New Guinea for 30 years but that we may be there for only 7 years. Rather happily, our period of trusteeship seems to bave extended. Notwithstanding any of those things, I think that most people who are placing a great deal of capital into an enterbecause of that, to the people of this counprise there realise that they are taking certain risks. In New Guinea we operate under pressure from the United Nations and from international opinion quite outside the United Nations. Therefore our tenure of office in our capacity as a trustee is uncertain. In all those circumstances Conzinc Riotinto of Australia and Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd have shown some courage; they have displayed some enterprise. Their greatest asset in the future for the investment they are making in the Territory is the goodwill of the people of the Territory. It is precisely this question that is the crux of the wbole debate. We have had certain incidents in which the people of Bougainville have shown their resentment and opposition to the development'that is taking place there. We have been told that the Administration over a period of some years has gone to a considerable amount of trouble to endeavour to explain to the people just what this development means to them, to their children and to the Territory in the years ahead. We know that the unity of this nation is not well established. We know that some of the problems in the Territory for which we have responsibility are akin to the problems that exist in Indonesia where the national motto is 'Unity in Diversity'. We know that these problems exist. We do not want, in bringing this matter before the House, a statement of complacency. We do not want Government supporters to come forward and say: 'We have done our best. Everything we have done is all right, as time will show'. We believe the unhappy incidents in Bougainville in recent times have been an indication that the actions which have been taken have not been good enough. What the Parliament is calling for tonight, and what the Opposition and the people of Austra'ia are seeking is for the Minister to spell out in the reply he will make in a few minutes just what additional measures the Administration will take and what additional measures the Government will take. The situation is that all Australians are proud of what we have done in New Guinea. We have come to the cross roads in this situation. We have come to the cross roads in regard to an enterprise which economically and in other ways is of great importance to the future of the Territory and which is important, try. We do not want the Government to be complacent, nor do we want the Minister to be complacent, because although we recognise what his administration and he himself have tried to do, the incidents that have happened there indicate that further action is necessary. If we are going to build in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, including Bougainville, the kind of society and the kind of nationhood we all hope will be built, the ball is back at the feet of the Government and the Minister. We now look forward to the Minister's reply. We hope it will be not a complacent one but one wbich shows the sense of responsibility which all Australians wish to see in our dealings with the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. External Territories) [9.47]-First of all, I would like to clear up a misrepresentation",130,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure
115,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson,"Minister forby the Opposition. It has been suggested that the Government endeavoured to avoid a debate on this matter by refusing to move that the paper be noted. We were forced to do this as a result of our negotiations with the Opposition. I had hoped to have a full and open debate on my statement because I believed that this House, and through this House the people of Australia, should be properly informed of everything that happened at Bougainville. Members of the Government Mining Committee have been there observing the situation. We have had most valuable contributions from them tonight which unfortunately were limited to 10 minutes. What on earth can be done in 10 minutes? They had most valuable tape recordings. The Opposition gave us to understand that it would refuse permission for me to make a statement and the arrangement was that we should not move that the paper be noted so that the Opposition could go on with this discussion of a matter of public importance. As far as I am concerned, this is a disgraceful situation. This was the arrangement. we have to make do with this. The honourable member should get in touch with his deputy leader and he will find out that this was the arrangement. Anyway, we are doing well enough as it is and we do not need to go any further into that question. We wanted a full debate, and obviously on what has been stated by my colleagues who were up there and observed the situation for themselves it is easy to understand why the Opposition did not want to hear any more. It has been suggested that loose statements have been made and that I have to follow up and gather them together. I made a very full statement covering all details and people feel that they are not represented. all questions before this debate began. 1 suggest to those honourable members who bave not listened, or if they did listen do not appear to have taken it in, that they should read tbe statement. If the statement is published people will have an understanding of what has happened. We fear nothing. It is unfortunate when force has to be used; but here again it is the will of the people who have come into this operation and it is the will of the members of the House of Assembly. They made this decision in the interests of their country. Under the Budget introduced tonight, the contribution by the Australian taxpayers this year will be a little short of SI 20m. This is a grant, with no strings tied to it. It is for this Territory of two million people. It represents $60 per capita. No other country measures up to that sort of contribution or comes anywhere near it. Our objective is to bring these people to a point where they are able to run their own show. First of all, they have to have economic viability. They have to be reasonably independent from an economic point of view; otherwise, as I said in my statement today, independence is meaningless. In this primitive operation one is dealing with primitive customs and attitudes, particularly in relation to land-it is a very emotional issue even between native and native-whic h produce these difficult situations. Over recent weeks, I think, somewhere between ten andfifteennatives have lost their lives in inter-tribal disputes over land. These are the things that are happening all over the Territory. These are the things that one must look at in the context of the Territory. There is one point about which 1 am really concerned in regard to the attitude of the Opposition. It is the denigration of tfie House of Assembly. This is a very serious situation. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) indicated that the members of the House of Assembly did not know what they were doing. He said that they were remote and so on. Although he had no reason to answer my interjection, I interjected to clear up this situation. But he would not answer me. The tone of his speech was that the members of the House of Assembly are remote; they do not know what is happening on Bougainville; and the To support my statement, I point to the very terms of this matter of public importance raised by the Labor Party. They are so strange that they make me quite suspicious that members of the Labor Party did not want a full debate but that they felt duty bound to come up with something. What they have raised is a matter of public importance, which has the lowest status of any protest that can be made in this House. It is not a motion of censure; it is not an urgency motion; it is a matter of public",131,Territory Of Papua And New Guinea Land Tenure

In other words, the Opposition is saying that members of the House of Assembly do not know what they are doing and are incapable of running their own affairs. Consider the resentment on the part of members of the House of Assembly when the United Nations suggested that they could not run their own elections. Now the Opposition is coming in and snubbing the House of Assembly. That is what it is amounting to. Let us look further at the attitude of the Opposition. Let me take some comments made during previous debates by these honourable members who have been sponsoring Papua and New Guinea. They show the opinions those honourable members had when the House of Assembly was being established. This is what the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said on 14th May 1963: I did not sense any hatred or tension in New Guinea and we in the Opposition believe for that many areas where complete faith should not be reason we should trust this Papua-New Guinea Parliament, this Parliament really representative of the people of Papua and New Guinea, considerably more than is evinced on the Government's part in the Government's proposal for a House of Assembly. On 14th May 1963 the Leader of the The basic thing, however, is that the people there should have the opportunity of representative government. We have heard much from the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). On Uth May 1963 he said: We have a faith in the ability of people to look after themselves, to stand on their own feet and' to develop their self-reliance. member for Wills is a very voluble gentleman. Again, on 14th May 1963 he said: All we ask is that the Government give to the people of Papua and New Guinea the self-respect that representative government demands. You will not get self-respect unless you develop self reliance. Now he wants to interfere. Now his Party asks for the appointment of a joint select committee. member for Wills is interjecting. I have already warned him during this debate and also this morning against doing so. If he continues I will deal with him. member for Wills, on 27th October 1966, said: The people of Papua and New Guinea have chosen their representatives. I think it is part of the pattern of development that we place upon them as much responsibility as we can. The people of the Territory have taken the responsibility for developing this copper project, but now the Opposition suggests that we should appoint a joint select committee to tell them what to do. The honourable member on the same date also said: Perhaps there should be implied sanctions against restriction of freedom of speech and freedom of association.

We have heard valuable contributions from my colleagues on this side of the House, especiaUy the members of the Government Members Mining Committee. They have pointed to the stirrers. The honourable member for Evans (Dr Mackay) said that the manager of a plantation went to a village and said he would supply arms for an uprising against the company and that he would fight alongside the villagers. This is the sort of thing that has happened. It has been reported to me that the honourable member for Wills advised the people not to sell their land. But here tonight he said that he only listened. Can any honourable member imagine the honourable member for Wills only listening? That would be absolutely impossible. Mr Speaker, I do not think I need add anything more.

However, the following comments for some States may supplement the infonnation given in answers to other parts of this question, particularly (5): Victoria-The total known eligibility is 4,319. South Australia-Mentally retarded children are brought to the notice of the South Australian Education Department by regular annual surveys or they are referred by medical practitioners and parents. The annual increase is approximately 100 students. Although the Education Department endeavours to place all eligible mentally retarded children in special schools, it may be that the placements are slightly less than the actual number of eligible children. Despite the efforts of the Department, the exact number of children cannot be accurately ascertained, as a few parents do not accept the possibility of schooling for their children. Western AustraliaA distinction is made between educable mentally retarded children who are capable of managing a modified school course relating closely to adult needs and likely to manage a routine job in the open labour market, if special placement help is given on leaving school between IS and 16 years of age and trainable mentally retarded children. The total numbers eligible for admission to a special school are 5,250 educable and 900 trainable.

(2) Will he also give consideration to increasing Government subsidies to the Overseas Service Bureau for the Australian volunteers abroad programme which is at present limited to ISO Australians serving overseas. able member's question is as follows: (1) Many universities and other institutes of advanced education already provide facilities fot collecting information and research in fields relating to development. I do not believe a separate and new institute of development studies needs to be established by the Government, but it is always open to a university to reconsider how it is groupto proved reserves of titanium in Australia. Reserve ing or organising its own activities. It does not appear to me necessary at present to establish a specialised institute to examine the need for the training and recruitment of skilled persons for long term careers in international development. (2) The Australian Government has provided some financial assistance to the Overseas Service Bureau since 196S, but it has been the Government's and the Bureau's wish that the independent and voluntary character of the Bureau and its activities be preserved. The Bureau has been sponsored by over 100 church, youth, and community groups and is also supported by contributions from individuals and some trusts. The Government has met in full each request of the Bureau for financial assistance in accordance with the agreed formula. The Bureau itself has pointed out that the supply of volunteers is restricted more by the number of suitable persons available than by shortages of funds. Communism in Asia (Question No. 1605) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) What persons are employed and for how long has each been so employed, by the Government to interpret policies of Asian Communist parties which are (a) in powei.

(2) What are the respective linguistic standards of these employees in relevant languages. (-3) Through what channels and what other individuals does each of them communicate with him. petence to furnish information relating to the persons employed by the Government as a whole on the study of a particular subject matter. As far as the Department of External Affairs itself is concerned, it is not desirable to make public details relating to individual officers who may be engaged on the study of particular countries or regions. Titanium (Question No. 1562) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: What are the (a) known and (b) estimated deposits of titanium in Australia. able member's question is as follows: (a) No precise figure can be given with respect figures of rutile and ilrnenite (the principal ores of titanium) are those collated from data made available by operating companies, and as such are probably equivalent to measured and indicated reserves. (b) Rutile (96% Ti0 ). Reserves of rutile based 2 on a cut-off grade of 0.25% rutile in the ground, are estimated to be about 6 million tons. Reserves are virtually confined to the mineral sand deposits of the east coast. Ilrnenite (55% TIOJ. Ilrnenite reserves in Western Australia are estimated to be about IS million tons. In addition, extensive deposits ot ilrnenite are known to occ along the central Queensland coast and on the offshore islands viz. Fraser and Curtis Islands. If these deposits are proved to be economic, overall ilrnenite reserves would be almost doubled. Anstralian Atomic Energy Commission (Question No. 1567) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: (1) Did the Atomic Energy Commission, in an advertisement in the Australian on 1 February 1969, state that the Physical Metallurgy Group of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission four electron microscopes.",139,Answers To Questions Upon Notice

(3) Has the Commission at any time attempted to sell any of its electron microscopes. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Physical Metallurgy Group at the Research Establishment by that time had just received its fourth instrumenta special scanning electron microscope. Although the four electron microscopes are located in the Physical Metallurgy Group laboratory, that group is not the sole user. Electron microscopy is used in many projects within the re-processing Commission's overall research programmes. Howfuel elements, development of methods for fixaever, for efficiency, all electron microscopes are tion of wastes of high level of activity etc. located in one centre where they use common dark rooms, specimen preparation rooms and other facilities.

(2) With what other countries does Australia have bilateral trade agreements and when were thcy concluded. able member's question is as follows: (1) Discussions regarding a trade agreement were first held between the Australian and United States Governments in 1934, when the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of the United States was passed, giving the President the power to enter into trade agreements. Since that time there have been exchanges of views between the two Governments to arrive at a basis for negotiations but so far these have not been successful. However, trade relations between the two countries are governed by the various provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which was accepted by the Australian and United States Governments in 1947. (2) Australia has trade agreements with the following countries:Bulgaria (1966), Canada (1925 and 1960), Republic of China (1968), Czechoslovakia (1936), France (1936), Greece (1940), Hungary (1967), Iceland (1952), Indonesia (1959), Israel (1951), Japan (1957), Republic of Korea (1965), Federation of Malaysia (1958), New Zealand (1933 and 1965), Philippines (1965), Poland (1966), Portugal (1930), Romania (1967), South Africa (1935), Spain (1950), Switzerland (1938), USSR.

Information about the nature and extent of the work undertaken by the United Nations and its specialised agencies may be found in the UN. Document E/4486/Add. 1 and in the most recent report of the Population Commission E/4454. These documents are available in the Parliamentary Library. Australia is aware of the difficulties posed for the developing countries by rapid population growth especially where population pressures are already severe and standards of living are low. The Australian Government welcomes the growing awareness of this problem and of the need for action. The Australian Government supports research into population control and family planning and the provision by international agencies of technical advice and assistance, when requested, for national projects and programme dealing with family planning and population problems. At the same time the Government believes that the population problem is one for each country to approach in the light of its own social values and experience. For this reason, and because of the work already being done in the United Nations, an initiative of thc kind suggested by the honourable member is not proposed.

161,Mr Lynch,"The answer to the honourFirearms (Quesuon No. 1487) Mr Hansen asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Has he discussed the licensing of firearms with the State Attorneys-General. (2) Has he noticed the increasing number of crimes being committed by persons using rifles and shotguns. (3) If he has been unsuccessful to date in obtaining the co-operation of the States, will he, in the light of recent happenings, renew efforts to have uniform controls over the use and purchase of firearms. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) There are no statistics available in this area to enable me to state wilh any exactitude if crimes of this nature are increasing. There may well be an increase but I doubt if the ratio of crimes of this nature to tolal criminal activity is increasing. (3) Thc administration of legislation relating to firearms does not fall within my Ministerial responsibility and the same is true of most, if not all, of Attorneys-General of the States. I am informed there is a proposal for a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible forfirearmlegislation. Commonwealth Assistance to Schools (Question No. 1500) Mr WliHlani asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) On what dates and in what terms has each State last sought Commonwealth assistance for (a) government and (b) non-government schools. (2) On what dates and in what terms has the Commonwealth responded. able member's question is as follows(1) and (2) The needs of education were discussed during the course of the Premiers' Conference in June 1966. It would not be practicable to summarise that discussion here but details are available in the published transcript of proceedings of the Conference. On 4th October 1968 the Premier of New South Wales wrote to me enquiring whether the Commonwealth would support an increase of $5m in his State's allocation under the borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council for State works and housing in 1968-1969. The Premier stated that this increase was required to enable a supplementary school building programme to be undertaken. The Premier was informed that (he Commonwealth Government could not agree, at that stage of the year, to support in the Loan Council a request for such an increase because of: (a) the large estimated increase in 1968-1969 in capital funds available to the States from the Loan Council borrowing programmes and from direct Commonwealth assistance; (b) the need to restrain the recent rapid growth in public authority expenditure-parti cularly public authority capital expenditure -in order to achieve a more appropriate balance between the public and private sectors and to ensure the preservation of a stable economy; (c) the implications in relation to other States and other areas of Government expenditure where, it could be argued, additional funds were equally required for various other improvements to services. On 14th November 1968 the Premier of New South Wales wrote to me about a request for additional Commonwealth funds for the Roman Catholic school system. The request came from the Federation of Catholic Parents and Friends' Associations. In the course of my reply of 26th February 1969, which was subsequently made public, I wrote' I note your view that despite the efforts of your Government to assist independent schools, more needs to be done if the non-Government sector of our dual system of education is to be maintained at a desirable standard. You referred to a noticeable drift of Roman Catholic children to Government schools. In the light of these trends, you asked me to consider supplementing the assistance which the States are able to provide from their own resources. ' I share your view that thefinancialproblems of independent schools are important and ot concern to all Australian governments. For its part, the Commonwealth Government appreciates the significant role played by independent schools in the education of young Australians and both by policy pronouncement and by programmes introduced, has demonstrated its willingness to provide direct assistance to these schools . . . . 'My colleagues and I are well aware of the particular problems with the running costs of independent schools and of the difficulties which many of them are experiencing in obtaining sufficient teachers and in paying them reasonable salaries havingregardto salaries in Government schools. We have received representations from the Federal Catholic Schools Committee and have had discussions with members of that Committee. As a consequence we have undertaken to look carefully into ways in which the Commonwealth might assist these schools further as part of its policy of assisting both Government and independent school authorities to improve the quality of Australian education. However, anything the Commonwealth were to do would have significant budgetary implications and therefore must be considered with that aspect well in mind. The same situation applies to the specificrequestsfor Commonwealth assistance contained in the resolution conveyed to you by the Federation of Catholic Parents and Citizens Associations. 'We will be considering the problems of independent schools further in the coming months and will bear in mind the support you have registered for some additional Commonwealth contribution to supplement what the States are now doing'.",173,Total 37 851 Rds

The conditions of service of these officers are those prescribed by the Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Regulations which are made by the Governor General on the recommendation of the President and the Speaker. The conditions of employment are, in general, based on those applying throughout the Public Service, but modified in some areas to meet purely local conditions. Sessional staff of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms are employed under wages and conditions that are, in the main, based on the Liquor and Allied Trades Award (A.C.T.), plus a special loading of 121% on tbeir wages to compensate for the short and uncertain duration of their employment.

Overseas Aid (Question No. 1589) Mr Kevin Cairns asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) What percentage of the Australian gross national product is provided in overseas aid to (a) Papua and New Guinea and (b) other countries. overseas aid could be raised to H per cent the gross national product. Will he consider the appointment of an International Development Committee or Commission to advise the Government in formulating aid policy and programmes, such a Committee or Commission to represent, if possible, business, agencies. (4) Is it a fact that at present only about half the available quotas of goods now admissible from less developed countries at preferential rates of duty are being taken up by less developed countries because there is Uttle demand in AustraUa for many of the goods to whicb preferential duties are now applied. (5) If so, is it possible to expand the list of goods so admitted. able member's question is as follows: (1) The table below shows the percentage of the Australian gross national product which has been provided in overseas aid to (a) Papua and New Guinea and (b) other countries in recent years. Papua Other Year and Total New Guinea countries % % % 1965-66 .. 0.37 0.16 0.53 1966-67 .. 0.37 0.18 0.55 1967-68 .. 0.39 0.20 0.59 (2) Not in the early future. (3) Many interested organisations and individuals make representations to ihc Government or are consulted by it and have opportunity of offering their advice on foreign aid matters. The appointment of a special committee or commission to advise the Government would largely duplicate existing facilities. But at the same time, I recognise that changing situations and problems often require different measures to meet them, and I keep in mind the need to adapt our existing machinery as appropriate. (4) I have been advised that at present quotas actually taken up under the AustraUan system of tariff preferences for developing countries have faUen well short of thc total concessions available. For the quota period January-June 1969, the available tolal was $24.1 million: of this, quotas actually taken up by importers amounted to $8'.6 million. There is no one general reason for the shortfall. Lack of demand could be a factor. However, every concession in the schedule has been estabUshed as a result ofrequestsby developing countries themselves, by Australian importers, or by exporters of the goods concerned. In many cases the requests might weU be based on prospects for future growth in demand rather than any large-scale current demand. Again, the success of developing countries in",174,Total 37 851 Rds

165,Mr Freeth,"The answer to the honourexploiting the quotas depends on the energy and expertise with which they attempt it, and difierent countries have naturally bad differing degrees of success. (5) Since the scheme was introduced in 1966 the schedule of concessions has been progressively extended beyond its original coverage of 57 quota groups, with a total availability of $13.3 million per annum, to 187 quota groups with a total availability of $33.5 million. Further extensions to the schedule are continually being examined. Overseas Aid (Question No. 1603) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) In answering my question No. 1355 (Hansard, 1st May 1969, page 1655) relating to the target recently set for economically advanced countries to provide 1 per cent of their gross national product as aid to under-developed countries, did he mean to imply that it may not be practical for Australia to achieve this target by 1972. (2) If so, what are thc practical constraints operating on the Australian Government that will prevent it from allocating one-hundredth of our gross national product towards the poor nations of the world. (3) Has Government expenditure on defence increased sharply over the past few years so that Australian external economic aid as a proportion of defence expenditure has fallen from 18.25 per cent in 1963-64 to 13.46 per cent in 1967-68. (4) If so, why has defence expenditure been apparently constrained to a lesser extent than expenditure on overseas aid. able member's questions is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The value of official external aid provided by the Government depends upon the resources available to the Government and the pressure of other demands on those resources. In deciding what proportion of its funds should be allocated to external aid, the Government must take into account all demands upon its funds as well as the requests of the governments of the less developed countries for economic assistance from Australia. The Government is sympathetic to the needs of developing countries for more external assistance and the rapid growth in Australia's aid expenditures over recent years testifies to this. Australia bas supported resolutions on the aid volume target in various international bodies and has been able to do so because the target, as at present defined, includes the clause '. . . having regard to the special position of those countries which arc net importers of capital'. But the government has reservations about the value of setting arbitrary statistical targets for aid-giving all aircraft at this date. which pay no heed to the form and quality of the assistance that is provided or the use to which il is put, and which do not take account of the fact that, just as the aid needs of developing countries might vary from time to time, so the ability of donor countries to provide aid can be affected by changing economic circumstances. (3) Yes. (4) External economic aid expenditures have been increasing at a faster rate than both total government spending and National income for more than 10 years now. The fact that defence expenditure has increased at an even faster rate since 1963-64 reflects the Government's assessment of the needs of defence over this period. Vietnam (Question No. 1608) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Can he provide statistics showing the (a) numbers, (b) percentages relative to other population groups and (c) ages and sexes of (i) refugees, (ii) members offightingservices, (iii) civil servants including police, (iv) full-time school pupils and (v) pre-school children in (A) areas tinder Australian control, (B) areas under control of other non-Vietnamese, (C) areas under control of the Hanoi regime, (D) areas under the control of the National Liberation Front and (E) areas under ; control of the Saigon regime (I) at Ihe time of Australia's first military intervention and (11) at present, in Vietnam.

(3) Wbatfigureshas he to indicate the relative (a) morbidity, (b) mortality, (c) literacy, (d) crime rale, (e) prison population and (f) prostitution rate among any of the groups, referred to under (I) above. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) It should be obvious that accurate und detailed statistics for all those areas and limes cannot be compiled in the conditions in Vietnam today. (2) The Ministry of Health, Social Welfare and Relief of the Republic of Vietnam regards as temporary refugees persons who come from territory occupied by the Viet Cong lo areas controlled by the Government of the Republic and are accommodated in temporary refugee camps pending return to their villages of origin or re-establishment at anolher location. They are regarded as having ceased to be refugees when they have relumed to their home village or been re-established at another location.

168,Mr Fairhall,"The answer to the honourMcNamara was for a package deal involving provision of 24 F ill aircraft with ground support equipment, reconnaissance equipment, training and training devices and one year's initial spares at a general order of magnitude cost of approximately $US125m. (2) As is equally well known there is a ceiling price to the flyaway cost of the aircraft: for the 24 this is SUS 142.8m. As has been explained on earlier occasions in thc House, to this must be added the cost of escalation of labour and materials from AprU 1965, the cost of Australian configuration requirements and the cost of approved added capability modifications. The cost currently known under these heads amounts to SUS11.621m. (3) The uncertainties to which I have referred in the House on 28th May 1969, do not allow of an answer.

Vietnam: Prisoners of War (Question No. 1545) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: . How many prisoners have been captured by the Australian forces in Vietnam since his answer to me on 19 May 1967 (Hansard, page 2476) and what changes, if any, have since been made in handling prisoners. able member's question is as follows: Since May 1967, 58 prisoners of war have been captured by the Australian forces in Vietnam, making a total of 104 from June 1965 when the (1) How many agreements have been entered into with foreign powers for the establishment of defence bases in Australian territories.

169,Mr Fairhall,The answer to fhe honour,178,Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme Percentage Of Scholars Receiving Living Allowance 1951 To 1968
170,Mr Fairhall,"The answer to the honourForces in Vietnam, to assess American troops in the war zones, bas reported that (a) 40% of American losses were due to mistakes of their own captains, lieutenants and platoon sergeants, (b) too many decisions that were essentially tactical in nature were made by political leaders for political reasons and made no military sense whatsoever and (c) the halt in the bombing of North Vietnam, ordered last year by President Johnson, was purely a tactical decision made for political reasons. (2) If so, are Australian troop movements in Vietnam governed similarly by tactical decisions made, not by the Australian Military Commander in Vietnam but by the Australian Government in Canberra. (3) Will he state the conditions under which Australian troops perform their duties in Vietnam and what political directions have limited the freedom of action, on tactical grounds, of the Australian Commander to date. (4) Has thc Australian Military Commander any real authority at all. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) , (3), (4). The Government has imposed no restrictions on Australian Commanders in Vietnam which might inhibit tactical freedom of action. Broad directions for the conduct of operations by Australian forces in Vietnam are contained in a directive issued by the Australian Government. This directive gives the. Commander Australian Force Vietnam (COMAFV) overall command of units and personnel of the KAN, Australian Army, and RAAF assigned to him for duty in Vietnam, and charges him with the responsibility for their overall conduct and activities including their safety and well being. The directive also defines the approved locations, roles and employment of the respective elements of the force and the areas in which they may be employed, as agreed with the Republic of Vietnam and United Slates Authorities. Operational control of each element of the Australian force is assigned to the appropriate United States Naval, Army, or Air Force Commander who allocates the tasks or missions to the Australian commander concerned. In the case of the Army, the Australian Task Force Commander having been allocated tasks has complete freedom within his allotted area of operations for the employment of his force as the tactical situation dictates. There are no restrictions placed by the Government which would binder him in any way in this regard. Australian Democratic Labor Party: Defence Programme (Question No. 1610) Mr Calwell asked the Minister for Defence upon notice: (1) Is he able to say what is the estimated additional annual cost of implementing the Democratic Labor Partjdefence programme over the next ten years. (2) What is the cost of the Government's defence programme for 1968-69. honourable member's question is: (1) l f the right honourable member is referring to the programme outlined by the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate on 19th March, 1969, no estimate appears possible. (2) Expenditure including expenses from United Slates credits for 1968-69 was $ 1,164.697m. Vietnam (Question No. 1612) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Did he, during his press conference in Kuala Lumpur on 22nd April 1969 express the hope that on thc settlement of the Vietnam war at least some proportion of the millions of dollars being spent on the war by the countries mvolved could be diverted to economic assistance in ihe development, not only of South Viemam, but ot other countries in the region. (2) Does the Australian Government have anyspecific plan regarding the possibilities of diverting some proportion of its expenditure on the Vietnam war to external economic assistance; if so, what is that plan. (3) If no specific plan exist3, what steps does he intend to take to persuade the Government to formulate a clear programme on ihis matterand thus ensure that his expressed hope becomes a reality. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) It would be premature to formulate a detailed plan while there are so many uncertainties about the timing and specific points in the military and political outcome. (3) Thc whole question of economic aid to Vietnam after a cessation of the hostilities is being kept in mind. As appropriate occasion offers, 1 shall make public announcements about Australian aid to Vietnam after a cessation of the hostilities. Australia's current programme of economic assistance to Vietnam continues to meet some important needs of the Vietnamese people. It is contributing to the economic development of the country, and is providing substantial technical assistance and emergency relief. National Service: Apprentices (Question No. 1488) Mr Hansen asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that young men who bave completed their apprenticeship and are awaiting callup for national service are frequently faced with employment problems. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the reluctance of some employers to retain former apprentices, eitlier because of a policy of discharging them on completion of their apprenticeship or because of the likelihood of their being called-up for service, and that of other employers",178,Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme Percentage Of Scholars Receiving Living Allowance 1951 To 1968
