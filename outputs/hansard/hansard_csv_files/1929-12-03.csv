They have been used as pawns in the political game. They realize that now. I am quite aware that the step I am taking this afternoon may be the cause of my leaving this party, but I do not care whether that is so or not. I entered the party with honest, clean hands and, if necessary, I shall leave it with honest, clean hands and honest motives. The Government says it cannot do anything. J.f that is so, why did the members of it criticize the members of the previous Government ? hear! "" Hear hears "" from the honourable member for Warringah. We know definitely where honourable members opposite stood, but the electors of Australia were misled about the stand of this party. The people whom I represent are to-day in the position of having to continue a helpless struggle. It would be hopeless for them to continue the fight, and I say to them from my place in this chamber, "" It is of no use for you to continue to struggle further."" My people were deserted by the party which proposed to protect them. Speeches were made by Labour members, myself included, from the benches opposite last session, of from fifteen minutes to sixty minutes duration, to the effect that the Bruce-Page Government had been guilty of cruel and callous actions in respect of the coalminers, in that it had not attempted to do anything to relieve the situation. A good deal was said about the breaking of awards. No one can deny that the coal owners have deliberately broken the awards. said that it cannot do anything. It says that it has no constitutional power to act. I believe that if it had had the courage to resume the mines and open them and had allowed the coal-owners to test the constitutionality of its action, it would have caused the fall of the Bavin Government. It would have forced that Government to the country and the people would have rejected it, because they would not stand for the coal-owners starving the miners into submission. During the recent election campaign I spoke in ings of my constituents. In four of those five electorates seats were won for the Labour party. The people realized that I had stood up and fought the Bruce Page Government. But now the chickens are coming home to roost. What has this Government done? It"" has not done any more than the Bruce-Page Government did. In these circumstances the members of it were not justified in criticising the previous Government. There was no need to encourage me to do it. I know f u ll well that the people who listened to prominent members of face the music. I know that some of them will be asked for their resignations. These people listened to the promises that were made on behalf of the Labour party and the promises appealed to them. Notwithstanding the suffering and poverty of the poor, unfortunate coal-miners they provided £1,000 for the purpose of assisting to fight the election campaign in New South Wales. It is now apparent that that money was got practically under false pretences, because nothing has been done to help the miners. I have heard a lot in this House about extremism. I have never been an extremist, and have never preached an extreme policy. I have always been a member of the rank and file of the Labour party. I have never held an official position. I came direct from, the rank and file to this chamber. I have always tried to combat the extreme elements in (the Miners Federation. There are a few extremists in that federation I admit, but they are not nearly so extreme as some honourable members of this House thought it Yet this Government has necessary to be to secure election. I remember reading some time ago, in a book written by the present Minister for Health( Mr Anstey), something to this effect: "" If you desire to stop a man from being extreme, if you hear a man singing revolutionary songs outside your house, the best thing to do is not to stone him, nor to send for a policeman, but to bring him inside and give him a feed. If you put something in his pocket, his singing of revolutionary songs will become weaker, until it will cease altogether.""",11,Opposition Members Hear Hear
12,Mr Abchdale,,12,Parkhill Hear The Labour Party To Day Have Got To
13,Mr James,"I do not require anyThat has proved to be true when applied to some members of this party, who have beeu brought inside the door and have had a feed and something put into their pockets. Their song of revolution and their militancy have become weaker, and we shall finally hoar them no more. I say further that this is a time when we should have strong men in the Labour party. I have here a poem which I have clipped from a newspaper, the sentiments of which can well be applied to the whole of those who sit on this side. It reads:GIVE ITS MEN. God give us men! A time like this demands Strong wills, clear heads, true hearts, and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not k ill ; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions, and a will; Men who have honour; men who will not lie. For while the rabble, with their narrow creeds, Their large professions, and their little deeds, opposite, and to disregard their taunt that Wrangle in selfish strife, Lo! Freedom sleeps, Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice weeps. On the northern coal-fields of New South Wales justice weeps at the plight of the wives and children of the men who have had so long and bitter a struggle. Apparently, with the exception of myself, nobody on this side has the courage to stand up now as he stood up when he was in Opposition. It grieves me to find that it remained for honourable members opposite to provide me with an opportunity to speak on this matter. any Opposition member, and none of them knew that I proposed to take this step to-day. But I iiave a duty to perform To-morrow, meetings are to be held on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales to decide whether the men w ill accept a reduction of their wages. When I left those coal-fields yesterday I knew that the proposals that were to be placed before the men would not be accepted by them. I realize, however, that it is only a matter of carrying on for a few more weeks and they w ill be belted into submission. They are being belted into submission to-day. Do honourable members stand for the upholding of law and order? It is not so long since a motion of censure was launched in this House against the late Government for its withdrawal of a prosecution that had been instituted against John Brown. I Mr James. supported that motion. Has this Government prosecuted John-Brown? It has not. why it has not done so. not. member ought to do so. member want me to divulge thing3 thai I was pledged in caucus not to divulge? If the Leader of the Government permits I shall do so. I ask the honourable member not to challenge me to break my pledges. No decision has been come to. Eor over a week I have been prepared to take this action, but have put it off again and again. I had to put up with jeers from honourable members who sit I am shackled; but I strenuously resist the assertion that I am not game. I am as game as any person who sits in t h i House. has actuated me. I am actuated by honest motives, and a desire to see that the people whom I represent are not crucified any further. Honourable members .who sit on this side went through the coalfields with me, saw the poverty and suffering that exists there, and made speeches mentioning that the world looked on with I d i d not approach horror when nations adopted the principle of the blockade, but that this food blockade on the miners and their children was infinitely worse. They then went throughout Australia advocating the cause of the miners. Why? D i d they not wish the electors to believe that if Labour were returned to power that suffering would cease and there would be a resumption of work on a pre-stoppage basis? That is uot what is now proposed. A t 1 o'clock on the morning of the 22nd March last, I contributed to a debate that took place in this chamber. I was followed by the present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) who, in the course of his short speech, saidA month has passed, and we have not had a further announcement on the subject.

19,Mr James,"It is not that whiclirepeatedly refused to acknowledge the responsibility of the Commonwealth to people who are in want. I tell him that if ever there was au occasion when the coffers of the Commonwealth should be opened it is now, for the purpared to take any action in fulfilment of pose of granting relief to those 12,000 miners who, with their wives and families, are on the brink of starvation. I urge the Prime Minister to expedite the investigation into the industry. As these miners have been used for political purposes, I ask this House to do something on their behalf. The Christmas season is fast approaching, and the least that we can do is to grant these starving women and children the sum of £25,000 to relieve them, from the distress from which they are suffering at the moment. There should uot be a dissentient voice against that suggestion. I do not ask for this with a view to enabling the miners to continue the struggle. I realize nowthat it is a hopeless struggle j and their leaders also know that it is useless to continue it. I am big enough to go back to them before the meetings take place and advise them not to stand out any longer. I wish it to be understood quite clearly that, although I have criticized the Government of which I am a member, I have no intention of crossing the floor of this House. I would never .join any of the parties that sit opposite. There is no honourable member there who appeals to me. I may be a lone figure, yet even if I am kicked out of this party I shall join no other over there. But when politicians go on the hustings and say they can do something in the interests of suffering miners I defy any person to attempt to deprive me of the opportunity to say that they should at least stand up to their professions. It would have been far better for this Government to test the legality of taking over the mines and working them. Far better would it have been to die fighting than to go down without a fight. In conclusion, I hope that the Government will take to heart this criticism that I am levelling against them, and that, on any future occasion when they go on the hustings, they will not make rash promises. We frequently find that promises are made but are not fulfilled. I have not made a personal attack upon any member of my party. I believe that every one of them is as guilty as are our leaders. They used the coal position, they used the sufferings, of these people, to get them where they are to-day; yet we find that, having landed the job, they are not pretheir promises. should speak for himself. self. I know ful l well that there was not one speaker iu the Labour cause who did not mention the prosecution of John Brown, or the position on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales, during the recent election campaign. Those subjects were the genesis of that election. The prosecution of John Brown could not be dissociated from the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the arbitration field. We all knew that the award of the miners stood, so long as the Federal Arbitration Court was retained. In my opinion, behind the mind of the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when he brought down the bill for the abolition of that court, was .a desire to get rid of the miners' award, so that the Bavin Government's proposals could be put into operation. While the award stood, the miners had to be paid in accordance with it ; therefore, it was considered necessary by the late Government that the award should be removed. The election was held, but the award still stands. We claim to-day to be upholders of law and order, and yet we allow the mine-owners wilfully to break the conditions of that award, and by starving women and children to force the miners to accept a reduction in wages. That is the position, in a nutshell, so far as the Labour party is concerned. We have fallen down on the job. We have not carried out our promises to bring about a resumption of operations in the industry on a pre-stop basis. It is no use our telling the people in the future that we can do a certain thing, because they will not believe us. Look at the effect that our inaction will have on the Labour party in New South Wales. Our party will soon be seeking the suffrages of the people in that State. The State Government has power to cancel the leases of the mine-owners. Again, Labour candidates will tell the people that they will bring about a resumption of operations on pre-stop conditions, if they are returned to power; but the people will disbelieve",13,Parkhill Hear The Labour Party To Day Have Got To

21,Mr James,"I am speaking for mytheni, because it was said by members of the party iu this House that, if they were returned to power, work would be resumed on the basis of the conditions that obtained prior to the cessation of operations. I invite those honourable members who have some knowledge of the constitutional position, to answer a question. If certain ferocious animals were protected by law, and honourable members saw them devouring helpless women and children, or submitting them to a process of starvation, would they hesitate to take up a rifle and shoot those animals, regardless of the law ? No; they would not. Then, I say that the Government should have proceeded to carry out its promise to bring about a resumption of work in the coal industry. That would have forced the owners to contest the constitutionality of its action. It would, no doubt, have been defeated in the High Court; but the party would, at least, have carried out its pledge to the best of its ability. It would have shown that its promises had been made in ' all honesty of purpose. ister) [3.35] -The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has taken the responsibility of moving the adjournment of the House at this stage. every honourable member. beyond that, and has made a number of charges against the Government. I disregard those charges, to some extent, and also excuse the honourable member, in a certain degree, for the toue in which some of his statements were uttered. realize that the honourable member feels his position keenly, because he represents a constituency that has suffered for eight or nine months through the situation in the coal industry. He has personally witnessed a struggle by men for a principle; they desire to retain the award that they have obtained from the Federal Arbitration Court. The honourable member has seen men, women and children suffer in consequence of the fight that they have made in upholding that principle. While the sympathies of every one of us are touched by such a sight, those who feel it most intensely are they who have witnessed it most frequently, and, therefore, I make certain allowances for some of the statements made by the honourable member; but it is my duty to place the facts before the House in their true perspective. This Government has not been spineless in its attitude to the coal dispute. It has taken every possible step to bring about a successful settlement of the trouble without a breach of the award and without the sacrifice of one penny by the men employed in the industry. Never have we said that we could end the trouble. What we do say is that we have done everything that lay in our power, and all that we have done up to the present moment has met with the approval of the representatives of the miners affected by the stoppage of work Every proposal put forward by the miners' representatives has been acted upon by the Government; as a matter of fact, we have anticipated the suggestions that have been made. In the first place, the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) called the parties to the dispute together in order to bring about a settlement, and he very nearly succeeded in his object at that time. That was two days after the recent election. Frequent conferences were held with the representatives of the men. The Cabinet met and discussed the situation. We realized that an award was in operation, and we believed that the proper tribunal to consider the new situation that' had arisen was the body that had made that award-the tribunal appointed under the Industrial Peace Act. The Government decided to ask the chairman of that tribunal to call I a compulsory conference. Although much has been said about the pledges given by the Labour party to the people of this country, one thing stood out prominently among our pledges, and that was that we stood for the maintenance of the Arbitration Court, and for the principle of conciliation, and every step that we have taken has been in accordance with the pledges given by us to the people. The honourable member for Hunter hinted at something that he could reveal from the proceedings at caucus meetings. I give him liberty to reveal it.",14,Parkhill Hear The Labour Party To Day Have Got To

It was that it had pinned its faith to prosecutions. vernment turned down the same arguI t launched prosecutions against the unions every time it had an opportunity to do so. It pursued unionists with vindictiveness, but when it was confronted with law-breaking on the employers' side it refused to act. Contrast that with our attitude. We have not instituted prosecutions which would have become persecutions, and which would be of no avail in the settlement of industrial disputes. We have all along taken up the attitude that no good is served by enforcing the penal sections of the act, and we fought the enactment of those provisions with all our strength.. We opposed such penal sections, whether they applied to employees in the case of strikes, or to employers in the case of lockouts. The present Opposition, when in power, believed in prosecutions in the case of the men, but did not apply them to the employers. Our attitude throughout has been consistent. Let me go further: The day after cabinet decided to call a compulsory conference of the parties to this dispute, we were waited upon by a deputation representing the miners, introduced by the honorahle member for Hunter( Mr James). The deputation informed us that they did not wish us to go on with the prosecution of any of the owners. tion, and it was not my place to put forward personal views which might be in not opposition to those of the deputation. of the deputation whether I was correct in assuming that they did not want the prosecution to be proceeded with. I invited every member of it, including the honourable member for Hunter, to express his opinion, and not one of them urged that the prosecution be renewed. I shall not wish it, and it was a sound reason. They said, and I agreed with them, that no useful purpose could be served by launching another prosecution. They said that it would only hold up the proceedings. I know what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) will say. He will say that that was the same reason advanced by Mr Bruce for withdrawing the prosecution. It does not lie with honourable members opposite, however, to make that easy retort, because their Goment when it was urged as a reason for withdrawing prosecutions against unions ists. We are not in that indefensible position. We have never refused to listen to reason, nor pressed on with a prosecution in 3j)ite of the arguments advanced against it. We come into court with clean hands on this question. No proposition put up to this Government by the miners has been turned down. Some wild suggestions have been made in irresponsible quarters, but never by the responsible leaders of the miners. Suggestions have been made that we should seize the mines, whether or not we had constitutional power to do so. We were urged to seize them, acquire them, or take them over; all those terms were used at different times. I now wish to tell the people of Australia, through this Parliament, that so long as I am Leader of the Government, we shall not act in any matter unconstitutionally, nor shall we administer the law against one side and not against another in any dispute. We have throughout this dispute followed the path of conciliation. We have called conferences. We have taken every step possible to achieve peace, and I challenge the Opposition to say that we have done",15,Parkhill Hear The Labour Party To Day Have Got To

36,Mr Scullin,"I asked the memberswrong. ""When members of the Opposition stand up in glee to support a motion for the adjournment of this House, and comment on the fact that only three on the Government side supported the motion, my answer to them is that honourable members who sit behind the Government have a sense of responsibility to the country. They know that the greatest struggle that has ever taken place on the coal-fields has reached a crucial stage, and that this Parliament ought not to butt into the negotiations in such a way as to destroy what chance of peace exists. Whatever regret I may have, and it is a very keen regret, that the men have been forced to compromise on the question of wages, as Leader of the Labour party in this country, and as a unionist, I stand behind the leaders of the miners in the action they have taken. Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) apologized for the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) because of the feeling he introduced into this debate. cated that the honourable member for Hunter was deserving of the sympathy of this House. In my opinion' those who really deserve the sympathy of the Eouse are the members of the Government. I doubt whether the members of any other Government since this Parliament began have ever been placed in a. more degrading position than that in which the present Ministers find themselves in to-day. First,there was the extraordinary spectacle which this chamber presented when the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) rose to move the adjournment. ported from those richly filled benches behind the Government by only two honourable members, and those two, significently enough, represent coal-mining constituencies. It was the more extraordinary when we recall that when the honourable member rose to move a similar motion from this side of the House, every other honourable member of his party rose to support him. I rejoice that we on this side of the House were able to give him his opportunity. I am exceedingly pleased about it, not because I wish to embarrass honourable members on the other side, but because we, on this side of the House, learned during the last Parliament greatly to respect the honourable member for Hunter. Although he attacked us bitterly week after week, we came to have a complete trust in his sincerity, and we supported gladly to-day his motion for adjournment. I do not quarrel with the Government in not openly opposing the tentative settlement on the Northern coalfields; we were ourselves working towards a settlement on those lines nine or ten months ago. We accepted the figures which Mr Bavin depended on. We believed that a reduction in hewing rates was inevitable, and. we sought to bring it about by a contribution of Commonwealth money which would effect a reduction in the price of coal. Knowing that we had nothing to offer to the northern miners we made no false promises to them; we were honest throughout. As was stated by us and as events have proved, the Commonwealth Government is powerless to do anything for the miners. But members of the He indipresent Ministry have not the political honesty to say so. On the contrary, they have exploited the unfortunate, workless, starving people on the northern fields, as no body of necessitous persons has ever been exploited before in an Australian election. The Prime Minister has stated that no extravagant promises were made to the northern miners, and that he will abide by constitutional practice. But what of the speech made by the present Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) at Muswellbrook, and reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 7th October? He was supvernment say about Walsh and Johnson in a previous election campaign? by us we made no attempt to exploit starving people. I quote from the Sydney Morning HeraldMr Theodore said that if Labour were returned, the mines on the northern coal-fields would be reopened in a fortnight. Asked how he would do this he said that the Commonwealth Parliament had sufficient power to bring about a resumption of work. The mere fact that a Labour Government was in office would soon move the owners to open the mines. To-day the Prime Minister speaks of the constitutional limitations of this Parliament. At the conference of mine-owners and representatives of the miners, which",16,Cobseb Wha T Innow Tell Honourable Members Why They Did

39,Mr Gullett,"Whateve r was saidthe Treasurer convened immediately after he assumed office, the honourable gentleman frankly admitted that he had no policy or .proposals to put before the delegates. The last, Ministry at no time exploited the miners. If it failed them, it did so supported by honourable members who honestly. It never believed that the Commonwealth, with its present constitutional powers, had anything to offer to them. Representatives of the last Ministry did not approach the unfortunate miners, who, according to the honourable member for Hunter, are literally starving, and despicably wheedle £1,000 from them, their women and children, to spend on the election campaign. The Treasurer said that a Labour Government would open the mines within a fortnight of accepting office. Two months have elapsed and the Government has failed to do anything, and if the mines are reopened it will he upon almost the same terms as were available to the miners nine months ago. I was amused by the Prime Minister's explanations of the reasons why his party unanimously, I understand, decided not to prosecute John Brown. thing of the sort. according to the Prime Minister, actuated his party in not prosecuting John Brown, are identically the reasons which prompted the last Government to withdraw the prosecution of that gentleman. To-day the present Government is in exactly the same position as was its predecessors. Nothing would have preprevented the Government from relaunching the prosecution at any time during the last five or six weeks, and bringing John Brown to justice, if it had wished to do so. The honourable member for Hunter has my sympathy. I am glad that members of the Opposition were able to give the honourable member an opportunity to put the case of the miners before the House. Without our support he would have been gagged by the members of his own party. Perhaps the most unfortunate feature of this motion is the opportunity it has afforded members of the Opposition to make paltry political capital out of the trouble in the coal-mining industry. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), in moving the motion, has not exceeded his rights and privileges, but it is a strange anomaly that to-day he is stood loyally behind the last Government, which, in alliance with the Bavin Government of New South Wales, deliberately sought to destroy the economicconditions of the worker. They wereprepared to do anything and everything to beat the miners and other workers into economic subjection. To-day those honourable members, by professing sympathy with the miners, are exploiting politically an unfortunate.situation. TheDeputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the suffering of the women and children. That was mere exploitation; he and his supporters do not want the mines to be re-opened; neither does Mr Bavin. Had Jack Lang been Premier of New South Wales the mines would have been opened long ago. ' The presem trouble has been caused by the policy of Mr Bavin, who was supported in every way by the last Prime Minister. I regret the attitude of this Government. I realize the difficulties of the position; but if the Government owes a duty to anybody it is to the workers. Members of the Labour party declared repeatedly in this Parliament and on the hustings that the mine-owners had no justification for their action. The fact that the officials of the Miners Federation asked for a conference with the owners is beside the question. According to our bold utterances in Opposition and on the public platform, the mine-owners had no case, and the Government should have acted accordingly. If immediately after assuming office it had boldly declared that it would stand to the death behind the miners, as Mr Bavin and Mr Bruce showed plainly that they stood to the death behind the mine-owners, a psychology would have been created which would have led to the re-opening of the mines. The timidity of the Government has permitted the trouble to continue. If the Government does not represent the workers it represents nobody. Surely an uncompromising declaration of its policy should have been made. It is quite true, as the Prime Minister has said, that he",17,Cobseb Wha T Innow Tell Honourable Members Why They Did

But we, sitting in Opposition at the time, challenged the assertion of the Government of the day that the Commonwealth authority was powerless, aud we declared in this House and on the hustings definitely and clearly that if we were elected to office the give an undertaking to put into operation mines would be re-opened. Eor my own part, although representing a mining constituency, and although three-fifths of my election meetings were held in mining centres, I did not cm one occasion promise that the mines would be re-opened if Labour attained oflice. At, who was a prominent official of the South Coast Miners Association, prevented two_ miners from asking me a question on that subject, because he said that no undertaking could be given. But I was told when the vote of confidence in me was moved, that a definite promise had been gratuitously given on behalf of the Labour party that the mines would be re-opened. Men, women and children who had been down in the depths of economic hell for five or six months were buoyed up by this promise; it was like a gleam of sunshine through the economic mist, and they were inspired to work energetically and enthusiastically for the return of labour candidates. They achieved a wonderful victory; Labour is in office, but if the mines are re-opened it will be upon conditions that the miners could have had on the very first day of the lockoutaccept a reduction of Is. per ton. tween the Is. and the 9d. now offered could have been the subject of negotiation. If they accept the conditions which are now recommended to them, they will be surrendering a fundamental principle of industrial unionism; they will be agreeing to victimization by the employers, which was not one of the conditions of the proposals first made to the miners. It is not too late for the Government to save the situation. Let it pass through this Parliament before Christmas a bill for a referendum to give to the Commonwealth Parliament complete industrial powers, promising that if those powers are granted the dispute in the mining industry will be settled as it should be. Some months will have to elapse before a referendum can be taken, but despite what the miners may be saying to-day in their disappointment, they still trust this Government, and if the Prime Minister will that plank of our platform which provides for seeking fuller industrial powers for the Commonwealth Parliament, I believe that the mines will be re-opened almost immediately. If the Government asked for the power to take these mines away from the one meeting the , chairman, avaricious mine-owners, who not only are exploiting the miners to-day, but exploited the country to the extent of between £7,000,000 and £10,000,000 during the war years, I believe that it would be given it. A move of the nature I have suggested would be acclaimed by the miners everywhere. Let me assure honourable members opposite that these men still believe in this Government; but it would be wise for the Prime Minister to make provision before Christmas for the taking of the proposed referendum early in the new year. The Prime Minister has stated that many wild proposals had been made, but none had been accepted. I submit that the proposal that I have made is sound and worthy of acceptance. One other thing that should be done is to terminate the investigation of that abomination, called a royal commission, which is at present inquiring into the coal industry in Sydney. It is nothing but a frame-up between the Bruce-Page Government and the Bavin Government. Its object is to prevent the people from learning the true history of coal-mining in Australia. Its investigations are a travesty upon justice. The commission, it is well known, allowed Mr John Brown to include in his statement of the costs of hewing coal the expense of upkeep of three mines which had not worked -for twelve months. He was also permitted to include in his figures a considerable amount for old rusty trucks, which had",18,Cobseb Wha T Innow Tell Honourable Members Why They Did

45,Mr Lazzarini,"The difference bebeen in disuse for years. For every reason, tbe present royal commission sbould be terminated, and a body in which the public would have confidence set up in its place to make a speedy inquiry into the true position of the industry, the cost of production, the extent of the profits, and the degree to which stock has been watered and capital inflated. If , coincident with the making of such an inquiry, a referendum were held with the object of obtaining full industrial powers for the Commonwealth, the miners would accept the conditions which had been laid down, because they would know that the situation could only last for three or four months. It is high time that the Government took over the coal-mines and worked them as a national asset for the benefit of the nation. Naturally, the coalminers are disappointed that their nine months' struggle has been fruitless, and in their present state of mind they may pass certain ""resolutions; but their heart is award. Now we find that the coal-miners sound-as sound as ever it was. I beseech and implore the Prime Minister to take action along the lines I have suggested. If he does so, the -well-being of the coal industry will be assured. The coal-miners know that the Government is composed of earnest-minded men, who will be strong and capable enough to do what is necessary to cure the country of the economic dry rot from which it is suffering, and to bring in an era of prosperity; but I ask that speedy action should be taken to this end. [4.10] -The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has tried to find excuses for the failure of the Government to restore harmony in the coal mining industry, but the object of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr about a settlement of the dispute. It has James), in introducing this discussion, was to condemn the Government for having broken its election pledges and to get something done immediately to relieve the distress of the miners and their wives and children. By assuring us that the heart of the miners was still sound, the previous speaker made it quite clear that he was more concerned about how the miners would cast their votes in the future than about relieving their distress at present. It cannot be gainsaid that every member of the Labour party opposite who was a member of the last Parliament must bear responsibility in no small degree for the continuation of the coal dispute, for they have not fulfilled the promises which they made. They led the miners to believe that it was only necessary to place a Labour Government in office to restore peace in the industry. During the last Parliament, the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, through its secretary, Mr Norman Makin, forwarded to the unions concerned, the following motionThis meeting of tlie Federal Parliamentary Labour party congratulates the rank and file of the miners and timber workers on their splendid unity against the general attack on wages and hours. It is strange, therefore, that within the first week of the assumption of office by this Government, the timber workers of New South Wales were advised to accept the increased hours proposed in the Lukin have been called upon to accept a reduction of their wages. This does not seem to indicate a fulfilment of the promises made to the electors by the Labour party during the last election. At a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall on the ISth February last, the present Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), moved the following motionThat this meeting condemns any increase in the working hours and any lowering of the wages and conditions of the workers in the Gommonwealth and pledges itself to support the timber workers in the present fight. Yet one of the first acts of the Labour Government was to enter into negotiations with the bosses of the trade unions to try to get the coal-miners to accept a reduction of wages. That is the only original thing the Government has done to bring not done anything to assist the industrialists generally, but has only sought the co-operation of the trade union bosses to urge the unfortunate strikers to accept something less than they could have got within a few days of the beginning of the trouble. The Government, all through, has worked through the bosses of the unions. member's boss?",19,Cobseb Wha T Innow Tell Honourable Members Why They Did

In his day and generation, he is ranging himself alongside that class of employer, who is endeavouring to bring about a reduction of the wage standard in this country.

Men were out of work, and women and children were suffering as a consequence of that lockout. During the time that I was a private member, I frequently heard the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), in good faith, urge the Government to do something to relieve the terrible distress that existed among the miners and their families. I give him f u l l credit for that action. I sympathized with him. occasion honourable members who now sit on that side gave expression to their sympathy with the conditions which lie revealed.

One was to implement the law to compel the mines to open and allow the miners to resume their work; the other was to pursue a policy of conciliation and argument designed to the same end.

I admit that this is ancient history; but it needs to be impressed on the minds of honourable members opposite, who are seeking to make political capital out of what has happened. They cannot avoid the charge, which we then preferred against them and which was partly responsible for placing them where they are to-day, namely that they had misused the legal processes of this country by instituting a prosecution against a man against whom their own Attorney-General and the Crown Law Department had decided, a prosecution would lie, and then, for political considerations, abandoned it,",21,Government Membebs N O

Is there any reason why the State officers who collect probate duties should not also collect the federal deceased persons' estate duties, and why these officers should not be similarly amalgamated? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Yes. The provisions of the various State laws on the subject are so diverse that any one form which could be devised to enable the whole of the information required by the various acts to be supplied would be so complicated as to defeat its own ends.

I have already indicated the course which I think should be adopted by giving contingent notice of my intention to move, after the second-reading is carried, that the bill be referred to a select committee to inquire especially into the probable effect which the embargo on the free export of gold w ill have on the maintenance of the gold standard in dore) described a few of the symptoms of the existing conditions, but did not attempt to get down to root causes in order that he might make an accurate diagnosis. We are entitled to hear his* diagnosis before we accept his prescription ; treatment without an accurate diagnosis may do more harm than good. The Commonwealth and the States owe about £520,000,000 in Great Britain, and the comments which have already appeared in the newspapers in the Old Country convey the impression of financial authorities there that these proposals are likely to be injurious rather than beneficial. The Financial Times is reported in the Argus of Saturday last as having described one passage in the Treasurer's speech as carrying a threat of direct official interference in financial matters which definitely accords with the socialistic view that banking policy is a national matter, and as such should be directed by the Government, but that journal added, "" this is likely to be viewed elsewhere w it h considerable misgiving.""

The sooner we understand that economic problems cannot be resolved by political intertended to discourage exports. Had we ference, the better for the community. I am not making a party political speech, but am trying to deal with the subject in the best interests of the country. The subthe buying of luxuries and unnecessary ject should be above party considerations, for it concerns, not this Government or that, nor this party or that, but the welfare of all the people. If we deal with it on sound lines the Commonwealth will advance, but if we deal with it unwisely we can never progress. When the Chancellor of the British Exchequer ( Mr Phillip Snowden) discussed these issues in October, he pointed out how involved they were, and pleaded for an attentive hearing, so that he might make himself understood. I also wish to place the situation clearly before honourable members. In order to do so I propose to use one or two illustrations. Let us assume that before the war"" a man of £10,000 invested at 7 per cent. His income was £700, and he lived at a certain standard of comfort within that income. As the result of the wastage caused by the war he lost £2,000 of his capital. If he still only received 7 an abnormal quantity of sugar. The per cent, from the remainder his income would be only £560 instead of £700. ID those circumstances he could do one of three things. He could re-adjust hia standard of living to his smaller income; or he could work harder and use his capital more profitably and so possibly make the £8,000 earn 9 per cent, instead of 7 per cent., which would return him the same income as formerly; or he could continue to live under the old conditions at the rate of £700 a year by drawing upon his capital to the extent of £140 a year. The last-mentioned course would bring him into difficulties sooner or later. it. It is not sufficient for us to do only I suggest that Australia has been following this course. She has been spending freely. Her low rate of interest has encouraged her people to indulge' in luxuries which possibly they could not afford. Prices have been maintained at a high level and imports have been attracted to the country. The conditions have been such that it has been impossible, under our Arbitration Court system, to give wages the same purchasing power as formerly. Nominal increases have been granted, but they have not been affective. -High prices under our tariff have also been wise we would have altered our policy, decreased our price levels by careful control of credit and discouraged goods from overseas. The remedy proposed in the bill is to concentrate all the gold in Australia in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank and then use it as an export, with the object of correcting our adverse balance of trade. If we do no more than that we shall not remedy the position. The mere taking of the gold from several places and putting it into one place will be of no use if we continue to spend just as much as formerly. In addition to concentrating and using gold to correct trade balances, we ought to do something to correct the internal position. I may be pardoned for employing a medical illustration to assist us to underor a nation had a capital stand the position. The symptoms of a man suffering from diabetes are a tremendous hunger and thirst. A sufferer from this complaint desires to be eating and drinking all the time: and at the same time passes result is that he does not get any improvement in his health from his food, but day by day grows weaker and weaker. If he does nothing but, eat and drink he can never hope to correct his disease, but * if he undergoes a course of internal treatment with the object of curing the cause of his disease, he will be able to retain the sugar in his body, and will gradually grow stronger. I suggest that it will not be sufficient for us merely to deal with the symptoms of the economic disease from which we are suffering; we must get to the root of what the Treasurer suggested-and , however wise the idea may be, I disagree with the method he proposes to adopt in this regard-w e must also attempt to correct our internal disorders. I believe that the only way this can be done is through the bank exchange rate. The speech of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer",31,Theodore

Mr Snowden dealt ""with several points that I ""wish to elaborate. putting, not only his private view, but also the official view of the British Treasury. In the course of his remarks he stated that for several years Great Britain had been steadily losing her gold. She was losing it to America because of the high rates that were being paid by speculators in New York. She was also losing it to Germany freely, because Germany was doing her best to rehabilitate her municipalities. Some of these municipalities were offering as much as 9 per cent, for the money that they needed, and the German Reserve Bank discount rate was 7 per cent. She was losing it also to France, because France was doing her best to call back the capital she had lost in overseas investments during her period of inflation. operation of all these factors caused Great Britain to lose about £4)0,000,000 in gold lust year. The action taken to prevent further loss was to raise the bank rate. The British Chancellor went on to observe that the effect of action taken to correct a particular financial situation was not always what was expected, and added that the credit of the British Government stood just as high that day as it had stood before the bank rate was raised a week earlier. It might have been expected, for instance, that an increase in the bank rate would adversely affect employment, but that was not the British experience. Mr and our deposits by only £10,000,000, Snowden pointed out that three days before the bank rate was raised last February the number of registered unemployed was 1,369,000. Two months later it had dropped to 1,178,000, and it had continued to fall except for a slight seasonal increase in August. prior to the date of the Chancellor's speech, the number of unemployed was 200,000 Jess than at any time since the bank rate was raised in February. He proceededFor five months before the bank rate was raised in February the volume of employment has been constant at 104. After the bank rate was raised, it began to rise, and had risen continuously up to tlie present time, standing last month at the index figure of 107. Mr Snowden went on to say that it might have been expected that the increased rate would affect export trade, but that had not been the case. His remarks under that heading were as folHe was lows :In February, the export of domestic produstion was £53,605,000; in August, the figure was £03,000,000. He did not wish to convey the impression that he had produced those figures to show that improvement was due to the rise in the bank rate. But, on the other hand, they showed that the disastrous results which were then foretold certainly did not appear to have been realized. Another good effect of a higher bank rate was the discouragement of speculation. discussion lead us? making these remarks is to urge the Government to let the bank rate and the exchange position settle themselves without any governmental interference. The of interference. see the bill passed in such a way that there could be no possibililty of political control over our trade or currency or gold reserves. There can be no doubt that the retention of our high price levels and low bank rate has encouraged importations and has led our people to spend more money on luxuries than should have been spent. Eighteen months ago, New Zealand was in a position something like our position of to-day. Last year, our bank advances increased by £30,000,000 which ratio is altogether out of proportion. In March, 1927, it was found that the advances by the New Zealand banks were seriously in excess of the deposits. The bank rate was then raised by per cent. The result was that by June, 1928, A week the deposits were £9,500,000 in excess of the advances. I submit that we could achieve the same desirable end by the same means; but it should be done by the banks without any government interference. As I have already pointed out, the position in Australia is that the price of the British basic wage articles is 23£ per cent, above the price in Great Britain.

This has been one of the ill-effects of keeping our interest rate low when trade conditions were against us. But we cannot continue to regard witli equanimity the fact that our bank deposits have diminished in proportion to our bank advances. There are three things that we can do to correct the situaof the honourable gentleman, because in tion. We can concentrate our gold; but, if the only result of our doing so is that we shall look upon it, and not use it, we shall be no better of f . Some countries have collected as much gold as possible and not used it. If it is used to assist our national credit or our foreign monetary position, it undoubtedly will he of extreme value. Our position can also be assisted by exporting the gold if necesferent methods he is aiming at the same sary, to ease our exchanges; but with that export there ought to be an automatic contraction of both the basis and the volume of credit. If that course is followed, as it will be if there is no governprovided machinery that would enable ment interference, our position will be righted automatically. culty will be caused by those who are engaging in speculation or risky ventures. The effect on those sound industries which are essential to the progress of this country, and which provide the great bulk of the employment that is offering, will be to make available larger advances, because the higher rates offered for deposits will attract more money to the banks. The result should be a repetition of what has happened in England-an increased employment ratio in Australia. I admit that the stupendous tariff that has been put on by this Government in the last couple of weeks will have a tendency in the opposite direction, because automatically price levels will be kept up. It is a matter of history that for a couple of years after the imposition of tariffs on such a large scale the resultant higher price levels have tended to increase unemployment. lowed upon the bringing down of the Massy Greene tariff, the unemployment percentage rose to 11.1, which was the highest in the history of Australia since federation. But leaving that aspect out of consideration, if what I have outlined is allowed to take place without government interference, we shall automatically right Dr. Karle Page. our position and be rendered capable of encouraging production and increasing employment. Let us now examine the methods that have been suggested by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore). In the first place he intends that all gold shall come into the hands of the Commonwealth Bank. I am the more interested in this proposal the last Parliament and during the recent election campaign I was castigated for having attempted to make the Commonwealth Bank a central bank, or a bankers' bank. If the Commonwealth Bank holds all the gold in Australia, and is the sole bank of issue, nothing can prevent it from being a central bank. Therefore, although the Treasurer is adopting difgoal that I sought to reach. I desired to make the Commonwealth Bank a central bank by evolution and practice, not by compulsion. I anticipated that if we it to function as a central bank, ultimately, and automatically it would do so The only diffiwith the goodwill of the other financial institutions in Australia. The Treasure] 1 desires to take a short cut, and to bring about this condition of affairs by compulsion. It is on that ground that I join issue with him. In matters of defence the Labour party says that there shall be no compulsion, and that one volunteer is worth nine or ten pressed men. I venture to suggest that one financial agent who voluntarily comes forward to help our financial position is worth nine or ten pressed agents, and that one sovereign given voluntarily to the central reserve will be of very much greater value to the credit and trade of Australia than would one that was taken compulsorily from the people who own it. The effect of the arbitrary commandeering of gold and the prevention of its export except by the executive authority of the Treasurer, whatIn the year which folever may be the motives behind or the immediate result of such action, will tend to generate in the community and the world generally the fear of an attack upon the fundamental basis of our national credit, and will make it possible to tamper with the currency in a way that I do not think the honourable gentleman desires. power to give. indeed. The Labour party has frequently been blessed with good ideas; but has translated them into action in such a way that their value has been destroyed. When the'last Government considered the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank, it examined the whole position very carefully, and decided to create machinery that would enable that bank to function as a central bank and to leave evolution to do the rest. In the belief that, if the Commonwealth Savings Bank remained part and parcel of the general bank, fear might be entertained that certain of its funds might not be sufficiently liquid to be freely available, the two institutions individually inconvertible, the object were separated. If it will be advantageous to the trade of Australia to have a further re-arrangement of. the functions of the Commonwealth Bank into a central banking bank and a trading branch, and the Treasurer will come down with proposals to separate them, a great deal of my objection to the requisitioning of gold will disappear, and he will have my hearty support in any endeavour to place the measure on the statute-book. If it was made abundantly clear that the gold which is to flow into the coffers of the Commonwealth Bank when altered in such a way is to be ear-marked exclusively for trading purposes, and not to back up a further issue of notes, and that the control of the bank is to be non-political, we should be able to give the Treasurer some support. If he took action in that direction he would improve greatly the financial machinery of Australia, and improve it in the direction which experience proves as wise. There is one point that the honourable gentleman should clear up. During the election campaign the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) stated that one of the first acts of the Labour party if it were returned to power would be to give the present directors of the bank notice of the termination statement was given wide publicity. When a judge has been appointed by one government, he does not vacate his oflice upon the accession to power of another government. The Government of which the present Commonwealth Treasurer was Premier appointed judges who still hold office despite the fact that another Government has come into power in Queensland. Public officials who are performing their duties satisfactorily should be absolutely free from political interference. The Treasurer should take an early opportuni'y to dissipate the impression caused by ihe statement of the honourable member fcr South Sydney. The honourable gentleman has pointed to the English practice as a precedent for this proposal, aud has urged that we should follow it as closely as possible. In Great Britain tlie £1 note has been made being to avoid the loss that results from the use of gold as a medium of ordinary currency in the hands of the people; but, if any person or institution has an amount of not less than £1,600 that he or it wishes to use for trading or industrial purposes, or to send abroad to stabilize his or its foreign monetary position, that value in gold can be procured from the Bank of England. To that extent, therefore, there is a convertible note in existence in the United Kingdom. That law was brought into force by the Gold Standard Act,. 1925. There is also in force the Currency and Bank Notes Act, 1928, which gives to the -Bank of England the power to (ake possession of gold to an amount not exceeding £10,000, except as to any part thereof which is bona fide held for immediate export. Consequently there is a definite line of division between the proposals we are now discussing and the English practice. Eor the information of honourable members. I shall read relevant sections that operate in England. The Gold Standard Act, 1925, enacts1. Unless and until His Majesty by proclamation otherwise directs(a) The Bank of England, notwithstanding in any act, shall not be bound to pay any note of the bank ( in this act referred to as "" a bank note"") in legal coin within the of their engagement. That meaning of section C of the Bank of England Act, 1833, and bank notes shall not cease to be legal tender by reason that the bank do not continue to pay bank notes in such legal coin.",34,Theodore
111,Mr Greqorv,It is a very dangerous,36,Theodore
112,Dr. Earle Page,"Very dangerous,2. So long as the preceding sub-section remains in force, the Bank of'England shall be bound to sell to any person who makes a demand in that behalf at the head office of the bank during the office hours of the bank, and pays the purchase price in any legal tender, gold bullion at the price of three pounds, seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny per ounce troy of gold of the standard of fineness prescribed for gold coin by the Coinage Act, 1870, but only in the form of bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy of fine gold. The C u r r e n c y and B a n k NotesA c t , 1928, contains f o l l o w in g p r o v is i o n : II . (1) With a view to the concentration of the gold reserves and to the securing of economy in the use of gold, the following provisions of this section shall have effect so loug as sub-section (1) of section one of the Gold Standard Act, 1925, remains in force. (2) Any person in the United Kingdom owning any gold coin or bullion to an amount exceeding ten thousand pounds in value shall, on being required so to do by notice in writing from the bank, forthwit h furnish to the bank in writing particulars of the gold coin and bullion owned by that person, and shall, if so required by the bank, sell to the bank the whole or any part of the said coin or bullion, other than any part thereof which is bona fide held for immediate export or which is bona fide required for industrial purposes, on payment there for by the bank, in the case of coin, of the nominal value thereof, and in the case of bullion, at the rate fixed in section four of the Bank Charter Act, 1844. It will thus be seen that there is a fundamental difference between those provisions and the Treasurer's proposal. mental difference? sentation of notes to the value of £1,600 a person can obtain in England a bar of gold which can be exported immediately. In Australia, under this measure no export will be permitted except with the consent of the Treasurer. In England one does not need to obtain the consent of the Treasurer or of any other person. There, funds held for immediate export are specifically excluded from the authority to commandeer; whereas here authority to place an embargo on export has been specifically included in the measure. enables the Bank of England to requisition gold except that held for immediate export, is intended to satisfy contracts previously entered into. Standard Act of 1925 made the individual note inconvertible-the smallest quantity of gold changed being 400 oz. troy. The Currency and Bank Notes Act was passed in 1928, and if £40,000,000 of gold went out of Great Britain last year, a very free export of gold must.have been possible during that time. If we can ensure as free an exchange of gold as in England much of my opposition to the bill will disappear. If the Treasurer is acting exactly on all fours with what has been done in England, I suggest that, so ""* far as possible, the actual text of the English act should be inserted in the present measure. We come to another point in which this bill differs materially from the English legislation, and, in my opinion, the difference is vital. In the bill as it stands, provision is made, as the Treasurer made clear in his statement, that the final word in connection with the export of gold shall be said by him as the executive head of the Treasury. I questioned him on the matter at the time, and he said that, irrespective of what the recommendation the Commonwealth Bank Board might be, he would have the last say in the matter, and take the sole responsibility for the action. This is a subject that should be removed as far as possible from political control. The export of gold must be dealt with by the bank rather than by anybody else, otherwise we shall strike a blow at the gold standard of the nation. There should be non-political control of the banking machinery. final word. wealth Bank Board should have it. The Treasurer made it quite clear that, despite what might be the recommendation of the board, he would exercise his executive authority. Treasurer would have power to act within his absolute discretion. I did not say that he would act contrary to the advice tendered. that the Treasurer should act on the recommendation of the board, the bill should plainly say so.",36,Theodore

So far as the Country party is concerned, we feel that free exchange is a matter of life and death to the great exporting interests of the Commonwealth, and, in my opinion, it has just as important an influence upon the general trade and commerce of the country. Our exporting interests are, to the extent of 96 per cent., concerned with primary industries, to which free exchange is vital. It is just as important to them as the air we breathe is essential to us. The bill should make it clear that the interests of those industries in this respect are amply safe-guarded. It seems to me that the bill does not ensure the convertibility of notes into gold. The Treasurer himself said that if a person obtained £1,000,0000 worth of gold in exchange for notes, it could be immediately requisitioned by the bank, and that means that the giving of the gold in the first place is merely a camouflage. Anything that prevented the free export of gold would destroy the convertibility of the currency. its convertibility, we cannot have the gold standard. We shall render ourselves liable, by a mere executive act, to all sorts of .exchange, monetary, and currency dangers to which we should not be sub-' ject were we on a free gold basis. We had some experience of that under the regime of the late Government, which brought about a return to a gold basis. In ""my opinion, one of the great achievements of that ministry was that it stood in line with the British Government in 1925 in the establishment of a gold standard. The return to gold immediately relieved the exchange position, through making Australian notes available here against London securities and gold. The exchange rate was reduced from £4 to 5s. per cent, within a month because of the possibility of a free exchange of gold, and the action of the Commonwealth Bank Board. But during the two years prior to that, when I was in charge of the Treasury, and m intimate association with the State Treasurers, I found that the exchange difficulties were almost insuperable. In fact, at the latter end of 1923, the State Governments were going on the market themselves, trying to buy or sell exchange. We found that, because of the different price levels in Australia, our £1 note represented quite a different value from the British £1 note. Although we had .sent goods to Great Britain, sometimes we could not get money back in payment for them. Exporters and importers did not know what prices they would finally receive in connection with their trading transactions. They did not know how or when they should he paid. The State Governments were endeavouring to keep men in employment by selling exchange on the open markets. This trouble was sufficiently serious inside the Empire, but also caused enormous difficulties for us regarding exchange with other countries. These disabilities were accentuated when we were dealing with foreign countries like. the United States of America, because the Australian paper £1 note had no common standard of value for comparison with the American dollar. Before the gold standard was re-established, Australian, British, and American standards differed so materially in their values that the banks in Australia preferred to import £10,000,000 of gold from America to settle exchanges, to going through the ordinary avenues of British exchange. If we had a similar experience again, as we conceivably might, by departing from the gold standard, we should for ever rue it, because of the damage that would be caused. The benefits of a common standard of value and a uniform medium of exchange are incalculable among the nations. We must maintain our gold standard at all costs. The only way to do that is to ensure the convertibility of our currency in Australia. The gold standard of a country has been defined as one in which, for all practical purposes, all kinds of money are ultimately converted into full-bodied gold money,",37,Theodore

That is the definition given by Professor Shields, a noted economist, and it is pracbody in Australia holds dear. If gold is tically the opinion given hy economists throughout the world. The English experience of the gold standard has brought practically every other country into line. A century ago, Britain was almost the only country with a gold standard; but, so great have its advantages proved there, that practically every other country has followed her example, some not completely, but all using gold as a uniform basis of exchange. Since 1844, the Bank Act of England has made the working of the gold standard automatic and independent of government management. The gold standard has been effectively maintained, because the principle of convertibility has been observed. The conversion of gold into notes is deprived of all its virtues when a law against it3 export operates. In England there is no embargo on export; but this bill prevents the export of gold, and I cannot see what great advantage there would be in placing such an embargo on it, if the Commonwealth Bank is to be able to requisition practically all the gold in the Commonwealth. Surely, if it is to be a bank of exchange, it will handle the matter automatically, and without compulsion and at competitive rates. In such circumstances, why should we introduce a provision that will most certainly do harm? This proposal is causing alarm among the financial authorities both here and in other parts of the world generally. I can see no tangible advantage in such an embargo; but there is the possibility of danger. There is no advantage in piling up gold merely to look at it. It might be used for London exchanges, or we could employ it as the basis for a further issue of notes. There is an arrangement between the central bank and the States moving it about? to move it. shipment of gold that was made recently? gold to other countries because we need it badly to get credits there.' If we interfere with the freedom of trade in gold we shall very materially interfere with those principles that everynot used for the purpose mentioned, it could be employed as the basis of additional issues of paper money. Without question there is a strong desire among some members of the Labour party to solve our problems by the short cut; of a further issue of paper money. If we put an embargo on the export of gold, wu might meet dangers which we now automatically escape. Honourable members who advocate that course should remember the experience of all countries that have adopted it . The prices of commodities rise according to the extent of the new circulation of notes. When prices rise the first result is an increase in profits of trade. Therei -j always a delay in the consequent increase of wages, and it is only when prices begin to fall again that wages get to their proper level. A time of falling prices is better for the workers than when money wages are rising. If there were a further issue of notes, followed by a rise in prices, the immediate effect on wage-earner3 would be disastrous. During a time of rapidly rising prices, with wages always lagging behind, there has always been an increase of industrial unrest. That has always been the case, despite the fact that wages ultimately tend to rise, but not as quickly as prices. on bond-holders ? be a depreciation of the value of the bonds in Australia. If we were deliberately to inflate the currency for this purpose we should be guilty of an act of spoliation, and of a breach of faith with the bond-holders. I am sure that the Treasurer would be one of the first to dissociate himself from any such suggestion. The effect would be to make it practically impossible to get money again in similar circumstances. A deliberate increase of the note issue is a disguised form of increasing indirect about the big taxation on the whole community. of inflating the currency to the point at. which it stood before we began to deflate it some time ago?",38,Theodore

' The first result of the action suggested by the honourable member would be a rise in prices throughout Australia. That would tend to encourage imports, the very thing which the Ministerf o r Customs seeks to prevent by increasing the tariff. . Wages would rise, but they would be always a lap or two behind prices. The economic position would be worse than it is now. There is no easy road to salvation that way. We cannot make a heaven on earth by issuing soft money, but only by doing hard work. We must produce more. The interjections of honourable members during, the debate have made it evident that this subject needs exhaustive investigation and discussion. Por that reason I urge caution, and a measure of delay. I have already given notice of my intention to move, after the second-reading, stage, that the matter be referred to a select committee. If we take a wrong step now it may land Australia in great difficulties. Already the proposed action of the Government is regarded with suspicion outside Australia. Nationalist and Country party propaganda. nothing about the matter u n t i l to-day, and I am sure that honourable members w ill acquit me of having said anything of a partisanship nature. It is unworthy of the Ministerf o r Home Affairs to impute this low motive. I trust that the Treasurer w ill accept my suggestion. I make it in no hostile spirit, but as a serious contribution to this discussion. Sitting suspended from 6.11 to S p.m. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) stated that most of our financial and commercial troubles commenced in 1923, and I asked him if he did not feel a great responsibility for what had happened. He replied that he was surprised that anybody should regard this matter from a party viewpoint; he was dealing w i th the economic situation purely in the interests of the Australian people. I repeat, however, that much of Australia's financial troubles have resulted almost directly from the partisan policy of the late Treasurer. Throughout his ministerial career he considered, almost exclusively, the private trading banks, the exploiting class and the rentiers or boud holders; whenever their interests conflicted with the interest of the Australian public and the Commonwealth Bank, which in the financial world represents the people, his influence was on the side of the private investors. argument in favour of depriving whoever may be Treasurer for the time being of the power to control the Commonwealth Bank? although this bill, like most financial measures, can be used to bolster up private financial institutions, it. does not give political power over that bank, but is designed in the interests of the Australian people generally. If , as the ex-Treasurer stated, our present troubles date from 1923, they were certainly accentuated by the proclamation of the 24th A p r i l , 1925, restoring the gold standard. D r .

The value of the pound note gradually declined during the war years and finally became more or less fixed at about 13s. 6d. When the gold standard was restored in 1925 the value jumped suddenly to 20s. 1925. gold from the Commonwealth was forbidden by proclamation under the War Precautions Act, Chinese at Port Darwin and elsewhere were detected trying to smuggle gold out of Australia. They knew that at Shanghai and Hong Kong they could get for each sovereign from 30s. to 32s. 6d. I had a personal experience of that appreciation of gold when returning from England in 1924. I had some gold with me and I was told at Colombo that if I went to a certain money changer he would give me for each sovereign an Australian pound note and 5s. in silver. I disposed of my sovereigns on those terms, and I was told that if I had gone to the pettah, or to the highest priced money-changer, I would have been paid 28s. It is acknowledged that during the war the pound note depreciated until it was worth only two-thirds of its nominal value. took place between 1920 and 1924 through the operations of the Australian Notes Board. of the pound note was, nevertheless, one-fourth, and on occasions during the war it was one-third. The proclamation restoring the gold standard in 1925 meant that although the Commonwealth had only received 13s. 6d. in the pound for the money borrowed overseas ithad to redeem its loan at 20s., or an increase of 33 per cent. For every £100 borrowed the Commonwealth had to pay back £133, and, although the interest decreased from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent., the effect of deflation was to make it, in effect, &i per cent. A similar position arose after the Napoleonic wars, when English currency depreciated to the extent of 22 per cent. Even the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) will respect the opinion of Eicardo, who was a recognized financial authority and writer on political economy. Speaking in the House of Commons on the 12th June, 1822, he saidI f in the year 1810 the value of .the currency had stood at 14s. for the pound"" note, whicli was the case in the year 1813, he should have thought that, on a balance of all the advantages and disadvantages of the case, it would have been as well to f i x the currency at the then value, according to which most of the existing contracts had been made; but when the currency was within 5 per eent. of its par value, he thought they had made the best selection in recurring to the old standard. The same view is repeated in his Protection to Agriculture, where he approved the restoration of the old standard when gold was £4 2s. per standard ounce, but added that, if it had been £5 10s., ""no measure could have been more inexpedient than to make so violent a change in all substituting engagements."" The meaning of that is that if the pound note had been within 5 or 10 per cent, of its proper value the disturbance of the economic and financial position of England through the return to the gold standard would not have been so serious, but as its value was only 14s. the deflation was disastrous to England. Similarly, the deflation of our currency has been disastrous to Australia. J. M . Keynes, in his Tract on Monetary Reform, saidThere should be no restoration of the gold standard unless the currency of a country is within 5 to 10 per cent, of its former value. . . . Tho vast issues of war loans have swamped the pre-war holdings of fixed interestbearing stocks, and society has largely adjusted itself to tlie new situation. To restore the value of pre-war holdings by deflation means enhancing at the same time the value of war and post-war holdings, and thereby raising the total claims of the rentier class not only beyond what they are entitled to, but to an intolerable proportion of tlie total income of the community. Indeed, justice, rightly weighed, comes down on the other side. Much the greater proportion of the money contracts still outstanding were entered into when money was worth more nearly what it is worth now than what it was worth in 1013.

An estimate of the volume of contracts now outstanding, classified accordto overturn the balance so far in the interests ing to their age, would show that some contracts are a day old, some are a month old, some are a year old, some are a decade old, and some are a century old, the great mass, howover, being of very recent origin. Consequently, the average, or centre of gravity, of the total existing indebtedness is probably always somewhat near the present. Before the war, Professor Fisher estimated, very roughly, that contracts in the United States were on the average about ono year old. When, therefore) the depreciation of the curthing whatever for the interests rency has lasted long enough for society to adjust itself to the new values, deflation is oven worse than inflation. Both arc "" unjust "" and disappoint reasonable expectation. But whereas inflation, by easing the burden of national debt and stimulating enterprise, has a little to throw into the other side of the balance, deflation has nothing . . . The ex-Treasurer admitted that contention. Angas( Mr Parsons) asked him byinterjection what would be the effect on new loan issues if the Commonwealth notes were again inflated. With a great amountI could almost say, in view of his past actions, ""show""-of indignation, the ex-Treasurer said that inflation would be grossly unfair to this community, and would be an act of repudiation. But what of his act of 1925? Was that not an act of repudiation to the Commonwealth? Did he not raise the interest of the bond-holders to 6 per cent, or 6^ per cent.? Has not the Commonwealth rights as well as the bondholders? The ex-Treasurer, in sponsoring that act, had in mind the interests of the moneyed and propertied classes in the community, and he served them to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. All who care to study this subject dispassionately and thoroughly must realize that the right honourable member made an immediate gift to the bond-holders of £133,000,000 when he caused the 1925 gazettal to be issued. In addition to that he increased the effective interest rate to 6^ per cent, although.it was generally supposed that it had been decreased to cent. The right honourable gentleman altogether overlooked the interests of the producers, although he is a leader of the Country party and claims to represent the farmers and men on the land generally. Let me quote Mr Keynes again. He saysLegislation is liable in these days of huge national debts expressed in legal tender money of the rentier that the burden of taxation becomes intolerable on the productive classes in the community. It means impoverishment to labour. I come now to another phase of the subject. The ex-Treasurer said that to concentrate the gold, as proposed in the bill, would be injurious to the trading banks. But have the trading banks cared anythe community in the past? Have they ever considered the welfare of the Commonwealth? Have they ever put any interests before their own? When thegold standard was re-established what did the banks do? They increased their gold holding by £10,500,000. The honourable member for from America. with their notes ? Fortunately the budget papers gave us some information on this point. The notes in circulation at the end of the financial year in 1924 totalled £56,890,000, but at the end of the financial, year in 1929 their value had decreased . to £42,258,000. Where have those notes gone? The decrease occurred in the holdings of the trading banksand not in the holdings of the public. Although between 1918 and 1928 the note holdings of the private banks decreased by £14,600,000, their gold holdings increased by £10,500,000. The private banks were able to grab the extra gold from the Commonwealth Bank because of the tragic act sponsored by the ex-Treasurer in 1925. bought most of their gold before the proclamation. with the notes?

150,Mr Crouch,"It is news to mostof this bill is that the Labour party wishes to protect the Commonwealth Bank and enable it to serve while the Opposition party wishes to serve a special class. That is not an ill-fouuded statement. It is common knowledge that the ex-Treasurer did his best during his period of office to cripple tlie Commonwealth Bank. For one thing, he divided it into two parts, and robbed it of the value of its savings bank business. He would have injured, it a great deal more had it not been for the strong protest of the directors of the bank and the Labour Opposition in this House. I u deference to the stand that was made at that time, the bank directorate's control of the Savings Bank was allowed to remain. The ex-Treasurer has always endeavoured to benefit the private banks --i the disadvantage of the Commonwealth Bank. He was afraid that the Commonwealth Bank would build up a large capital and so impress the nations of . the world. AVhy is it that during the last two and a half years the Commonwealth Bank has not established auy new branches ? The reason is that the Government has endeavoured to give effect to the views of Sir Ernest Harvey, tlie Comptroller of the Bank of England, who advocated that the Commonwealth Bank's functions should be limited to those of a bank reserve, and used solely to permit the private trading banks to use it to increase their business at the expense of the people. Previous to the ex-Treasurer interfering with the Commonwealth Bank, it. was gradually building up a substantial capital, but now its capital is only £4,61S,000. Before its redemption fund and reserve funds were seized for the purpose of relieving wealthy interests in the community from taxation, the bank was doing well; but now it cannot make much of a show, and its financial prestige has suffered for its capital is not sufficiThe Official Record of the Melbourne ently large. The ex-Treasurer took half the profits of the bank and applied them for the relief of taxation. sinking fund purposes. to take the ex-Treasurer's word for that; but I suppose that the right honourable gentleman will admit that if a sinking fund is built up by this means and its money is invested, it will not be the whole Commonwealth, necessary to impose such heavy taxation, and if taxation is decreased the trading banks will benefit in common with other interests in the community. To this extent, therefore, the Commonwealth Bank is being used to serve the interests of its rivals. To indicate how small the capital of the Commonwealth Bank is, I give the following details of the capital of various banking institutions:£ Commonwealth Bank .. 4,618,000 Bank of Australasia .. 8,950,000 Bank of New Soutli Wales 13,400,000 National Bank .. 8,100,000 Commercial Bank of Sydney 8,700,000 Bank of New Zealand .. 10,300,000 The Bank of New Zealand serves a very small population, yet it has a capital of £10,300,000. With its small capital the Commonwealth Bank is expected to do our exchange busiiiess with the world. The bank should have been allowed to retain its profits until its capital had been built up to £10,000,000 or £15,000,000. The Bank of England has been able to make London the financial centre of the world because of the huge capital it has at its command. It was a sorry error for the last Government to cripple the Commonwealth Bank by robbing it of its funds. That a Treasurer of the Commonwealth should have been responsible for such an act is deplorable. The right honourable gentleman would have served the community well had he allowed the banks' profits to accumulate. It cannot be expected that a puny bank with a yearly transferred capital will be able to do very much for us in the overseas markets. I should like to ask now why the last Government permitted the trading banks to escape their fair share of taxation ? Stock Exchange for February, 1928,which is the most recent issue I have been able to obtain, shows without doubt that these institutions have been able to avoid paying their fair share of the expenses of government. The Record observes that these trading banks made profits ranging from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent. I quote the following from an article which is headed:",42,Theodore

All dividends are exempt from State taxation in the hands of shareholders. The exemptions under the Federal Act are of two kinds:1. Rebate allowable in respect of "" exAustralian "" profits. The proportion of a dividend deemed to have been paid from profits earned outside Australia is exempt from federal taxation. This rebate attains very large proportions in some cases, and the value of this concession will be appreciated when it is remembered how very high are federal rates of taxation applicable to income from property. In other cases where the whole of the profits are earned outside Australia, such as in some Eastern tin companies, dividends are wholly exempt, notwithstanding the company is registered and the capital subscribed in Australia. I should like the Treasurer to note the amount of exemption that some of the trading banks receive. I give the following figures to show the proportion of dividend which is exempt from federal income tax:Bank of Adelaide Bank of Australasia Commercial Bank of Australia Tlie last-named bank pays a dividend of 15 per cent, on its ordinary shares. If I held 1,000 of its shares it would be necessary for me to return for income tax purposes not £150 but a little less than half that sum, because the bank gets the benefit of a rebate of 51.93 per cent.

Let me analyse the position. How is it that the English, Scottish and Australian Rank, for example, escapes taxation on 44.2 per cent, of its profits? That bank has in Australia deposits totalling £33,318,045, whereas its deposits outside of Australia amount to only £1,454,623. Is it not remarkable that it is able to make 44 per cent, of its profits on £1,454,623 and only 56 per cent, on £33,318,045? It must be remembered that it has no branches in New Zealand. Let us take the case of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, which also has no branches in New Zealand. Its deposits total £54,420,S76 in Australia, and £1,802,727 outside of Australia. Upon about one-fiftieth, or 2 per cent, of its external profits, it receives an exemption of 40 per cent. with it? they get away with it , and it is not my business to find out.

156,Mr Crouch,"I do not know howThe trading hanks should have this legislation put into operation against them so that our credit may be mobilized, and thus be of advantage to our producing interests. There is another direction in which I hope that the Treasurer will take action with the trading banks. In 1910 the Commonwealth Parliament passed a Note Issue Act. A return has been made, annually of the value of notes issued by the private banks and still in existence. In 1918 those banks, according to their sworn returus, held in Australia gold to the value of £224,739 against notes which they had issued. In 1928 a similar return showed that they had unredeemed notes to the value of £199,995. In that period they had paid back to the people of the Commonwealth only £24,744, an average of £2,474 annually. If they drew interest at 5 per cent, per annum on the £224,739 which they held in 1918 the return would be £13,550 yearly. Thus they have had the whole of the capital, and in addition £11,000 annually from interest on the notes they had issued. This bill should contain a provision empowering the Commonwealth Bank to give an indemnity for the amouut still outstanding. It is money which belongs to the people, and apparently the private banks may never pay it back, because the notes may not be presented. They are earning a greater sum in interest than they are paying back annually. The ex-Treasurer this afternoon gave us a very interesting speech on gold reserves. Those who read it will learn the mariner in which gold finally became the medium of exchange among commercial people. to keep other than the smallest possible reserve of gold. In 1892 Russia proposed to create a gold reserve, but found that the monetary disturbance would be so intense that it could not afford to do so. It was then a very deeply involved debtor nation, like Australia is to-day. What did it do? It said, ""We will create this gold reserve, but we will put it where it will earn a profit."" time Russia's two creditor nations were France and Great Britain. quently, instead of piling up the gold in St. Petersburg it bought securities in Mr Crouch. both London and Paris, and held them there. Every pound of those securities brought in a return. The Commonwealth Bank will lose revenue if it holds all Australia's gold in its vaults. That is what the United States of America have been doing. Other countries dig up gold and America buries it. That country has a gold reserve of £900,000,000, into which other nations of the world dip as they require funds, upon payment of certain rates of interest; but it is wholly unproductive. England tried to imitate the example of the United States of America, and lately approached fairly closely the margin of safety. For almost the first time in the history of modern finance London occupies second place in Europe in the amount of gold held as a reserve, because there is a greater reserve held in Paris. Gold is won by English speaking people in South Africa, Australia and elsewhere, and is sent to the United States of America, where it is buried in vaults. What would be the use of decreasing the profits of our bank by holding its gold in vaults, unless it were intended to increase the note issue, which would require an increased gold reserve? I am satisfied that the Treasurer has no intention to inflate the note issue. The Australian trading banks could have their source of credit in the gold held in this country by the Commonwealth Bank. ber is now arguing against the great principle of the bill. been indulging in preliminary observations and would ask the honourable memAustralia has no need ber not to jump until he reaches the stile. I say that the gold held by the Commonwealth Bank should be invested in London or New York, where our creditors are. The Treasurer is doing right in getting the gold together, and so long as it is held, it should be used in meeting our overseas obligations, so that we may derive benefit from it, as Russia did under the Czarist regime until 1916. At that Gold is only required for the settlement of external obligations. be more profitably employed than by rectifying the exchange position overseas ?",44,Theodore

If the honourable member looks up the returns of the hanks he will find that the sum of money at ual'l in London is enormous. The Note Issue Board has from £7,000,000 to £9,000,000 invested in London. I am not in favour of the proposed amendment. Why did not the late Treasurer have a select committee appointed in 1925, when he was doing much harm to the Commonwealth ? now to appoint such a committee? to support the appointment of a committee to investigate the whole financial position, but not on this hill, which is well considered and urgently necessary. We had the spectacle of the late Treasurer bringing down a party measure, and the suggestion is now made that the present Treasurer will administer this legislation on party lines. London itself is in a state of panic and depression that will seriously react on Australia, because we are absolutely dependent on London credit. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) knows that the matter under immediate consideration ""s too urgent to be referred to a select comThat shows clearly that the trading banks mittee. If he is not familiar with the financial position it might .be well to appoint a select committee to inform him and the whole Commonwealth of the true position.

I have not heard much criticism of a party nature. Even the trading banks have not raised any serious objections to the bill. Generally the banks that have made statements about it appear to have accepted its principles, subject to the proviso that, if their gold is taken from why that principle should be departed them, the Commonwealth will provide them with the exchange credit they require in carrying on the business of the country. The Treasurer has the precedent of the British act that was introduced hy a Conservative government. He is also supported hy a recommendation of the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The only criticism that I have noticed is with respect to those provisions in which the Treasurer has departed from the British practice, and has exceeded the recommendation of the Commonwealth Bank. He .told us, when he introduced the measure, that quite recently the British Parliament had conferred on the Bank of England power similar to that proposed to be given under this bill; but, as a matter of fact, the bill differs materially from the British measure. In the first place, in Great Britain the control of the finances is reserved for the Bank of England. It is not handed over to the Treasury, and the export of gold is not prohibited. The British act in section 11, sub-section 2, provides thatAny person in the United Kingdom owning any gold coin or bullion to an amount exceeding £10,000 in value shall, on being required so to do by notice in writing from the bank, forthwith furnish to the bank in writing particulars of the gold coin or bullion owned by that person, and shall, if so required by the bank, sell to the"" bank the whole or any part of the said coin or bullion, other than any part thereof which is bona fide held for immediate export, or which is bona fide required for industrial purposes. have not to yield up all their gold, but only such portion of it as may be required of them. They are permitted to retain all the gold that is bona fide required for industrial purposes. We know that gold is not largely used in payment for goods ally speaking, adjustments are made by a system of exchange, setting off one credit against another. Gold is only required adverse balance, and it is necessary to utilize it to correct that position. In England the right to use that gold, and hy that means to assist the industrial affairs of the country, is retained by the trading banks, and I can see no reason from in the present bill, unless the Treasurer adopts some scheme by which credit will be guaranteed to the trading banks. It will be noticed that in Great Britain the initiative is left with the bank; but in this bill the Treasurer proposes to take the initiative himself. It",45,Theodore

163,Mr Nairn (Perth) [8.52],"Th ewill be seen, by referring to proposed new section 7B, that where the Treasurer is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the currency or of the public credit of the Commonwealth, to obtain particulars of gold, coin and bullion held by persons in Australia, or to require the exchange of any gold so held for Australian notes, he may, by notice in writing, authorize the bank to require any person to furnish particulars of the gold, coin or bullion held by him, and exchange it for gold. Under the bill, the Treasurer will use the bank as the instrument for getting the gold, but the Treasurer will call upon the persons upon whom the bank will make these demands. The same principle is followed in proposed new section 7c, and I regard it> as causing the strongest objection there is to the bill. This section provides for prohibition of the export of gold; but in Great Britain there is no such embargo. It appears that the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) would oppose the retention of gold in this country, because he considers it necessary to export it as a matter of economy. The Treasurer, in this bill, authorizes the bank to make a report on all applications for the right to export gold; but he reserves to himself the absolute power to determine what shall be done with respect to every application. The proposed new section provides that the Treasurer "" may in his absolute, discretion approve or refuse approval to any application made under this section.""

That statement does not correctly Under the bill the Treasurer retains absolute discretion Not much objection can be taken to the bill on general terms, but fhe proposal of the Treasurer to keep control of the whole situation himself is fraught with danger. It would be very much better that the control of finance should be vested in some permanent institution such as a bank, tinder the Commonwealth Bank Act it is necessary for six of the seven members of the board to be commercial itr. Nairn. men. The present system ensures continuity of policy, and the directors are, so far as possible, free from political control. A Commonwealth Treasurer, of whatever political party, must be always subject to political pressure of some kind. It is not well that a Treasurer should have the opportunity of putting his personal ideas into effect for a period, and then for his policy to be entirely reversed after the next election. There is a particular reason why, at the present time, we should be careful about putting such extreme powers into the hands of the Treasurer. Next year the Government will be faced with the task of raising about £70,000,000 for the conversion of loans. That means that it will be a very great competitor, not only in the money market of Australia, but also in those of Britain and the United States of America. To the extent that it is a competitor, it will' reduce the volume of money available for carrying on the industries of the country. There is only a limited amount of capital available for investment, and if the Government takes most of that, the effect will be to starve the industrial concerns of the country. The Government proposes to institute a line of government-owned steamers to ply between Tasmania and the mainland, and that will involve the expenditure of a large sum. Many demands are at present being made on the Government for the The Treasurer led the relief of unemployment, which will involve further expenditure.

No useful purpose is served thereby. It is on a part with "" bulling "" and "" bearing"" the stock exchange market, and the effect is the same-to take millions of pounds out of the pockets of those who produce actual commodities. In this book the writer points out that in 1927 Britain transferred no less a sum than £6,000,000 in gold to America, while in the same year America transferred approximately £6,000,000 in gold to Britain, the actual marginal difference being approximately £190,000. gling of gold was done by the money bugs of the two countries whose business it is to deal in specie. I do not altogether blame the Treasurer for this proposed action, because he is probably merely following the British precedent. I hope that the Government here will go further, and effectively control the currency of the nation in the interests of the people. It must be done either now or later. By doing it quickly we may hope to l if t the depression from which this country is now suffering. This depression, economists tell us, is due to the fact that we have borrowed too much, and cannot afford to pay the interest. That is quite true, and again the burden falls on the workers of the country. Eigures dealing with the banking operations of Australia are astonishing. Ou £30,000,000 of paid-up capital the Associated Banks of Australia made £1,500,000 in 1917. The paid-up capital now of the same concerns is £60,000,000, and the profits last year were £4,000,000. The banks are not suffering as a result of the prevailing depression, but one effect of it is that John Brown has to force down the miners' wages because he cannot make a profit on the coal won by them from the bowels of the earth. In South Australia the conditions of unemployment are worse than at any other period in its history, they are a disgrace to Christianity, humanity, and civilization.

There is, I have tried to explain to you as best I could the reason for the recent increase in the bank rate. I do not profess to understand this question. Even Philip Snowden does not know the intricacies of the banking business; even he does not understand why or how the bank rates are increased or lowered by the trickery of those who manipulate the currency of the world. He continuedI know some people who think they do, and the vigour wit h which they express their views is generally in proportion to their ignorance of the subject. I quoted that passage for the purpose of This jugexciting the guffaws of honourable members opposite, and I have not been disappointed. I have read the debates that preceded the establishment of the Australian note issue, and I shall quote for the information of honourable members, the gloomy predictions of the ""knowalls"" of the then Liberal party. They said that the proposal to issue an inconvertible note was a wild-cat scheme, yet it has proved the salvation of Australia. To-day, members of the reactionary parties in this House sneer when I attempt to expose a system of finance, by which financial cormorants keep the workers in thraldom. Mr Snowden continuedHowever, there must be something wrong, and something which needs attention, when an orgy of speculation in a country 3,000 miles away can dislocate the financial system here and inflict grave suffering on the workers of practically every country in the world. Many honest toilers in Australia are feeling those effects to-day, and that is why the present Government must provide a remedy. I have advocated'such a policy from every platform, my party has promised it, and now I call upon it to deliver the goods. of the policy.

In 1924 there was £21,000,000 worth of notes of £3,000 denomination. Let no honourable member tell me that those notes went into circulation. The gold held hy the banks as a reserve against the notes amounted to £24,000,000. of June, 1929, the value of £1,000 notes was £5,015,000, and the gold reserves held by the' banks £22,152,497.

I crying in the wilderness"" at present; but seeing that the credit of this country has fallen from £59,000,000 to £42,000,000, I must confess that I cannot see that any harm would follow the printing of additional notes. I shall have more to say on this aspect of the subject on another occasion. I wish now to quote from a book entitled International Gold Movements by Paul Einzig. I am sorry that I cannot at the moment state Mr Einzig's qualifications, but I assure honourable members that he is thoroughly competent to deal with this subject and is not one of those of whom the Chancellor of the B r it i sh Exchequer ( MrP h ill ip Snowden) said that their vigour in utterance indicated their ignorance of the subject with which they were dealing. Mr Einzig is a. gentleman of international reputation on financial affairs. He wroteIn the ease of Great Britain, tlie deflationary the gold jugglers. effect of the abnormal efflux of gold can be neutralized through the application of Clause8 of the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, by virtue of whicli the fiduciary issue may be raised for a period not exceeding six mouths. The increase of the fiduciary issue would not in any way check the efflux of gold, but it would protect trade against the adverse effects of a decline of the gold stock. Contrary to what may appear to the superficial observer, an increase of the fiduciary* issue does not result in an increase of the active note circulation, but merely an increase of the part of the note issue which is covered with securities instead of gold. What does the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) say to that? It appears to me that we ought to use the printing press to provide the country with the currency that it needs. So long as we hold fast to the fetish of former Governments and borrow money and make book entries i u respect of which we pay £5 14s. 4d. per cent., we shall have difficulty in financing public undertakings. was permitted to print That cannot be allowed to go on too long. Some day the workers of Australia w ill awaken to the fact that they have been tricked, and when that time comes they w ill sweep right out of public life the persons responsible for such a system. On page SO of his book, Mr Einzig refers to the use of gold for internal monetary purposes. He says:Since the war, Great Britain and several know that I am "" a voice other countries have adopted a monetary system in which gold has practically ceased to play any part in the internal monetary sphere. The Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928 has dealt a final blow to the internal monetary use of gold in this country. The object of clause 11, empowering the Bank of England to buy any amount of gold held in this country in excess of £10,000, provided that it . is not wanted for bona fide industrial or export requirements, is to concentrate in the hands of the central institutions all gold available for monetary purposes, so as to provide for the requirements arising from the international use of gold. While before the war the domestic transactions of the bank-tli e issue and withdrawal of sovereigns to and from internal circulation-were of great importance, at present they are insignificant as compared with international gold movements. about the internal position. and that is why this bill has been introduced. The Government desires to do something to protect Australia against I come now to another shibboleth of the financers. We have been told time after time that when we borrow abroad Ave must take goods instead of gold. I contend that if we want gold we should demand and get it . Mr Einzig has some interesting remarks to make on this subject on page 20 of the same book. He saysAn unusual example of special transactions was provided by the gold exports of Brazil. Every Brazilian loan agreement concluded since 1927-whethe r by the Federal Government, State Governments, or municipal authoritieshas included a clause according to which the issuing houses have to transfer to Brazil the proceeds of the loans in the shape of actual",50,Theodore

When the loans were issued in the United States of America, gold was taken from New York, When they were issued in London' gold was usually shipped from South Africa. Brazil has shown, us what can be done. When she wants gold she demands it and gets it . I trust that it w ill not be long before we follow her good example. I do not expect my remarks on this subject to bear much f r u it immediately, but I trust that those who read Hansard w ill think over what I have said, and, in the interests of humanity do their best to scotch the gold jugglers. We must r i d our country of the market riggers, stock brokers, and gold jugglers who have hitherto fed upon it . This bill is divided into two parts. The first part seeks to entrust the Treasurer with power to authorize the Commonwealth Bank to requisition gold coin and bullion from persons and banks; the second part gives the Treasurer discretionary power to place an embargo upon the export of gold. An amendment of which the Treasurer has to-day given notice proposes to modify this discretionary power, for it provides that it shall be exercised only upon the recommendation of the Commonwealth Bank. It seems to me that the second part of the hill, which places our gold standard in jeopardy, is particularly dangerous. Great Britain first adopted the gold standard in 181G, the year after the battle of Waterloo, and she has retained it , except during the last war, for more than a century. The gold standard was the successor to the silver pound standard which dated back to before the Norman Conquest. The countries of Europe have been gradually adopting the gold standard unti l to-day it is almost in universal use. It is extraordinary, therefore, that a Government which has beeu in office for only a few weeks should in troduce a bill which may shake, to its very foundation a system of finance which has served GreatB r it a in so well for so long. Until the outbreak of the great war British bank notes could be immediately converted at the w ill of the holder into gold. This practice was temporarily abandoned during the war years, aud with it there appeared the most effective bar to inflation. connection, I quote the following passage fro m a book entitled Inflation, by Professor Shield Nicholson, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Edinburgh :If, however, experience had shown that the issues of notes by the banks as a part of their own credit system, ought to be limited, still more clearly had experience shown that the issues of paper money by the Government ought to be placed under tlie most stringent limitation. Again, if we appeal to experience we find that the most effective and tlie most beneficial form of the principle of limitation is the practical rule of immediate convertibility. So long as the paper money is subject to this practical limitation, and so long as the real limitation is not evaded by all sorts of suspensory devices, or by the control of the export or the use of gold, the other regulations matter very little. One hundred and fifty years ago Adam Smith, a very great authority on economies, in the Wealth of Nations, dealt with the evils that experience had shown to be associated, uot only with inconvertible notes, but also with suspended convertibility. As I understand the latter part of this bill, the Treasurer ( Mr. Theodore) proposes that he shall be authorized to suspend the convertibility of notes into gold. w ill have power to prevent the export of gold. That simply means the suspension of the convertibility of notes into gold. It would be of little use to convert notes into gold for internal circulation if one were debarred from using the gold for the main purpose for which it can be used, that is, the rectification of exchanges overseas. Eveni f this power is never used, the fact that Parliament has given the Treasurer authority to use it , undoubtedly w ill lead to a weakening of confidence aud an impairment, of our credit in the eyes of other nations. In his second-reading speech last Thursday, the Treasurer quoted from a letter sent to the Government by Sir Robert Gibson, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. Probably the honourable gentleman felt that the reading of that letter would create confidence in the minds of honourable In this members on both sides of the House, the inference being that in taking this",51,Theodore

193,Mr Paterson,"The Treasureraction the Government is merely carrying out what Sir Robert Gibson proposed. But one does not need to study the bill very deeply to realize that it goes very much further than that gentleman's proposal. posal put forward hy him. only does he not propose that an embargo shall he placed upon the export of gold, but he goes out of his way to point out the ill affects of such action. I quote the following extract from his letter:My board is of the opinion that the last resource which should be adopted would be of gold and the advantage of having a any course which meant even temporary degold standard. It reads:parture from the operation of the gold standard on the part of Australia. It must be obvious that the placing of an embargo upon the export of gold would mean a departure from the gold standard. The letter goes on to saySuch measure would reflect most adversely against Australia in respect of overseas credit, and incidentally have a most serious effect upon our abilities to raise loans abroad. That is his opinion in relation to the jeopardising of our gold standard. He then saysAs a measure which would very materially help the position in the meantine, and in addition, having regard to precedent, would in the opinion of the board be a sound measure of permanent legislation, my board definitely recommends your Government to consider immediately tbe bringing in of legislation on similar lines to that which now exists and is operating in England. It will be noticed that his pror posal is that we should copy the legislation in operation in .Great Britain. He begins his letter by pointing out how bad it would be for Australia if we were to shake the foundations of the gold standard by prohibiting the export of gold, and goes out of his way to show that the British legislation does not do what the Treasurer by this bill proposes to do, namely, place an embargo upon the export of gold. I make the following further quotation from his letter:I do not propose to traverse the effect of such legislation, as perusal of the acts referred to w i ll f u l ly acquaint you with the position, but I might briefly say that such legislation would place the Commonwealth Bank in immediate control of all gold in Australia by whomsoever held. Whilst this legislation in itself would not prevent exportation of gold from Australia, it would place the gold in Australia definitely in the control of the bank. Once placed in this position there would only be one authority in control of the gold in Australia. Those quotations will suffice to show honourable members that the proposal put forward by Sir Robert Gibson is being very greatly exceeded by the Treasurer. His letter does not propose that there shall be an embargo upon the export of gold. I shall now make a further quotation from the work Inflation by Professor Shield Nicholson, to show the danger of imposing an embargo upon the export To resume the main argument: Before the war the gold standard was effectively maintained in this country because the principle of convertibility was strictly observed. A t the small end of the system the proportion of bank notes to gold simply depended on the convenience of people. Any one who wished could change his bank notes for gold or get notes for his gold as he pleased. In cashing a cheque the option of the form of money-whethe r paper or gold or other coins-wa s left to the customer. Again, at the big end of tlie system, foreign countries could convert their claims into gold without let or hindrance. London, unlike some other capital cities, was strictly a free market for gold. The remarkable tiling about this free market was that the whole business was conducted on a less amount of gold kept in reserve than in other great monetary centres. The point was that, owing to the perfect convertibility of al l our forms of representative money, a stream of gold was always flowing in and flowing out, and the cistern never ran dry. Of course, on occasion of panic the reserve fell below that safety limit, but, as observed by the great Ricardo, "" Against such panics banks have no security on any system; at no time can there be in a bank or in a countvy as much specie or bullion as the moneyed individuals of such country have a right to demand."" Before the war it used to be said that this country had carried the economy of gold to the verge of danger, and warnings were constantly given that the central reserve should be increased. And yet in practice it was found that the methods adopted to replenish the central reserve in case of need were sufficient. Everything depended upon convertibility-no t on the piling up of great stores of gold. My final quotation is the following:We found out in this country by experience that the best way to allay a monetary panic was to pour out the reserves freely in the usual channels on the usual security. ""Beb o l d "" was the rule.",52,Theodore

The section continues:shall, on being required so to do by notice in writing from the Bank, forthwith furnish to tbe Bank in writing particulars of the gold coin and bullion owned by that person, and shall, if so required by the Bank, sell to the Bank the whole or any part of the said coin or bullion, other than any part thereof which is bona fide held for immediate export or which is bona fide required for industrial purposes, on payment there for by the bank, in the case of coin, of the nominal value thereof, and in the case of bullion, at the rate fixed in section four of the Bank Charter Act 1844.",53,Theodore

If a man is hoarding that quantity of gold and has no immediate need of it for the purposes of his business, or does not require it for export, the bank may call upon him to hand it over and receive paper money for it. But, if that man has any need to export it for business purposes, the section places no restriction on export. There is no export embargo in the British act, and to that extent there is a fundamental difference between this bill and the British measure, of which some honourable members seem to think it is a copy. The Government is going very much beyond the advice tendered by ""the Commonwealth Bank. in everything? but standard, and make it practically worthless, if we tinker with the convertibility of our notes into gold. After the war we got back to the gold standard, after considerable difficulty and delay, and the last thing we should now do would be to surrender any ground recovered on that occasion. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr interest on loans raised on an inflated Crouch) seems to regard the return to the gold standard as having been harmf u l to the primary producers. Ln 1925 we had an extremely adverse exchange in Great Britain, which was detrimentally trade. The exchange was against us to the extent of £4 per cent., whicli meant that, on every bushel of wheat sent to Great Britain at 6s. a bushel, the primary producers lost 3d., and on every pound of butter worth, say, Is. 6d., they lost 3d. when, we reverted to the gold standard? That adverse exchange of £4 per cent, dropped to 5s. per cent., and the loss on wlieat and butter practically disappeared immediately. What is the real object of the proposal to depart from the fundamental principle of a gold standard and convertibility? Is the object in mind the building up of gold reserves as a pretext for the printing of .'additional paper currency? so, I think that it would be well for the Treasurer to let us know it. An increase in the note issue would simply mean that the cost of living would again advance. Experience shows us that every time paper money is increased in any country beyond a certain point, the additional currency does not enable more goods to be purchased. The Treasurer is playing with fire, and I should like a lot more information from him in his reply. I am strongly in favour of the proposal of the Leader of the Country party that an inquiry should be made by a select committee before the bill is further proceeded with. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat said that the gold standard was restored in 1925, and that that resulted in immediate benefit. If a gold standard means immediate convertibility, no country has such a standard. The honorwe shall jeopardize the gold able member said that Great Britain had returned to a gold standard, and that, when Australia did so, the community benefited; but economists throughout the world agree that the economic woes from which Great, Britain is suffering to-day are due to an attempt to deflate back to gold. It is pointed out that this deflation has meant paying, with a deflated currency, currency. Arthur Kidston pointed out in 1917-18 what the bankers were scheming to do in Great Britain before the conclusion of the late war, and, in his lastpamphlet, he urged Britain to resist to affecting our export the utmost any attempt to deflate back to a gold standard.

In Australia, provision would have to be made for the What happened conversion to gold of £544,000,000. that immediate conversion is not demanded. ing of the currency history of Great Britain, and Australia enables me to speak, the gold standard has nothing to do with the export of gold, because gold is exported not as sovereigns, but as bullion.

I should not have spoken on this matter at all, were it not that we have heard such a lot during the debate about the gold basis, when no such thing as a gold basis really exists would have been very interesting if we could have heard the full-dress debate in the Government party room, revealing the real desire of the Government in regard to the note issue, and the wishes of honourable members generally on this matter. The honourable member who has just spoken referred to the great importance of the credit system generally in Australia, and the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), when speaking recently on the subject, said that it was the duty of the Government to utilize the credit of the Government through the note issue, and make money availahle for carrying out important work to relieve unemployment. that a pound note is a. promise to pay, and that we have to foot the bill no matter how many notes are issued? How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds prohibition. Hakes ill deeds done! What worries me is that when this measure is passed other legislation may follow of even greater importance. look upon this bill as one of the most important which has been before Parliament for a long time. It deals with the credit of the nation, and there is undoubtedly very grave danger in passing legislation of this kind without the fullest inquiry. that something on these lines be done, the Government has power to issue a proclamation prohibiting the export of gold, but it is not right to involve honourable members on this sid° of the House in the responsibility for such action until the matter has been fully investigated. member always urge procrastination? vantage of obtaining the opinion of persons conversant with a subject before passing legislation dealing with it. Probably they would be only too pleased to pass this measure, and learn afterwards what its effect was. I want, if possible, to learn the effect beforehand. Surely there is need for caution. Time and again I have advocated that we should set up a special finance committee in Parliament to deal with all financial measures, particularly those dealing with taxation. Taxation bills have frequently been passed which next year had to be amended, and great harm is so often done when ill-considered legislation is rushed through Parliament. Evidence should be taken by a committee on such matters, and a report made to the House. What objection can there be to a slight delay? It ought not to take more than a fortnight for a committee to conduct its investigations and present a report. As I said before, if the Government feels that the position is acute, and is prepared to take the responsibility, it has power to proclaim by order in council that gold must not be exported. Such a proIs he aware clamation could be repealed at any time it thought fit. An embargo was placed upon the export of gold from Australia at the beginning of the war. In 1922 a proclamation was issued repealing that Only a few months afterwards the embargo was re-imposed, the previous action having been premature. Things went on in that way until FebruI ary, 1925, when the banks were given authority, under certain conditions, to export gold. Later in 1925 a proclamation was issued making the export of gold free. There has been carelessness in the If it is urgently necessary drafting of this bill. The new provision in clause 2 is to follow section 7A of the principal act, which is the section empowering the Commonwealth Bank to acquire the business of other banks. It has really no connection with that section whatever. The proper place for it is after section 60A which deals with the",55,Theodore

Further evidence of carelessness in drafting is shown in the provision in proposed section 7B that any person may be required to exchange for Australian notes any gold coin or bullion held by him, whilst section 60H of the principal act provides that notes shall bear the promise of the Treasurer to redeem them in gold coin on demand at the head office of the bank. Two conflicting rights are being set up-first , the right of the bank to commandeer, and secondly the right of the note-holder to secure gold for all notes presented. vantage in that. The retention of section 60H maintains the convertibility of the note. in notes for gold coin or bullion requisitioned from me, I can present the notes at the Commonwealth Bank on the following day and demand gold for them. advantage of doing that if the gold could be commandeered by the bank at any time, and could not be exported without permission ? The honourable member might urge the same criticism against the British legislation. Most financiers agree with the contention of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that the Commonwealth Bank should be made a central bank, and I was in accord with his statement that the policy of the last Government was to endeavour to induce the private banks to come to a friendly underdangerous because of our limited knowstanding with the Commonwealth Bank. Hasty and coercive legislation of the character proposed in the bill cannot be too severely condemned. The world has been compelled to adopt a standard currency that can be offered by every buyer and will be accepted by every seller. Iron, wheat and other commodities have been suggested as substitutes for gold, but for the solution of our financial difficulthe gold standard is almost universally accepted, and it provides that stability which is essential in international trade. Some critics condemn as absurd the hoarding of huge quantities of gold in bank vaults, but the gold reserves are like the foundations of a building; although hidden view they are the basis and support of the superstructure of credit. Any action to interfere with the nation's credit is dangerous. The desirability of establishing a central bank calls for the consideration of experts rather than of politicians, and if the Government will agree to the appointment of a select committee, full inquiry can be made as to the policy the Commonwealth Bank should adopt in regard to the reserves of the private banks, with a view to the adoption of a system similar to that which is successfully in operation in the United States of America, South Africa and Great Britain. No . Treasurer should have the power to permit or forbid the export of gold; such a power would give politicians too much influence in the trade and commerce of the country. If that power rested entirely with the Commonwealth Bank Board, I should have less objection to it. Already the Treasurer has given notice of an amendment to provide that action to prothe hibit the export of gold shall be preceded by a recommendation from the bank. If private reserves of gold are to be commandeered and placed in the vaults of the Commonwealth Bank, those in control of that institution should have absolute control of the export of gold. member give the bank absolute power to refuse a permit to export? that the politicians should be given too much influence in the trade and commerce of the country. This bill is ledge of financial practice. As Mr Snowden has saidNobody likes a high bank rate, but in this rather imperfect world we are sometimes compelled to submit to things we do not like, afraid that, if we do not, the consequences may be still more disagreeable. The opinions of some honourable members in regard to the use of the printing press ties are well known, and we have had some experience of the result of such operations. About 1915 the private banks handed over to the Commonwealth Bank £10,000,000 worth of gold aDd with that backing, £18,000,000 worth of notes was issued and loaned to the various States from for the carrying out of public works during 1917.

We have been told that we have £44,000,000 in gold and bullion in Australia.

America, although some came from London.

Since then some gold has been exported. worth a month ago. lowing the gold movements recently. ber had done so he would have realized the necessity for the introduction of this bill. that I have, is that we have £44,000,000 worth of gold in Australia.

There is no urgency in this matter. A fortnight's delay would not injure anybody. Seeing that the subject is of such vital importance to the community it should be given proper consideration. So far as I know none of the banks have protested against the proposal in the bill. tem allows freedom of trade between Possibly they may be reluctant to enter the political arena. But I am firmly of [25] Between £25,000,000 and the opinion that the sooner we make the must be sent out Commonwealth Bank a true central bank, this country every year to aud empower it to take care of our currency, the better it will be for the country. When this bill was first introduced I thought it quite an innocent measure, and I believe that the Treasurer read the the object of deepening that impression. But when we compared the bill with the act that was passed by the British Parliament with the object of achieving similar ends we saw at once that there were fundamental differences between the two. The Treasurer also told us the amendment was on the lines of the British act. In these circumstances, I urge honourable members to support the amendment of the Leader of the Country party. It is not a fair thing to expect laymen in from finance to pass a bill like this without expert advice. Like the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) I should like to know what the Government proposes to do with the gold when it is concentrated. Does it intend to work the printing press with the object of issuing notes in accordance with the gold collected from private individuals and tradings banks? If it does that, it will cripple the credit of the country. The Treasurer stated, in reply to a question, that there would be no interference with the txport of gold for legitimate purposes; but it seems to me that if the bill is passed in its present form the Treasurer will be able to prohibit gold exports for any purpose whatsoever. Immediately the export of gold to pay legitimate accounts is prohibited, the good name of the country will suffer. the previous embargo was enforced? ber knows very well that war-time conditions prevailed at that time. So far as I can see, the British act places no restriction upon the export of gold. If the British banks find that too much gold is leaving the country they increase the discount rate, and automatically the gold begins to flow back again.
