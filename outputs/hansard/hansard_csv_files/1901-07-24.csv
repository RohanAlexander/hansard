I Wish To Ask The Prime Minister, Without Notice, If His Attention Has Been Drawn To A Statement In The Press That The Govern","ment of Queensland has been in communication with the English War Office upon the question of Bending troops to South Africa. Telegrams appear in the newspapers to-day to the effect that Lord Kitchener has accepted certain men for South Africa. What action docs the right honourable gentleman propose to take in the matter ? article to which tlie honourable and learned member refers, but, although I have not done so, I take it that no official engagement has been entered into between the Government of Queensland and the Imperial authorities on this subject. Noticing the statement that an offer had been made, I caused a communication to be sent to the Imperial authorities, reminding them that the Defence departments of the several States were transferred to . the"" Commonwealth on the 1st of last March. attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the members of the South Australian Legislature have decided to retain the title "" M.P.,"" and I wish to know whether, in view of that fact, it would not be well for the Cabinet to reconsider the decision which it arrived at some time ago that members of this House should be designated "" M .

Whether he is aware that, prior to the submission of the Commonwealth Constitution Act for the approval of the people of Western Australia, the Government of South Australia by its then Prime Minister gave an undertaking to pass (or endeavour to pass) a law empowering the Commonwealth, under sub-section 34 of section 51 of the Constitution Act, to construct a railway through the territory of that State to the border of Western Australia. 2.

Whether he will see that these increments are-granted as in other departments ? no increments were granted by the Commonwealth, but the salaries were paid ""at the rates then fixed by tbe States. 2. The matter is under consideration in connection with the Estimates. upon noticeWhether the Government proposes to Carry out the promises made hy the various States to award a special Colonial medal to the Australians who served iu South' Africa, as has been done by Canada and Cape Colony! decorations must be conferred by the Crown, and the Imperial Government, whilst sympathizing with the motives which actuated the suggestion, and whilst fully-appreciating the services rendered hy the Colonial volunteers, pointed out that the multiplication of decorations for military services is on general grounds deprecated as tending to diminish their value. Therefore, in view of this, it is not proposed that-a distinctive Australian medal should be conferred in addition to the medal which has already been granted to all the troops engaged in the war, whether Imperial or Colonial, THE POST ANDTELEGRAPHBIL L AND ""TATTERSALL'S."" representing the Fostmastei'-General, upon Whether the proposals of the Post and Tele-, graph Bill relating to gambling, and what is known as "" Tattersall's,"" differ in substance from the provisions of the State Postal Acts? the Post and Telegraph Bill relating to gambling, and what is known as "" Tatteiv New Guinea, and if the result sail's,"" do not differ in substance from the provisions of the State Postal Acts of Vic-: toria, Queensland, and Western Australia.

21,Sir Philip Fysh,"The proposals of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and myself have considered this matter, and I regret that I cannot promise to make the provision which my honourable friend desires. Bill received from the Senate, and (on table a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending to the House of Representatives an appropriation of revenue to be made for the purposes of a B i ll relating to the Customs. I move That the message be referred to the committee on the Bill. Customs Bill that we have already had under consideration 1 to bring it down. was a message brought down before tlie second reading of the Bill, but that message did not quite cover all the ground we wish to cover in the Bill. Under tbe Constitution it is perfectly competent for such a message to be brought down at this stage, and I will read the section referring to it . Section 56 of the Constitution says A vote, resolution, or proposed law, for the appropriation of revenue or moneys, should not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. There is no necessity under the Constitution for the message to be received upon tlie introduction of the Bill though binding upon this House except a_ practice conformable to the Constitution. liberty given by the Constitution is a liberty of this House, and it is perfectly within the rights of this House to go on with a Bill, providing that the pleasure of the Crown regarding it is signified by way of message before it passes from this Chamber. gentleman approve of this course 1 course .under the circumstances. the message is in proper form. We have no practice to guide us, but are making our practice as we proceed. 1. As the Prime Minister has saidj the Bill not having passed from this House, it is within our power to receive a message relating to it . agree that we are acting strictly within our Constitutional rights, but I would point out that we are laying down a practice that will be followed hereafter, and I wish to express my opinion that the practice now being adopted is not a go.od one. . Bothi n tlie House of Commons, and in other Parliaments with which I am acquainted, the whole Bill, in similar circumstances, would have to be withdrawn and reintroduced. Of course I recognise that the Constitution covers the action of the Ministiy in this instance. Buti t is exceedingly desirable that a message from the Governor General covering the whole of the ground intended to be covered by a Bill should precede that Bill, so that honourable members may know exactly the ground which it is intended to cover. While admitting that this course is necessary, I hope that tlie Government will not say that the practice which we are now adopting is a good practice to follow in the future. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee (consideration resumed from 4th July, vide page 2090) : Clause2 (Definitions)ternal Affairs) -Some objection was taken to this clause as printed with reference to the use of the terms ""justices"" and ""arbitrators."" Lest some consequence might follow the use of the word ""arbitrators"" as extending it beyond the intention of the Bill, I propose is no practice to move an amendment, which will, I think, remove the objection taken. I moveAny That the words "" justices and arbitrators "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""and justices and all arbitrators under any Act or State Act."" That comprehends the legislative authoiization which the honourable gentleman who made the objection wished to be made clear, and I think it removes the objection.

This new clause is moved in order to meet a difficulty pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi. There might be some doubt as to whether clause 213A, which was adopted yesterday, being amongst the clauses dealing with officers, would apply to other cases. objection of the honourable and learned member for In d i was also as to the place where it was proposed to put this clause in the Bill, having regard to the sub-heading governing to a certain extent the interpretation of the clause. I do not know whether the Minister remembers that point. point, and therefore I make the clause expressly apply. New clause agreed to. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). -Honorabl e members will, no doubt, recall to their minds that when clause 213A was under consideration, I raised a question as to the large powers to be given to courts of summary jurisdiction. I pointed out to the committee that in most of the States the * * * * * * limit of courts of summary jurisdictioncourts not presided over by a special magistrate, or by a stipendiary magistrate, but perhaps consisting only of justiceswas less than £100. I think in no case on I m o v e the civil side in any of the States is jurisWalesI think the amount is £ 3 0 , but as to VictoriaI do not know whether they have any corresponding court or not. the limit is £ 1 0 0 . MrV . L . SOLOMON -In South Australia the limit is tlie same. In that State the court is one of absolutely summary jurisdiction, in which a man may even elect to be tried for an indictable offence, provided that the penalty is not greater than six months' imprisonment. It seems to me that under this CustomsB ill it is rather hard that the plantiftj the Customs department, should have the right to elect to have a case, which may involve a fine up to £500, tried in a limited court of this descriptiona court which even the Minister in charge of the Bill admits is frequently faulty, or at least occasionally faulty, and a court which he does not profess to have much faith in. I have already tested the opinion of the committee on some points in regard to this matter, but not on the one point which I now desire to bring forward, and I think most honourable members will agree with me. WhatI propose is that while giving the Customs power to institute their prosecutions when .the penalty does not exceed £ 5 0 0 in a court of summary jurisdiction, we should, at the same time, give to the defendant-wh o may, like the Minister, only viewing the matter 'from a different aspect, not. having implicit confidence in a small court of summary jurisdiction, consisting of two justices, not presided over by a skilled lawyer or by a magistrate-the right to remove his case to the Supreme Court of the State. I am not attempting to provide in this clause for any question as to the costs. Doubtless, it may"" mean that the expense will be greater as far as the defendant is concerned than if the case were tried in the lower court; but, at the same time, surely, when a case involves, or may involve, a fine of £500, or imprisonment up to twelve months, the right should, in common justice, be given to the defendant to have his case tried in I will not say a superior court, but a court somewhat",17,State Lawsand Records Recognitio Nbill

I would ask the assistance of honourable members of this committee who are learned in the law in making the clause perfect. I do not think that I am asking for anything unreasonable in proposing to give the defendant in such important cases the option of having his case tried in a higher court. Doubtless it will be a consideration with the defendant whether the expense of having the case tried in the Supreme Court would not be higher, but I presume the costs themselves will be regulated by the rules of the court. able member propose that the defendant a form better calculated to meet my wishes. should elect to have his case tried by the I movehigher court ?

I shall support the point is that where a man is prosecuted by new clause. the Customs he should have the right to elect to be tried by a court, which in the orable member for South Australia, Mr. ordinary way would try cases involving Solomon, does not appear to the Governsimilar issues and similar penalties in the ment to be very unreasonable, and they are States. A man may. be brought before a disposed to give effect to it if we can court of summary jurisdiction, which may be constituted in such a way as not to have his confidence, and it should be open to him to elect, if he chooses, to' take his case to a higher court; perhaps the costs may be on a higher scale, but that is a point for him to decide. In South Australia two justices of the peace form a court of summary jurisdiction which has the power to try even indictible offences involving a penalty of not more than six months' imprisonment, and a person brought before this court may elect to be tried summarily. Surely the committee will agree with me that it is a fair thing to give the defendant -provide d he is willing to stand the costs of the trial in the higher court-the right to have his case tried there. I am sure that the Minister will see that there is a certain amount of justice in this proposal, and I shall be only too happy and thankful to honourable members who have legal training That the following new clause be inserted to tuted the Customs authorities where the One hundred pounds, the deiu which such prosecution has been instituted."" will not have the effect of curtailing the objection raised by one honourable member not necessarily make the procedure more clause will give the defendant an oppor-",18,Customs Bill

If we pass the clause in its present shape, we shall not know when the right to transfer the case will be exercised. Further, we feel that it ought not to be in the absolute right of the defendant to select the Supreme Court if the prosecution are willing to give him a court of equal authority. I mean to say that in the event of the defendant desiring to go to the Supreme Court -of the State, and the prosecution preferring to go to the High Court of Australia, I do not see why they should not exercise their privilege in that direction. Mr G. B. EnwAKDS -It might be more -costlyfcogo to the High Court of Australia. that court will be singular for many splendid attributes, some of which will be the expedition and cheapness of its procedure.

Theni t -ought to be-provided as far as it clearly can, that on the notice for any discontinuance of -proceedings, the transfer shall be effected, ..and that there shall be some simple niode of providing for that transfer, so that there shall be no unnecessary delay or -cost. Another thing is, that the defendant ..should not have the rightfcogofcothe higher court simply because the law provides for a high penalty, if the prosecuting authorities .are content to abandon the excess over the £100, or the amount that it is considered -desirable to fix. I was thinking of making the clause read as follows :In any Customs prosecution where the penalty . exceeds one hundred pounds and the excess is not abandoned the defendant before the hearing and within seven days after the commencement of the proceedings shall have the right to elect to have the case tried by the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme Court of .the State in which the prosecution has been instituted, in the option of the prosecution, and thereupon such proceedings : shall stand removed accordingly, and may be continued in the manner prescribed in the court in -which they were originally instituted. I think if we were to make the clause run : somewhat in that way it would meet the . necessities of the case. there would be seven days between the summons and the hearing. Sometimes our ..summonses are heard before seven days elapse. [187] some provision which would prevent the defendant from lying by until the prosecution is all ready and then springing an application for a transfer, so as to temporarily defeat the prosecution.

I hope That after the word ""pounds,"" the words "" and the excess is not abandoned "" be inserted. That after the word "" defendant,"" the words ""within seven days after service of process "" be inserted. That after the word ""right,"" the words "" in manner prescribed "" be inserted. That after the word ""tried,"" the words "" in the option of the prosecution, either in the High Court of Australia or in "" be inserted. I think that if we offer defendants the right to go to the High Court, they should not have the right to drag us to the Supreme Court of the State. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). It seemed to me that the Minister was acting too sweetly for his mood to last long, and I have therefore watched carefully to see how he desired to defeat the object of my clause ; now I have discovered it . The object of the clause is to provide that a case involving a penalty of £ 5 0 0 shall not be« tried before a court consisting of two unskilled justices, but that the defendant, towhom the committee want to give thelargest measure of justice, shall have the option of going-a t his own expense, and it must be remembered that the scale of costs will be much greater in a Supreme Court than in a lower court-to the Supreme Court of the State in which the proceedings were instituted. That provision does not allow the prosecuting authority to be dragged to the Supreme Court of another State.

The Minister has perhaps omitted one safeguard the option of sending the case to the Privy Council. enable a case to be tried at an earlier date than might be chosen if the option were given to the defendant.

MrV . L . SOLOMON -Precisely . But I do not think a defendant would have much of a show if the prosecuting counsel were a gentleman of the determination and zeal of the Minister, and he was defended by a somewhat inferior legal adviser. In spite of what the Minister has said about tlie leaning of courts composed of only half instructed justices of the peace, without legal training, towards the defendant when cases against the revenue come before them, a defendant would undoubtedly be at a disadvantage under such circumstances. We do not know what the expense of going to the High Court may be. It may be more than a defendant could afford. But surely the Supreme Court of any State ought to be a sufficient tribunal in a case involving a penalty of £500, and there could be no delay in bringing cases before the Supreme Courts of the States, because they sit pretty regularly. I am sure that honourable members must admit that in a case of this sort, if the defendant is prepared to pay the cost, of going to the Supreme Court, he should be allowed to have his case tried there in stead of in the lower court. honourable member for South Australia is. overlooking a very, important fact. Under clause 231 the Government has. the option, at the initiation of the proceedings, of goingeither to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a State, if it chooses. But if it thinks that the matter could be more expeditiously and cheaply dealt with in caseswhere pecuniary penalties not exceeding£ 5 0 0 are.involved, it may go to a court of summary jurisdiction. Suppose that the a defendant Government determines, for the sake of expedition and economy, to go to a court of summary jurisdiction instead of to of the State, and the defendant says, "" This is a case in which more than, the mere question of money is 'concerned. It is not cheapness I want, it is a judgment upon which I can rely. I do not want to be tried in this summary fashion by judicial officers who are not highly skilled. I want to be tried by skilled officers."" The Minister proposes that in such a casethe prose-cuting authority shall have the option,, which he originally possessed, of going either to the High Court, if the case is of such importance as to require it , or MrV . L . SOLOMON -Why should he nob have done that in the first'instance ? Why, when the defendant proposes, the SupremeCourt, should the Minister say-""Oh, no, T. will take it to the High Court"" ? says-"" I object to the court of summary jurisdiction.""

There may be cases arise in Queensland, or remote parts of the Commonwealth, where the Supreme Court does not sit, and where time would be an object. Surely no defendant can fairly object to submitting his case to tlie High Court of the Commonwealth. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It depends upon what it is going to cost. were to carry his clause in the way in which he desires to carry it, the Ministry would not give the defendant an opportunity of objecting, but would go to the High Court at once. His proposal would prevent the matter from being placed in an economic and expeditious way before summary courts of jurisdiction where the Government had the smallest suspicion that the defendant would insist upon going elsewhere. While giving the defendant the option of objecting to be tried by a comparatively unskilled tribunal, we ought not to take away from the Customs the option of, in the first instance, going before the High Court. I hope that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, will accept the proposal of the Minister. That proposal really gives to the prosecutor the same privilege that we are extending to the defendant. So long as justice is done all round I do not see why the honourable member for South Australia should object. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). -The honourable and learned member for In di has put this matter in a somewhat different light from that in which I viewed it in the first instance.

There is, as there always is, considerable force in what is said by the honourable member for North Sydney; but at the same time. I think this is locking the stable after the steed has been stolen. The fact is that the Minister has a much wider power in clause 49, which, 1 think, was passed without any dissent to sub-clause (</). myself to other parts of that clause, but with regard to sub-clause (g) I do not think there' was any dissent. without having their mind fixed specifically .on this difficulty in regard to kerosene, have given the Minister power to prohibit all kerosene or any article he thinks fit, subject, of course, to his responsibility to Parliament if he exercises his power foolishly. In giving illustrations of what is proposed by this amendment, the Minister referred to kerosene, and that at once awoke the susceptibilities of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse. not mentioned kerosene, which, apparently, has honourable member for Tasmania before that. had not mentioned kerosene, there would not have been this discussion now. instance. as it stands the Minister would, I think, have the power he is seeking now, because he could by proclamation prohibit all kerosene of a certain character. A t the same time, as the Minister feels there might be some dispute as to his power, he asks the committee to make it perfectly clear that he is able to prohibit kerosene, or any other article, under certain conditions. Unless the committee are prepared to go back on their decision on sub-clause (g) of clause 49, they ought to make the provision clear for the Minister, for that is all the Minister asks. I think the power has already been given to the Minister, and I fancy the Minister thinks the same. out of deference to the doubts of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, the Minister is trving to make the clause clear. am of opinion that the Minister has done quite right to bring down this clause. When clause 49 was under discussion, there was a great deal said about the Minister specifying certain articles which should be prohibited, and then in sub-clause (</) taking power to prohibit "" a l l goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation."" I think it was the honourable member for North Sydney who at that time asked what necessity there was to specify articles if sub-clause (</) covered all articles the The committee, Minister might wish to prohibit. I think it was stated further on in the discussion that tea, margarine, and other articles were mentioned merely as instances of the class of articles which would be prohibited. However, we are not giving the Minister any more power, but we are only making clear what was set out in clause 49. We are merely saying that certain imports that are specified by proclamation shall be prohibited, and I certainly think that the clause should be passed. of this proposed new clause rather attracts observation. The words, "" shall authorize prohibition subject to any specified condition "" would read more correctly if the word "" admission "" were substituted for the word ""prohibition."" negative or positive. honourable member, I would suggest that if If the clause were left the word "" prohibition "" is to be adhered to, the other words should be altered so as to make the prohibition subject to any relaxing condition.

I put my opinion against that of tlie honourable member for Indi with a great deal of diffidence, but that seems to me to be clearly the extension of power that we are giving the Minister and the Customs-house officers.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think the clause as originally brought down by the Minister reads quiteclearly, and that he would do wrong to take out even the words that it has been suggested, should be taken out. The design is toapply certain tests to certain goods, and to provide that if the regulations relating to that particular test are not complied with the goods shall be prohibited. I think the clause meets the case entirely. to prohibited imports, clause 49 mentions, eight distinct classes, and seven of theseare prohibited not by proclamation, but by the operation of law, and I think that in this particular case we should give the power to prohibit the importation of goodsby proclamation. This clause is incasks only that candles in tended to remove a doubt as to the operation of paragraph (</), and as to the operation of other clauses, and, unless these wordsare put in, it might be argued that the Minister might under this clauseexercise the power of prohibition in a way other than by proclamation.

Minister's consideration -the penalties and forfeitures-recovere d of the wording of the proposed new clause is that it shall be read in conjunction with clause 49. That clause prohibits, in seven out of its eight paragraphs the importation of certain specified things, and in paragraph (</) it gives a general power of prohibition. only general power of prohibition which is contained in the Bill, and therefore it is in conjunction with that provision that this clause must be read. None of the other paragraphs in clause 49 give the power to prohibit, though they contain absolute prohibitions. power to prohibit, because they give the officers of the department power to enforce prohibitions. graphs say, ""The importation of these things is prohibited."" Power to prohibit importation is given only under paragraph (<-/). However, I will look into the matter further, though at the present moment I am strongly of opinion that there is no necessity for an alteration. Proposed new clause agreed to. suggest that, inasmuch as there may be some power which we have omitted to give the Minister, a short clause should be added to the Bill, providing that in every case not heretofore provided for the decision of the Minister shall be final. that would be a very useful clause, but I would suggest that the qualification ""after consultation with the leader of the Opposition "" should be added. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I move That tlie following new clause be inserted after clause 24!):-""No permanentotficerof theCustoms shall participate in the distribution of penalties or forfeitures recovered under any Customs Act."" Clause 249, as we have amended it, reads-'All penalties and forfeitures recovered under ' any Customs Act shall be applied to such purposes and in such proportions as the Minister may direct. It might be added to In that clause we give the Minister a discretion in regard to the division of what I may perhaps be permitted to term the spoil under the provisions of the measure. . But, in a debate which took place on the clause,, several honourable members agreed with the contention of the leader of the Oppositionand myself that it was inadvisable that Customs officers should have a further inducement to vigilance and honesty than the salaries paid to them for the performance of their duties. I pointed out that in cases which had come under my own cognisance, provisions such as those in the clause had operated to induce officers to exaggerate trivial offences into offences which would permit them to make seizures and to have fines inflicted, so that they might participate in the penalties and forfeitures. Honourable members must re-' member that, in a measure like this, there is a trap at almost every turn, not only for ' In one sense they give the the man who wilfully attemptsto defraud the Customs revenue, but even for the innocent man who makes the slightest mistake in the reading of a provision, or whomakes a wrong entry, or a slip of any kind ; and, in order to test the opinion of the committee as to whether Customs officers in permanent employment should be allowed to share in fines and penalties, I have moved the proposed new clause, which is simple and direct to the point. The clause 'makes no reference to casual employesmen casually employed 'to lay traps or to detect attempts to defraud the revenue, because informers must undoubtedly receive a share of the spoil. But is there any more reason why permanent officials should receive this specialinducenient to do their duty than there is that members of the police, or officers of the taxation department, or any other department who are equally interested in preventing frauds upon the revenue, should be specially re warded ? I know that the Minister will tell me that in many, and, perhaps, in all of the States, this rule has been in force.; but those of us who have had experience of its. operation must have come to the conclusion that it has not been conducive to the doing of justice. On the contrary, it has conduced rather to the bolstering up of",27,Customs Bill

It is all -very well to say that the States have adopted that system in the past, but that is an argument which the Minister uses only when it suits his purpose. He has not followed the customs laws of the States so closely in other particulars. A t any rate, it is now within the power of the'committee to say that this system shall cease. It is a system which cannot be productive of good.

MrV . L . SOLOMON -Mak e an exception of special circumstances. do that ? Why, they would be all special. Not only has this been the South Australian practice, but ib is the English practice. Herei t is-The Commissioners of Customs may order such reward as they see fiboutof any pecuniary penalty to Customs officers not only to be vigilant, or composition to any officer or other person by whose means the same is recovered. I am sorry to hear the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, say that the existence of these laws has led to abuse. He has practically suggested that the Customs officers have given false evidence for the purpose of securing convictions. MrV . L . SOLOMON -I did not say so. the truth, and secured convictions for breaches of the law, so much the better for the honest trader. Are these men bo be marked out for special disqualification as regards rewards which are given to similar officers all over the world t We have had the system tried here, and it has not been abused. We cannot calculate""by fixed hours and a regular wage what reward a man should receive. We have struck out the direct reference to informers, but we have given to the Minister the same power that has always been conferred hitherto, that is conferred in England, and may be continued without the slightest risk. Minister thinks an officer has abused his position, he will not give him more than a fraction of a penalty. It is for the Minister to say what he will give. not give a halfpenny. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). It is all very well for the Minisber bo quobe existing laws in the States and Great Britain when ib suits him. BubI can point to half-a-dozen instances in which this Bil l is opposed to the laws of the States. It is' only when it happens to suit the Minister's argument that he exclaims-""Oh, this is the existing law of the State."" I do not bhink we are to be bound down by the laws which have existed for some time in one or all of the States, if we are convinced, as I hope many honourable members will be, that those laws have been a mistake. There are many honourable members who must recognise that wibhoub casting any slur such as is suggesbed by bhe Minister ber did cast a slur in his speech. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Without casting any slur on the Customs officers, I do say that this advantage of a participation in fines and penalties, i u addition to their regular specified salaries, is an inducement bub to be too vigilant. It is an inducement to make them too anxious to secure a conviction, boo anxious bo exaggerate a small flaw or mistake againsb bhe Cusboms Acb into such a crime as would lead bo bhe exaction of heavy fines and penalties, to forfeiture, or to something in which they will have a pecuniary interest. We have no more righb bo place Cusboms officers in' that position than we have the officers of any other taxation department. What right have we to assumeeven though it has been done in the States -that the Customs official in the receipt of a salary commensurate with his services requires in addition that which is required by the informer, namely, a participation in the plunder that is to be got by working up a case and by increasing its importance. When we consider other clauses in the Bill and see how drastic are its regulations, we can understand how mere slips may be exaggerated into big offences, into big crimes almost. When we give bhe Customs officers in addition to their salaries the right bo participate in certain fines and penalties, I say thab we do wrong.

I trust that the committee will see that in this Commonwealth we do not want to offer inducements such as those to well-paid permanent officers. 1 do not want to give power even to the head of the Customs department to divide penalties amongst Customs officers. By all means, let the Customs officers be paid a fair salary, but let us do away once and for all with this additional incentive to them to be extra vigilant, and to bring cases forward as frequently as possible. like to say a few words in support of the proposed new clause. When clause 249, relating to the application of penalties was before the committee, the Minister was very good to several honourable members who protested against it . The, clause was amended with his concurrence, and all reference to informers was eliminated. AlthoughI know that some honourable members who opposed that clause thought it was not much improved, still I am of opinion that it was materially improved by the amendments which were made. I scarcely think that this clause goes far enough. It would be much better if a reference were made to informers, as well as to seizing officers. I should prefer that the clause should provide that the fines should not be awarded either to the informer or to the seizing officer. I ask the Minister to see if he cannot accept it in a modified form, because it seems to me that if we are going to allow the seizing officer to be recompensed by getting a portion of a fine, it may happen that an unscrupulous officer will be induced to manufacture a case. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the majority of Customs officers. I regard the majority as very estimable men. But there are exceptions to every rule, and it may be that some unscrupulous officer or officers may arrange to manufacture a case between them. I know that that has happened very often, particularly in connection with the administration of the licensing law, and that for the sake of sharing in the plunder, officers have been instrumental in an innocentpersonsuffering. To prevent such a possibility as that 1 strongly favour this clause. It seems to me, as has been already pointed Hadi t not been for that out, that when Customs officers are paid a salary in the same way as are other members of the publio service, that salary in itself should be quite sufficient recompense to them, without their being paid a portion of the fine. Such a practice is not followed in the case of the police or other officers of the public service. It is all very well to say that if this is not done tlie officers will not be so zealous as they ought to be, and that the revenue must suffer. But I would much rather see the revenue suffer' than see innocent individuals suffer by reason of unscrupulous officers manufacturing cases in order to get a share of the plunder. I sincerely trust the Minister will reconsider his views regarding this clause. what ? To practically declare that we do not believe in tlie honesty of our permanent Customs officials. MrV . L . SOLOMON -O r that they re-quire further incentives to keep them honest ? every rule. permanent Customs officials, and we are told that the possibility of a reward leads them to lie, exaggerate, and practically to conspire. I do not believe they do anything of the sort. I believe our permanent Customs officials are as well worthy our trust as are the permanent Customs officials in any countiy in the world. In regard to the question of right it is suggested a certain right is given to a certain reward. Nothing of the sort. What is the. power given to the Minister? It is to do as he pleases in regard to the distribution of the penalty. Neither officer nor informer is mentioned, but it is left to the Minister to say what he considers should be paid. We are told that because a man is giving such satisfaction that he is permanently employed, he is not to have the reward, and these criticisms are made in respect of him. , Something was said about the police not getting rewards, but the police do get rewards, and properly so, time and again.

209,Mr Crouch,"I thought that theinvolved, but both sides of the House have done their best to assist the Government to perfect the measures submitted. In this Bill, however, distinct issues are raised, and a question of national policy is ' brought before us which must eventually be decided, and I have no doubt that the whole matter will be very carefully considered, and that many questions will be divided upon before the Bill leaves the House. I feel that in connection with this B ill we shall have to confrom the European nations that I think we sider two other very large national measures which have been referred to in connection with the motion relating to the taking over of the Northern Territory, brought before the House by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon. A t the very opening of the debate, I may say that I recognise the necessity of constructing both the transcontinental line and the line to Western Australia as national undertakings for purely defence purposes, if for no other reason. I think we should have the railwayconstructed to the West so that we may connect the great ports of Albany and Fremantle with tlie eastern States. A t the same time. I think it is equally necessary for us to look at the western railway, not from the view of' its monopolizing the railway expenditure and railway effort of the Commonwealth, but that we should be ready also to complete for South Australia the railway that they have commenced to construct to Port Darwin. These lines are equally necessary, judged from the defence stand-point. Taking first the Western Australian railway, I find that British policy"", so far as it has been directed .or four hundred millions of people in the at all during the last few years has been more and more directed into converting the Indian Ocean into a British lake. If honourable members will look at the map of the countries that surround the Indian Ocean, starting from Cape Town, and going then to British East Africa along to Egypt, then along the southern shores of Asia right away round to the Malay peninsula, and down to Australia, they will see that the whole'of the lands contiguous to the Indian Ocean are becoming more and more painted red, and this shows that when we ' are considering our defence problem we shall be able far more economically to meet the position if we view that side of .our responsibility as really an extension of British policy in the Southern hemisphere, leaving outside the Pacific problem, which will have to be dealt with independently. Honourable members will see the advantage of concentrating our efforts to a very large extent upon the completing our defences on the Indian Ocean side, because that will mean that we shall make ourselves secure from attack on that side. If honourable members look at Port Darwin, they will see that it is. probably from that direction that we shall, have to expect our greatest difficulty and. our most determined opponents. ' It is not Australians have to expect any great national difficulties, but from those great nations of the East, China and Japan, which we have unfortunately stirred up, and which we are unfortunately teaching European methods of utilizing their military resources. It is to these nations that we have to look, and we have already seen in connection with the recent Chinese campaign how very complete-fa r too complete-the Japanese arrangements already are in connection with .their military organization. I fear the dangers that may come from that direction, for the conquering of a white race by the Oriental races would' be so disastrous to the whole world that it is almost impossible for us to calculate the consequences. The late Professor Pearson tried to do so in his book on National Characteristics, and he showed us with fair clearness what would happen in such an event. We have seen, some of the results of stirring a nation of 40,000,000 people into activity with regard to this question of defence, and I want honourable members to contemplate what will be the danger to us if the three hundred Chinese Empire became equally impregnated with the warlike spirit, and capable of carrying it into execution. W it h us it will not be so much a question of repelling attack from the Oriental races as a question of driving away a nation that has already gained a footing on our shore. My fear is not that we will not be able to defend Australia from the Oriental nations if they make an attack upon us ; but that our chief danger will arise if we allow these people to settle down in the north-western part of our continent, or round about Port Darwini n the northern part of Australia. In that case it would not be a matter of repelling attack, but a matter of dispossessing them of land that they had occupied, and we at present areabsolutely in no position to meet any conr tingeney of this sort. MightI point out to honorable members that almost within a day and a half's sail from Port Darwin, we have tlie largely civilized nation of Netherlands India with 43,663 trained troops, of which at least 16,000 are Europeans. All these troops are trained under European officers, and are in a high state of efficiency, and they are within a day and a half's sail of Port Darwin. MrV . L . SOLOMON -If the honourable that principle became established, it was and learned member said four days' steaming every man's right, hand for the community, it would be nearer the riiark. such a large number of well-disciplined speak in a' community, and it is that that troops so close to our shores ought to be gives us the right to rule in the community. thoroughly well known to the whole of In a democratic community it is the perthe people of Australia, so that they may sons who vote who rule, and the right to realize that it would be unwise for us to rule should always be accompanied by the neglect any reasonable defensive precautions.. ability to take a share in the defence of There are 24 ships with 3,300 men stationed the nation. I think, therefore, that the in Netherlands India, in addition to the proposal that has been made that every troops I have mentioned. When we come man should be compelled to make himto look for what the Minister. for Defence self perfect in the use of the rifle, proposes to do in order to meet any possible ,as a sort of preliminary to his right aggression, we find that he has divided the to vote, is a very good one.

I think that our designation of the Ministeri n charge of the Military department as the Minister for Defence, instead of the Minister for War, is a proper designation, and that our military operations .should be directed to defence only. That is the furthest extent to which I am ready to .go in the direction of militarism -and other artillery corps at Drysdale, more than defence under some Ministers. begins with defiance; and the best way -of defending one's self may be to -adopt aggressive tactics in the first instance, in order to secure the position, in reference to the question of .armaments and ammunition, I think that Australia should be self-contained. I am very glad that an opportunity was .given to a large number of honourable members the other day to inspect the ammunitionfactory at Deer Park. I do not think that we should depend upon outside supplies in the matter of ammunition, and the Boers, apparently, hold that opinion too, judging by the large plants of ammunition which have been discovered in various parts of their -territory. I have been told by the manager -of the Deer Park factory that, with the exception of some nitrates, Australia can supply all the raw material required for the manufacture of cordite and nitro-glycerine, -so that the chief thing we want is a proper plant to enable us to meet the -exigencies of war time. In my opinion, the Parliament will not feel that it is fulfilling its duty towards the citizens of Australia unless it provides, not only for the establishment of a cordite factory, but also for the -establishment of a small-arms factory. I think that honourable members should give that project very hearty support. I have been told that our manufacturers would be able to make steel guns as well as such weapons are made in other parts of [188] the world if they had encouragement from the Government. A t any rate they could make small arms, and I think that a start should be made in the direction of establishing a small-arms factory. If we must buy guns, let us buy them from Australian manufacturers, not only because of the commercial advantage of doing so, but because of the advantage that would be gained from the stand-point of defence. I am sorry that the defences of Victoria are in a chaotic state at the present time. I do not intend to put the blame upon any one, because I think that it must be shared by all. The present condition of affairs has been brought about largely by the necessity for retrenchment. But as I have pointed out, an artillery corps at Geelong-and I referred to the case before because I am cognizant of the facts it may mean something Warrnambool, and Port Fairy, are being drilled with muzzle-loading guns; an absurd condition of things at this stage of the world's history. To drill men with muzzle loading guns, when in war time they will be expected to fight with breechloading guns, is an absurdity which should only be mentioned to be remedied. I trust that the first step the Minister takes in this matter will be to see that the men are drilled with proper guns. It is of no use to have artillerymen unless they are properly trained. Better not go to the expense of an artillery corps if we cannot give them proper arms to drill with. Dealing now with the details of the Bill, it seems to me that the Governor General is given powers which are far too large. The term ""Governor General"" really means the Minister for Defence, and the decision of the Minister for Defence will be very largely the decision of the permanent head of the department. The Minister, with the approval of the Governor General, has power to appoint, promote, and transfer officers in every direction. That provision really gives the whole of the control of the forces to the permanent head of 'the department. I do not know what has been the practice in the other States, but under the Defences and Discipline A ct of Victoria a Council of Defence, consisting of certain permanent heads, was appointed, and that body had to make recommendations in regard to promotions, transfers, and appointments. That arrangement took from the Minister a very large amount of power in regard to matters which",35,Defence Bill Second Reading

214,Mr Crouch,"Defenc e sometimesI do not think should be left in his hands alone. In my opinion we should adopt iu this Bill a provision similar to that contained in the Public Service Bill, -where the Governor General acts upon the advice of the Commissioner I would like to see it provided here that the Governor General shall act upon the advice of a board of experts. I do not think that the permanent head should have such absolute control as it is proposed to give him. In clause 10 it is provided that a district commandant may be an officer of the .King's army; but I feel that the opportunities for promotion which we can offer to the permanent officers in our, forces will be so permanent forces cannot do so. I do not few that we should certainly give the position of district commandant to Australian-trained soldiers. No doubt it is advisable for the first few years to appoint, as the Minister suggests, an English soldier to tlie position of general officer commanding. use the term ""-Britisher."" ""While I think that the general officer commanding should be a Britisher, the district commandants should, if possible, be local men. We do not want our officers to feel that, however well they perform their duties, the higher commands will be kept from them. The ability as fighters which Australians have shown in South Africa' should make us only too glad to give Australians the right to rise at any rate to the district commands, leaving it to the Minister to decide whether the general officer commanding shall or shall not be an officer of the King's army. Clause 25 provides that officers must retire at the ages set forth in the second schedule. will turn to that schedule they will find that certain officers must retire between the ages of 45 and 55. Inasmuch as the pension scheme provided for in the B ill does not apply to men already in the forces, I think that it will be unfair to apply this provision to such men, unless we also provide that uj>on retirement a fair amount of compensation shall be given to them, or that they shall be given a jiension. The House will see the injustice of asking an officer now in the service, whose age is perhaps 42 years, to retire at tlie age of 45, unless some such arrangement is ""made. I think that the clause should be made to apply only to men joining the service after the measure comes into operation, because such men will know that their career must come to an end under the conditions provided for. The Commandants' report, which, is now on the table of the House, points out that if we adopt, the I m perial retiring ages, we should also adopt the Imperial pension arrangements. I trust that honourable members will bear the matter in mind when we come to consider the Bill in committee. Clause 38 provides that men in the militia and volunteer forcesmay retire within three mouths after the measure conies into operation, on giving 14 days' notice ; but men belonging to the know why members of the permanent forces should be excluded from that provision. As they are being required to serve under new conditions, they should have a right, to reconsider their contract with the Government. The permanent forces of the various States have been serving the King under certain conditions and at certain ratesof pay which will not continue when they are brought under the Commonwealth Government. New rates of pay are to be determined under regulations made in compliance with the provisions of this measure, and it is provided, not only that men may be transferred from one part of Australia to another-a n arrangement which will prove most expensive to some men and most distasteful toothers-bu t also that they may be required' to serve outside Australia. In those respectsthe conditions of their service are materially altered, and I trust that honourable members, will see that the members of the permanent, as well as of the militia and volunteer forces are given the right to say whether they will or If honourable members will not enter into a new contract with the Commonwealth Government. They may very well cay "" When I joined the forces for five years, I expected that certain conditions of service would continue, and now that theseconditions are being altered, I wish to retire from the service,"" because they do not feel bound to serve under the new condition."" which are being imposed by a harsh and arbitrary law of the Commonwealth. Clause 49 is another provision which should be seriously considered. I do not think that any man, whether he belongs to the permanent or to the volunteer forces, should be compelled to serve outside Australia, and I am very glad that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has given",36,Defence Bill Second Reading

216,Mr Crouch,"Perhaps I had betternotice of a motion for the striking out of the provision which allows j>ermanent men to serve outside tlie Commonwealth. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -He will carry it, too. Mi-. CROUCH I am glad to think that lie will. I wish to point out the very illogical position assumed by tlie Government in regard to this proposal. They say that we do not want too many permanent men; that we only require enough to look after tlie complicated machinery of certain guns, and to attend to the scientific work of artillery defence; that we want the permanent men only for artillery. That is the only justification that we have for keeping up a standing army in Australia. Buti t is proposed that in time of war, when the services of these men will be required for the management of garrison artillery with which they are thoroughly familiar, they may be sent to serve outside Australia. When a call was made for volunteers to serve in South Africa, more than wererequiredcameforward, in Victoria, at anyrate, and I have no doubt that if the provision to which I refer is struck out, and an emergency arises when the Commonwealth Government may consider it necessary for the purpose of its own defence that men should serve outside Australia, enough volunteers will present themselves to meet the occasion. Clause 111 provides that any member of the Defence force may, with tlie consent of the Minister, volunteer for service outside the Commonwealth, in connection with any force that may be raised by the Commonwealth. ThatI think should be done only with parliamentary sanction. I do not want it to be done as an Executive act. I need hardly refer the House to the reply which was given by the Prime Minister a few days ago to a question put by the honourable member for Bland. The honourable member for Bland asked if we were to participate in some alleged execution of rebels in South Africa. The Prime Minister answered that he did not know anything as to the truthfulness or otherwise of the statement, and that even if he did it was a matter of Imperial responsibility, in which he could take no part. I venture to say that this House regards the question in a different light. institute an inquiry into the matter at tlie present stage, because that would be equal opportunity for equal ability. 1 do not mu. 2963 constituting ourselves a court of inquiry over the doings of an authority which we could not control. ment of what happened in accordance with what the Prime Minister says, I rejaeat that wp should not send our men into any position in which we have not absolute control over them. Australian soldiers may be used in South Africai n connection with these executions. The executions may be necessaiy, but, according to the cabled reports, they do not appear to be necessary. I believe in Australia having the right to say whether it is a proper course for our soldiers to participate in such doings, and, if it is not right, I believe in some national protest being made here. sent to Africa to be hangmen. should like to see an amendment made in this Bill in the direction which I have suggested. If men are to be allowed to volunteer for purposes outside of the Commonwealth, they should be allowed to do so only with parliamentary sanction. If Parliament is not in session at the time, I think tlie fact of our troops being required for service outside of the Commonwealth would constitute a national emergency of sufficient importance to warrant Parliament being immediately called together. No act of any Government while Parliament is not in session should be allowed to decide an important matter of this sort. We should, therefore, insist that no Australian troops should be used outside of the Commonwealth without the sanction of Parliament being first obtained to that course. I do not propose to take up the time of the House further with regard to the question of commissions. I intend to circulate some amendments shortly, but the B ill came on so unexpectedly that I have so far been prevented from doing so. Every man in the defence force should have the right to rise from the position of a gunner to the highest office within the gift of the Commonwealth. I feel it is one of the scandals of the past that regulations have been made in professedly democratic States, which hav, prohibited many men from rising beyond a certain rank.",37,Defence Bill Second Reading

222,Mr Crouch,"I am only asking forsay that the Minister for Trade and Customs has not risen to the height to which it is desirable he should rise, but still there are some men who could rise higher sergeants, and it is on behalf of those men that I am appealing to the House. I know of some good men who are only half way up the tree, although they are fit to be at the top of it. But because they were not born in a certain social rank, or because they have not enough money, they have been unable to get there. The result is that by a system of caste, which has been introduced into the military forces of Australia, and which follows upon the lines of tlie caste system which exists in Great Britain, but not in Republican there has been a violent chasm opened up between officers, non-conunissioned officers, and men. I do not think that that state of affairs should exist. It is against all the principles that are moving democratic communities at the present time. AlthoughI can see the advantage of an officer being distinctly a leader and a man of education, I think that the House can be put into possession of examples in which men have found it impossible to bridge this chasm, although they have undoubtedly possessed the ability which entitled them to rise. The Victorian regulations, after a tremendous were amended about six months ago by men who certainly had not the interests of the non-commissioned officers, whom they were professing to serve, at heart. quently they brought forward regulations under . which' no man could become an officer in the permanent he had reached the age of 22 years. blocked the way just as effectually as if the power to rise from the ranks had never been given. It was one way of pretending to give an opportunity of rising, and at the same time of actually withdrawing it. Therefore, I want the provision which I have suggested inserted in the Bill. I do not wish to leave it to regulations which are often administered by persons who have no desire that a man should rise from the ranks. Upon the question of the navy, I find that there is no reference to tlie Australian squadron. Bill does not repeal the Australian Defences Act, under which we contribute £126,000 a year towards the maintenance of an auxiliary squadron. I wish to read to the House a statement which, coming from the source it does, will, I think, appeal to honourable members. Mr Crouch. the principle which I think we ought to adopt in this connection. The land force and the naval force which is than created and called into existence by our own means and maintained at our own cost should be kept under our own control. I do not think there is any one who can raise a rational objection to that limitation. It is prescribed by self-respect and prudence, for I do not know what advantage this or any of the neighbouring colonies can gain by paying in time of peace for either a naval or military force which may be withdrawn in time of war. If it is outside oiir control, it may be withdrawn, and probably will be withdrawn. That statement was made in this very chamber by the late Chief Justice Higinbotham, on 2nd March, 1869. He said, in France, effect, that if we create a force we should have a final control over it in every direction. I want that principle to be applied to the Australian naval squadron, which is at present in Sydney. There was a time when one of our colonies appealed to Great Britain for aid, and it was refused. I refer to the year 1869, when the New Zealand war was in progress. The late Chief Justice Higinbothani referring to that occasion saidI t was stated that the application for help by the New Zealand colonists in 1869 was refused, and the general who temporarily granted them help agitation, was censured because they possessed in full measure self-government; and that having self government, it was a duty to defend their own country against aggression from native tribes or any foreign source. ConseThe Imperial Government, upon being appealed, to, refused to help New Zealand in its time of need. I think it is just force after as well to remember that. There may That be a time when it will be necessary for the naval squadron to be withdrawn from Sydney, if we leave its control-as it is at the present time-in the hands of British officers, and entirely directed by the British Admiralty. If we are going to pay for men, or for the maintenance of men, we must see that we have that final control over them which will prevent us from finding ourselves deserted in time of emergency.

227,Mr Crouch,"That does not in the first law of nature, certainly this Defence Bill for the Commonwealth of Australia is very properly in the forefront of the legislation of this House. MY. PULLER (Illawarra) I desire to Say a few words on the important subject of defence as submitted in this Bill. I look on the question of the defence of the Australian States as one of the most important influences in connection with the bringing about of federation. We all well remember that it was the famous speech of Sir Henry Parkes, delivered at Tenterfield in 1889, when, with the report of Major-General Frenchi n his hand, he urged the necessity of the defence of Australia, that really galvanized the federal movement into life, with the result that the Convention of 1891 met. It having been the prime agent in bringing about federation, I think that, under the circumstances, one of the most important matters we can consider is the defence of the Australian States. I listened with great interest to the speech of the Minister for Defence when he introduced this B ill the other night; but I must say that to a large extent I am disappointed with its provisions. I am altogether opposed to the establishment of a large standing army in Australia. volunteer or militia system, carried out somewhat on the principle of the volunteer movement in the various Australian States. There is also another matter which has been passed over in the Bill, and which I look on as most important, namely, the establishment of the nucleus, at any rate, of an Australian navy. The time has come in the history of the Australian States, when we should not rely altogether on the old country, which has done so much for us in the past in connection with the defence of our shores and tlie protection of our commerce throughout the world. Now that we have emerged from being States, and have started as what I trust will be a great nation in the future we ought to do something more in connection with the establishment of a naval system of defence than in the past. is true that for some time we have been contributing a certain towards keeping in southern waters an Australian squadron from Great Britain for the protection of these shores. But I am one who believes the time has come when we should establish, at any rate, the nucleus of an Australian navy, and when all the men of that navy should be Australian-born citizens. If an attack were to be made on Australia it must of necessity come from without, and it is the duty of the Ministeri n charge, in connection with the first line of defence, to see that some movement is made in the direction of the establishment of a navy. There is another very important matter in connection with the first line of defence of Australia, namely, the matter of coast fortifications. I understand that so far as the great cities of Melbourne and Sydney are concerned they are pretty well fortified against sea attack ; butspeakingof the coastline, with which I am familiarly acquainted, there are many places within the near neighbourhood of Sydney where an invading fleet might land without difficulty, and march on the city. One of the things an invading fleet would immediately look for after arriving from a considerable sail, would be a coal supply j and we have in the immediate vicinity of Sydney, on tlie south coast, the extensive coal seams of Bulli, AVollongong, and Port Kembla. We have at Port Kembla a harbour which almost any ship in the world could enter. AVe are continually loading there ships of 4,000 or 5,000 tons, and the State Government of I am entirely in favour of the New South Wales have passed a B ill authorizing the expenditure of a very large amount in order to make Port Kembla a magnificent harbour. To prevent an invading fleet from getting coal supplies, immediate steps ought to be taken to have an important place like Port Kembla, in the soutli coast district of New South Wales, put into such a condition that it would not be possible for an invading fleet to enter there and obtain coal supplies. These are one or two points on which I touch in connection with the establishment of the nucleus of a navy, and in connection with the necessity, so far as that part of the coast line with which I am personally acquainted is concerned, of having it fortified against an invading force. could not get into Port Kembla? are thereloading ships of 4,000 and 5,000tons, and I take it that when we are able to load ships of those dimensions a great many men of war would be able to come into the port. In the future1 am not speaking of immediate action-whe n the expenditure which the Government of New South Wales proposes takes place, almost any ship in",40,Defence Bill Second Reading
228,It Sir Malcolm Mceachaiwf,Surely a fleet,41,Defence Bill Second Reading
229,Amount Mr Fuller,"A t the present time wetlie world will be able to enter Port Kembla and obtain coal supplies. As to the manning of our forts, although I am opposed to the establishment of a large standing array, it appears to me that it will be absolutely necessary in order that the forts may be properly manned to have skilled men in service of a permanent character. skilled officers in connection with the training of the volunteers and the militia, there is no necessity to establish a large permanent force in Australia. The principle has been adopted in the Bill by the Minister for Defence that every male person between the ages of eighteen and 60 years shall be called on if necessary to shoulder arms, but it appears to me that no provision of a satisfactory character has been made that those men, when they are called on to shoulder arms, shall have had a sufficient training to make them effective in the field. The question of the clubs is one of the most important in connection with the defence of Australia. We saw from a cable message tlie other day that Lord Roberts, who has had the recent experience of the South African war, has called tlie attention of the English authorities to this matter, and, so far as E can judge the effect of the cable, he proposes putting a system of rifle shooting in the very first place in connection with military training in England. nising, as we all must, the necessity of having good rifle shots for the defence of our States, I think that more notice should have been taken of the establishment of rifle clubs under the Bill than has been taken by the Minister for Defence. If we had rifle clubs properly established, and a proper system of training in connection with them, then, according to tlie statement of the Minister for Defence, we should have a good many hundred thousand men ready to go into the field for effective service in case of an invasion of Australia. rifle clubs, a great deal will depend on the regulations laid down, and hi clause 119 the proposition is made that an Australian Rifle Association should be established. Such an association would be a very important body, and an effective one, if properly organized. There was a proposition brought forward by General Richardson, a good many years ago, in connection with the rifle clubs of New South Wales, which, in my opinion at any rate, was a very good one. He proposed that every man who qualified himself up to a certain standard should earn what is known as a capitation fee. That fee was given not to the man personally, but, as an encouragement to the men. of the rifle clubs to But beyond those men and qualify themselves up to the required standard, it was paid towards tlie funds of his club. It appears to me that that would be a very good plan of encouraging men in these clubs, which I hope will be extensively established under this B ill from one end of Australia to the other. None of the State organizations which have been carrying on rifle clubs have, so far as I can see, attained that amount of success they might have attained. One reason for this has been that there always is a certain amount of antagonistic feeling between the military and the civilians who belong to these instituestablishment of rifle tions. A great many civilians, though I do not say this applies to all, are very apt to show a sort of contempt for military authority, while, on the other hand, a great many of the military men suffer to a large extent from, if I may be permitted to use the term, "" swelled heads,"" and so fail to carry out their duties. We have in New South Wales what is known as the Defence Force Association, and it appears to me that an Australian Defence Association might Recogbe established very much on tlie same lines. A number of men on the council of the New South Wales Defence Association were nominated by the general officer commanding, and in the press the other day I saw a suggestion made that in connection with the proposed Australian Defence Association, a number of members of the council should be similarly nominated. The experience in New South Wales of having members nominated by the general officer commanding was that they could never be got to attend the meetings. Even at the annual prize meeting at Randwick, when it Of course, in connection with was necessary and important that they should be there, out of a number appointed, only one took the trouble to attend. In order to avoid that difficulty in connection with the Australian Defence Association, I would suggest to the Minister for Defence that none of the members should be nominated to the council by the general officer, but that 'every one should be elected by the members of the association,' and that no one should be entitled to be elected to such an important body unless an active member of the defence forces. There are two clauses of this B ill which appear to be of a most important character, and those are clauses 108 and 109, in connection with the penalties which are proposed to be inflicted on persons who approach or enter any fort, battery, field work,, fortification, or any work of defence, with sketching, drawing, photographing, or painting materials or apparatus in their possession. Now, the penalty under these clauses is-first , in connection with clause 108, £ 5 0 , and in connection with trespassing, which is provided for under clause 109, £ 2 0 . Now, speaking of my own State, we have from time to time had matters brought before us which point clearly to the fact that we are in very great jeopardy in that State, in connection with our fortifications, by reason of the apathy or carelessness of the officers in charge of them in allowing people to trespass upon the forts, and to take sketches or photographs, and get other information regarding them. In order to stop that sort of thing, I would suggest that not only should there be penalties such as are provided under these clauses, but that a term of imprisonment should be provided for offences which are really a menace to our fortifications and therefore to the safety of the State. There is also clause 15, in connection with appointments, which appears to me to be of rather an objectionable nature. The clause says(1) No combatant officer of the defence force above the substantive rank of major in the military forces, or above the rank of commander iu the naval forces, and no adjutant, shall hold the same appointment or command for a longer period than five consecutive years from the date of his appointment, whether such date occurred before or after the commencement of this Act: Provided that in special cases the Governor^ General may extend the term of the appointment or command for any period not exceeding two years. Nowi t appears to me that under that clause, no matter how excellent an officer may be, at the end of seven years, at the outside, he will have to retire from the service. is eligible for appointment whenever a vacancy occurs. . in the way I have indicated. convexthat impression, and I do not wonder at the honourable and learned member thinking as he did; but it is not the fact. my reading of the clause that any officer, no matter how good he might be, would, afterserving seven years, have to retire from the service. So long as the position is as explained by the Prime Minister, I am satisfied, and I shall not make the remarks I had intended to make. Of course it gives, an opportunity of getting rid of undesirableofficers, and so far as that goes it is a very good provision. As I did not expect the Bill to be discussed quite so soon, I am not prepared now to deal with it as I should have liked, but I briefly put forward a few suggestions, and I shall be prepared to move some amendments in connection with the various clauses when we go into committee. I sincerely trust that we shall be able to amend it in such a way as to make it an effective basis for the establishment of a proper defence system for Australia. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) I cannot profess to be able to speak in reference to this defence question with the same experience or authority as do those honourable members who have had the honour and privilege of being connected with tlie various Australian defence forces, in positions of authority and influence; but at the same time. I recognise that this question of Australian defence is one of such immense moment, magnitude, and importance that it demands the careful consideration, not only of military men, but of civilians generally and of every member of this House. Certainly no Bil l of equal importance has up to tlie present been brought under the attention of this House, and I know of no measure that is likely to be submitted to us that could exceed it in importance or interest. The considerations involved in this Bill will probably affect the destinies of the Commonwealth in ages to come. They may certainly affect the relations of the Commonwealth with the Empire. Consequently it is desirable that this Bill should be very carefully considered, even in the earliest stages of its progress through the House, and probably a thoroughly good discussion of some of its leading principles and features may facilitate tlie clear consideration of the proposals when we reach the committee stage. For my own part I desire to say that I have no sympathy with any unnecessary movement in the direction of militarism, and I should certainly be no",41,Defence Bill Second Reading

233,Mr Fuller,"It appears to me fromparty to any movement that savours of extravagance or unnecessary expense in that .direction. A t the same time. I think we are, as a practical people, bound to recognise the signs of tlie times; that we are bound to recognise the fact that the time of universal peace has not yet arrived, and that it probably will not arrive in our time. The nations of tlie world are massing their forces and increasing their fleets, and we hear of bloated armaments in various parts of Europe. Consequently we in this young Commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the great military forces that are at work-force s which may not directly menace this young Commonwealth, but which may menace the Empire of which we are a part. Further, I think we cannot ignore, and ought not to ignore the fact that we have sprung from a militant race, a race which has always been able to assert its supremacy on the ocean as well as on the field, and I do not think that the Australian race has lost any of that militant instinct by which the great dominions of the Crown have been built up. I trust the day is far distant when the Australian race will lose those instincts. A t any rate, the instinct of self-preservation and defence against external aggression and attack is one that ought never to be allowed to slumber. This Parliament, therefore, in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by the Constitution, however unpleasant considerations of expenditure may be, must approach this great problem in a statesmanlike attitude, not being carried away by any alarmist feeling that may lead us into extravagance, but, on the other hand, not being afraid of doing our duty policy and statescraft may justify us. Now, according to the Minister for Defence, tlie fundamental principle of the Bill is that the supreme power is to he vested in the Federal Executive-that is the supreme power to administer the provisions of the law. That, however, is hardly a strict explanation of the Bill, because we find that a considerable amount of military power, as well as of naval power, is to be vested in the general officers commanding the naval and military forcesAlthough in this Bill the general officer in command is described in these terms and is not mentioned or referred to as a Commander-in-Chief, still it does not seem that, as' far as the command and discipline of the forces is concerned, the Bill recognises the principle of a Commander-in-Chief, and that raises the first important problem to be considered in connection with the provisions of the measure. Ought the Australian Commonwealth, in organizing its military forces, to place the command and discipline of those forces absolutely under one officer, to be known as the Commander-inChief? There will be a considerable amount of argument to be advanced both for and against that proposition, but having read most of the literature available on this branch of tlie question, I think that tlie status and great lustre that for many ages have attached to the office of the Commander-in-Chief in England are gradually diminishing, and that the general tendency of modern military thought is that the office of the Commander-in-Chief should be modified if not swept away. We all know, as a matter of history, that the time was when the navy was administered solely by the authority and under the supreme command of the Lord High Admiral, whose position corresponded with that of the Commander-in-Chief of the any. We know, also, that the Lord High Admiral's office was placed in commission, and -that its high functions were vested in a Board of Admiralty, and the drift of modern thought seems to be in the direction of placing the office of Commander-in-Chief in commission also. Therefore, I think it is well worthy of consideration whether the commander of the Australian military forces ought not to be associated with a Council of Defence, and that is the first proposal I desire to submit for the consideration of the Minister. The question is whether it as far as considerations of would not be desirable to associate with the general officer commanding a board or council of military advice. Unless that be done, it seems to me that tlie commanding officer will not be in a position to exercise the high functions of his office satisfactorily. He will be probably, for a considerable amount of his time, engaged in the work of inspecting fortifications or other defence works, and branches of tlie service in various parts of Australia, and his usefulness w ill certainly no.t be so great as if he were associated with a Council of Defence. I understand that the Minister has had the idea of appointing a Council of Defence submitted to him, and that he has rejected it for reasons which do not appear. This, however, I do know-that in the report of the military officers who met in 1895-6, and who formulated a scheme of military organization, it was recommended that a council of advice or a Council of Defence should be one of the features of the federal -organization of the forces. It is not necesState Governments that there should be a sary at this stage to pause to consider what should be the exact composition of that Council of Defence, or what should be its function except that it should be partly to aid the general officer commanding and partly to advise him. him. Sir JOHN QUICK about hampering him. A similar council is associated with the officer in command of the army of Switzerland, and there is also a similar council associated with the officer in submit the proposal because of any strong command of the French army. There has been a council of advice in Victoria for many years past, and these councils of advice have been found useful as a means of communication between the superior officer and the various branches of the service. Some members of the council have represented various arms of the service, and have been able to place those brandies in official communication with the commander of the forces, and to bring matters demanding as before the Executive Government. I suggest that a council of defence might be composed of the various district commandants referred to in the Bill, and presided over by* the general officer commanding. Its function should be to recommend to the Governor-Generali n Council regulations for the control of the forces, and it should also make recommendations as to who are f it and proper persons for appointment as officers, as to what officers should be promoted to fill vacancies, as to the fixed establishment of officers, and the number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, as to tlie gradation of officers taken over from the services of the various States, and as to transfers from one corps to another. Such a council might also be called upon to advise the Governor General from time to time on matters of policy referred to them for their opinion and advice. As -to the weight of military authority in favour of the establishment of such a council, I would refer honourable members to the report of an intercolonial military committee which sat in Sydney. It is dated the 29th November, 1896. That committee was composed of Major-General Hutton, Sir Charles Holled Smith, Colonel C. E. Roberts, Colonel J. M . Gordon, and Colonel Howell Guntera strong and representative military body. They agreed to recommend to tlie various Council of Australian Pederal Defence, to be nominated during peace, and to assemble at such intervals as might appear to be desirable, but at least once a year. It was fco have the control of the defence forces of Australia, and was to perform other duties which I need not pause to enumerate. I mention the recommendation of that comI do not know mittee to show that the suggestion which I have made is not without military authority, and I hope that it is not too late to take the matter into consideration. I do not preconceived notions of my own ; I submit it merely to give effect to the representation of our proposed citizen forces in tlie military councils of the Commonwealth. The scheme of defence which we are now considering has been launched partly for the creation of a citizen force-that is, a force composed of citizens who give their services, some gratuitously and some for very trifling remuneration. But the officers and men of such a force are enattention before him as well titled to more than the ordinary consideration which is given to persons whose time is exclusively devoted to military or naval duties. I contend that hi regard to a citizen force, special provision should be made for their representation upon a military council, charged with advisory functions in matters relating to their interests. I shall not, however, take up further time with that branch of tlie subject now, because there are other and even more important matters which demand attention. That is a preliminary and subordinate matter in comparison with some of the other provisions of the Bill. Next to the commander-in-chief comes tlie federal army which it is proposed to create. The Bill divides the active federal forces into permanent forces, militia forces, and volunteer forces. In that division or classification a very important principle is to be found. The Minister of Defence stated that he has not adopted the recommendation of the military officers that the permanent forces should be given precedence over the volunteer and citizen forces, and he is to be congratulated upon having assumed that attitude. But I",43,Defence Bill Second Reading
234,Mr Watson,"And partly to hamperwould point out that although he has not in so many words given precedence to the permanent forces, he has, by the classification to which I have drawn attention, by placing the permanent forces at the top of the list, laid the foundation of a claim which will no doubt be made hereafter that the permanent forces, although numerically the smallest, should he considered in point of status, position, and influence the superior element. I contend that in forming an Australian federal defence force such as we contemplate no such principle of classification should be allowed. If the proposed classification remains in the Bill, the permanent element will gain indirectly what it has failed to secure directly. I think we should take every care and precaution to secure that the proposed federal force shall be an integrated united force, a force in which artificial distinctions and differentiations shall not be allowed to creep in, especially when they are to the advantage of the permanent element and to the disadvantage of the volunteer and citizen elements. If there is to be any priority or preference in the mode of classification it should be given rather to the citizen and volunteer element than to the permanent element. I suggest that instead of the classification adopted in the Bill, we should provide that the active forces shall consist of officers and men, sailors and soldiers, serving during a portion of their time either for pay or gratuitously; and that for the purpose of keeping ships, forts, armaments, arid warlike materials in proper condition, officers and men may be engaged to give the whole of their time to serve in the active forces. tically the effect of the provision in the missioned officers, 8 surgeons, and 4,346 Bill.

But I fear that unless some provision be made to prevent the growth of military feeling, it is bound to grow. It has been seen in Australia already under our existing systems, and it will grow more intensely under the B ill as it stands. What have been the consequences of allowing the permanent element to dominate our forces ? One of the consequences is that in the permanent forces there is an undue proportion of officers to men, as compared with the proportion in the volunteer forces. I have not had access to the Victorian information, but I have before me some figures relating to the composition of the military forces of New South Wales which I will use to illustrate how tlie permanent element has acquired strength and absorbed expenditure in the past. The permanent forces of New South Wales amount to 747 men ; 659 permanent officers and men cost on the average £131 17s. 3d. per man per annum, while 5,549 partially-paid officers and niencost on the average £ 1 7 5s. lOd. per man per annum, and 3,347 volunteers cost on the average £ 8 10s. 5d. per man per annum. So that three permanent men cost as much as 22 partially-paid men, or 43 volunteers ; and in a report which appears in to-day's newspapers, Colonel Templeton is said to have stated last night that three permanent men cost as much as 84 members of rifle clubs. In the permanent forces of New South Wales, there are 54 officers, 227 warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, .40 clerks, and 426 men, or 747 altogether. In the partially-paid forces, there are 297 men, or 5,370 altogether. So that in the I do not think that permanent forces one man in ten is an offi-",45,Defence Bill Second Reading

236,Mr Crouch,"Has tlie honourable and the desirability of hedging about the proposed military authorities with every precaution, in order to prevent undue growth of power in their hands. The citizen element and the volunteer element, which we desire to encourage and give prominence to under this Bill, should not be overshadowed by any professional element. It would be disastrous to our proposed citizen force if we permitted any provision to get into this Bill which might tend to foster or create anything like a difference of rank or status, such as would lead to one branch of the force being regarded as professional officers or soldiers, and another branch being looked upon as amateurs. We ought to resist that at the very outset. My desire in supporting this proposed federal force is that the citizen and the volunteer element should predominate, and that every effort shall be made to provide that a volunteer in the service of the Commonwealth who may not be in receipt of any pay, or a militiaman who may not be in receipt of much pay, shall, in the general eye of the law at any rate, be considered as good as tlie permanent man. Unless that be done, the tendency will be for the permanent element to look down upon the militia and tlie volunteer element, so that those in B and C divisions will, in time, come to be regarded as inferior men. professional man from looking down on the amateur 1 Sir JOHN QUICK professional element is given the primary position. Of course I know that we cannot keep a professional man from looking down upon an amateur. I am merely pointing out that under this Bill, in the order of classification, the permanent element have received the pride of place, and that there is, on account of that classification, a danger that there will not be that unity in the force-that equality of status which it is most desirable should receive expression in this Bill. the honourable and learned member not give the lawyer precedence over tlie amateur ? Sir JOHN QUICK anything of the kind at the present stage. I am merely discussing what may possibly be the effects following from this Bill, and I do not think that the honourable member for Coolgardie is anxious to allow any class distinctions to grow up in the force. A t any rate, nothing should be done to facilitate that if it can be avoided. W it h reference the to the officers also, I concur in the remark made by a previous speaker, that if we possibly can in this proposed Australian defence force we should make every provision for, and give every encouragement to, the promotion of officers from, the ranks. I entertain the view that in this democratic country men should be encouraged to work their way up from the ranks to the highest position, not only in civillife butalso in connection with our military and naval forces. I was very much impressed a couple of months ago, upon reading a letter in the Times by Donald Macdonald, the celebrated war correspondent, in 'which the .following passage occurred :It has been said, and ssiid truly, that the non-commissioned officer is the backbone of the British army. Many of them are of good education, who would be invaluable as commissioned officers if it were not so expensive to be au officer and a little less attention were paid to social differences. This is the whole crux of army reform. They want more of the wear and tear and common sense amongst the commissioned officers. At present, admission to the ranks is only by some brilliant action in the field; but the best and biggest things done in action are never heard of, and it is only the isolated cases that are seen by the proper people,, and are reported to head quarters and win distinction. That is most remarkable testimony by a distinguished authority, and I hope that the can we prevent the Commonwealth Parliament will, so far as regulation and opinion can operate, endeavour to give effect to the ideathat men In this B ill the should be encouraged to work their way up from the ranks to the position of non-commissioned officers, and from that position to the rank of commissioned officers. I hope that we shall recognise that they should not be debarred from so doing by any artificial distinction, and that they shall not be required-as it is said is required in some army regulations-to be either possessed of private means or within a certain limit as regards age, a limit which undoubtedly has the effect of excluding worthy men. If , in launching this scheme of military defence In a matter of law, would on our Commonwealth, we insist upon it being understood that every member of our militia force or volunteers may like the I a m not discussing soldier of the French republic dream that he has a marshal's baton in his knapsack, that principle would have the effect of giving strength, power, and popularity to our Australian defence force. I wish next to invite attention to the provision that is",46,Defence Bill Second Reading
237,Sir John Quick,What I suggest is,47,Defence Bill Second Reading
238,Mr Higgins,How,47,Defence Bill Second Reading
239,Mr Mahon,"made in this Bill with reference to the reserves. Honourable members will see that in clause 29 the provision as to reserves is a very nieagre and unsatisfactory one indeed. It is upon the same lines as have been followed in Victoria for seventeen years past, where the system adopted may be considered a total failurea mere reserve in name. What we want to provide for, in addition to the active military force, is a reserve in reality. As the result of my reading of the available literature on this subject, I think that the best reserve at our command for our proposed scheme of citizen defence is to be found in the rifle clubs. Provision ought to be made, not merely to formally recognise the rifle clubs as an entity, but to recognise them as an entity forming a possible component part of our army should it ever unfortunately be called upon to take the field. The rifle clubs should be organized to be a real part of the reserve. For that purpose arrangements should be made for giving instruction and training to their various members. I have the assurance of officers, from the commanding officer of the rifle clubs down to tlie subordinate officers and men, that they are only too anxious to be recognised in this Bill as part of the reserve force of the Commonwealth. They are an unpaid force, they give their time and attention to practising with, the rifle, and in many cases-as in my own districtthey have by their own labour cleared the scrub in order to establish their rifle ranges. These are the kind of citizen soldiers that we want to encourage. It is quite possible that arrangements of a very satisfactory character could be made for the drilling and training of the members of rifle clubs. Queensland now. Sir JOHN QUICK it. dependent for their training and instruction merely upon the regimental drill instructor. Some means of a more effective character than that ought to be adopted, and the company officers themselves ought to take an interest in the training and drilling of their men. If that were done, we should be able to turn out a better class of soldier. A very great deal depends upon the training. We want men who are not mere machines, but who are so trained that they can be capable of initiative, and capable of exhibiting an individuality, which is one of the primary requisites of military duty in these times. Whilst speaking of the reserve force, perhaps I may be allowed to suggest another addition to it, which could be secured by enrolling the members of tlie fire brigades throughout Australia. Some honourable members may consider that a startling suggestion, but I think that it is worthy of consideration. I hold in my hand a copy of a resolution passed at a meeting of delegates of the Victorian Country Fire Brigades, which was held at Bendigo on 7th March last. About 50 members were present, and a certain resolution was carried. It was moved by Captain .Andrew, of Bendigo, and seconded by Captain Suffern, of CharltonThat the Country Fire Board be written to asking them to take into consideration the advisability of getting the members of the Victorian country fire brigades affiliated with the defence forces of the State, and that the Defence department be askedfcosupply us with rifles, and to undertake to teach us in shooting. There are about 1,900 men connected with the Victorian country fire brigades, and I have the assurance of the leading officers that the men are quite willing to place their services at the disposal of the Commonwealth as a reserve force. I am told that they are perfectly prepared to submit to arrangements being made for drilling and training them provided that they are properly recognised. I have also taken the trouble to consult with a few leading military men with whom I have the honour of being acquainted, and they say that the plan of incorporating the fire brigades is a practicable one, and that the military authorities would be only too glad to utilize this volunteer element. doing it in teers. I simply throw out this suggestion. We are organizing a citizen force. Let us I am glad to hear see that we have a citizen force not only in Our citizen soldiers should not be name, but in reality. Here we have a fine class of men who are to some extent prepared for discipline, and who are only too eager to place themselves at the disposal of the Commonwealth in the direction which I have suggested. I am glad to see that the cadet force has been properly recognised h i this Bill, and I rejoice that the Minister for Defence had the courage and strength to resist the recommendation of the military officers that the cadets should not be incorporated in this scheme.

There is no doubt such a company or such an enterprise could be madeto pay the Commonwealth.

Our frontiei's are the sent time, so that there would be plenty of work either for a federal establishment or for a private company engaged in such an enterprise as that which 1 have' mentioned. So much with regard to the military branch of this Bill. 1 would invite honourable members' attention to the fact that nearly the whole of the Bill deals with military defence. There is-hardly a provision relating to naval defence. So far as reference is made to naval defence, it accepts the status quo. There is no indication of any policy, or even of the consideration of any policy, in the direction of naval defence. I , for one, am disposed to think that naval defence is of supreme importance-of even greater importance than military defence. With all respect to the military officers who are interested in promoting this Bill, and with all respect to the soldiers and volunteers who are interested in it, I say that the great fundamental mistake in it is that while provision is made for military defence of an elaborate character, no provision is made for the improvement of our naval defence. Honourable members have had placed before them the figures relating to the cost of defence as a whole. I believe the Minister for Defence stated that the cost per year amounts to about £700,000. An £800,000. £700.000 is applied to the purposes of naval defence? We have it in official documents that the average amount of money expended by the whole of Australia on local naval forces, partly paid and partly permanent, consists of about £65,00.0 per year. fence expenditure, or our contribution to naval defences, is made up of the sum of £126,000, which we pay as a subsidy to the Imperial Government. This amounts altogether to a little over £.190,000not naval defences of Australia, leaving the balance of tlie £700,000 to be applied towards military defence. I would invite the attention of honourable members to this question, and especially the attention of those who are peculiarly interested in military matters. Whence and' in what direction might Australia expect danger? Isi t not from across the sea ? We are an island continent-w e have no military high seas which surround our island continent. Like those' isles from which we come, our first and most important line of defence undoubtedly is on the sea. I would like. to invite the attention of honourable members to a passage from the London Sjjectator of the 26th Ma)', 1900, in illustration of what I am now submitting. Referring to Australia as on island continent, and the necessity for naval defence, the Spectator saysTo hold intercourse with mankind, to share in their fortunes, to enrich themselves by commerce, above all to be great in the world's aftairs, the Australians must take to the sea. B3' the sea they will sell everything, through the sea they will buy everything ; and that fact, which they cannot alter, will in the end-whic h may not b& as distant as Ave now imagine-forc e upon them ships,fleetsto protect the ships, and, if we may look 3'et a few decades further ahead, political ambitions. A great commerce implies fleets to protect it,fleetsrequire maritime stations, and both commerce and ambition point out to tha Australians the same path. Of course, the language in that passage may be a little high-flown and coloured; but at the same time there is a great amount of truth in it . We cannot expect to maintain our position as an island continent, altogether isolated and removed from the influence of the great forces qf the Avorld. I hope that in time Australia, agencies, Avill stretch its hand across the sea and plant trading and commercial stations in most of the great countries of the world.

I do not suggest that we should start a navy that would be in antagonism or in conflict with the British fleet in times of action; but 1 do say that we might make arrangements in the direction suggested by the committee of naval officers which assembled in Melbourne in August, 1899. The conference was attended by Captain Francis Hixson, commander, New South Wales; Captain William Cresswell, South Australia; Captain Collins, Secretary for Defence, Victoria; Commander Drake, of Queensland ; and Commander Tickell, of Victoria. I do not wish to elaborate their report too much, because I am afraid I am trespassing at too great a length on honourable members' attention; but I would certainly invite consideration to the recommendations of the committee, which was not an Imperial committee, or a committee of Imperial officers, but a committee of officers who are in tlie employment of the Australian Governments. suggestions contained in the report appear tlie following:] . That whilst aKoyal Naval Reserve cannot, in our opinion, be raised in Australia on conditions required by the Admiralty, yet we consider that a naval force that would be efficient and available for service in vessels of war can be raised on rates of pay and conditions of service suitable to the colonies. 2. That such force should be formed by the amalgamation of the existing naval permanent establishments, who would be the instructional staff and required nucleus for maintainence of the vessels in reserve, the complement of the vessel being made up by the officers and men not permanently employed, but maintained in efficiency hy courses of annual training. This force would be maintained and controlled by the Federal Government, and would be governed by a Federal Discipline Act, and regulations which would provide for their employment in general naval service. 3.

Now, in this proposal I think we can find the germ of a scheme which may very properly be considered and elaborated, and which would be suitable to the of our young Commonwealth. suggest anything, very extravagant or very Sir John Quick. expensive, but I say that, as an alternative to the present system of paying an annual subsidy towards the British Govern-' ment in,return for our auxiliary squadron, v.*e might organize a scheme of naval reserves in each of the principal seaports of Australia, on the lines recommended in this report. These naval reserves would form -centres at which the seafaring population of Australia could be recruited and drilled in naval manoeuvres and practice, and they would form a body of trained men, who could, in time, either be drafted off for service in British men-of-war or placed on the reserve list here. Lord Brassey, in one of his valuable pamphlets, has drawn attention to the fact that there are upwards of 30,000 seafaring people in Australia engaged in the coastal maritime trade, and in fishing and similar occupations, from whom recruits could be drawn for the building up of these naval reserves. I think that some system of that sort would be far preferable to the payment of subsidies to the British Government. WhilstI , for one, admire the principle of the Naval DefencesA ct which WJIS at the time regarded as a splendid reAmong the cognition by the Australian people of their obligations An Honorable MEMBER It was very inadequate. Sir JOHN QUICK It was very inadequate, we all admit. The sum of £126,000 a year given by Australia towards the cost of maintaining the auxiliary squadron is a very small contribution indeed in comparison with the risks to which our commerce is exposed, or with the contribution to the defence of the Empire which we might reasonably be called upon to make. As I mentioned on a previous occasion the naval defences of tlie Empire cost £30,000,000 a year, and yet towards that vast sum Australia contributes only £126,000. I say that that is a small and insignificant amount, but still it might be better spent in the establishment of Australian branches of the naval reserves, as recommended by tlie conference of naval experts. I hope it will not be considered premature or out of place to press upon the consideration of the House at the present time the vast importance of this question of naval defence-in fact its supreme importance, its vastly greater importance than the question of requirements military defence. We are proposing to I do not spend at least two-thirds of the total amount to be devoted to defence upon our military forces, whereas the most important of our defences, as I think we will all agree -the naval defences-is comparatively neglected. I ask this House, therefore, to pause before ib commits itself to any increase in our expenditure upon military defences, and to regard generously and favourably any proposal for the improvement of our present system of naval defence. If tlie Housedoes this we shall not only be doing our duty,'bub what is reasonable and what is .absolutely necessary in order to preserve the naval and maritime instincts of our people. I hope the result of this discussion will be that such alterations will be made, .and improvements effected, as will make this measure a good and workableBillaB ill which will, not be unpopular, but which will command the respect of the democracy, and also the admiration of our fellow countrymen throughout the Empire. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) I approach this subject with a deep sense of responsibility. I agree with previous speakers that it is certainly one of the most important bhat bhis Commonwealth Parliament can have to deal with, and I feel that my responsibility is very much greater by reason of the fact that I nm totally ignorant in every way of anything of a military character. All the preceding speakers, including the Minister for Defence, have had at least some experience of military matters, but I have had none whatever, for I have token no part in any volunteer movement for the defence of my native land. A t the same time, if this nation were in danger, I would not be one to shield myself under the clause of this Bill that exempts Members of Parliament from military service, but I would throw up my seat and shoulder a musket, and I believe bhab is the spirit that would actuate every one throughout the Commonwealth -the spirit of ready response when called upon for the defence of the countiy. Consequently I think that the great responsibility thab resbs upon the House is to frame such a measure as will maintain bhab spirib of patriotism and to take care to avoid legislation that would have blie effect of killing, or withering, it away to such a point that we might have bo take the final course of introducing a system of conscription. I do not think anything could surpass the importance of this question, and although ib has been held bhab we who are mere [189] civilians, should be very cautious about offering criticism in a matter of this sort, I think our responsibility is such thab we cannob geb out of it by pleading ignorance of the subject. I hold bhab in a matter of this character, it is not so necessary to have a military training as to have some common sense and some knowledge, of the history of nations, and of what has been done in other lands ; and with bins belief to support me, I will venture to criticise this measure in the hope that has been previously expressed that we, the representatives of the people of bhis new nation, will be able to give them a measure under which the land-if ever bhab fabeful moment comes when we shall have bo defend ib-ca n be defended well and thoroughly, .and the enemy whipped away from our shores. I was exceedingly disappointed at the way in which the Minister inbroduced bhis Bill. His speech in moving bhe second reading was disappointing, to me in every respect. I had looked forward to the time when bhis Bill would be inbroduced bo hear some declaration, from a statesman's point of view, of the opinions of the Ministry on this great subject of defence. I had looked forward to a statement of the policy of the Government, and of the reasons which underlay bhe considerations bhat induced Ministers to adopt bhab policy, bub I heard nob one word bhab would give us bhe fainbesb inkling that a policy of any sort had been adopted. If honourable members will casb their recollections back to bhe speech of bhe Ministerf o r ' Defence, perhaps bhey will agree wibh me when I say bhat the measure took somewhat the form of something baited and thrown into the Chamber, in order to ascertain what were the opinions of the members of tlie Legislature, and what were the feelings of the people, so that a measure might eventually be drafted bo meeb bhe circumsbances. The second readings of Bills, in accordance -with the traditions of tlie mother of Parliamenbs, and according to the practice of every other Parliament of the world, are occasions to be utilized, not for the reading out of the clauses of a Bill, or of the titles of such clauses, but for announcing and defining the great principles underlying the measure. But I defy any honourable member bo say bhat in any shape whatever the Minister declared any policy, or gave the House any statement of principles upon which they could judge of the policy adopted by the Government. of the Minister for Defence was totally devoid of anything .beyond the mere reading over of the clauses of the Bill, in short; and he left it to the House to gather, as best they could, the underlying principles followed by the Government, which I have not yet been able to discover. My contention is borne out by the fact that nearly every honourable member who has addressed himself to this subject has been in the dark on all points, and there has been a unanimity of opinion that the measure has disclosed no policy whatever, and that we have nothing whatever to debate except the abstract question as to what is to be the defence system .of this There were two courses open to Ministers. The time was short, things had been hurried forward very much, and there was a great deal to do It was competent for Ministers to have taken over the defence forces of tlie various States, and to have made some temporary arrangement for the amalgamation of the forces, contenting themselves 'the bare amalgamation for a few. brief years until they could evolve a system, and in the evolution of this system they might have had 'the assistance of tlie high and competent authority who we are assured will be engaged to help us in carrying out the defences of Australia. continued the system such as it was until they could give us a scheme of defence which would be perfect in all its branches, and which would be satisfactory to the people. 'They have seemingly attempted tem of defence, but they have given us only a skeleton, upon which may be woven 'any policy that it may be thought well to adopt. I look upon the Bill as neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring, and it reminds me of Johnson's leg of mutton, which was ill-bred, ill-fed, ill-dressed, ill-served, thought desirable in the naval defence of this ill-carved, ill-everything. graft on . to this measure any policy we like. There is no good in it, but there is a great deal that is perniciously wrong and bad in principle. for Defence led us to believe that this Bill had been the product of great thought, and that it was a measure that was based on mature consideration ; that he had had the reports of military experts, but had thrown them aside and had adopted something that was vastly better, and we were Mr O. B. Edward*. promised that the provisions of the B ill The speech would meet all the circumstances that might: arise in regard to any dangers that might, menace Australia, He pointed out that he had included within the provisions of the measure the cadet forces. I think that any national system of defence must contemplate the training of our citizens at the youngest age, and that we must teach tlie young idea howto shoot before we can commence to make an army. Then the Minister touched upoii the question of rifle clubs, but he entirely failed to gauge the pulse of the nation upon this very important matter. There is a deep-seated feeling in the community that we have to look to these rifle clubs as one of the most foremost features of our defences. Commonwealth. There is no doubt that the popularity of the rifle clubs is very much greater than the Minister thought or seems likely to believe. We have a description of citizen forces divided-why , I cannot say-int o militia and volunteer. I could never see the reason of adopting these two classifications in forming citizen forces when a combination with of the two would be quite adequate for anything we could expect having regard to the medium region of our finances. The Minister hardly referred to the question of naval defence, which was so ably advocated by the honourable member for Bendigo this evening, in-that respect he was asked, They could have some questions as his speech proceeded, and he was able to give us no more information than that there was to be an officer in charge of the naval, defences as in the case of military defences, but as for any details as to whether he would retain and amplify to give us a complete systhe present relations under which the mother country defends us, in return for a subsidy, or whether he would create an Australian navy and develop what I believe is the real thorough naval spirit of this community, we were left entirely in tlie dark, as to anything he or Ministers We may enCommonwealth.

AVith regard to the permanent . forces I am glad to note a tone going further in this matter than creating a force to man the forts and batteries which protect our ports, and to establish a reserve for naval defence. Coming again to what is called, both in the old country and here, the first line of defence for maritime comiminities, the Prime Minister uttered some winged words the other day, which I am pleased to see have gone round the community. "" a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation."" We must never forget in. dealing, with defence matters that we have an island for a home. As has been pointed out by the press, and by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, how must we expect an enemy to approach our shores ? There is no possibility of him coming except by water, and the first way of meeting him-cos t what it may-is with a naval defence. I am sorry that in connection with this question of naval defence I am not in accord with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I do not think that we can do much better than we are doing. We have not the means to create a navy or to train, up a body of men in ships commissioned for fighting. AH that we can do is to cany on the present system. We may amplify it if we choose, or we may make some arrangement by which the old country shall be represented by a fleet which shall be confined to the shores of Australia and to protecting the shipping of the Commonwealth. For the present, however, our means' will not allow us to go much further. But we can go further in the direction, suggested by Lord Brassey and others, of creating a naval reserve. From whatever stand-point we view this question, we must come to tlie conclusion that we have continually to look to the creation of reserves. Any system that will give us a large body of reserves must be a very good system for us. We might go further in this respect by increasing the naval brigade, and by imparting to them more efficient practical instruction. We might train them not only to figure-as they do so well-in gun practice on shore, but in occasional practice on the ocean. By doing this, we shall be doing all we can afford at the present time towards the naval, defence of this community. If we do as I have suggested, and if we resolutely throughout the House against bring the rifle clubs to the front, and make them popular, we shall be acting wisely. But we ought not to allow old men who are really past service to take part in them. Let us keep the rifle clubs open only to young men, who, after passing through them, will enter the reserves, and prove valuable to the Commonwealth in time of need. the honourable member would impose ? He said that we have Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not think that we ought to have* men in -the rifle clubs over 40 years of age.. shots are over 40. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Then tlie best shots should be in the reserves.' We want in the rifle clubs to get hold of the bad shots, make good shots of them, and pass them on to the reserves. I recollect many years ago reading of Crecy, Agincourt, and other places, where the shooting of the English archers and crossbows won battle after battle. Right throughout history we see the success which has attended accurate shooting. But I do not think it meets the case sufficiently for a man to be able to hit a bull's-eye in a scientific posture at S00 yards. What we want is men who can run an unknown distance, and halting at any time between 200 and 500 yards, judge then distance, and fire-such marksmen as 1 we have met with in the South African war. train the forces to be able to do that ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I admitted my ignorance of military matters in the first place. I cannot tell how long it will take, but I feel certain that my view is an accurate one, and that the creation of largo reserves is the only sound system of defence which can be adopted by this communitj . r The system must be popular. It is of no use giving us a system which the people of this community will regard as practically one of conscription. It must be a system which the people will readily join. No system can be popular which preserves a distinction between the rank and file and the officers. There may be some reason why such a distinction should be kept up in England, though it has been gradually losing ground in the English army; but there is no reason why it should be maintained in this quarter of the globe in con* nexion with a citizens' defence force.

While this is so, if we pass regulations which permit of men without means qualifying, we shall be only offering them a stone. The present system is not one whit better .than the old purchase system which' was abolished by Gladstone. Under that system men paid for their commissions. Underoursystem they pay for their uniforms, and they cost pretty nearly the price of a commission in some cases. The only way to get rid of this difficulty is to prohibit the use of uniforms above a certain value, or to determine that the Commonwealth shall provide the whole of the uniforms for the officers, and take care that they do not cost too much. This would i open the way to ambitious young men to obtain commissions. The Minister for Defence said that tlie poor man loved gold lace as much as the rich. Why should he not? But what we ask is that the gold lace that makes the uniform soexpensive shall be abolished for both the poor man and the rich, and that where men are making equal sacrifices they shall stand on the same terms of equality as we stand on in the political arena. If we do that, we shall carry out the principle to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo alluded, and each soldier will know that if he has not a marshal's baton in his knapsack, he at least has the chance of obtaining a captain's commission. That fact will stimulate him to qualify for any position that his ambition and merit can command. If we do this, and base our claim upon the patriotism and goodwill of the Australian people, we shall make tlie system popular, and, if we make it just to everybody alike, there will be no need for conscription, but the people will come forward in numbers, and provide us with a defence system which will be quite adequate for tlie circumstances of the Commonwealth. member for South Sydney apologized for his want of military knowledge. ing to him, we can at least' say that he has a knowledge of military principles. honourable member spoke as if he hod been reading Cressy's Fifteen Decisive Battles and Hamiey's Operations of War. He gave ns a lot of useful information. Whenever military matters have been discussed before, Not only is one uniform I have been accustomed to see them treated in rather a humorous manner. I have heard the Australians spoken of as though in the case of an outbreak of hostilities there would not be an available hollow log between Port Phillip and Cape York. But the experience of the past twelve months has been that the Australians have done yeoman service in waifare, and they have received such a. measure of instruction as will prove useful to us in laying the foundation of our military system. I think that the Minister for Defence made an egregious miscalculation when, in moving the second reading of the Bill, he stated that Australia could put about 1,000,000 men into the field. AVe all know that no countiy can place the whole of its population in the fighting hue. To say that 1,000,000 men could be put into the field by Australia is an over-statement which would bring upon this Chamber, if not contradicted, a certain amount of ridicule by foreign powers. If we were fighting for our national existence, we might possibly put 500,000 men in tlie field, but not 500,000 men who were trained to military discipline. I trust that the Prime Ministeri n his officialcapacity will contradict the statement made by tlie Minister for Defence, as otherwise it will probably be looked upon as-a bombastic advertisement. I think that the paramount duty of the Commonwealth is to study the financial aspect of the military question. If the system of which we have experience in the States be allowed 'to continue and grow, the whole of the Commonwealth revenue will soon be exhausted. It is the duty of this House to keep a tight hand and a watchful eye upon the expenditure, otherwise there may be a tendency to extravagance. The cost of our defence forces throughout the whole of the States last year was over £800,000. That sum included, I admit, the £126,000, which forms our annual contribution to the Australian auxiliary squadron. . MrV . L . SOLOMON -Does not it also in(Dalley) -The honourable clude extraordinary expenditure on account of contingents ? that out.

255,After Listen,"Mr Wilks No ; I have purposely leftthan 2,000 permanent men. I trust that this Parliament will expect a better return in the future for such an expenditure than has been received in the past. The Swiss military system has been cited as a model for a young Commonwealth like ours to follow. There, for an expenditureof £1,000,000, they have a military force of 120,000 men. They have the Landwehr of 70,000 men, and the Landstrum, which corresponds exactly to our reserves, of 300,000 men, and out of that number 60,000 men are well equipped and trained for war. In Canada, which compares even more closely with Australia, we find that with an -expenditure not exceeding £500,000, there is a force of something like 360,000 men. I hope that in the Commonwealth ad ministration of the defences the civil control will be powerful, as against military dictation or direction. the permanent officers have great control, their recommendations are always on the side of gross expenditure. In view of the illustration of Canada, where the conditions are very similar to those of Australia, we should hope to have a better return for the Commonwealth expenditure than has been -obtained for the States' expenditure. sure that these are the Canadian figures? They are marvellously startling. collection of the figures I give. amounts to 30s. per man per annum. the reserves and everything else. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has shown that the cost of the rifle clubs and volunteer corps is very little per head, but the cost of the partially paid and permanent forces is very much higher. Canada is somewhere about 35,000or 40,000 men. tion suggests that the first line of defence in Canada is 35,000 or 40,000 men. In the United States we find that a department is -never introduced until experience has Shown that it is necessary; and Canada has done likewise, and there is the result. I would like to say one word in regard to the Council of Defence suggested by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. On the face of it the proposal has much to recommend it, but, unfortunately for his illustration, the Council of Defence, to which he alluded, had an unfortunate ending so far as efficiency is concerned. I remember that the commandants of the various States met in Melbourne two or three years ago for tlie purpose of making general recommendations to the various States Governments. Amongst other recommendations was one that the forces of Australia should be armed with a small arm of a certain class,"" and the Council broke up with that determination. But three or four months afterwards, instead of the commandants carryingout the recommendations of the conference, the commandant in Victoria absolutely armed his men with a different rifle altogether. I simply state this because the honourable and learned member referred to this conference as one reason for recommending a Council of DeWe find that when fence. Personally, I do not agree with that honourable and learned member. I rather agree with the honourable member for South Sydney in the suggestion that the. Minister for .Defence, who is responsible, should be advised by the most expert commandants he can get. The experience of Great Britaini n her war in South Africa, where .the tactics of the enemy were directed to preventing invasion, should provide object lessons for Australia, As we are so far removed from the I was very careful in the theatre of European war, an officer of high attainments would be desirable for the Commonwealth. We should have an up-to-date commandant, some one like Major-General Hutton, whose introduction into New South Wales was marked with good effect. Major-General Hutton simply revolutionized what had been a rotten system of defence, and in no direction did he do greater work than in improving the knowledge and the capacity of the officers under him. W it h no disrespect to the present commandant, it may be regretted that we have not another man of the same strong discipline, and strong character of Major General Hutton. I hope the Commonwealth will obtain the services of a gentleman of like attainments. On the matter of conscription I think there is some little difference of opinion, or misunderstanding. As I read the Bill there is no conscription in the sense understood in European countries. On the continent of Europe the conscription takes men away from their occupations and duties as citizens for long periods, for the purpose of military training.",57,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And

What is provided under clause 48 is that in case of emergency, such as invasion, the Commonwealth shall have power to call out certain men for active service. clause directly. I would like to say that five out of tlie States of the Commonwealth already possess the power sought in clause 48-namely , tlie power in case of emergency to do what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo objects to, and calls conscription. Mr G. B. EBWABDS -Al l nations have that power. one State that does not possess that power at present, and the power, if given in the Bill, will only be exercised, as interjected by the Prime Minister, in case of necessity. If the volunteering spirit of the people is strong enough-and we believe from experience it will be-there , will be no reason to exercise any such power and , authority. I take it that it will be only in cases of exthe millions of armed men in the world whotreme urgency that the Commonwealth will exercise the power already possessed by five States of the union. If this conscription compelled men to go into military training I would oppose it. But even on the matter of conscription there has been a remarkable change of opinion during the last 70 years amongst the great powers of the world. It was only in 1814 that Prussia, under the pressure of the hero of Corsica, was compelled to resort to conscription, and between that time and the present the whole of the powers have been compelled to take a similar course. Even Switzerland has done so, and that is the country which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo so much admires, as a community of democratic ideas trained on radical lines. Britain is the only power that has kept free from the doctrine of conscription, but even in Great Britain the point is very often raised by leading public men whether that great country may not be compelled, for the purposes of defence and for the preservation of the Empire, to adopt some quasi system of conscription. I will not deal with that question now, but simply remark that the present Premier of Great Britain, . some eighteen months ago, in an address in London, regretted very much the difficulty of obtaining suitable men for defence pm-poses. He appealed to the people of England to keep the example of Switzerland"" before them, and also to keep before them the example of the English at the time of Edward III . in the battle of Creey: If they kept such examples before I will consider that them, the Prime Minister of England was sure that the spirit of the people would be such that they would offer their services to tlie State, and then the danger and difficulty of conscription would be overcome. He pointed out that the army of Switzer-. land, with its powers of conscription, was admired by all military experts as tlie best system of military training in existence. Mr G. B. EDWABDS -Switzerlan d has 5,000,000 armed men around her. millions of armed men are around Great Britain. We know that in the early period of the Boer war, there was likely to be a concert of all the European powers against England, and I do not know whether the clanger of so many million armed people around Switzerland is greater than that created by do not look with the best favour on Great Britain. against invasion. agreement to that effect, and I am glad that the honourable member has reminded me of it . But when we are asked to copy the military system of Switzerland, we must not only copy it in certain details to please ourselves. If we find that this system is supposed to be a perfect one, we must copy it in the -whole .of its details, so as to get the f u l l result. We are told that the officers in Switzerland are not promoted by seniority, but simply by merit. That is an admirable idea, and I can understand, seeing that Great the Swiss officer remains a citizen, that the citizens and the army work well together. If we copy only one part of the scheme, and neglect another, the result will probably not be the success met with in Switzerland. There the people do not look on the system as conscription, but regard it as a means of protection. In Australia, the fact that so many men join the ranks, of the volunteers, and in their desire formilitary training occasionally .suffer disabilities without fair reward, inclines me to the belief that in case of emergency the people of this continent would not object to clause 48.

The volunteers, free to the State, supply a compensation not easy to measure in pounds shillings and pence. In New South ""Wales they are the raw material of the partially paid forces; and I presume it is the same in other States. Volunteers without fee or reward undergo all this training, and often pass into the ranks Tif the militia. It has been said by volunteer officers that they lose the best of their men by the inducements held out by the militia. As to exemptions from service, we find that members of the the States and Commonwealth Parliaments are exempt. denying ordinance carried, and Members of Parliament debarred from accepting commissions in military forces. If Members of Parliament are exempted from serving, they should be prevented from holding commissions. Members of Parliament holding military commissions have run into conflict with the staff authorities, and it would be inimical to the interests of the Commonwealth to allow the two positions to be held at' the same time, because Members of Parliament have power and influence whicli in this connection would not be right. I trust the volunteer system will be accompanied by proper organization and proper equipment. Reference has been madefcothe want of an 'arsenal or small arms factory in the Commonwealth. The suggestion that there should be some such establishment comes with greater force when we find the superintendent at Woolwich, Sir Henry Brackenbury, informing us that in the last .Boer war the amount of ammunition expended was greater than in any previous campaign. He computed that the amount of ammunition expended in small arms was five times greater than that expended in the Franco-German war. He also computed that the amount of ammunition expended by the big guns in the South African campaign was three times greater than during the Franco-Prussian war. So that even with all our advances in the matter of machine guns, improved ordinance, and mechanical appliances, we find that the cost of war, as far as ammunition is concerned, is becoming greater and greater. Not only that, but the merest neophyte .must know that the present method of conducting war, the. fighting in extended order, and the absence of close formation, has a very strong tendency to cause the expenditure of greater quantities of ammunition. If Australia is to keep a thoroughly equipped body of men, such as is recommended by the Minister for Defence, we must have a national arsenal to provide us with all the necessary ammunition and other war requisites. We know what the cost of the ammunition will be, and also what amount of ammunition will be necessary; and to rely upon the stores of the old country when our mercantile ""marine might, as has been pointed out, be captured, would be to place ourselves in a very weak position indeed. I would like to see the I would like to see a selfGovernment establish an arsenal. The tendency of the British authorities, conser^vative as we all know them to be, has been to proceed more and more upon the lines of conducting Government estabr lishraents for the supply, not only of There have been occasions when ammunition and munitions of war, but also of clothing for their troops. A t Pimlico a clothing establishment is run under Government supervision and control, and the principle of providing for Government necessities through Government establishments is being more and more extended. I would not urge the extension of any of the I private"" concerns for manufacture of ammu T nifcion in existence at tlie present time. If we take Captain Whitney's factory, we find that although it is spoken of as a cartridge factory, it is really "" only a packing factory, because the materials of which the cartridges are made are imported, and are simply packed here. to an interruption of supplies as if we were to import the cartridges direct. for Bland has said, the supply of the materials of which the cartridges are made is just as much dependent upon the inain 7 tenance of sea traffic, as the supply of cartridges sent direct from England. We do not wish to live in a fool's paradise and think that we have an ammunition factory, when it is only a packing factory, which will not secure us against the risk of having our supplies cut off. As a matter of fact, there is no establishment carrying on business here such as we require in order to provide proper supplies of ammunition which will render us independent of outside sources, and I hope the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is temporarily in charge of the Bill, and who I understand has had some",59,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And

269,Mr Wilks,"As the honourable memberexperience of military matters' himself, will see the necessity of establishing a Government arsenal. In regard to the question of training .men for military puiposes, the honourable member for South Sydney, and also the .honourable and learned member for Bendigo, suggested that our fire brigades might be brought into requisition in connection with-our defence system; but it seems to me that fire brigades are organized for the purpose of suppressing fire, whilst military duties consist chiefly of opening fire. I do not see very much advantage to be gained by any attempt to work in our fire brigades with the defence forces. If the. members of the fire brigades have any desire to become associated with our defence forces, they can easily join the volunteer or militia corps, and thus get the necessaiy military training; but I do not see any point in establishing a direct connection between the fire brigades and our defence system. quite agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that the experience gained in South Africa has brought home to us the fact that the days of precise drill on the parade ground, and spectacular displays have gone by, and that there is no longer any necessity for us to offer any facilities for that sort of thing in connection with our defence system. The residents of tlie Transvaal showed that they could fight as well as any one, without any knowledge of parade ground movements quire for our forces is what is called battle training, such a'sthe honourable member for South Sydney called attention to. We want not only proficiency in rifle-firing, such as may be obtained through our volunteer and militia forces, and also through our rifle clubs, but we also want our men to be trained in the practical work of the battle-field, and to be subjected to what is ""called fire discipline. have dark, the found like were way which, -from many early localities features absolutely and Mr back. the we the put required would themselves ifEnglish of to they stages Wills. find thickly in defects The the have which fco asaway they immediate ignorant officers were men settled of infantiy make test, totally they the towho in of ask Boer would stand live, were the the regiments atfrom awar, their districts country, and were frequently unable to reach their camps. as bod. impart, to our troops a knowledge of the conditions of warfare that would be likely to arise in the case of an invasion of Australia. We are not here to build up military forces for offensive"" purposes, but simply for defensive purposes, and I think we should take thoroughly to heart the lessons that were learned in South Africa, and set our house in order accordingly. During the early part of the campaign in South Africa, the highest military authorities entirely failed to appreciate the necessities of the situation. When the Australians offered assistance in the form of mounted troops, the Imperial authorities cabled out to the Premiers stating that infantiy would be prefer-** I red. The Imperial officers, who were supposed to be well acquainted with the conditions in the Transvaal, told us that infantry would be preferred to the mounted men which the history of that war has told us were absolutely the forces that were most required. And from that time until the last contingents were sent from Australia, mounted men have played the most important part in the campaign. We have,, in Australia, a very fine recruiting ground for this class of soldier, and at the present time, partly as a result of the South African campaign, we' have the finest body of horse soldiers of their kind in any part of the world. Australia has gained to this extent, that her capabilities for defence, and the resources of her people, have been exhibited by the way iu which she has been able fco respond to the necessities of the old countiy in connection with South Africa. There is no necessity for us to have any fancy cavalry regiments, but we require active mounted infantrv men, such as have been found capable of acting on their own initiative and using their own intelligence when occasion arises, and who have compared to advantage with soldiers who have had a very much wider knowledge of or manoeuvres. What we rebarrack-square military accomplishments. Rifle clubs have been referred to during the course of the debate, and as they are inexpensive in comparison with tlie amount of good work that is accomplished through them, I hope that the members of the Government will not endorse the idea of the Minister for Defence, who looked Our volunteer forces andbe way sea at the vicinity force policeman Sent topographical of who, camp when about present, men if out who England, were somethingin are the of ofthere after they the-",60,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And
270,Mr Page,Some Australians were just,61,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And
271,Mr Wilks,"We should endeavour torather askance at rifle clubs on account of the expense involved in keeping them going. Man for man, and considering the degree of efficiency that the members of such clubs attain, offer the cheapest and best form of instruction in one of the most important requisites of defence equipment which could be devised . by the Government. the members of our rifle clubs, in addition to obtaining the necessary training to qualify them as first-class rifle shots, should not also be put through a simple course of fire discipline, such as would be of great benefit to them on active service. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo objected to the introduction of a military caste, and I am quite with him in his objection to the defence of the country being conducted on strictly democratic lines. We have before us tlie example of the Swiss nation, which has a splendid system of citizen soldiery. There the officer goes from the command of his company back to his work, and -there is no assumption of any caste distinctions such as would probably exist under a purely military system ; and the more we can have our citizen forces controlled by citizen officers, so much the better will it be for the people of tlie Commonwealth. soldier will be required to assist us in our organization; but not as ""the head of our citizen army. I believe that if we give facilities for men to pass from the ranks to the highest positions in our military service, we shall offer the greatest incentive to a high degree of efficiency, and add to our security as a nation. We do not want any purely military system carried on by professional soldiers, and under conditions of professional caste, with the risk that war.may be provoked for war's sake. All we require is that our citizens -should live up to the requirements of their citizenship, and fit themselves for the defence of the nation, so that we maj' have the means of resisting invasion when necessity arises for placing ourselves on the defensive. It will be necessary to have a body of permanent men to man our fortifications. We do not -require in these men soldiers so much as mechanics, because the work in connection with the manning, of. the forts and the artillery is becoming more and more such as requires men with mechanical, experience and with training in certain lines of life. Men from the volunteer ranks, however willing they might be, would prove most unsuitable if they were placed in charge of machine guns and other implements of war in our fortifications. I trust that what are known as sergeant artificers will -not be paid at ordinary military rates. The artificer, nowadays, is an expert and experienced engineer, who can command the There is no reason Why highest rates of pay in various industrial establishments in which men of his class are employed, and if such men are required to accept a rate of payment similar' to that given to staff sergeants, who simply have military duties to perforin, they will be placed in a wrong position, and the Government will lose the services of valuable officers. I think we should be careful to see that the Commonwealth does not lose the services of efficient, and.well-paid men of that type. Under the cadet system, which the B ill provides for, it is intended that school children shall remain under the control of the Minister of Education, while tlie senior cadets are brought under the military sys.tem. I think it is rather a bad thing to allow the school children, who are junior cadets, ai)d really volunteers in their x-elation to the senior cadets, to remain under the Education department, and I think that they should receive the advan.'Doubtless the professional tage of tlie control of the military administration in the same way as the senior cadets. I cannot understand why there should be anydisfcinction made, and hope the Minister for .Defence will consider the expediency of taking the control of all the cadets out of the hands of the Education department, because the whole matter is foreign to that department. Now, there is another matter. If we are to have a citizen army, I think that one of the natural adjuncts will be a military college, and I do not think that those honourable members who have addressed themselves to this subject will prove to be unfavorable to the establishment of such an institution. In Canada they have the Kingston Military Academy, which has been a success, and perhaps we might establish a similiar institution in the Commonwealth, and call it the Forrest College, out pf compliment to the Minister for Defence. I think it is quite within tlie function of the Commonwealth to establish a military college, so that our officers may receive the necessaiy instruction to fit them for exercising efficient control over our defence forces. W it h regard to the naval forces, I think the honourable and learned member for Bendigo made very strong aud justifiable remarks. any great provision for the of a naval brigade or a naval reserve. The tendency is to estimate that our first and our only line of defence would be that of naval defence. We have relied for years on the assistance of the Imperial authorities, and we have contributed £100,000 to £120,000 per annum, in return for which 'we have received an auxiliary squadron, and' the continuous services of other ships of His Majesty's navy. do not agree with the honourable member for Bendigo that the Commonwealth can establish a navy. The cost of a first-class battleship would be £1,000,000, and that in itself would be a serious drain upon the resources of the Commonwealth. Ministers who are noted to be the reverse of economicnl, would hesitate to contemplate the building of u navy for Australia.' one battleship, could answer the purposes of a continent her enormous sea-board. While defence is a matter for serious consideration, given sufficient consideration fco it. do consider it impracticable, and, so far as it is concerned, my vote will be in the direction of extending and enlarging the arrangement with the Imperial Government to provide an auxiliary squadron. We have a naval brigade and naval volunteer artillery, but, with due respect to them, they are a land force wearing a naval dress, but having no experience with naval armaments and guns. They are land soldiers dressed as sailors. AVe see them marching through the streets of a city, and we are under the impression that we have a naval force, but it is very weak. I suppose Sydney has the strongest naval brigade in the whole of Australia, but they have the most obsolete arms. If the honourable member for Bendigo had read far enough, he would have found the sad admission that they had not advanced in regard to training and up-to-date machine guns. tralia, with its large sea-board, willingly join naval reserves as have joined the land forces in the past. The expenditure as far as the military forces are concerned will have to be cut down, and the navy expenditure will have to be increased. AVe have the material, and the ciy has been that you should have naval forces, but you have no training. I would Mr Witts. suggest that the auxiliary squadron, which This Bill does not make is lying in Sydney Harbor practically for establishment years, with an occasional trip to the south seas, could be used as training ships for the naval reserves. The naval brigades have had land training only. They have not had experience in the use of arms at sea. I think it is not going beyond the something like province"" of a layman when I say it is not so much seamen we want as well-skilled mechanics. The man who is called a sailor in the navy is a trained mechanic, who has intri? I cate machinery to deal with-nava l manoeuvring is not dependent on seamanship, but on skilled mechanics. On the matter of military districts this Bill makes a provision which is a wise one. I hope no commanding officer will be allowed to Even remain in his district more than three or four years. Throughout Australia the staff officers have remained so long that No they have brought around them' a sort of caste arising from social distinction, like Australia, with and they recommend men for promotion naval according to their caste. .Not only have the ' members of the staff themselves the Government have not become careless, but they are not acr I quainted with the details of modern warfare. AVe have had years and years of one system of control, and that has brought about the evil. Consequently I hope that in the administration of this Act Ministers will see that district commandants do not remain longer than three or four years in their districts. I would like to"" say something with regard to the salaries of officers. This is a matter over which we can exercise great control. How the Estimates have been prepared in VictoriaI cannot say, but in New South Wales the officers have thensalaries and allowances. The .amount of these allowances has been a serious burden on the public funds, and the difficulty for public men has been to trace? with accuracy and certainty the amount of the allowances the officers have received. I trust the Ministry, therefore, will supply this I think that the people of AusHouse, when submitting their Estimates, would with the total salary and allowances they of each officer, so that we can get at how the public money is used in the payment of these officers. AVe have found that in the past the Easter encampments, as fchey are called, haveexhausted a large amount of public funds without good effect. MrA . CHAPMAN -Sham fights ! of the l o t ! They are very humorous and very laughable, and very costly. I know that from personal experience. tell us some of his personal experiences. MrA . CHAPMAN -He is under arrest yet. moments of my life, I think, was when I accepted a commission in Her Majesty's service. I do not wish to revert to that, except to say that there is a danger in politicians playing at soldiers. My short experience with the military forces in New South Wales taught me as a public man much that is useful to me in my public capacity. I w ill not, however, acquaint this House with the amusing incident that occurred in New South Wales, and to which the honourable member for Barrier refers. The, leader of the Opposition tried in that seductive way he has to get me to repeat it, so that he, as Minister o£ War, might form a judicial opinion regarding it . He thought a Saturday afternoon would be a good time to have the manoeuvre carried out again. But I thought there was something behind it, and I said I would not like to carry it out -at the expense of the people of New South Wales. the matter before the House? politicians holding commissions. When I suggested that the leader of the Opposition should himself appear in uniform as Minister of War at the repetition, he let the matter drop. Prom that I think the right honourable gentleman will favour any suggestion to cut down -the cost of uniforms in a service like ours, where the majority of the people are not people of leisure, but people of trade, or artisans. However desirous they may be of going from the ranks through ""non-commissioned officerships to the position of officers, they are always prevented by the enormous expense that confronts them. It requires from £ 6 0 to £ 7 0 to properly equip an infantry officer in the New South Wales forces, and that is a bar to pro nio'tion which I trust the Commonwealth will remove -We want citizen forces and 'citizen officers at the head of them, and T hope no expensive uniform will ju-event that. I think the Commonwealth should provide the uniforms. The volunteer officers have in the past received a capitation grant. There is no doubt-that the flippant manner in which these matters have been taken in the past has passed away. Australia has shown that if there is necessity she is able to give her help, and can show the best record. She has shown to the world that the Australian soldier is not a mere machine, but an intelligent unit that can direct his actions and do all that is required in modern warfare, I hope, however, that the Bill has not been introduced with the idea of posing before the world as a military power. If we want to hold our liberty we can do so. It will be in danger only when we think that we are impregnable. I do not think we should be always trailing our coat around and asking for trouble. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney when he says that it is the' Eastern nations that we have to fear because of their proximity-and it was urged as one of the reasons why Tasmania should be accepted as a State of equal powers, that it is a strategic base, and if not properly protected might be used to inflictincalculable injury to this island continent. We know that their permanent force has a strength of only 30 men, and has been a subject of ridicule. But if we are to establish defence forces, it will be our bounden duty to provide that State with proper defences so that it may not be a vulnerable part of our territory. But of course I am not carried away with this Chinese bogy scare. I have a very distinct recollection that some seven or eight years back the cry was raised "" We had better federate and get a strong military system, or we shall have the Chinese down upon us."" Yet in tlie first conflict which China had with a third-class power, namely, Japan, tlie former with its boasted millions of people went under. My view is that our isolation is our greatest defence. W it h the Imperial navy at our command we have nothing to fear. The transport of an army alone would be so difficult that no one can conceive of Australia being conquered. If Great Britain herself, with a command of 300,000 men, and with a Treasury that is bound1 less, has taken such a long time to subdue the Transvaal, how can we expect any single nation bo. capture Australia ? 1 If the people of this country were determined to defend it, bhey could easily do so. The .only danger which we have to fear is from an Eastern nation making invasions at remote points. But before they can make those invasions they have bo geb the necessary transport for an army.

276,Mr Wilks,"It shows the danger ofclanger, .therefore, which we have to fear is that which arises from filibustering expeditions. T. do not think that Australia ever need fear that she will be conquered. She may be temporarily invaded at points, but to conquer 5,000,000 of people, with our extent of territory, is altogether out of the question. To subjugate us would be a task that no nation would ever seriously entertain. But, notwithstanding the large sums of money which are annually expended upon our military forces, we find that the moment there is an order to mobilize, the difficulty of transport asserts itself. We find that the transport requirements are very weak indeed. In New South Wales if the local butcher's cart were captured, the -army would be captured. The experience of the Transvaal has taught us the abso: lute necessity of being well equipped in regard to the Army Service Corps, and I trust that the Minister will not neglect this despised branch of the service. It is a cut from the existing Acts of the most useful one. The old axiom that an army travels on its belly is equally applicable to our citizen defence force. If we have not a proper, army service corps, all our great preparations will fall to the ground. I know that there is no glitter about this department of the military -service, but, at the same time, it is a most properly provide only for defence. I am useful body. I trust that the Minister for Defence will direct attention to these matters. Of course I recognise that the Commonwealth Parliament does not wish to enter upon a system of reckless expenditure. A tight hand-and a watchful eye are required. I hope that none of the excesses connected with the standing armies of European countries will ever be carried out in Australia. We wish to appear before the world as a nation that htii never known internal warfare. We merely desire to sufficiently organize our men that when the call is given they shall have some knowledge of the use of arms and the necQSsary ammunition, in order that they may be able to prevenfc.any possible invasion, long as Great Britain holds the power of and to drive a hostile force from our shores -the seas, we have no need to fear any great There is a great deal of force in what some honourable members have said as to the Minister for Defence having failed to give the House a lead upon the. question of what is a proper policy for the Commonwealth. There is ""an. inevitable tendency in dealing with a Bill of this sort to go into details, but I do not feel myself in a position to do"" so, as I have never'been in any military force. I am not like the honourable member for Dalley, who has had experience not only of drills, but of manoeuvres, and who could give this Hoifee very valuable hints upon army discipline and accoutrements-ho w to lead a force through a swamp, for instance. It is fortunate that the honourable member, though under arrest, is out upon bail, so that he is in a position to give the House the benefit of his knowledge. I understand that discipline was enforced in his case at the instance of a member of another place, a member who distinguished himself at the opening of this Commonwealth Parliament by appearing in uniform. I feel that we ought to consider the question "" What do we want"" before we go intothe long details of this measure? It seems to me that this Bill is a scissors and paste Bill, its provisions having been States, with a certain dash of the commandants' wishes thrown in. It will be recognised that we do not want to fight. The ideal of Australia is peace; the peaceful development of our great resources and the peaceful employment of our people. If our idea is peace, we shall very glad that in our Constitution we have safely embedded that principle, and I think that constitutionally we have no power to go beyond defence purposes even to the«extent provided for in this Bill. For many years there is no need to make much of the military system of Australia. I agree thoroughly that it would be advisable not only for the purpose of defence, but for the purposes of physical training, to let our boys' know how to shoot, and"" to shoot straight, and to give them the advantage of rifle training, so that if there were need they could use the rifle. But the first, the second, and the third line of our defence is the navy. As encroachment upon our shores, nor have-we any need for great permanent militia and volunteer forces. It is to be recollected also that it is inadvisable and impracticable for us to have any military system like that of a sovereign European State. So long as we are not a sovereign State, in the _ sense of, being able to dictate peace or war, we shall not be",64,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And
277,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"consulted as to peace or war. Our fathers came to Australia largely with a view to getting rid of the burdens and dangers of war which have oppressed the people of Europe for so many years, and we should be giving up the best part of our heritage in Australia if, remote from the centres of excitement, we were to start a military system in grotesque imitation of the military system on the continent of Europe. We ought to thank God for our freedom from these complications. I quite admit that the storm centre of the world has shifted to the east of Asia, and that we are very near to thab centre, bub it is bhe navy to which we should direcb all our energies, instead of building up a swaggering, gold-laced military system. proposes that. In this Bil l we speak of a Minister of Defence. In it we have not once mentioned the word "" conscription."" On the contraiy we have carefully avoided any appearance of conscription. Bubi f we look ab bhe clauses carefully we' shall see bhab bhe commandants-if they have coloured bins .Bill-hav e certainly done their best bo provide for conscription as nearly as is possible. I have read of a very wise man who believed bhafc. "" if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the laws of a nabion."" So, if I were allowed bo make bhe interpretation clause of a Bill, I would allow the Bill to be made by any one else. Looking at the interpretation clause off this Billi t will be seen that the definitions of such words as "" emergency "" are such as bo cover bhe widesb scheme of any military man, and bhab is sayiiig a good deal. The'ideal of a force only for defence is embodied deeply in our Constitution. If honourable members look at sub-section (6) of section 51, and also at section 119, bhey will see what I am referring to. Section 51 says bhabthe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, in the north-west. The words in bhe interhave power to make laws for tlie peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to (K) the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and of the control of bhe forces, to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth. Section 119 saysThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion, and on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. What does the word "" invasion"" mean ? It does nob mean the invasion of some other country. It is clearly provided, therefore, that the Commonwealth is to protect every State against invasion, and on the application of the Executive Government of bhe State, againsb domestic violence. Supposing there was a strike in New Soubh Wales, it would be impossible under bhe Constitution to bring the military out to suppress that strike, unless tlie Government of New South Wales asked that that should be done. American law. stitution carefully, it will be seen there is no power to provide against the invasion of any country except Australia, and I think ib is well bhab there is not. I am sorry bhis B ill has come to be discussed at a time at which I think there is a sort of ebb in progressiveprinciples in regard to war and warfare. But, ab the same time, I bhink bhere are sufficienb members in this Parliament to see bhab we should nob allow our people bo be led, hoodwinked, into a scheme of militarism, except in the direction of defence. I might just indicate, with regard to this Bill, what it seems to me we ought to do. First of all, we ought to alter the radical word ""emergency,""' which is used i i i dozens of clauses throughout the Bill. It sounds all very well to say "" this or that power will be used only in case of emergency."" But if we look at the interprebabion of bhe word "" emergency,"" we see bhab ib means ""war."" War-where ? It means "" invasion ""-of what ? It means "" national emergency"" what kind of national emergency? It also means ""the declaration by proclamation of any danger "" of "" war, invasion, or national emergency."" Supposing the Government chose to declare by proclamation thab bhere is danger of war in British Guiana, they would have power bo compel every man in our permanent forces bo go bo India and fight bhe Afghans pretation clause are so wide that if there iswar, or apprehension of war, in which Britain can be engaged, in any part of the world bhere will be power bo compel all our permanent men, and even, as I will show presently, even our non-permanent men to go and fight bhere or elsewhere. defence of the Commonwealth.",65,Honourable Member Nearly Through Its Commercial Enterprises And

282,Sir Edward Braddon,"Only for the honorable minutes, recognise that I have considered theory within certain limits, that one may best defend a place by attacking another -place. -AVe might defend Hobart, for example, by attacking Vladivostock, and we might best defend Bathurst, in tlie interior"" of New South AA^ales, by sending a fleet to Kronstadt or the AVest Indian Islands. a theory of defence which has been adopted by military and naval authorities, and very properly so. The best way oftentimes to prevent an attack is to attack, just as President Kruger ordered the advance on Natal iu place of waiting for the British to attack him. And this, I say, has been thought of, and embodied in the Bill. If we look at clause 48, sub-clause (6), it will be seen that tlie draftsman contemplates the defence of the Commonwealth being carried on by the service of our forces in places outside tlie Commonwealth. The clause provides that the Governor General inay-C'all out the defence force or any part thereof we see what the force of those words is. Their for active service anywhere within the Commonforce is that if it seemed to the Government wealthThat is all right. and also without the Commonwealth for the they would be.entitled to order even tlie defence thereof, nt any time when it appears adcitizen soldier to serve there. I know that visable so to do by reason of emergency. That blessed word "" emergency"" again! That difficult. It has taken me some time, and provision means that if the Government given me a good deal of trouble, although choose to declare that there is war, or danger it is my business to read Acts and underof war, on the north-west frontier of India, stand what they are about. An y one who t here will be a legal obligation on our soldiers starts to work out the meaning of the Bill to serve in Indiai f they are ordered to do by dovetailing-the clauses will find it a very so. There are phrases in the Bill which times. AVe have rifle clubs.

I am quite sure that if a man enlists be a proclamation that there is danger of as a volunteer in Victoria he has no idea war in the West Indies, be ordered off to that he may be called on to go to India and Afghanistan? I do not think that that is serve there, or to go to Ireland and, perhaps, understood ; but there is that extreme power. fight against the people from whom he has It will be seen by sub-clause (c) of clause 48 descended. Clause 49 provides that;The permanent forces shall b'e liable to serve Council to direct in cases of emergencyI beyond the limits of the Commonwealth in time remember the blessed word ""Mesopotamia,"" of emergency. Let us go back to the interpretation "" emergency ""-that members ' of rifle clubs clause, which says that "" emergency "" means shall be enrolled as members of the active ""war,"" or ""invasion"" of any part of the gentleman will, in a few British dominions, "" national emergency "" -that is, any emergency which the the point. There is a British Government think to be a national of defence, which is true emergency-and the declaration .by proclamation . of the danger of war or invasion anywhere. On the flimsiest pretext there might be a legal obligation put on the citizen soldiers of Australia to go and serve in India against the Afghans or Sikhs. I think that that is not what we mean. means either. members now to read clause 50, which provides that;No member of the citizen forces""Citizen forces ""mean the volunteers and the militia. shall be required, unless he voluntarily agrees to do so, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, except for the defence thereof, or in the case of the naval forces, while training on board ship. Just look at the words, "" except for the defence ' thereof."" Having regard to the meaning given to "" defence"" by clause 48, that they were justified in saying that AustraButi t goes on to saylia might be defended by an attack on India, this process of dovetailing clauses is very difficult task indeed.

287,Mr Higgins,"I will ask honorableforces. There is no qualification here, the clause providingAnd so long us the emergency exists all memers of rifle clubs shall be deemed to be members . of the active forces, and subject to drill, training, According to the Volunteer Act of 1863, and discipline to bhe same extent as members of the militia and volunteer forces. Supposing a man who is a member of a rifle club says, "" I cannot go away and leave my -family and business; I never meant to go and serve in England or Ireland,"" he will be guilty of disobedience of orders and of breaking his oath. Not only that, but he will be guilty of mutiny. What is the effect of mutiny ? The court-martial may hang him for it. There is no mistake about that, as may be seen by reference to clause 86. ""The court martial is to have absolute power, with one qualification. Clause 86 provides thatNo member of the defence force shall be sentenced to death by any court-martial except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy, or traitorously"" delivering up to the enemy any garrison. . . . What is mutiny? I have looked into the Imperial Dictionary, and I find that although there is no definition of the word "" mutiny"" in the Bill, the word in the English Mutiny Act includes any disobedience of commands in the army or navy. That Act says that mutiny isAny attempt to excite opposition to lawful authority, or any act of contempt towards officers or disobedience of commands. I definition in this country. I tliink it is hardly contemplated by us-to give power to a court-martial to condemn a man to death because he refuses to serve out of Australia. The word "" mutiny "" ought to be defined, but if it is defined as in the English 'Act, we ought to be careful not to subject men to an oath which they do not quite understand. The oath is set forth in the schedule to the Bill, and is far too wide. Having carefully framed our Act we ought to limit tlie oath to the obligations created by it. In the 4th schedule tlie form of oath is as follows :I . . . swear that I will well and truly serve our sovereign Lord tbe King in the . . . for tlie term of . . . . There is not one word limiting the service to Australia, or to defence purposesand that I will resist His Majesty's enemies and cause His Majesty's peace to be kept and maintained . . . Where? I think the service ought to be limited to the Commonwealth. It is not [190] unreasonable for us to ask that the volunteers of Australia shall be confined to the same oath and duty similar to those in force in England. What is the case in England? section 17, power to call out the volunteers to fight is given only in the case of the actual or apprehended invasion of Great Britain, which, of course, includes Ireland. The words of the section areIn case of actual or apprehended invasion of any part of the United Kingdom (the occasion being first communicated to both Houses of Parliament if Parliament is sitting, or declared in Council and notified by proclamation if Parliament is not sitting), Her Majesty may direct the lieutenants of counties throughout Great Britain, or such of them as Her Majesty may judge necessary, ""to call out the volunteer corps of their respective counties, or any of them, for active military service. Every officer a<vd volunteer and every non-commissioned officer of the permanent staff belonging to every corps so called out shall be bound to assemble as the lieutenant of the county directs, and to march according to orders within Great Biitain. There is no such limitation in the Bill, and I should like to know why tlie Minister did not explain to the House the serious and far-reaching effect of its provisions. Whether the effect is right or wrong, the Minister ought to have told tlie House that they would have this consequence. The Minister for Defence is not here, and I do not wish to say too much suppose we shall have the same in his absence, but I must say that either he did not know what the Bill involves or he ought to have told the House what it involves. It will be seen by reference to the B ill that the defence forces are divided into the active forces, the reserve forces, and tlie rifle clubs. I would ask honourable members not to forget that the rifle clubs are included in tlie defence forces, as defined in the Bill. Among the active forces we have the permanent forces, the militia, and the volunteers. So far as permanent forces are concerned we want some permanent soldiers, because I feel convinced that we shall require thoroughly .well-trained men, especially for artillery work. I saw a good deal of barrack life when I was a boy, and I know something about military matters, although I was never actually in the service. We shall certainly want a permanent force, consisting of men who are thoroughly up-to-date in the most recent developments of military science, for the purposes of training and example, and we shall want such men especially in connection with artillery. W it h regard to the militia and the volunteer forces, I should preferalthough I wouldn<i>t make it an essential point-thai t instead of two classes there should be only one. I donet think there is any needfor a nailitia force. The nearer we can approach to the purely voluntary systemof service, under whichmen are ready and willing, to serve the countiy without fee or reward, the better it will be. Then we have provision made for transferring men front the reserves to the activeforces, and we havepower also to transfer a man from the active to the reserve forces within three years-. If we look at clause 3'I, and piece that with certain other provisions, we shall realize the f u l l force of what the Bill provides for. Clause 31 provides thatThe following persons shall' be liable to serve the defence force shall be entitled to'' -be disin the defence force when called upon by virtue of this Act to do so, namely :. All male inhabitants of Australia (excepting, those who are exempt from service in the defence forced who have' resided therein for six months, and are British subjects,, and are between the ages of eighteen and sixty years. Happily Members of Parliament are exempted, although I do not know why the exemption should begin with Members of Parliament, who ought to have been kept lower down on tlie list. MrV . L . SOLOMON -They ought to form a most effective line of defence. They could fire off some old speeches at the enemy. will look at clauses 35 and 36 they will see that it is provided that, except in times of emergency, the defence force shall be raised and kept up by voluntary enlistment only; but it is also provided thatIn case of emergency the Governor General may by proclamation call upon persons liable to serve in bhe defence force in the order before provided to enlist as members of the defence force, and thereupon, suchpersons shall in the manner prescribed enlist as members of the defence force accordingly. Under this clause the persons who are subject to be called upon will not only be required to enlist in the defence forces, but will also have to take an absolutely unqualified oath. If they enlist,, even compulsorily, in the defence forces, what will be the resulb 1 They will be required under elause 41 to serve for a period-of three years.

He does not want to fight or enter the defence force, but aproclamation may be made that there is danger of-. war in British Guiana, or in Africa, and the Governor General may call upon him to enter the defence forces, and when he isonce in bhe defence'forces-he must stay bhere' for three years.

296,Honourable Member,"Awfully near Mr HIGGINS No-; because there isclauses, unless the word ""emergency"" means war outside of the Commonwealth. I am very glad that the Constitution does restrain the power of the military authorities ; but this Bill was drawn on the assumption that more power could be given than would be quite apparent. I do not accuse the Prime Minister in this matter, but the B ill has been very discreetly drawn with a view to the wedging in of powers which do not appear to be given at first sight. For.instance, it is provided in clause 48 that the Governor General mayColl out the defence farces or any part thereof, some words to show that. If we turn to for active service anywhere within the Commonwealth, and' also without the Commonwealth, for the. defence thereof, at any tune when it appears advisable so to do by reason of emergency. Now what is the meaning of that clause, unless the draftsman meant that if there were an emergency in the sense of war or invasion of some other part of the world there could be a calling out of tlie defence forces to serve without the Commonwealth ? Honourable members wil l bear in mind that a theory of defence-whic h is very largely theory-is that oftentimes the best mode of defence is attack, and I would suggest that, it should be provided that when a man, whether he be a permanent soldier or a volunteer,, is required to go beyond the Commonwealth, for the purposes of fighting, he should do so of his own consent. I do not say that men should be prohibited from going, but I think that it_ would be fair before they go, even voluntarily, that they should have to obtain tlie consent Of the Government. . MrA . PA/TKRSON -The consent of Parliament bones aboutthat. I think that m a real emergency the Governor General might do all that is required,, sts he is responsible to Parliament. Recognising as we do that we are all willing to aid the mother country if she should be inany stress or danger, I think that only so long as the service is really voluntary will the aid of our people be substantial, andthereforei t is better to limit the provisions relating to serviceoutside the Commonwealth .to cases wherethe individual says-"" I consent."" Some weeks ago I tabled amendments to this Bill,, with the object of carrying out that view, and I only, hope that as. many honourable members as feel that they can support me will do-so; I have several matters to refer to, but 1particularly want honourable' members to see how very wide clause 48 is. Tlie Governor General' may (a) call out the active forces, or any part thereof, for any military purpose, whenever he deems it expedient, and also at such times' and in such manner as may be prescribed. I think the Prime Minister will at least recognise that there ought to be words which will show that we recognise the limitation of the Constitution. I think the provisions of the Bill might be misleading if there are not clause 52, we find that it is provided thatWhenever thedefence force, or any part thereof is called out for active service, by reason of emergency, the Governor General'may place them under the orders of the Commander of the King'sregular forces or. Royal navy., as the case may 1 be, in the Commonwealth, or any other place where the force is required to serve. Is that consistent with the idea that our forces are to be called' out only to meet an invasion of the Common-wealth I fully required."" They cannot, be lawfully required to serve for any purposes the Constitution, does not prescribe. vision here ? Eitheu the draftsman did not recognise thelimitations of the Constitution or he did. If he did, he. ought to have put in words, consistent with the. Constitution ; but this goes, beyond the Constitution. must be read w it h the Constitution, as every provision must. have nomeaning at all.
