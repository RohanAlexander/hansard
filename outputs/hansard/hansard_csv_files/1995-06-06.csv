Health and human services are the operational procedure done without waiting fundamental elements of the social wage. It is very long. very interesting that in a 20-minute speech attacking the Prime Minister yesterday the Let me make these points about this matter: Leader of the Opposition mentioned the words firstly, it is true that the minister underwent 'social wage' a number of times, but he did a procedure. She did so while she was Preminot explain a single thing about it-not what er of Western Australia. It was done in a it means and what it is all about.

She chose this course of action in the human services component of the social order to avoid putting any additional burden wage and the health component of the social on the public health system. This is the wage-what does the Leader of the Opposiposition which a number of Australians have tion do? He does not have a clue. He did not taken. For whatever reason, they have chosen talk about it.

Department of Tourism Proposed expenditure, $104,551,000. Consideration resumed from 5 June. consider in any detail these important portfolio areas in five minutes. I intend to talk for a short time about my favourite topic, that is, tourism. I cannot do justice to that in five minutes, but I would like to make a few remarks. Obviously, tourism remains very important to the Australian economy. I am sure many members will have read the recent report by the Tourism Forecasting Council. It is an excellent document and paints a glowing picture of Australia's tourism industry, not only of the consistent growth that has occurred over the last 15 years but also, more importantly, of the very healthy looking forecasts for the industry between now and the year 2000. It says that in the year 2000 6.3 million people are expected to visit Australia, that is more than double the number that visited in 1993, and for the next 10 years inbound tourism is expected to grow by 10 per cent a year. Tourism is well known for its contribution to export earnings of around $10.6 billion per annum. It is a very important industry to Australia. I suspect that the government has done very little to assist the tourism industry. The tourism industry is one of those Australian industries which has grown despite the government. It is a great tribute to the many small business people in every part of the tourism industry who have made the industry what it is. Many of .those people are my constituents, so I see at first hand exactly what they are doing on a day-to-day basis. There are lots of reasons why we should not be complacent about our tourism industry. When the vice-president of All Nippon Airways visited Australia last week, he made some very pertinent remarks. He informed us-it was news to a lot of people-that Japanese tourists find visiting Australia expensive compared with going to the west coast of the United States. Honourable members might think, with the way the $A has depreciated against the yen in recent times, that we would find it very expensive to go to Japan, but the point is that we are almost paying the Japanese to come here. If Australia is an expensive destination for the Japanese, of all people, then it probably ought to ring warning bells for the government to ask why. I hope that the comments made by that visiting Japanese airline executive will be taken very seriously and that we might look at that. I suspect the fact that we have an archaic industrial relations system is probably a major factor in contributing to that lack of competitiveness. We need to be very careful. As was pointed out, the industry is volatile for",101,Adjournment To Grant The Member For Chisholm Dr

237,Mr Bradford (Mcpherson) (12.46 P.m.),"It really is quite absurd to expect us toMC 1306 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 all sorts of reasons and we should not be complacent about the fact that the Japanese will continue to support Australia to the extent that they do. It was interesting that the vice-president of All Nippon Airways also talked about the need for Australia to revise its visa system. That is something the government ought to consider. I know it comes up from time to time and perhaps, with VJ day approaching, it may not be entirely appropriate to put it firmly on the agenda at this particular time. Our visa system is, once again, becoming out of date and out of step with a lot of other countries. Few Asians are overstayers and the Japanese do not overstay in any great number. There is evidence that when other countries have revised their visa system it has led to an increase in tourism. So Australia ought to make it as attractive as possible for Asians to come here. Certainly, we ought to continue to encourage Japanese visitors to come here. Revising the visa restrictions which currently apply would be one way of doing that. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration recently brought down its report Taxing relaxing. There are lots of recommendations in the report which I hope the government will look at. None of the recommendations surfaced in the budget, but I am prepared to concede that that was because the report came down shortly before the budget. Our visiting Japanese airline executive called for incentives to be put in place. As a result of that call, it becomes clear that incentives are needed. EMDG is one, but there are numerous others recommended here. Rather than incentives for the tourism industry, what we have in the budget are a number of disincentives, that is, an increase in company tax, increases in tax on building materials, an increase in sales tax on motor cars and all sorts of things which are going to make it more expensive for tourism operators. There is a shortage of accommodation, not only on the Gold Coast but in Cairns. We need to do everything we can to fix that problem as quickly as possible, but what the government has done in this budget is actually to make the problem worse. I believe that is something that needs to be looked at urgently. The other imposts on small business that came in the budget do impact directly on our tourism industry, and I can assure the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) that those-(Time expired) Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12.51 p.m.)-The member for McPherson( Mr Bradford) focused on tourism. It is worth noting that, when compared with 1983, tourism in 1995 is a massive contributor to the Australian national economy. Whereas it was not even an industry that was fully recognised by the federal government in 1983, when the Liberals were last in power, today tourism represents an $11.2 billion earner to Australia in terms of foreign exchange. There has been a massive increase in the number of tourists who come here, and the growth is continuing. They are coming not only from Japan but from the whole north Asia region. From Korea, from Taiwan and even from China, the number of visitors coming here has been growing at seven, eight and 10 per cent over the last couple of years; and that is because we have had a concerted strategy of marketing into Japan and into north Asia as well. With the appropriations that are allocated in this year's budget, the Australian Tourism Commission will be able to continue with that job. It is developing the increasing sophistication demanded by the market. People packaging holidays in Japan tell us that these days the Japanese tourist is looking for more than the tightly targeted package that would have",103,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Elliott (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and ParliamentaryTuesday, 6 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1307 been sold and was accepted in their tours in the past. Now, tourists from Japan are looking for a broader range of experiences. They are wanting to get outside the Cairns area. They are wanting to get to the outback areas. There are a lot more rural holidays taken by Asian tourists, as well as· by other tourists coming to Australia.· The whole strategy that the Tourism Commission has been adopting has been focused on trying to broaden out the tourism product that visitors coming to Australia can enjoy. A couple of weeks ago we had the launch of the regional tourism program. Again, that was an initiative of the government which we made a commitment about before the last election and which is being implemented. It is ensuring a building of tourism infrastructure all across Australia. It does not matter whether we go to Queensland or to places like Strahan, on the west coast of Tasmania: the Commonwealth government is there, helping to build the infrastructure that is needed to provide the tourism potential of that region. I note we have a number of members here from Queensland. The fact of the matter is that the programs we launched in the regional tourism strategy and in the ecotourism strategy were all about trying to broaden the capacity of the infrastructure that exists throughout the whole of the state of Queensland-much of it in the regional and provincial parts of Queensland-to make the tourism product in those areas more accessible. We know from the research that the Tourism Commission has done in Japan that that is striking a very positive chord with the Japanese tourists that want to come to Australia. Mention was made of industrial relations, and the impediment that that might or might not be to the tourism industry. I note that before the budget the big cry of the opposition was that there was going to be a bed tax. That was the big scare that was being run prior to the budget. Of course, that did not eventuate. That was another thing the opposition had on the wish list of things it hoped might be in the budget, but it was not. By its continuing commitment to the Tourism Commission and to the Department of Tourism in the budget allocations, the government has showed that it is maintaining very strongly the Tourism Commission's drive in its international marketing strategy. When it comes to industrial relations, the member for Herbert( Mr Lindsay), who has a very close interest in tourism because of the nature of the tourism product that exists in the Townsville area, reminded me of what the Liberals were actually proposing before the last election with their $3 per hour youth wage. That would have gone very much to the living standards of young people working in the tourism industry in Queensland. We rejected that, and the people of Australia rejected that. . We are committed to ensuring that the growth of our tourism industry, which has been growing at seven and eight per cent each year for several years, is maintained. We are committed to ensuring that we take advantage of the big opportunities that are going to come on line over the next few years in marketing Australia's profile around the world, with things like the Olympics and other major events, and that we get full value in the region. The Indonesian tourism minister was here a few weeks ago, and others have come. We know from the range of international visitors who have come here how much potential they see in terms of development of the bilateral relationships in tourism. These appropriations make absolutely crystal clear that we are going to ensure that the Commonwealth plays its rightful role in achieving the full aspirations that we all have for the tourism industry in Australia. Proposed expenditures agreed to. MC 1308 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 Department of Industry, Science and Technology Proposed expenditure, $1,443,914,000. but I think it is deplorable that the government has cut off the discussion on the budget, that the debate has been transferred over here on limited time, and that we now have to discuss the estimates of Department of Industry, Science and Technology, and other departments, on a five-minute basis. In order to assess the values of any department, it is necessary to look around and to meet some of the people, and to look through the accounts presented in the budget. To have only five minutes for this side of the House to discuss these estimates is a deplorable state of affairs. But the government is in a rush to judgment. It wishes to hurry to the election and to get rid of the budget-it does not matter what is in it. The hallmark of this government is that the people of Australia must not be told too much. The budget itself, as addressed to industry and commerce, is about business, but as far as business is concerned there is nothing in it but a let-down. Business sought a reduction in the deficit. This can be done in two ways: by cutting spending or increasing taxes. To cut spending was what businesses were calling for. The government took the soft option: it is an election year, therefore up with taxation. Consequently, investment will fall, growth will fall, and a fall in employment will follow. On top of that, there will be a negative impact on savings. The cumulative effect is that our international competitive position will not be enhanced by the actions of this government. Indeed, the speech by the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) stated that it is a tough environment in which industry is operating. At the same time, the commitment of the government to industry in this budget was to say that, come the year 2000, the last tranches of assistance will be completed. I walk around Canberra and I keep my ears open: I hear the bleats coming from the Treasury that we will have no more industry inquiries. We are heading towards the Bogor agreement and therefore all those areas of assistance will be gone. I can assure the government that the opposition does not see it that way. We are concerned about the outcomes. The next meeting of APEC in Osaka is rumoured to be setting down the road towards definite guidelines and positions, to which we can expect the members of APEC to agree. There has been no discussion with the major industry groups about the outcomes of Osaka. I have that from the best authority. Is that any way to carry on discussions and development? Does the government genuinely expect Australia in the year 2010 to be in a position where it can compete on the world stage against the might of Asia without any concern for the outcomes? I listen to the hot air that comes from the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). I quote this little effort, in reference to taking a delegation to the Far East: SoI have faith that Australia is well prepared for a world where techntcal change in transport and telecommunications is removing the barriers to diverse cultural interactions. Globally, cultural diversity is an increasingly important element in the intemationalisation of industry. As structural and technical barriers ·are removed, cultural diversity assumes a pivotal role in global progress. What on earth does that mean? Do you think that the people who are employed in Australian industry know what all that gobbledegook is about? Is that the sort of representation to expect? The hot air goes on; hot air is everywhere.",104,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Moore (Ryan) (12.56 P.m.),"I have not had the opportunity of speaking here before,Tuesday, 6 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1309 In the few remaining moments I have, I want to make some comments in relation to the performance of a couple of the programs administered by the department. The Burgess committee was set up to review the programs of assistance. However, the riding instructions given to Mr Burgess were not to look at alternative programs, but to look at the programs we have and see .how we might be able to improve them. As a consequence, very little, in my view, came out of the Burgess committee report at all. But what we do have is an example of a meeting in a regional area. There were 80-odd invitations sent out, four or five people turned up and there was a bevy of about 20 others, including secretaries of departments and local Labor politicians. Is that the way you spend money? Does that get productivity up? Does that get business going? It certainly does not. It is all the gloss. But the final gloss is this: the million-dollar man. There is $10 million in the budget to promote new industry. And who is doing it? None other than John Dawkins. I hope he enjoys it while he has got it. Technology) (1.01 p.m.)-It is a great privilege to speak in this debate. The industry, science and technology portfolio contains agencies and programs which are fundamentally important to the future success and growth of the Australian economy. Indeed, the portfolio contains personnel in whom I have the utmost pride for their capacity and the way they are able to originate and develop policies for the improvement of the Australian economy and put forward programs which are practical and success stories by themselves. We have seen the programs and policies of this portfolio developed in a way which has delivered manufacturing growth in this country at unprecedented levels. For example, Australia's manufacturing sector has recorded growth over the last two to three years in a way which has been unmatched in our history. It has been responsible for nearly a quarter of the total growth of the Australian economy since early 1991, even though it only accounts for 16 per cent of the total economy. Production in the manufacturing sector rose by 9.3 per cent in real terms in 1993-94, compared to overall economic growth of 4.2 per cent. It is an outstanding achievement. The growth in exports of our elaborately transformed manufactures-ETMs-has been particularly impressive over the last decade. Australia exported $2.4 billion of ETMs in 1984. In 1994, this figure was $11.5 billion. That is a growth of 16 per cent a year over the decade. Again, a truly outstanding milestone achievement. So the growth in manufacturing and export service industries demonstrates the success of these policies. That success contrasts sharply with the failure of the opposition's industry policies when it was in government. This is avery important point to make in this debate. The appropriations for the industry, science and technology portfolio are $2.8 billion, approximately the same as in 1994-95. In my speech on the appropriation bills, I covered a number of agencies and programs being administered by the portfolio this year and I will not add to those remarks today. But the government has set out in the budget a new phase of our support for one particular program which I want to make a few remarks on, and that is the textile, clothing and footwear industries program. This new TCF development package will continue the process of restructuring, it will help raise productivity to meet the industry's goal of $2 billion of exports by the year 2000. And, importantly, the package will assist the industries to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that will emerge from Australia's integration within APEC.",106,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Lindsay (Herbert,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science andMC 1310 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 The department also administers the investment promotion and facilitation program. This is designed to inform overseas investors of Australia's strengths as an investment location. The budget funding of $9 million will continue the program for another year while an evaluation is carried out. I am very proud of this particular program. It also includes activities such as the regional headquarters campaign and the funding of feasibility studies for eligible major investment projects. The work on the investment promotion has encouraged a number of companies to establish regional headquarters in Australia. Among them are British Telecom, CAE Electronics and Methode Electronics, to name a few. Also in the budget $3.75 million. has been allocated over three years to continue the reform process in the construction industry. That will enable the establishment of an Australian construction industry council which will then be able to implement the second stage of the micro-economic reform agenda, with the council drawing its members from leading industry firms. The government will also undertake an independent safety assessment of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor at a cost of $2 million, and that assessment will be carried out by independent researchers in accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines. This is an important initiative in the methodology we adopt in developing the overall future of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. Australian participation in international relationships is an important element of the science and technology program. This year, .activities will include the implementation of new arrangements for science and technology cooperation with Indonesia, and the signing of a new science and technology agreement with Korea, to name a couple. The innovation statement will be brought down by· the minister later this year. That is designed to encourage an innovation culture in Australia. Generally, the portfolio is making an important contribution to the development of that statement and its culture by consultation right throughout the community. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Primary Industries and Energy Proposed expenditure, $468,502,000. only five minutes for each of the coalition speakers, and only one has a chance to make comment on each of these major departmental estimates. I want to refer to the welfare aspects of primary industry in the time that is available, and I notice that in the budget statement welfare for the rural sector is now DPIE included in its expenditure. I think in particular of the DRP, the drought relief payment, and I think also of some of the other elements that are now included in primary industry to bolster the figures which should not be there and traditionally have not been there, for example, the diesel rebate, which really is income forgone rather than a payment, and also even labour market programs, which should be under another department and not in primary industry. It does indicate the double standard of this government with regard to rural welfare versus urban welfare. At a time when welfare generally is increasing in urban Australia-and I can understand that because of the high level of unemployment-it has actually been reduced in rural Australia. I think in particular of the restrictions on household support, which is now only available in declared exceptional circumstance areas, and you know how difficult that has been in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, with the drought. I think also of the inappropriate",107,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Lloyd (Murray) (1.06 P.m.),"I too would like to say how pathetic it is that we haveTuesday, 6 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1311 use of assets tests, which has meant that most rural people basically miss out on any of the welfare provisions available to other Australians. I think of the assets test in relation to Austudy and what that means for denial of educational' opportunities. When one talks about two Australias, rich and poor, that is certainly the case, but I believe most of the commentators have missed out onwho are the rich and who are the poor. The biggest income divide in this country is not in the city; it is between country and city. The best evidence of that is the Parliamentary Research Service comparison of the 1990-91 census of 147 federal electorates with 57 different comparisons-you can call it the Heinz study, if you like. The number of rural or regional classified electorates would be, at the most, say, one-third of the total of 147, but the comparison indicates that the 12 poorest, those electorates with family incomes below $16,000, are all in rural Australia. Murray is number 30 and there are only eight of the first 30 that are urban electorates. So we can see the tremendous disproportion in income between country and city. Since the census in 1990-91, that would have got worse because of the drought and because of low wool prices. I want to make an appeal to the churches-particularly my own church, the Uniting Church, and the social welfare commission section of the Catholic Church-to really look at where poverty is in this country. Forget about GSTs, privatisation and things they have attacked the coalition on, and look at exactly where the lowest income in this country is and where the direction for drawing government's attention to the greatest needs in this country should be , addressed. I commend the Uniting Church in Victoria, because its share appeal, which is now under way, is basically for those who have been drought affected. In spite of rain, the cash drought will continue for up to six months, particularly as the government-showing its usual double standard of country versus city-included hardly any of Victoria in the exceptional circumstances drought provisions. Even if more of Victoria had been included, it would have been of no great value. Because of its negative ideological nature-against country people-the government had to change the 'exceptional circumstances' several times before anybody ever qualified. One might look at the real assistance provided by the coalition government when it was last in power, compared with what the government has provided and even to what the government claims it is going to provide in the next two or three years. As we know, from the way the government keeps changing and breaking its promises, that is a very doubtful proposition. The recognition of country problems, as well as city problems, has been forgotten by this government. I would like to go on and detail, to a far greater degree, what that is. I would also like to deal to a greater degree with where I believe the churches, being mainly urban based, have also missed the correct focus in this debate. But I have not time. Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (1.11 p.m.)-I want to take the opportunity to make clear the government's strong commitment to rural Australia, as outlined in this budget, and to take issue with some of the matters raised by the member for Murray( Mr Lloyd) in respect of that strong commitment, which is demonstrable. The budget makes it clear that the government is determined to provide the ongoing assistance that large parts of rural Australia need because of the severity of the drought and the ongoing nature of that drought. I would like to go to a couple of the details. The drought assistance measures introduced to date total $302 million, from 1994 up to the period 1997-98.",108,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Elliott (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and ParliamentaryMC 1312 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 Given the adjustments made to the rural adjustment scheme to ensure that the exceptional circumstances provisions were demand driven, the cost of the package is estimated to increase to $519 million. To have any suggestion that it is not, indeed, a very substantial financial commitment, as well as a very strong recognition of the severity of the particular needs of rural Australia, is to sell this budget and the government's actions well and truly short. The drought relief payment has already benefited some 10,000 farm families. I do not think anyone would dispute either the need or the severity of the problem. But I would also be arguing, very strongly, that that highlights the substantial nature of the response. The total assistance that those 10,000 farm families have received to date is just on $48 million. The government has made clear, even with its decisions in the last fortnight, that it is continuing to monitor those problems, take them seriously, and address them vigorously at the same time. There are measures contained in other areas of the primary industries and energy budget, relating to land care and to the particular needs of parts of Australia faced with soil erosion and so on. There are ongoing commitments to those matters through the comprehensive land care strategy that the government has already announced and is implementing. There is also the whole area of rural financial counselling services. I know, from when we held the inquiries of the banking committee looking at the needs of rural Australia a couple of years ago, that there was increasingly a demand and a requirement both to have the financial institutions more attuned with the needs of rural Australia, and to have independent counselling services that farmers and those involved in agribusiness concerns could go to to get comprehensive, independent advice. All those arrangements have been the subject of enhancement over the last 12 to 18 months, as well. As well as that, the government, through the primary industries portfolio, is not only making a commitment to those key domestic demands because of the severity of the drought but is also taking steps in this budget to deal with the increasing scope in the food processing area for export. We know that is one of the key areas that will help to drive the future prosperity of rural Australia, to build what is a major opportunity in the food processing industry and the export of those products. The clean food export program is being continued, and there is an allocation in the budget of $2 million towards that program. ' We recognise both the key concerns and needs of rural Australia. I think that is a view that is shared across the community. The member for Murray referred to the fact that churches and others in the cities are not responsive enough to that need and what is perceived, I guess, to be an emphasis on some of the particular requirements of families in cities. I take it that is the gist of the comment that was made. I grew up in rural Australia, in country New South Wales, but I can say I have lived in the cities for quite a while now, and certainly in my own church and others I know we have had major collections relating to the needs of rural' Australia and a major focus on the needs of parts of rural Australia. I think most of us who live in the cities these days are very conscious not only of the impact of the drought on farm families but of what that does to communities in the country towns that service those farms as well. Obviously if there is a cash drought for farm families it affects the whole community. The statements of the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) related to the drought package made it clear that the measures were focused not only on the needs of the farm families but on the infrastructure, the businesses and so on that go to service those in the country towns. That is Tuesday, 6 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1313 important. Everyone knows that the demands in rural Australia are substantial and will continue to be substantial. The budget estimates themselves take account of the fact that the ongoing severity of the drought is going to have a continuing impact, particularly on export markets and on the trade position. We all hope that will be overcome sooner than later but, as the member for Murray points out, it is a sqbstantial issue. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Proposed expenditure, $2,333,921,000. the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1995-96, under the Foreign Affairs and Trade allocation, I wish to firstly speak about one specific commitment, which is to reopen the Australian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which is a specialised item in this year's budget referred to in the budget papers. It is set down to happen officially on 18 July, subject to no early election or no other factors intervening, in the presence of one or two ministers, but with a representative to not be formally appointed as ambassador, as opposed to charge d'affaires, until a little later in the year. I welcome very much this particular focus and this particular proposal in the 1995-96 budget. I believe it is only fair, proper and reasonable that Australia re-establish its embassy level links in Beirut, Lebanon to reflect the peace process in the Middle East but also to reflect the real progress that Lebanon is making against very difficult odds in circumstances which are extraordinarily difficult relating to its neighbours, most notably both Israel and Syria. Despite that, there is a spirit alive and well in Lebanon to get on with the job of rebuilding Beirut and rebuilding Lebanon. I salute that spirit and hope that the embassy, on its reopening in the same building as it was in before its closure in the middle of the civil year, will reward Australian promotional effort not only on the diplomatic front but also in helping to boost our trade to the Middle East and our trade to Lebanon, where we have a small live sheep trade and other items. The second point I want to make is that the whole focus and effort of the trade component of Foreign Affairs and Trade must be mindful of the fact that Australia is losing market share in certain key growing Asian markets. It is not quite good enough to say that, as the Asian economies move on and further mature and develop from their very small economic bases, they are going to show huge growth figures; their needs are going to be different, and that explains justifiably, in the eyes of some, why it is okay for Australia to lose market share in some of these key Asian economic tigers. I would argue that there can be absolutely no complacency about our trading and export efforts to Asia and elsewhere. We hear the government referring to it repeatedly. I make the point that, when one analyses the figures on any objective and properly comparative criteria as I, particularly in a paper in January this year, have said; and as, more recently, the shadow minister for foreign affairs has said-one can have no doubt that we are losing our market share, and that is a matter of legitimate concern. In the context of the allocation of these appropriations for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I want to see attention brought to bear on that circumstance, on the need to further diversify our export efforts, and on the need to, in fact, lift our game against some pretty nasty competition coming from around the Pacific and elsewhere in the world.",109,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Tim Fischer (Farrer,"Leader of the National Party of Australia) (1.17 p.m.)-InMC 1314 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 The last point I want to make in the time available is to refer to the foreign aid component in the budget, which has again fallen as a percentage of GDP and, of course, falls well short of the allocation of the policy objective laid down at the national ALP conferences in Hobart. There is a need to be very careful about Australian taxpayer dollars being used on aid. There is, of course, a case for foreign aid: it does indeed help Australia and does help many people in the world who are disadvantaged, and I am, in general terms, supportive of the foreign aid program. The targeting, efficiency and effectiveness of that aid program is something for legitimate scrutiny by this parliament and, indeed, by the minister for overseas aid, most notably in his comments with regard to one particular international organisation. I highlight the fact that, as a percentage of GDP, aid has fallen well short of the government's own foreign aid objectives. We must work harder to drive those foreign aid dollars just as far as they can be driven to produce the maximum effective outcome. Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (1.22 p.m.)-I am pleased to respond to the member for Farrer( Mr Tim Fischer) in relation to the foreign affairs and trade portfolio appropriations. I join with him by saying that I welcome the initiative relating to the reopening of the embassy in Beirut. I note from the actual budget measures that $3.76 million is provided towards this end in 1995-96, and $2.33 million is provided for 1996-97 in the forward estimates. . One of the significant things about the reopening of the embassy in Beirut-which is something that all of us have been keen to encourage just as soon as the security situation permitted, and something the government has been committed to have occur this year-is that, as well as reopening the embassy, we are going to establish an Austrade office in the embassy in Beirut. That is a reflection of the fact that we do appreciate the opportunity to use the embassy in Beirut as a major gateway to build trade not only with Lebanon, but also with the region . .One of things that has become clear in more recent times is that, as Lebanon goes through the process of restructuring after the devastation of the war that has occurred there, the opportunities to both invest in Lebanon and use that investment to extend more broadly into the region are very real indeed. Last Sunday, the Australian Lebanese Business Council had the launch of a trade mission it is taking to Lebanon to coincide with the reopening of the embassy. Again, that reflects the fact that Australian business people here-particularly those originally from the Lebanon who have come here and shown terrific enterprise in businessrecognise that business here can playa very active part in that rebuilding process in Lebanon, with the range of demands and needs it has to rebuild infrastructure and the whole range of services from financial services through to water, electricity, et cetera. At the launch of the Australian Lebanese trade mission last Sunday, business people were saying that the opportunities in Lebanon are as great as those in Vietnam, if we move in there early and play a real part, because of the strong connections Australia has with Lebanon and the great bilateral relationship that there is between the two peoples of the respective countries. We know that the demands that exist there are shared by countries right around that region, and that Australia is well regarded throughout the Middle East. I certainly share the view that, through our trade efforts, we can do substantially more to boost trade in the Middle East across",111,Representatives Main Committee

The member for Farrer referred to a couple of other matters, including the area of foreign aid. It is correct to say that there is a marginal decline, as a percentage of GDP, in the foreign aid budget for this year-I think the actual figures are 0.34 to 0.33-but the dollar increase over this year, and the previous budget, highlights the government's ongoing commitment to the foreign aid program. That real dollar commitment has indeed been a substantial increase over those two years. That of course enables a well targeted, properly focused foreign aid program to be achieved. It also enables the government to maintain its clear commitment to the range of foreign aid needs that exist, be they in the immediate region or in Africa and other parts. In the area of trade with Asia, the fact is that over recent years there has been a massive increase in our commitment and representation within the Asia-Pacific region. We have not only opened additional Austrade offices but we have also had much greater commitment to our direct diplomatic representation in countries in the region. There has been a very strong focus on using that increased representation to further the trade opportunities that exist in the region. It is clear, from almost every facet of industry we talk about-whether it relates to Indonesia or other countries in the region-that that commitment is ongoing. Rarely a week goes by without major visits to Australia from business in those countries or delegations from here to countries in the region. Certainly the opportunities are there and we have to grasp them. We know that those countries are going to be competitive and to suggest that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing anything other than putting the proper focus on the Asia region, and the growth opportunities in the region, is absolutely wrong. I commend the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Main Committee. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Administrative Services Proposed expenditure, $630,930,000. which put forward the recommendation for the establishment of the second chamber. Part of the recommendation, and part of the reason for it, was that members of this House would have additional opportunity to speak on issues of importance, not just to them but to the nation as a whole. The whole purpose of this chamber was to extend the range of speakers, and yet we find in this budget debate that we have still had the gag applied and we have still had the guillotine applied. I want to make a formal complaint about that. It is totally inappropriate that this government should try to gag and guillotine discussion on the most important document to come before the parliament every year-that is, the budget. It affects every man, woman and child in this country. It is just further evidence of the authoritarian attitude of the government. We have seen this in the most recent moves to take steps to jail journalists if they do something that the government believes is incorrect. I make the point that members of the opposition have been prevented from speaking on the budget because of the gag and because of the guillotine. It is only because we have the second chamber that we got an extra day and a half; otherwise most of the opposition would have been prevented from speaking on the budget. I do not see that as an expression of democracy.",112,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Nehl (Cowper) (1.27 P.m.),"I was a member of the Standing Committee on ProcedureMC 1316 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 It is interesting to note that very few government members bothered to say a word on the budget. I can only assume that they are a bit ashamed of it. We have the figure being put forward in the budget of a surplus of $719 million, whereas the real deficit is certainly at least $8.2 billion. Of course, some people who have been analysing the budget suggest that it is as high as over $12 billion. One of the ways that the government has falsely attained this so-called surplus is by the sale of assets, one of which is Dasfleet. It is interesting that this particular sale is a double conwhile the government has applied to the budget the revenue, the funds that it is getting from the sale of Dasfleet, it is my understanding that it has not counted in that it is going to have to lease back the fleet to continue to provide the same service. So on the one hand it is going to sell it and that is counted in, but then it is going to ·have to pay to lease it back and I understand that that has not been included. I believe are vitally important. The other point I would like to make is regarding the drivers of Comcar. I have been a member of this place for 10 years. I have had incredibly good service from Comcar drivers everywhere I have been, and there should be a special place for the effect on them. I hope that, in responding, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts( Mr Elliott) will make some mention of what is going to happen to Comcar drivers, because I believe they have been given a raw deal for at least the last four or five years. There have been so many new management plans, so many new schemes, and they havedeal, and I think it is appropriate that they should be looked after appropriately. week. other thing is that in terms of the budget, in terms of the so-called surplus which is achieved by the sale of assets, the people of Australia should be very much aware that this is a very high taxing government, that over the next two years alone taxation revenue will increase by $6 billion. That is an additional $2.4 billion in 1995-96 and an additional $3.6 billion in 199697. This is the biggest single tax hike since the Whitlam government. Labor specialises in being a high taxing government. I make the point again that the surplus in the budget is a false surplus. It has been obtained artificially by the sale of assets. If assets were to be sold, the money obtained from them should not be put in just to wipe out a deficit in one year but should be paid off the debt of the Commonwealth. The debt of the people of Australia should have been reduced by the sale of Dasfleet, by the sale of Qantas and by the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, when that occurs.

I certainly acknowledge that he played a constructive role through that process and made valuable contributions, which I would suggest was more than some of his colleagues did in that process. There has been discussion about the appropriateness of the estimates matters being considered in the Main Committee. The reality is, I think, that that process can work quite reasonably. That has been the subject of discussions and agreement on the process between government and opposition before we commenced the reference to the Main Committee and I would like to think that is still going to be a fruitful way for the parliament to viewimportant matters, and I think the budget was so good that the longer we had to discuss it the better it would be for the government. I certainly made my contribution in the second reading debate on the appropriations, because I certainly believe that the budgetmany positive things there were in this budget, both for the good of my electorate and also for the good of the electorate of the honourable member for Cowper. I just hope that, as he reads it more closely, he starts to see just how many valuable things there are for the good folk of Coffs Harbour and other parts of Australia. With respect to the actual matters relating to Comcar, most of the major announcements relating to the restructuring of Comcar were taken in last year's budget or in earlier management decisions. There are no matters pertinent to this year's budget that directly affect Comcar operations at all. I know from experience, and from what I get told in New South Wales, that the basic numbers of Comcar drivers that were spelt out as required have been reached and there have not been anything other than voluntary redundancies that achieved that number over a period of time with the natural process of people taking those packages. Clearly, it is an issue that the minister and the government continue to take seriously. I will certainly relay the general concerns that the member for Cowper raised about that particular area to the Minister for Administrative Services( Mr Walker). I make a comment generally on the asset sales question, given that the member for Cowper raised that. As the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) indicated in question time last week, in answering a question about the accounting of asset sales and the arrangements that apply to those, the process that we are following in this year's budget is absolutely no different from that which was followed when the current Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of Australia, or that undertaken by other governmentsExactly the same accounting process has been followed in relation to asset sales in this year's budget as has been in other budgets. not running too hard in the Coffs Harbour paper about the domestic surplus argument. I thank the member for Brisbane for reminding me of that fact. The fact of the matter is that, as far as DasfIeet is concerned, we are in the same category of treating that asset sale as we are with other asset sales. The appropriate arrangements for what other lease-back arrangements might apply in the future are spelt out-indeed, in the documents that were provided as part of the administrative services advice on budget night.

258,Mr Elliott,"Yes, the domestic surplus argument. I suspect the member for Cowper isMC 1318 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 Cowper. With those few words, I commend the appropriations for the department to the Main Committee for favourable consideration. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $10,516,267,000. in the last couple of parliaments, there has been an increasing move towards bipartisanship in terms of the defence portfolio. Whilst in the context of this budget that trend will continue, can I say to you and to those opposite-in particular, the Parliamentary Secretary to the the edges in terms of the defence debate. We will continue to home in on the issues as we think they are appropriate. The second point I would make is that that does not indicate that in any way the opposition is policy bankrupt in terms of the defence portfolio. Far be it from that. I heard the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Punch) in this place last week, in the context of a particular debate, make that point. I say to the parliamentary secretary, and I hope he will convey this to the minister, that initiatives will emerge from the coalition, the opposition, at an appropriate time of our making in due course. That said, here we are faced with an outlay of $9.92 billion. But if you include the Young Endeavour and cultural and recreational programs, that goes out to a little under $11 billion. Those increases have increased the percentage from eight to 8.1 per cent of government outlays. That is the sort of percentage that ministers and the parliamentary secretary would use. That is as a result of some arithmetic gymnastics and adjustments within the department that I need not go into in the time available. However, I think that the most important point to make is that that represents 2.0 per cent of GDP. Argue about it or not, Parliamentary Secretary, that is the lowest that this country has experienced in our history-two per cent of GDP. That must, of course, put up signs around the place that we need to consider that and look at that in detail. One element in these arithmetic gymnastics is the increase of $15 million for Voyager compensation. As the parliamentary secretary would know, I have argued the case for Voyager compensation for a long time, and once again I have to compliment both the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on their initiatives in that area. I particularly ask the parliamentary secretary to reinforce the point that the outstanding claims-those claims made after 1 December 1988-need to be settled as quickly as possible. In the area of asset sales, which of course are going to become an increasing element in the Defence budget, we would like to see some substantive progress in terms of the sale of ASTA and in terms of the AIDe. The parliamentary secretary might make some comment, bearing in mind that they hold a 50 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation, about just where that is heading and how quickly it might be resolved. One other element that I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary to address is the sale of an asset which is not mentioned in the budget papers. There is a question mark about the Nomad aircraft. Those Nomad aircraft are sitting on the ground at the army aviation centre in Oakey. They have moved absolutely nowhere in the last five or six months. There are",115,Representatives Main Committee

Finally, in the assets area, there is the situation with Cockatoo Island. I am aware of ongoing litigation between the Department of Defence and Cockatoo Island Dockyard. It is a big black hole when it comes to environmental matters. I hope that the government will come to grips with that and that the government will make some substantive statement in the area of the sale of Cockatoo Island in the not too distant future. Apart from that, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the very short time that we have got available in Committee I commend the budget to this Committee. appreciated the contribution from the member for Groom( Mr Taylor), and am happy to acknowledge his long history and sincere interest in the field. I have had the pleasure of serving with him for some three or four years on the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I value his contributions in the Defence debate. I know that is a view shared by my colleagues in the ministry. I will go to a couple of the specifics which he has raised. In relation to the Voyager-and again I think it is fair to say that the member for Groom has been at the forefront of the debate in pursuing that matter-the government has already settled a number of claims. There are some outstanding claims which were the subject of an offer from the government and which are still under negotiation. The Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) has made clear on the public record his desire to see that matter progressed to a satisfactory outcome, and I understand that it is a matter that is currently in his consideration. It is something that I would hope will be taken forward to a conclusion sooner rather than later, and I am sure he does too. As with all of these matters revolving around litigation, it is not always possible to put a finite time on it, but it is clear that this government has moved much further than any government since the Voyager disaster to try to ensure some justice for Voyager victims. So far as asset sales generally are concerned, as they affect Defence, there have been a number of assets that have been identified for disposal; but it has not been the top of the market, as it were, to sell many of those assets. Defence is keen to ensure that it does get a good return on those assets, and I would anticipate that given the change in the broad economic climate we will see some of those assets to which the member for Groom referred being able to be put on the market and realised during the course of the current financial year. I am not in the position to provide him with specific advice on ASTA and the AIDC, but I would be quite happy to look into that for him. In relation to the Nomad aircraft, another issue which I know he has pursued for some time, there is an ongoing investigation. I understand that the findings from that inquiry are due to be presented to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) by the end of June this year. In fact, at a recent function I was talking to one of the officers involved in that review, and was advised that it is still ongoing. I know they have not completed their work at this time. Hopefully that work will be completed in time for a report to be made available to the minister by the end of June, and we will then all be in a position to make some clear assessment about what future role, if any, the Nomad has in the Australian Defence Force.",116,Representatives Main Committee

262,Mr Taylor,"If any.MC 1320 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 6 June 1995 defence globally gets out of the budget. As the member for Groom correctly points out, it is a smidgin under $10 billion. That does represent an increase, as a percentage of government outlays. It also represents about two per cent of GDP. It is interesting that the percentage of GDP is often used as a yardstick. I have made it very plain, for some time, that I have never regarded percentage of GDP as a dramatically useful measure for defence effectiveness. It may have some use when you are trying to compare across national boundaries. But even there it is very limited, because it is a percentage of a fluctuating figure, and that does not produce too much in terms of actual hardware or personnel on the ground. I will just illustrate that. I have just come from a lunch with visiting members of the Japanese parliament. The gentlemen sitting beside me were talking about defence matters. Bear in mind that Japan has what is the third largest defence force in the world-it is, arguably, the second largest, if you take account of what has happened in the Soviet Union. The gentleman sitting beside me said, 'How much do you spend on defence? What percentage of GDP?' I said, 'Two per cent.' He said, 'Oh, that is twice as much as we spend.' There is the answer. It is two per cent. It also happens to be maintaining defence commitments in all but real terms. There has been only a very slight reduction in defence outlays in the last year. I should not let the opportunity pass without noting that, on the last occasion, the opposition did have a formal policy on defence. At the last election, the opposition undertook to reduce outlays on defence by $200 million beyond the cuts which we were programming. The two per cent figure is not one I would rest on.

They must be paid in the amounts, and at the times, that are determined in writing by the minister. As in the case of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), there is a provision for this act to be updated, should the Financial Management and Accountability Bill be enacted before 30 June 1995. In debating the Appropriation Bill (No. I), I have already canvassed the excessive spending and the excessive use of higher taxes that are a hallmark of this government. I have also dealt with the growth in debt that is also a hallmark of this government, and I do not propose to go over these issues again. However, we will not let this government forget its fraudulent budget in the coming months. This government will have to go to the people knowing that nothing it says can be believed and that none of its promises are credible. It will be at that time that the Australian people will pass their verdict on this high taxing, self-indulgent government. I would now like to make a few comments, as we are debating these measures cognately, on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96. This particular bill appropriates funding of $144.46 million for the year ending 30 June 1996. There may also be some additional appropriations for increases in salaries. The extra amounts may be issued only for the purpose of increase in salaries and in payments in the nature of salary, and the minister must report the amount so issued to the parliament. If the description of the purpose of an appropriation refers to net appropriation, then this is taken to provide that any moneys received may be credited to the item, on the conditions agreed to by the minister and the presiding officer responsible for the department. The bill also allows for any money in relation to the Senate or the House of Representatives in excess of specific appropriations to be charged to an advance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or to an advance to the President of the Senate. After allowing for any repayments, the total expenditure must not exceed the amount appropriated for the advances. As with the other two appropriation bills, this bill allows for modifications to reflect the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, should it commence before 30 June 1995. This bill is concerned with the running of the parliament and the funding of its operations. We must, however, always be aware that many of our fellow Australians are still doing it tough. We must always be on our guard so that parliament, while fulfilling its role as a democratic institution in contact with people, is not wasteful and extravagant of taxpayers' money.
