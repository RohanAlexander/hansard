That will be the third negative Armitage, J.L Johnson, Keith (Teller) Blewett, N. Johnson, Les (Teller) vote. I am suggesting that the Opposition is Brown, John Jones, Barry obstructing the business of this House by moving Cass, M.H. Keating, P.J. Cohen, B. Kerin, J.C. these motions. This will be the third occasion on Dawkins, J.S. Klugman, R.E. which one is resolved in the negative. Everingham, D. N. McLeay, Leo Fry, K.

That the honourable member be not further heard. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Ayes 70 the bells. He referred me to Standing Order 86 Noes 30 relating to motions for the suspension of Standing Orders. Standing Order 86 refers to a certain Majority 40 group of motions which must be put forth without debate. A motion for the suspension of AYES Standing Orders is not one of those. Therefore, Adermann, A. E. Johnson. Peter there is no point of order. The honourable Aldred. K.J. Johnston, Roger member for Corio then took up the point of order Anthony, J. D. Jull. D.F. Baillieu, M. Katter, R. C. relating to Standing Order 86 and suggested that Baume, M. E. Killen. D.J. it should relate to motions that the honourable Birney, R.J. Lucock, P. E. Bourchier, J.W. Lusher. S. A. member be no longer heard. In fact, Standing Bradfield, J.M. Lynch, P. R. Order 86 only operates in that sense if the motion Braithwaite, R. A. MacKellar, M.J. R. has been negatived. All of these motions have Brown, N. A. MacKenzie, A. J. Burr, M. A. McLean, R. M. been carried in the affirmative. That is why I Cadman, A. G. McLeay, John ruled that there was no point of order.
