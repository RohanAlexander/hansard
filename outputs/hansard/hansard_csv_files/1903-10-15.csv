The committee has realized that the duties as for as possible, by exchange instead of by intrusted to it by the Houses of the Federal purchase. The committee desires to acknowledge Parliament are of the utmost importance, as it the courtesy so for extended to it in this matter has looked forward to the probability of the by certain States. establishment of a Federal Public Library, of which the Parliamentary Library will be only one department. It is also impressed with the wealth ore filed in the Library, and two leading importance of securing and preserving all works journals from each State are bound. There are now and documents connected with the discovery, seventy-eight bound volumes of newspapers in the settlement, and early history of the various States of the Commonwealth, and their attainment of responsible government, as well as their aspirations after Federation, including also all records relating to the establishment of the Commonwealth itself. 2. There are now 3,039 volumes in the Library. These comprise statutes of Great Britain, of the various States of the Commonwealth, and of other countries, as well as parliamentary papers, law reports, constitutional manuals, and works of reference. A very generous donation of 2,433 volumes has been made to the Library by the Government of the United States. This includes Congressional documents, statutes, and the Con15 October, 190S. grtagional Record, and in additiou there are several thousand pamphlets dealing with a wide variety of subjects of governmental concern. These have been classified and are being catalogued. 3. The committee is devoting special attention to Australasian literature. Already 445 volumes, some of them very rare, have been purchased, special efforts being made to secure all such works as are likely to be increasingly difficult to obtain as time goes on. 4. The committee is endeavouring to,form as complete a collection as possible of all official and other literature, and documents, including originals, relating to Federation, both before 1891 and since that date,' and especially of the pamphlets, broad-sheets, and polemical matter published in all the States from all points of view, during the campaigns which preceded the referenda on the acceptance of the Constitution. The Governments of some of the States have presented sets of parliamentary papers on the subject, and tbe committee will probably secure a complete series of these for the whole of the Commonwealth. 5. A very fine collection of cuttings from the illustrated papers at the time of the proclamation of the Constitution, and the opening of tbe first Parliament, has been presented by Mr A. Mr R. P..

The files will be completed, as far as possible, back to the date of the inauguration of the Commonwealth, in January, 1901. 9. As the Parliament has the use of the Victorian Parliamentary Library, it is not the policy of the committee to buy largely books already available for members, unless copies are specially required, or there is reason to believe that anyparticular book may become difficult to obtain in a few years. But care is being taken, as time passes, to provide that, by the time the Parliament leaves Melbourne for the permanent capital, it shall possess a suitable and sufficient library for its own use, and the basis also for a collection of archives, and for a library worthy of the Commonwealth.

External Affairs) -With the consent of the House, I move That the Standing Orders be suspendedso as to enable a BiU for .an Act to amend the Public Service Act to be introduced and passed through all its stages without delay. The Bill contains but one clause, amending paragraph (c) of section 80 of the Public Service Act, to enable us to extend the time during which those who have passed the examination under the Act may have an opportunity to enter the public service. Under the Act as it stands at present, after the passing of the examination, they may be called upon for duty at any time during nine months, and it is thought advisable that the period should be extended to two years. The period of nine months subsequent to the first examination is now almost exhausted, and under the circumstances in which thepubli'cserviceof the Commonwealth is conducted, by. the filling up of all possible vacancies in one Department from another, it is found that, as a matter of fact, in two of the States not a single one of the successf u l candidates at the examination has yet been called upon. I have consulted the Public Service Commissioner, and find that, in his opinion, two years would probably be a better period to provide for. The present condition of affairs is partly due to the exceptional circumstances attaching to the commencement of the Commonwealth, and the proposed amending Bill is intended simply to prevent those who have passed the examination from being struck off the list of eligibles before they have had any opportunity to secure the reward to which they are entitled. The proposal is eminently fair. It has been commended by many honourable members already, and on the last occasion by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I trust that at this stage of the session the House willallowthis extremely simple and non-controversial measure to pass through all its stages without delay. The principle clause of the proposed AmendingB ill readsParagraph c of section SO of the Cmnmonweallh Bill. Public Service Act 1902 is hereby amended, and shall be taken to have been amended from the commencement of that Act by substituting that there is a necessity for extending the for the words ""nine months"" the words ""two time ; but I doubt whether it is wise that, vears."" Paragraph c of section 80 is to this effect: The Governor General may make regulations(c) Ifor examinations for fixing the fees payable for entrance examinations and for registering in the order of merit the names of all persons who have passed the entrance examinations, and those candidates who have been qualified at any such examinations may be appointed to fill subsequent vacancies arising within nine months thereof. If the Bill is agreed to, that provision will read "" within two years thereof."" make the period of two years a permanent provision ? Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented and read a first time. That the Bill be now read a second time. fair that some reason should be given for the introduction of this measure. 1 am very glad that the Government have introduced it.

In New South Wales, amongst the males who have passed the examination for telephone attendants, out of forty-eight only seven have been appointed, and the time is now nearly up. over age. pointed. cessful candidates, only fifteen have been appointed out of forty who passed. In Victoria, only three have been appointed out of twenty-seven males who passed, and only four out of eighty females who passed. In Queensland, eleven males passed, and none have been appointed ; twenty females passed, and only one has been appointed. In Western Australia, twelve males passed, and none have been appointed. In Tasmania none have been appointed out of five who successfully passed the examination. Honourable members will see that it is quite unjust that the Act should be allowed to remain as it is, and I venture to think they will be 'unanimous in granting the concession proposed by this as a permanent provision of the law, we",14,Federalfinances South Australia

I can understand two years being a reasonable period at the inception of the Commonwealth Public Service, but I do not think it should be made permanent. eighteen months would be a fair period to allow. but I have been informed that two years would be a better period, and will do no injustice to any one. If the successful candidates are exhausted sooner we can have another examination. some of the grades the examination age is limited to between fourteen and sixteen years. is fixed in some cases at sixteen years. just under fourteen years of age, and may be over the age before the next examination comes round, if a period of two years is to be allowed to elapse between the examinations. aminations being held. hausted I take it that no examination would be held. ing exhaustion the examination is held.

Under the Public ServiceA c t the strong I think there should be feature underlying admission to the Public Service of the Commonwealth is that it shall be by competitive examination, and . not merely by examination. It is not sufficient that a lad may be qualified to pass I think that perhaps a certain examination-h e must be able to obtain a greater percentage of marks than other candidates. If every candidate who secures a mere "" pass"" can remain upon the list of those who are eligible for appointment for a period of two years, the provision may operate to the detriment of smarter young men or women who may qualify twelve or eighteen months later. If we unduly extend this period, we shall incur the risk of destroying in a large measure the competitive aspect of admission to the service. To my mind, eighteen months is a reasonable term to prescribe. If the list of successful candidates is not exhausted within that time, those who have not secured appointments may very well be asked to again submit themselves for examination if they are not over age, and if they are to give place to others. External Affairs) -This is a matter for the consideration of the Committee. Honourable members have heard the list which was read by the honourable member for Wide Bay. It shows that in some States, although nearly nine months have elapsed since the first examination was held, not a single successful candidate has been appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service. It is exceedingly doubtful whether that list will be nearly exhausted in another nine months. It was these circumstances which prompted I think that it would an amendment of the Acti n the direction of extending to two years the term during which successful candidates at the first examination should be eligible for appointment. As, however, this provision is intended to be of a permanent character, I do not feel inclined to resist the alteration proposed. appoint them according to the number of marks which they obtain 1 which is at present followed.",16,Public Service Amendment

The late Prime Minister indicated that he did not anticipate that an opportunity for their consideration -would occur before the prorogation, although I believe he stated that if time permitted they might be dealt with. The Prime Minister, when alluding on Thursday week last to the business with which Parliament would be asked to deal before the close of the session, saidThe Senate will have the whole of next week to dispose of'the various Appropriation Bills before them-the principal Appropriation Bill, that relating to works and buildings, and the two minor Bills relating to arrears. Those measures will occupy the time of the Senate during next week. If this House is fortunate enough to make its selection of the site-as I hope will be the case; if necessary sitting late and long for that purposeWe sat late and long and made a selectionthen, in the week following, the members of another place will have an opportunity of agreeing or disagreeing with us ; whilst we on our part shall take up the Defence Bill, and the minor measures that are still before Parliament. Those minor measures comprised the Patents Bill, the Extradition Bill, and several other Bills, and we have dealt with them.

My contention doubt that, although the honourable member' U that we should have ample opportunity to for North Sydney requires further time for examine the proposed Orders. If we have not we shall have no chance of passing them this session, and the time occupied in their consideration will have been wasted. If notice were given we should be able to carefully study the Ordersi n private; to compare them with those of the Imperial and States Parliaments, and thus to avoid many difficulties and objections which would otherwise impede the progress of our work in Committee. The time occupied by the Standing Orders Committee in drawing up these Orders is an indication of the attention which they require. The Committee entered upon its work early in the history of the Parliament, and concluded it only on the 7th inst. been under consideration since the 18th July, 1901. be far better for us to hold to our temporary Standing Orders than to adopt these Standing Orders with the idea that they may be amended at some other time. On the other hand if they are to be permanently adopted -and any Standing Orders to which we agree should become permanent-the y must receive the fullest examination. I for one find myself utterly unable to deal with them now as they should be dealt with. It is the proper function of an Opposition, and, indeed of every honourable member, to see that any Standing Order which might take away our privileges or give honourable members undue licence, is carefully considered. If the consideration of this matter were postponed for a week, we should have ample opportunity to thoroughly examine the proposed Orders. In order that they may receive the consideration they deserve, I am perfectly willing to did not regard the attend here for another week. I hope that the Prime Minister does not think of forcing the Standing Orders through the Committee without due notice. If the attempt be made so many questions will be raised that it will be impossible to deal with them in a couple of days.

We have having had a week's notice of the intention been informed that similar Standing Orders to consider the new Standing Orders is more were presented to the Senate, and that a than counterbalanced by that advantage. standing order similar to that now under No doubt there are members of the Oppodiscussion was practically struck out by the sition who are competent to point out very members of that body.

72,Mr Sydney Smith,"If we are goingshould not leave the Chair, a privilege which we have enjoyed for the last twoand-a-half years. Although in the House of Commons they have very stringent rules for the regulation of their procedure, in order to save public time, their Standing Order is thatWhen a motion is mude for the adjournment of a debate or of the House during any debate, or that the Chairman of Committees do report progress or do leave the Chair, the debate thereupon shall be confined to the matter of such motion. It is now proposed to go beyond that, because the new Standing Order provides that motions for the first reading of a Bill, motions "" that this debate be now adjourned,"" motions in Committee "" that the Chairman report progress and ask leave to sit again,"" or "" that the Chairman leave the chair,"" shall not be open to debate. I have not had an opportunity to thoroughly study the new Standing Order, but I took the trouble to compare some of the new Orders with the old ones, and 1 then discovered that several of those now proposed would require very serious consideration. Mi-. KINGSTON I wish that the new Standing Order, which would prevent discussion upon the question, "" That the Chairman leave the chair,"" had been in force long before. that would have suited the purposes of the right honourable and learned gentleman ; but the people of the Commonwealth do not share his view. They recognise that, with the assistance of the present Standing Orders, which permit discussion upon such a motion as that referred to, we were able to perform good service for them. We exercised our rights in order to prevent the imposition of taxiition upon them without proper consideration. After midnight on one occasion the Government wished us to consent to taxation proposals involving £1,000,000 per annum, and we felt it our duty to protest. The fact that we were right on that occasion was amply demonstrated at a later stage, because the discussion of the Government proposals occupied over a fortnight, and the impositions upon the people were lessened to the extent of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. If it had not been for the rule now in force it would have been impossible for honourable members to make an effective protest against the course proposed by the Government. Honourable members may differ from us, but 12 G they must admit that we took no unfair advantage of the Standing Orders. We felt very strongly, and we had to adopt extreme measures; but no one can in fairness say that we abused our privileges. I am not moved by any personal considerations iu this matter, because I do not expect to be always in Opposition. I believe that after the next general election the members of the Government will be transferred to this side of the Chamber. Eight or nine yoars ago, the Standing Orders Committee of the New South Wales Assembly proposed some very stringent rules which were supported by the Government of the day, and passed during the absence of a number of members of the Opposition. Within fourteen days, however, the Government were defeated. In that respect T believe that history will to some extent repeat itself. We desire to be fair to the Ministry even to the very last day of this Parliament, and to secure them against unjust treatment when they find themselves in Opposition. In view of the promises made by the late Prime Minister, and the other indications that were given that the Government had no intention to proceed with the Standing Orders this session, I think their consideration might be very well postponed until the next Parliament. The rules of the .House of Commons afford opportunities for free discussion upon all the motions which under the new Standing Orders would have to be passed without debate. I think that the reasons which I have put forward for a postponement are well worthy of consideration. We should have had no objection to consider the Standing Orders if they had been brought forward some weeks ago. Though we might object to some of these proposals, we should not object to their consideration even at this stage of the session if honourable members had beer, given notice that the Government intended to proceed with this business. It could not then have been said that it. was rushed through during the absence of honourable members who had expressed a desire to discuss it . I am aware that the Prime Minister desires that the Standing Orders should be dealt with during the present Parliament, but he will admit that honourable members are not to blame for the fact that this is the first opportunity presented to us for their consideration. We should not be asked to consider them in the absence of so many honourable members.",20,Standing Orders
73,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"No doubtbut the honourable member would not himself consider it fair if, after giving him a promise that they would not proceed with a measure in which he was interested, the Government pushed it through in his absence. I hope that the Government will not proceed with the consideration of the Standing Orders to-day. I have shown that a very important alteration, contrary to the practice of the House of Commons, is proposed in one of them. mitted to every honourable member of this House to adopt a ""yes-no"" policy. Three or four weeks back I remember strongly supporting the honourable member for Dalley in his lamentations upon the absence of Standing Orders, and I cannot now with any degree of consistency object to consider them when they are submitted by the Government. Honourable members who usually sit with me on this side are anxious to return to Sydney, but I am willing to sacrifice myself by remaining in Melbourne to assist in the discussion of this business. A t the same time, I remind the Prime Minister that the Senate occupied no less than seven weeks in dealing with somewhat similar Standing Orders; and I ask how the honourable and learned gentleman can possibly hope that there will be time for a ' f u ll discussion of these Orders in the remaining hours of the present session. The Standing Orders Committee, which included some eminent constitutional lawyers, were occupied for nineteen sittings in completing the draft Orders, and they were engaged from the month of June, 1901, to 7th October, 1903, a period covering two years, in the work. It cannot, therefore, be'expected that we shall make very much progress today. If the Prime Minister were disposed to allow Standing Orders of vital importance to be postponed, I could understand his proceeding with the discussion of the remainder. the critical Standing Orders if we can get on with the others. honourable members to point out which are the critical Standing Orders. For instance, Standing Order No. S4 gives very strong closure powers, and it must be admitted that in the exercise of the closure honourable members require to be safeguarded and protected. A call of the House might with advantage be resorted to in connection with these critical Standing Orders. If the Standing Orders are not the political Nirvana of honourable members, they are to a great extent the guiding star of our deliberations. The honourable member for Macquarie informs me that the first Standing Order is a most critical one. I am not to be led astray on that account, because the honourable member, in this matter, is a Greek bringing gifts, and we are advised to beware of the Greeks when they do this. As the Prime Minister is prepared to postpone the critical Standing Orders, we might pass those which are not critical; but I remind honourable members that the Senate, which contains only thirt} -six memr bers, took seven weeks to discuss the Standing Orders adopted for that Chamber. That will give honourable members some idea of the length of time which the discussion of our Standing Orders will occupy. I admit the excellent work done by the Standing Orders o Committee. Honourable members representing all shades of political thought were represented on that Committee, and that is a warrant to us that the proposed Orders have been carefully considered and criticised. I am extremely pleased that so much heed has been paid by the Prime Minister to the grievance which I ventilated upon a previous occasion in reference to the Standing Orders.' I compliment the honourable gentleman upon having submitted these Orders, and I can assure him of my support i u securing their adoption. Nevertheless it must be recognised that honourable members are not in a proper frame of mind to seriously consider the whole of them upon such exceedingly short notice. I see no reason why we should not adopt the practice of the House of Commons when contingencies arise which are not provided for in our own Standing Orders. That practice has been followed in our States Parliaments, and has also been adopted by other legislative bodies throughout the Empire. TheseI am willing to postpone Orders will require the most careful scrutiny; but if the Prime Minister is determined to proceed with their discussion upon the present occasion I shall do my best to assist him.

We have to decide whether Mr Speaker should create precedents for this House; or whether he should of his own free will follow the precedents of the House of Commons in cases in which he believes they apply. This Standing Order expressly provides that in cases not provided for he shall follow the practice of the House of Commons; but there is a great difference between making an expressed declaration in writing to that effect, and simply enabling Mr Speaker to follow the House of Commons precedents where he thinks it desirable to do so. What does the use of the word ""practice"" involve? Is the whole practice of the House of Commons under its Standing Orders, and in accordance with its precedents, to be adopted; or are we simply to adopt the precedents of the House of Commonst The two honourable members to whom I have referred seem to think that this expression will cover the closure rule. out that provision in its draft Standing Orders. closure rule, we should not do so in tbe dark. I am not discussing the point whether it is desirable or undesirable to adopt that rule; but I contend that we should not in the dark adopt any practice of the House of Commons. Honourable members have not had sufficient opportunity to inquire into the practice of the House of Commons to enable them to understand what this term will cover, and I should like the Prime Minister to give us some information on the point. He should tell us how far this Order will extend, and give us good reasons for it . ' think that some honourable member of the Standing Orders Committee should explain the reason why it is proposed to depart from the temporary Standing Order which provides thatIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons. . . . The Order now before us omits the words, "" rules, forms, and,"" and I think it should be explained why it is proposed to make this alteration.

The Committee, however, has substituted for the words "" a t t h e time of the adoption of these orders "" the specific date, "" 1st January, 1901."" I quite understand that no really serious alteration is involved in that change; but I do not know exactly what the use of the word ""practice"" implies. so.

Strong representations have been made privately to me by honourable members who are anxious to support the passing of the Standing Orders that they require time for further consideration in order to satisfy themselves as to certain of the principal Orders. I have communicated with Mr Speaker, who considers that he would not be debarred from taking part in a discussion upon rules of procedure, which must necessaiily affect the whole House.

101,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"I wish tocoming elections. I have been speaking to some of the officers of the Electoral Branch in regard to the matter, and I find that there is a disposition to be somewhat niggardly in providing for polling booths. It must be remembered that during the forthcoming elections there will be twice as many voters in Victoria at least as there have been on previous occasions, of whom more than half will be women. A mile may not be very far for a man to walk to record his vote, but it is a long distance for a woman to go, and women can hardly be expected to ride fifteen or twenty miles, as men have been accustomed to do in country districts. If the elections are to give a true make a suggestion in regard not so much reflex of the opinions of the people of Australia, we must afford every facility for the recording of votes by both men and women. I hope therefore that the Government will not, in order to save a few pounds, put any obstacle in the way of obtaining the fullest voting possible. I understand that there is also a disposition to be a little too economical in regard to the appointment of assistant returning officers. If all the votes cast in a division venience of voting by post. It has been are to be brought to one booth to be counted, the announcement of the result of the election will in many cases be delayed for a week after the polling day. To obtain expedition, more assistant returning officers must be appointed, and the Government should not stand in the way of a speedy announcement of results. With regard to the day upon which the elections should be held, the popular view seems to be that Saturday should be chosen. I have no objection to Saturday, but I wish to point out that if the elections are held on that day, the poll clerks and others engaged in the scrutiny will have to stop work at midnight, and begin again on Monday morning, so that that may cause the postponement of announcements of some of the results until at least Tuesday. If these two or three points are taken into consideration by the Government, they will greatly facilitate the administration of the Act. W it h regard to the suggestion of the honorof practical experience should be appointed, able member for Bland, I would point out that some days ago I spoke of the advisability of preparing a short statement for the information of electors. I feel sure that it will be a good tning to adopt such a course. The provisions of our Electoral Act are so stringent that full information should be supplied to the public regarding them, so that they may be advised of the exact nature of the offences which they might otherwise be liable to commit. I hope that the Minister will see that the matter is attended to as early as possible. I hope, too, that timely notice will be given of the dates of nomination and polling. The Act contains certain provisions regarding State members, and we do not wish anything to be done which may cause them to feel a grievance against us. We do not wish them to be able to say that they had not sufficient time in which to send in their resignations. to the day as the date of the elections. I suggest that the elections should not be held upon a date too close to Christmas, because a considerable displacement of population takes place during the holiday season. Many thousands of people then leave the district which I represent, and spend their holidays in the coastal districts; and, if the elections are too long deferred, they will be disfranchised, or will be put to the inconsuggested that the elections should be held on 17 th December, but that would be toolate. Referring to the day upon which the elections should take place, I may point out that the practice in South Australia for many years has been to hold the elections oa Saturday, and that the results have been satisfactory. A large number of working men are free on Saturday afternoons, whereas if the polling takes place upon an ordinary day they have to obtain permission from their employers before they can go away to record their votes. stand that it is intended to appoint postal officials as returning officers in the various States. I have nothing to say against that proposal, except that the officers may not have the necessary experience to enable them satisfactorily to conduct the elections.
