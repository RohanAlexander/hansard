However, the March quarter is generally low and there is no indication in this quarter'sfiguresthat inflation does not still remain the most significant economic problem for the nation. There is no sign yet that the nation and the community can diminish any efforts that can be made to reduce inflation. The figure for the March quarter is much influenced by the continuing moderation in increases in price of food, clothing and even housing. However, there is still an uncomfortably large increase in the price of most manufactured goods and in other goods with a high labour content.

House of the implication of these decisions and what action can be taken to ensure that natural jusuce is available to aU? doubt came to the attention of the honourable member. I think they appeared in the 'National Times' over the weekend. It is disturbing to read that decisions of that sort have been taken at times in the past by police officers in charge of people in custody. I think it should be said as well-thi s would be known to members of the profession in the House, particularly those who have practised criminal law in the past-that there has been a certain lack of enthusiasm sometimes on the part of prison officers and indeed police officers charged with the care of people in custody when lawyers wanting to speak to people in custody ask permission to do so. One assumes that the thinking of the police is that the lawyer might in some manner get in the way. I have noticed with some pleasure that in recent years that tendency on the part of police officers has diminished. As far as the Blacktown Austrahan Legal Aid Office is concerned, it is correct that the duty lawyer service at the Blacktown Magistrates Court was suspended for some 2 months from August 1974 after pohce authorities strictly enforced a police instruction limiting access to the cells. However, the duty lawyer service has been operating satisfactorily since about October 1974 with the assistance of the presiding magistrate, who announces to unrepresented persons, particularly those in custody, that the duty lawyer is available to help them. The Blacktown police have co-operated in arranging for the duty lawyer to see persons in custody who seek the services of the duty lawyer, either by approaching the police or after the magistrate has drawn theh attention to the duty lawyer service.

29,Mr Beazley,"In AustraUa there are 7600in December last we increased the grants to all non-government schools$79m, while trying to maintain the purchasing power of the Karmel grants to all schools, as the honourable gentleman has said. The funding in relation to that scheme has been enacted by the Parliament for 2 years. The kind of issues the honourable gentleman has raised should now be raised with the Schools Commission, which will be making its recommendations to the Parliament shortly for funding over the next triennium. I doubt whether I will be able to carry out any changes at the present time. The honourable gentleman will recall that we raised the grants to schools from $112m in the last biennium of the McMahon Government to $780m in the present biennium. I doubt whether the grants will be increased much further. I agree with the honourable gentleman that there are those sorts of problems. I think that the bodies concerned should raise them with the Schools Commission. That is the kind of evidence it is now seeking. the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of the cash Uquidity shortage affecting Western AustraUan clothing manufacturers situated in the metropoUtan area of Perth? Is he aware that the clothing industry employs 10 per cent to 12 per cent of all female workers engaged in manufacturing industry in Western AustraUa? Is the Treasurer aware that if the cash liquidity is not established it could lead to further retrenchments in this field? Can he give an assurance that the matter will be investigated with a view to giving assistfull agreement between the Government and the ance in order to prevent further unemployment in that industry? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-From time to time. I have received a number of representations and reports about the situation of the clothing industry in Western Australia. These have been examined by the Department of Manufacturing Industry for which my colleague in another place, Senator James McClelland, is responsible. I think that the position of the industry in Western Australia is a little more difficult than that of the industry in general. It suffers partly from the overaU shortage of working capital, which as I said in answer to a question a few minutes ago was partly a result of the reduction in the money supply last year and at the end of 1973 and which was picked up again by the change in policy and improvement in the money supply that took place after the third quarter of last year. Therefore, a good deal has been done directly to improve the money supply and the supply of working capital. The banks are now lending at rates which are a record compared with the rates which have been applying for quite some time. Most industries that are viable are receiving the capital they need. In respect of the clothing industry in particular, for some time it has been believed and asserted that one of its main difliculties is imports. Imports have been quite severely controlled. Quantities have been applied in practically every area as a result of the Government's recognition of the fact that impons were oversupplied. A great deal has been done to assist the industry directly. I think it is a very arguable question whether more should be done. The question of whether further assistance to the industry in Western Australia or to any other part of the industry could be justified would have to be preceded by an adequate inquiry by the Temporary Assistance Authority. Should this be the case, I assure the honourable member that the matter will be referred to the Department of Manufacturing Industry with a view to deciding whether reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority should be made. expect his poUcies to overcome the record unemployment in Australia? Has the Minister for Social Security distributed a paper which differs from the Treasurer's analysis of the economic crisis and proposes different solutions? Finally, can he give the House an assurance that there is Reserve Bank on monetary policy? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-I have answered the latter part of the right honourable gentleman's question three or fourtimesin the last week. There is no disagreement at all between the Reserve Bank and the Government. Most of the right honourable gentleman's questions are based on newspaper reports written by journalists who are trying to interpret my views and state what is happening but who have never made any reference to me. Mr Anderson of the 'Sun Herald' and Mr Haupt of the 'Australian Financial Review' have written page after page interpreting my views and saying what is happening in my vicinity but neither of those gentlemen has ever come to ask me one word about my policy, what is my interpretation of economics or what is happening in or around my office.

Did the honourable gentleman fly to Queensland some months ago to discuss with the Queensland Treasurer such additional financial assistance as would be necessary to maintain existing levels of State services and State Government employment? Has the Treasurer seen statements made by Mr Lee, the Queensland Works Minister, and other Ministers, that due to pohcies of the Australian Government a number of State and local authority employees would have theh services terminated throughout most areas of the State? Knowing as I do the competence of my former colleagues in the Queensland Treasury, can the Treasurer explain whether these Queensland ministerial statements are factual? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-It is true that before the recent meeting of PremiersI did go to Queensland and I had a lengthy conference with Sir Gordon Chalk and his officers in Brisbane. He, together with his officers, put forward a submission detailing the requirements of the Government of Queensland to maintain employment in State services and with local authorities. I assured the Queensland Treasurer that it was the intention of the Australian Government to provide adequate finance to ensure that employment levels of State governments and local authorities would be maintained. The details given by Sir Gordon Chalk at the time indicated that he was submitting to me a full statementa full requirement-to achieve those purposes. At the Premiers' Conference in Canberra on refugees, there have been some categories which 14 February Queensland was granted $47.5m have been approved. I would point out, however, for the specific purpose of maintaining levels of as I have pointed out before, that the Governemployment as I have just mentioned. This was ment of South Vietnam has for years diseverything Queensland had asked for; in fact, it couraged the people from leaving the country, was more than Queensland had asked for.

Since then Queensland has received more URBAN FREEWAYS: ENVIRONMENTAL than $20m in other specific employment-creating grants.

These statements indicate urban freeways, is directed to the Minister for that the submissions made to me by Sir Gordon Urban and Regional Development. Is the MinisChalk were not adequate, were inaccurate or ter aware that the environmental impact inquiry were insufficient. I cannot believe that that is the being conducted into Victoria's proposed F19 case because the Queensland Treasurer was freeway does not allow proper evaluation of the notified a fortnight before what we wanted from him and he had adequatetimeto provide it. He expressed his own complete satisfaction at the response of the Australian Government to what he had submitted. I think that if there are now any jobs in jeopardy it should be the responsibility of Mr Lee, Mr Hinze and other Ministers to explain it to us directly and not to conduct a newspaper campaign which is, I think, their main purpose. If there are any deficiencies in Queensland or in any other StateI would expect, as the Treasurer of this country, to receive notification of them first, not through a newspaper headline. It seems to me that the Queensland Ministers are mainly concerned with playing pohtics. I think there are some Ministers in the Queensland Government who do nothing else but play politics. They do not care what happens to the people involved as long as they get political advantage out of it. I think that the present outburst by these Queensland Ministers is an example of that. proved categories of persons from South Vietnam to be admitted into Austraha as refugees?

69,Mr Enderby,". . . the practice in the Australianhe could get away with that. He thought 'That is fair enough; I am going to have a welling up of opinion in the Australian Capital Territory among all the pot smokers'; and that the rest of his friends would be saying 'Good on you, Kep, this is sane government'. But that was not to be because on 10 April the newspaper in this city, the 'Canberra Times', had an article headed: ' Misleading reply on ACT drugs'. It said: The Attorney-General, Mr Enderby, made a misleading statement in a written reply to a question on notice on prosecuted under the Customs Act? Will there be Tuesday. Then it said: Sources in the Attorney-General's Depanment said yesterday that a person possessing marihuana would be reported to the legal adjudication . . . I would like to know with whom the Attorney General discussed the answer he gave to me before he gave it to the Clerk. Surely to goodness he discussed it with the Attorney-General's Department. If he did, did the Attorney General's Department disown him the next day or was this simply a statement the Attorney General made himself after discussing the matter with a few of his trendy friends in Cabinet. I do not think he did even that. With the regularity with which we find some of these trendy people in the Press gallery constantly in offices of Ministers, one wonders where the Minister is seeking his advice on such a matter. Then on 15 April the Minister himself burst into print and criticised me for becoming hysterical about it. I certainly did not say the things about floodgates which the Press reported me as saying. I make this aside, Mr Speaker: It never ceases to amaze me how some of these people in the Press gallery ring us on the telephone asking for a quotation and, when we give it to them, put something in quotation marks, attributed to us, that never passed from our lips. However, I have not time to deal with that. The Attorney-General said: The fact that no prosecutions have taken place here for the external affairs power to impact and improve sometimeprobably would have gone unnoticed were it not for politicians like Mr Chipp trying to get on a bandwaggon and get their name in the papers. I am terribly sorry; I apologise to the Attorney General. He was trying to bring about a change in the law in a sneaky, underhand way and in contempt of Parhament, and I found him out and brought it to the notice of the Parliament. I am terribly sorry. I am supposed to apologise for that. He operates to a set of standards, which I certainly do not accept. But the mere fact of having a law in the Australian Capital Territory different from the law enforced by the Customs Department when people returned from overseas in possession of products of the plant cannabis, apparently escaped the Attorney General. Does he seriously want people to believe that he sees no reason to alter the practice in the Austrahan Capital Territory-that it is all right for people in Canberra to possess marihuana with immunity from prosecution? Will some poor devil who gets off a plane from Bali with 3 or 4 joints on him be arrested and 2 standards under the one Government and within the one department? This is the absurd situation which has been reached. My friend, the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) brought the matter to a head again last Thursday when he asked whether the Attorney-General knew some of the danger signals of marihuana. The Attorney-General gave a most extraordinary answer. On the front bench it is sometimes difficult to hear full answers given by Ministers. The Attorney-General is sometimes even a httle more incoherent than some of his colleagues. Sometimes his answers are hard to pick up. I am indebted to a very astute journalist in the Press Gallery, Mr Laurie Oakes, who heard the Attorney-General's answer on the microphone and brought it to my attention. When one reads the Hansard report what the Attorney-General said last Thursday was highly significant. He said he would do 2 things: He would introduce the International Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances into this Parliament for ratificationI thought it was strange that he answered my friend, the honourable member for Kennedy, in that way and I missed his next few words-and he would change the laws in relation to marihuana and cannabis which would then have an over-riding effect on the States. To me this is an example of the most blackguardly impertinence I have ever heard from this Government. By introducing this Treaty ratification into the Parliament the Government could then, as I understand it, use its laws and regulations on to the States. When I was Minister for Customs and Excise we had many conferences with the State Ministers of Health and theh officers, with the State Attorney-General's Departments and with every expert we could find to determine whether marihuana was a dangerous drug and what was the best thing to do for the people of Australia. Only after conferences did we reach agreement and decide on uniform drug laws. But this Ministerthis Government-is simply going to have this Parliament ratify this treaty and then pass some law decriminalising marihuana or legalising it, or making it an offence equal to selling sly grog and impact that on every State government. That law will apply to everybody in the country. If the Minister believes that pot should be decriminalised or that it is harmless-it is a respectable view but one with which I do not agree-and if he wants to change the law, why does he not come into this Parliament and introduce legislation and let it be debated? Why does he not seek expert advice from people in the field? As recently as a few months ago, there was not one police force in Austraha and not one drug squad on any police forceI am including the Narcotics Bureau in addition to the 6 State pohce forces and the Commonwealth Police. Force-whic h would have recommended to the Minister the lowering of penalties in the way he proposes. I have not time to go into all the clinical eviThere was nothing incorrect in the answer which dence. AllI am saying is that cannabis sativa in its 3 forms-marihuana , the drug from the flower; hashish, the drug from the resin in the stem; and a third dangerous drug, liquid hashish or hashish oil which is an extract of hashish forty been a pohcy in the Australian Capital Territory times stronger than marihuana and possessing a very high content of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol-is a dangerous hallucinogenic drug. Does the Attorney-General mean to legalise that too or to reduce the penalties for possessing the drug? I ask him not to think that he can simply change the laws relating to use and possession without it having an effect on the pushers. If he makes the quantity for use 40 joints, then any pusher can come to Canberra or anywhere else and have 4000 joints in a hole in a garage or somewhere else, and as long as he does not have 40 joints on him at any one time he is immune from prosecution. All he could be charged with is that equivalent to a traffic offence. I have evidence from experts showing the danger signals about cannabis. I ask that the Minister think carefully before he proceeds. Order! The honourable member's time has The facts are pretty clear.

They get sick and tired of wastfeaturesMr ChippI do not apologise for that. honourable member apologise for being associated with the debate, because it is one that has been active in the community for many years and he has played a prominent part in it. WhatI suggest to the honourable member is that the emotion which he brings to bear on this occasion and over the last week is not warranted. He inflames the passions which are aroused when the emotional subject such as drugs and what should be done about drugs in a modern community is debated. By fanning the passions in that way, the honourable member also contributes to the hypocrisy and the double standards which exist in our community in relation to drugs. He criticised the answer I gave. He drew attention to the fact that the circumstances which were dealt with in that answer related not to the time when I was Attorney-General, but to a previous period-principall y last year in 1974. But may I just correct the honourable member. I gave him. In reply to the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) the other day, I went into a great deal more detail about the matter. The simple facts are that for sometimethere has by the pohce of the Australian Capital Territory not to arrest people who are found merely in possession of cannabis. As I have said in this House on previous occasions, there have been exceptions to this and a prosecution did take place, as I recollect it and on the advice given to me, in about October 1974. But that does not detract from the fact that the Australian Capital Territory Police on their own initiative, without any instructions, as I have said over and over again and I beheve the facts are correct, did not arrest people when they found them in possession of cannabis and not trafficking in the substance. Mr ChippI do not believe it. can say that he does not believe it. He keeps asserting a position and in doing so he is comber should search the record.

They would not convict, perhaps because of changing social attitudes. This is a controversial matter. Whether it is an instruction from authorities in New South Wales or not, I do not know; it is not my concern, although of course it is a mathonourable members to illustrate the point that I ter of interest. But the simple fact is that prosecutions do not take place and have not taken place for sometimein New South Wales for that particular crime. They could not get convictions, and there is an interesting philosophical point in151 grams of heroin-that is a hard drug-the volved because that is often a way in which the law tends to be changed. Juries-and indeed magistrates are as capable ofit as juries-ten d to make a certain finding on the facts and the law, and that throws the matter back into the lawmaker's court. The lawmaker then decides either to change the law or not to change it, but in the course of this process reform takes place which is more in accord with changing social attitudes. Those are the simple facts of the situation in the Australian Capital Territory, and it has never been said otherwise by the honourable member for Hotham. The unsatisfactory state of the legislation in relation to the definition has made the enforcement in the Australian Capital Territory of the laws relating to marihuana a difficult task for police. May I go on and talk about a wider issue, beof Miss F, for the importation of 1517 grams of cause the marihuana debate does continue. This cannabis, a fine of $300 was imposed, with a.stay Government does have international obligations of one month to pay; she was given time to pay. on the subject, as the honourable member for In the case of Mr G, for having in possession 7.9 Hotham has pointed out.

There is an obligation on the Governcharges concerning the importation of 1673 ment to give effect to those conventions and it is grams of cannabis, the penalty was 2 years an obligation that the Government intends to imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to honour. I draw attention to some of the defects be served concurrently. that exist in the present situation. For example, does the honourable member appreciate the enormously diverse penalties that are imposed people for offences they take into account more upon people who come before the courts on drug than simply the amount and nature of the drug. offences? These diverse penalties are imposed They take into account any previous recordeither because people appear before different form, as lawyers call it-and other surrounding magistrates, which is a circumstance difficult to circumstances. They take into account the age of change, or because they appear charged with the accused and the general circumstances. One offences under different laws-Australia n laws could go through the files on cases of this sortbeing fragmented in this way. I have the task and honourable members will appreciate that I from time to time-it is a regular task of any cannot put them all before the House-and find a Attorney-General-of deciding whether or not a remarkable degree of similarity in offences and person in custody should be released on either find this enormous disparity in penalties-heavy parole or licence. I am appalled when I read the handedness on one side and complete softness of facts that lead to some magistrates or some approach, leniency, turning a blind eye, on the judges putting people in gaol for greatly differing other. I put to honourable members that there is periods of time or imposing greatly differing levels of penalty, pursuant to different laws. Surely this is a mischief that has to be putrightin Australia in this overall context. There is nottimefor me to go through all the cases but I can extract one or two to read to have in mind. I will not use the names of the persons accused or convicted; most of them were young people, a feature of the situation that is disturbing in itself. Case A, for the importation of penalty was a $500 good behaviour bond. I repeat that for the importation of 151 gramsa lot of heroina good behaviour bond was considered sufficient. In case B, for the importation of 34 grams of heroin another $500 good behaviour bond was the penalty. In case C, for the importation of 11 grams of heroin 6Vi years imprisonment with hard labour was imposed. In case D, for the importation of3741 grams of cannabis-the so-called soft drug, the one that is often said to be less harmful than alcohol and certainly less harmful than nicotinea fine of $500 was imposed. In the case of Miss E, for having in possession prohibited imports, 1537 grams of cannabis-agai n presumably for trafficking, but it is the soft drug, the one that is said to be harmless2 years 5 months imprisonment with hard labour was imposed on each charge, the sentences to be served concurrently. In the case I appreciate that when magistrates convict a case to standardise and bring some degree of order into a chaotic situation. Indeed, one could go on and one must say that the whole approach of the community to drug taking should not be confined to seeing the problem through the eyes of the criminal law. Certainly in the case of users, Everingham) and myself-and I emphasise the certainly in the cases of dependent persons, the persons who are caught on a drug, as far as possible one should treat them as cases of sickness, as for anyone concerned with the criminal law-is cases where medical and hospital attention is required rather than threats to put them in gaol, although one should bring to bear the full power of the criminal law against the trafficker, against against the trafficker, against the exploiter of the person who exploits somebody in a vulnerable situation of this sort. The honourable member for Hotham does no one any service at all when he recklessly alleges that the Government wants to decriminalise the laws relating to marihuana. the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr than a suggestion, although I do not mind giving Katter) the other day that there would be it to the right honourable member-is for penalreduced penalties under the proposition that was ties of 25 years imprisonment and $100,000 fine. being considered. me. with this recklessness and this hysteria time and tremely severe indeed.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 April on motion by Mr Charles Jones: That the Bill be now read a second time. suggestion that a Bill to re-establish the InterState Commission would be introduced in this month's sitting of the Parliament appeared in a newspaper article on 3 April. The Prime Minister( Mr Whidam) made an announcement about it on 7 April and the Bill was introduced into this House on 9 April. Now-1 2 days later-the Government has brought on this Bill for full debate through all of its stages. It is rushing the Bill trade. Section 92 has been a stumbling block for through the Parliament. As it stands this Bill represents the most blatant attempt that the Government had made to gain control over industry and trade in Australia. The Bill seeks to create a commission that will exercise supreme power in those areas. It embodies far reaching and sweeping changes not only in the field of transport but also over the entire range of industry and production in this country. Yet the Bill is being steamrolled through the Parliament before the pubhc has an opportunity to learn of its contents. The Opposition believes that the measures contained in this Bill are too imponant to be rushed through the Parliament without proper scrutiny and pubUc consideration. The Opposition wishes to defer the Bill until the next session because it is much wider than a Bill dealing only with transpon matters. I remind the House that in his Speech at the opening of Parliament the Governor General stated that the Inter-State Commission would plan and provide means of communication between the States. The Commission which is proposed in this BiU deals not only with transpon but also the whole range of trade and commerce in Australia. The draftsman's skill has been taxed to its limit and the provisions of the Constitution have been stretched beyond theh proper meaning in order to bring forth a piece of legislation which is horrendous in its scope and potentially ruinous in its effect on all trade and commerce in AustraUa. With the passage of this BUl the creeping octopus of sociaUsm would no longer be Umited in its advance but would be brought into the open and embodied in this institution which the Government is asking this Parliament to create. The Commission will be in reality a device by which complete Federal Government control may be brought about in this country. Secuon 101 of the Constitution states: There shall be an Inter-State Comniission, with such powers as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce. . . . Although under the Constitution the Commonwealth has been granted power over trade and commerce between the States, and with overseas countries, section 92 of the Constitution states that trade, commerce and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free. Thus the Commonwealth's power over trade does not extend to intra-State trade and may not be exercised in such a way as to impair the freedom of interstate the repeated attempts to restrict, curtaU or control interstate trade. It is the one section of the Constitution upon which private enterprise in AustraUa has been able to rely in order to resist the encroachments of governments, both State and Commonwealth. The attempt to nationalise the pubhc banks in 1947 foundered on section 92. In replying to a question asked of him in the House last week the Prime Mimster compared the proposed Inter-State Commission with the American Inter-State Commerce Commission. It is clear that the present BUl has been modelled on the United States Commission. However it should be remembered that the United States Constitution contains no provision equivalent to our section 92. The Opposition is confident that the High Court of Australia will uphold the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce, especially the freedom of trade guaranteed by section 92. However, there is a danger that the High Court will be so snowed under with litigation that many of the actions of the Commission will go unchecked.

That imposes an intolerable strain on the Constitution. It is part of the policy of the Government to undermine the whole constitutional framework of government as it exists in Australia. One of the major ways in which the BiU would alter the constitutional balance of power is in its effect on the States. The Bill contains provisions which would undermine the authority of a State over transport within that State. The Bill would practically take control of road transport and the raUways out of the hands of the States. Furthermore, the Bill would also create confusion as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The BiU contains provisions which would mean that decisions or actions of the Inter-State Commission would override the decisions of all other statutory authorities, including the Prices Justification clause 3 (2) a service is defined in such a way as Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission.

We purchased outright. The scope of this provision is know that this Bill is the brain-child of the Prime breathtaking in its width. It would allow GovernMinister. Why does the Prime Minister not come ment control not only of all transport in Australia into the House and defend his own handiwork but also of the faciUties associated with it. instead of sending in the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) as a front man? If this Comdoes it distinguish between private transport and mission were to proceed as proposed the Minispublic transport. I use the phrase 'private ter for Transport would be in charge of an transport' in the sense that every person who adminstrative backwater in a Department with owns a motor car or other vehicle for personal or no policy capacity. I would now like to turn to the Bill and to Commission. As it stands, the BUl does not preexamine some of its provisions in detail. The devent the Commission from controIUng, if it finition of 'goods' as contained in clause 3(1) wished to do so, any private citizen who drives shows how the Government is attempting to conhis motor car from one State to another. There trol not only transport but also the whole area of are other clauses in the BUl which are so wide trade and commerce. The definition includes not that the Commission is permitted to exercise merely ships, aircraft and vehicles but also minpowers and undertake functions which ParUaerals, petroleum and gas. Transport is an integral ment has never permitted any other single body part of trade, but the concept of trade is larger to have. I have already mentioned the power than only transport. It involves goods as well. granted to the Commission in clause 13 (1) to The reference in the definition to minerals and petroleum is an obvious attempt to use the InterState Commission to control the production and movement of those resources. Similarly the definitions of'inter-State transport' and 'overseas transport' contain the phrase 'transport of goods . . . that are the subject of such trade or commerce'. The meaning of those words is ambiguous, but it would appear that theh intention is to enable the Commission to exercise powers of control over goods which are the subject of trade at every stage of their extraction, production and manufacture. The draftsman is clearly attempting to use the subject matter of transport as a means of reaching back to control every stage of the trading process. Such an attempt is clearly not permissible. Clause3 (2) of the BUl contains a definition of what is a service which is probably the most blatant example of the fact that this Commission is really intended to embrace much more. In would allow the Inter-State Commission to control all matters connected with transport, such as the ancUlary services which are essential to transportation. Thus the repair and servicing of vehicles, ships and aeroplanes and even the provision of fuel suppUes would be within the control of the Commission. The clause also permits the control of all facUities connected with Another feature of this BUl is that nowhere famUy transport wiU be subject to the Inter-State override the determinations of other tribunals estabhshed by Acts of this Parliament. Clause 13 (1) also permits the Commission 'to exercise all or any of the powers . . . of any authority . . . under any law of Australia'. In other words, the Commission may take over the functions of the Australian National Airlines Commission or operate an airline. This, in combination with the power granted to the Commission in clause 17 to prevent any person engaging in interstate transport without the licence or consent of the Commission, would mean effectively an end to the 2-airlines policy. The Commission has power under clause 13(1) to take over the operations of the Australian National Line. There is no provision for the Commission in the exercise of its powers to be subject to the power of the Minister or even of Parliament. Once this legislation is passed, an all-powerful and supreme body will have been created which will exercise its wide powers without reference to the wishes of the Government of the day or of this Parliament. The powers vested in this Commission are wider than any which have been granted to another body in Australia. It is true that the Constitution provides for the existence of tested previously before the High Court of an interstate commission, but the Commission which this Bill proposes to establish is far beyond life of the Interstate Commmission from 1912 to the spirit and intention of the Constitution. The Government is attempting to establish by indirect means a body which the Constitution never contemplated. The Opposition believes that the need exists for a body which will have power to regulate transport in Australia within the limitations proTransport late in September 1974. For these vided for in the Constitution. The Constitution gives the Commonwealth power over interstate and overseas transport, but the Commonwealth must not exercise its power over interstate trade in such a manner as would restrict, curtail or coninformation to be circulated on this very importrol interstate trade. There is a considerable amount of judicial authority to support the view that the Commonwealth has power to regulate interstate and overseas transport, and the extent of this power of regulation is quite adequate to permit the planned and co-ordinated development of transport services in Australia. The Opposition would support a Bill to create an interstate commission which was intended to be a regulatory body in the field of transport. It must be remembered that the Constitution contemplates as the functions of such a commission the execution and maintenance of the provisions relating to trade and commerce. Since the States have been left with control over intrastate trade and transport, a commission exercising power of regulation and advice would be a purely federal body in the sense that its functions would be to uphold the Constitutional provisions as they relate both to State and Commonwealth powers over transport. Such a commission would be in line with the spirit and intention of the Constitution. The Commission proposed in this Bill is not a body which is truly federal in its nature. Rather, it is an attempt to use the Constitutional provisions to create a commission which will be an arm of the central Government in its conquest not only of the States but also of all transport and trading activity in Australia. If the Government wants to show its bona fides in its wish to create an interstate commission for which the Constitution provides and which will exercise regulatory power over transport in a manner which is truly in keeping with the federal nature of the Constitution, the Opposition will support such legislation. But this Bill departs in horrendous fashion from the words used in the Governor General's Speech that a commission would be for the purpose of providing a means of communication between the States. It endeavours to sneak in by the back door provisions that were Australia and negated by that court during the 1920. The Bill is a monster, and the Minister is being used as a dumb stalking horse for its introduction. The Bill in no way parallels the findings of the private seminar run by the Department of reasons the Opposition proposes to seek the agreement of the Government to allow the Bill to lie on the table until the Budget session. This will allow pubhc discussion and debate and proper tant and vital Bill. Failing acceptance of its amendment, the Opposition will be forced to oppose the Bill as a measure of its dismay and horror at the pressure tactics of the Government on this important BiU. I will then seek to move a number of amendments in the Committee stage to bring some sense of reality and common sense to the measure. I make it clear that the amendments are not final and may be added to in another place, but they reflect the concern of the State governments which have made representations to me, the Road Transport Division which has made representations to me, and the shipping and airline companies in Australia and the other bodies that have made representations to me. I now move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and not proceeded with until after presentation of the Budget to enable the principles era of coaches, river boats, buUock drays and the of the Bill to be more fully investigated'. the amendment seconded? Mr HydeI second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. years since December 1972 when I became a member of this Parliament I have heard the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) address himself to a number of Bills in this chamber. I have taken note of some of the phrases and chches that he has used on many previous occasions. He has referred to 'pressure tactics', 'blatant', 'horrendous',' steam-rollered 'octopus of socialism', 'monster', 'defer, defer, delay'. Surely those words could not have been applicable to all the legislation to which he has addressed himself. I put it to honourable members that this is again just the hackneyed, stereotyped delivery which is the general attitude of members of the Austrahan Country Party to legislation brought before this chamber. The Inter-State Commission was first mooted been modified to the extent nowadays that it is in 1898-7 7 years ago. Surely that gave the Opnow charged with the responsibiUty of developposition some notice of the possibility ofan intering, co-ordinating and preserving a national state commission being created by this Governtransport system by water, highway and rail, as ment. In his policy speech last May the Prime well as by other means, adequate to meet the Minister( Mr Whitlam) said that in 1974 an needs of the commerce of the United States, of interstate commission would be established.

It is obvious that that Party supports the inequities and Commission BiU 1975, seeks to re-estabUsh the the inadequacies of the hotch potch, present Inter-state Commission in accordance with the unplanned system of transport in this country. provision of the Constitution. As the Minister What the honourable member for Gippsland is emphasised in his second reading speech, when really putting forward is a case for the march presenting the BUl, it is the Australian Governback to colonialism of the last century. If the ment's intention that the Commission operate fears which he expressed are well founded, why under its provisions solely in the field of does he not take the matter to the High Court transport. Section 101 of the Constitution states: after the legislauon is passed? The clear majority of the members of the High Court were powers appointed by his own Government, his prededeems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within cessors. Or is he afraid, and is the Country Party the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution afraid, of the impartiaUty of the High Court in relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made these matters? Because of the vastness of our thereunder. land and the relatively enormous distances beSection 102 goes on to state: tween our population centres and between the location of resources and markets, transport costs commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimiare a vital factor in our national economic structure. It is imperative to our development as a nation that we have not only an efficient transport system embracing the various modes of transport but that we have also a system that is coordinated, and that access on an equitable basis is available to all who require to use it. Since the fledgling railway systems, when our Constitution was drafted and adopted by the 6 colonial States, we have seen the proUferation of differing means of transport, in many respects unco-ordinated, with discriminatory pricing and access in terms of trade, that have resulted in many unnecessary costs being built into our transport arrangements. If we are to develop as a nation in the world of trade then, above all, we must have a coordinated, efficient and accessible transport. The Founding Fathers foresaw the need when they drew up the Constitution and they provided for it by means of sections 102, 103 and 104 of the Constitution, in addition to section 101. The interstate commission they envisaged was modelled largely on the commission created in the United Kingdom by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, which was designed to prevent unjust charges and ensure rights of through traffic amongst private railway systems. They were also influenced by the United States Interstate Commerce Commission of 1887, which has The BiU before the House, the Inter-state There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such of adjudication and administration as the Parliament The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or nation by any State, or by any authonty constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue or unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to thefinancialresponsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways.

Those men of and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State from other States. The attitude of the Austrahan Labor Party towards the establishment of an interstate commission is firm and clear. The Launceston Federal Conference of our Party resolved, in June 1971, that an Austrahan Labor Government would 'estabhsh the Inter-State Commission to co-ordinate all types of interstate transport in Austraha including rail, road, ah, water and pipelines and to regulate conditions of carriage'. In December 1972 a majority of Austrahans supported our campaign policy, and in that campaign the Prime Minister( Mr Whidam) said in his pohcy speech: The Inter-State Commission was intended to end the centralisationfosteredby all State governments through thenrailway systems. It should now provide not onlyforthe coordination of our mainland railway systems and our major ports in the period before the Commonwealth, like other federal governments, inevitably takes responsibility for railways interest. More recently, in fact last year, the Brisand ports; it is the ideal instrumentforco-ordinating our major roads and airways and pipelines. A Federal Labor Government will prompdy restore the machinery the Constitution intended and vest it with the Commonwealth's full constitutional powers to plan and provide modern means of communication between the States. In his pohcy speech in April 1974 the Prime Minister further stated: 'The Government will re-establish the Commission this year'. This Bill is the fulfilment of those policy promises, albeit a little later than had been hoped initially. It is appropriate to recall that the Founding Fathers envisaged the future progress of the 6 States of Austraha as along the course to a strong, independent, national outlook and possibly to the creation of more States within the federation as the population grew. I suppose it is understandable that in the years since Federation constituent States should tend towards State parochialism, but that in no way excuses the paranoia of the present non-Labor Premiers whose policies and endeavours fly in the face of the development of a strong, independent, national outlook. The continual tirade of abuse against this Federal Government that emanates particularly from Premier Court and Premier Bjelke-Petersen can only retard the progress of Australia. Then attitudes herald a march backwards to the States of the nineteenth century, whose governments realised the disadvantages of not having a co-ordinated national transport system for our vast island continent. The gallant, lone Liberal Prime Minister who strove to place the national and overall interests of Austraha before the by his own party coUeagues and theh machinemen at State level, and the faceless men of prithe State governments at the end of last century hoped that by enshrining sections 101 to 104 of the Federal Constitution they would ensure the creation of a continuing Inter-State Commission. The fact that the original Inter-State Commission was allowed to wither and die until the 1912 Act wasfinaUyabolished by the Menzies Government in 1950, resulted in unnecessary and incalculable costs being inflicted on our transport systems since 1920. However, in 1959-only 9 years after the abolition of the 1912 Act and during the administration of a later Menzies Government-the Constitutional Review Committee recommended the re-establishment of the Commission. The Committee recommended also that the Commonwealth ParUament should have an express power to make laws on restrictive trade practices found by the Commission to be contrary to public bane Chamber of Commerce, backed by the Department of Economics at the Queensland University, in a submission to the Queensland Government advocated re-estabUshment of the Inter-State Commission to regulate transport, both interstate and intrastate, so as to overcome the anomaUes and inefficiencies which existed in abundance as a result of State regulation of the transport sector. Subsequently, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, at its conference in May 1974, adopted unanimously the following resolution, following the discussion paper on the adverse effects of State regulation in transport industries: Conference asks council of management to consider the desirability of setting up an Inter-State Commission, as provided for under section 101 of the Australian Constitution but only for the purpose of properly co-ordinating and regulating with the maximum economic efficiency the distributive service industries so far as they relate to land, sea and air transport. The editorial of the 'Australian Financial Review' of 8 April 1975 refers to the need for an authority clothed with unqualified constitutional powers to correct the many anomalies of the present transport scene and makes particular reference to the chaotic development of our ports that has occurred. The Brisbane Chamber of Commerce was able to show in its submission that, as a result of intrastate taxes on road transport in Queensland and because there was no interstate road transport tax, freight rates from Adelaide to Mount Isa were cheaper than from Toowoomba to Mount Isa despite the fact that Toowoomba is 715 miles closer to Mount Isa than to Adelaide. What clearer case can there be than that for the co-ordination of an equitable, efficient system of transport facilities and rates on a basis of nauonai interest and equity? Another effect of the lack of a national, coregional development and regional planning, ordinated system of transport facilities can be and hence have an important influence on seen in the Hunter region and the port of Newefficient pubhc and private investment.

He side and to the Minister in particular that if the said in his second reading speech: idea has been around so long why is it that we have to make a final decision in 12 days on the form of the legislation? If it is so tremendously to the trade and commerce provisions and laws made important, if it has been such a high priority in thereunder. the Government's legislative program, why was these provisions other than in the field of transport. it not brought in earher? Why are we not being given propertimeto digest this legislation? The legislation is argued for on the basis that it mission will be a body to whom people can take complaints, a body to whom the man in the streetI think that is the expression used in the Minister's second reading speech-ca n go along with the large corporations of the nation to have a problem resolved or adjudicated upon. I put it to the Minister that one way in which he can enlist the aid of the man in the street is by not confusing him. If there is one thing this Government is doing it is confusing the people with the plethora of commissions it is establishing. This is the second commission about which the Government has talked in a definitive form in the last 10 days. Last week reference was made to a conThe commercial impact of this legislation is the better. That ought to be the aim of a sane legislative process, instead of saying: 'Here is the Honourable members will note that the Constitution refers However it is not the Government's intention at this time for the Inter-State Commission to operate under From that it is quite obvious that what the Government intends to do is to re-establish the Commission, to re-establish the bones of the mechanism, use if for transport purposes in the first instance and, astimegoes by, gradually add to the functions and the power of the Commission in the light of what plans the Government may have. We have heard a great deal of reference by' the honourable member for Shortland to the question of resolving constitutional doubts about the extent of the proposed Inter-State Commission's powers. The honourable member for Shortland has advanced a remarkable argument today. It is an argument that is being advanced with increasing frequency by both Ministers and Government back bench members of Parliament. That proposition is that a government has absolutely no responsibility to make a value judgment as to whether a proposal of the Government is within power. All it has to do is to pass the legislation. I does not have to worry about whether there is any legal doubt regarding the constitutional scope of the legislation. They say the High Court of Australia can determine that. I argue that it is the responsibility introduction of the Budget and until the full of the Government to give some consideration to whether something is within power and that it is a gross breach by the executive arm of government for the attitude to be taken that if there is any problem it can be resolved by the High Court. I think that is an irresponsible attitude. It is an attitude which has come to be far too frequently displayed by members of the Government. I think that as a responsible Government it ought to give some responsible consideration to whether legislation it proposes is within power. We have heard much reference during this debate, by both the Minister in his second reading speech and by the honourable member for Shortland to the historical antecedents of the Inter-State Commission. While I would be prepared to accept that the original idea of the InterState Commission may have had its genesis in an Act of the United Kingdom back in the 19th century, I think that for anyone to argue seriously that a useful analogy can be drawn between the drcumstances that then existed and the circumstances which exist today in Australia is to be patently absurd. Every member of this House knows that many of the original concepts which led to the insertion of particular clauses into the Constitution have been altered by the passage of time. If there is one set of relations in Australia which have altered perhaps more than any other by the passage of time, it is the relations between the Federal Government and the States. Ideas and concepts which in the early part of this century were vahd and had relevance in regard to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States were no longer relevant. If we are ever to bring about a sensible resolution of areas of difference between the States and areas of difference between the Federal Government and the States it will not be by unilateral legislative confrontation on the part of the Federal Government. This legislation represents yet another piece of unilateral confrontation by the Federal Government towards the States without proper consideration of the attitude of the States and without proper consideration of the attitudes of industry and commerce. Within a short period of 12 days we, as an Op : position, are being asked to give a blank cheque to what could constitute the introduction into Australia of a fourth arm of government. We have not proposed that the legislation be rejected at thistime.We have asked that it be withdrawn and that its re-introduction be delayed until the ramifications of the legislation can be digested. It is a responsible attitude. It is not an obstructionist attitude. The onus lies on the Government to estabhsh to the satisfaction of the people why it is so frantically necessary to have this legislation passed in such great haste and without adequate opportunity for consideration by those affected and by those interested, which, in this instance, means a very substantial section of the Austrahan community. heard a submission from the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) this afternoon which is typical of this indentikit Liberal, as he has been described by the Leader of the House( Mr Daly). He could be described as an identikit Liberal because what he said this afternoon is not new, even though he is a relatively new member of this House. It is the same sort of thing that has been trotted out on many occasions by members of the Liberal Party of Australia when this Government has attempted to do something positive to show some form of national leadership. We heard the same old diatribe again this afternoon from the members of the Australian Country Party. Earher this afternoon the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) talked about this legislation establishing a fearful commission which will not be answerable to Parliament. The honourable member for Bennelong talked about the legislation establishing a fourth level of government.",39,Inter State Commission Bill 1975
91,Mr Keogh (Bowman) (4.20),"We haveOf course, the reason honourable members opposite hold these knee-shaking attitudes is because their Parties, when in government for about a quarter of a century, were never prepared to show nauonai leadership. They were prepared to weave and wave at the whim and fancy of the various State governments. Of course, on many occasions particularly in recent years those State governments have been led by Premiers more powerful than the former government's Prime Ministers. It is a little difficult for them to understand now that a united Australian Labor Party Government is in power which is prepared to put its policies into effect. This is a Government which has announced policies which have been accepted on 2 occasions in recent years by the people of Australia. Of course, when the legislauon to put these policies into effect-legislauo n such as the Inter-State Commission Bill introduced by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones)-is introduced into the Parliament honourable members opposite sit back in wonderment and amazement and say: 'We are not really against the legislation but we would like to have it withdrawn to give us an opportunity to consider it further or to think about it to see whether it is the sort of legislation that we want to support'. The honourable member for Bennelong talked about the unilateral confrontation that we are having with the States. I submit that the introduction of this legislation by no means represents unilateral confrontation with the States. Previously in theh history the States have been part of an Inter-State Commission. The Minister for Transport when introducing this legislation said in his second reading speech that the Commission will be very limited in its powers at this stage. He went on to say in his introducafter tory remarks: However it is not the Government's intention at this time commission made recommendations on the Confor the Inter-State Comniission to operate under those prostitution after hearing evidence and considering visions other than in the field of transport. During the debate this afternoon we have heard ran pointed out that the absence of the Comsuggestions from Opposition speakers that this mission prevented the Commonwealth from will be a fourth level of government and that it exercising its powers to regulate railway charges will be a level of government that will be unwhich section 102 of the Constitution made an answerable to Parliament. Of course, nothing exclusive prerogative of the Inter-State Comcould be further from the truth. This legislation is mission. Reference was made to this very imporset up under the provisions of the Constitution. It tant function of the original Inter-State Comwas envisaged quite clearly by the founding mission by the honourable member for fathers in theh deliberations and was made clear Shortland ( Mr Morris) this afternoon. The royal in the drafting of the Constitution that an Intercommission in 1927 recommended the reinstaState Commission would be established and that tement of the Inter-State Commission with juthe role of the Commission would be compdicial powers provided by constitutional alterlementary to that of the Parliament, the Execuation, but it pointed out that even without those tive and the judiciary. We need the existence of a judicial powers the Commission would provide a body such as this with the wide powers it would have to deal with interstate transport problems in the interests of all parties. These problems in transport exist today to a much greater extent than they existed some 70 years ago. But in fact they have never been faced or tackled by previous governments except for the short period of 7 years between 1913 and 1920 when the previous Inter-Sate Commission operated. I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the legislation. I think it is high time that such legislation was introduced. I suggest to members of the Opposition that they should have second thoughts about theh attitude and that they should devote every effort possible to understanding what the legislation is about and to show some progressiveness as they are suggesting to the nation they intend to do under theh recently elected leader, and suppon this progressive legislation that has been introduced by the Minister for Transport. In 1912 powers were vested in the Commissioners of the Inter-State Commission which were of a judicial nature. It is well known that it was because of those powers and the challenge that subsequently was made to those powers as being in conflict with the Constitution, the Commission did not get very far in the 7 years in which it was in office and eventually lapsed. The challenge, of course, was that the Constitution provided that any appointment of a judicial nature should not be limited by years in office but should be for life. The previous Inter-State Commission was wound eventually on this technicality in 1920 on the completion of the original 7-year term. I submit that it is not a new idea. Some7 years the original Inter-State Commission lapsed a royal commission was held in 1927. The royal the revival of the Commission. Sir Robert Garvaluable service. It is quite apparent and obvious, of course-even , I am sure, to the Opposition-that such an alteration to the Constitution would be most unlikely. Of course, the legislation which has now been introduced and which we are currently considering is proposed to operate without such judicial powers as were included in the original legislation and which led to the downfall of the previous Inter-State Commission. Anyone who has considered the problems associated with any aspect of interstate transport today, whether it be by rail, road, sea, or air, would realise that the differences of the attitudes of the various States cannot be solved by the sort of approach that fhe Opposition has suggested we should be taking. It cannot be solved by simply getting a united effort from each of the States. Each State has its own attitude on these matters. None of the States will in the future be prepared to give up any of these attitudes, to compromise, to co-operate and to overcome the problems that exist in the various transport that I have named. This legislation, when passed by the Parhament, will in fact put the Australian Government, through the Inter-State Commission, into a position where it can show the States the leadership which in the past has been lacking in these areas. The Australian Government wUl be able to show the leadership to the States that will bring them to accept the need for the cooperation and co-ordination of theh efforts in these areas that previously has certainly been lacking. I again compliment the Minister for bringing forward this legislation. I suggest to honourable members opposite that they should step, even very briefly, out of the 18th century into the 19th century and realise that today's problems in the transport field can be tackled and overcome only by the Inter-State Commission. FinaUy, I remind honourable members opposite that if some of the men who represented the States in the preparation of the Constitution had the type of thinking that they are exhibiting Australia would still be made up of 6 separate States instead of being one nation. There is no doubt that Australia, under this Labor Government, will go forward as one nation provided that the Opposition does not put forward in the other place in this ParUament where it has the majority the negative thinking that has been put forward by it in this House, which would have the effect of blocking the passage of this legislation. first thing I want to note is the absence of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) from this debate. We are discussing legislation which relates to the fourth body which was appointed by the Constitution in imperative terms. In those circumstances one would have thought that a Bill of this kind would have been introduced by the Prime Minister and that he would have been here to explain why it is necessary that this country should have such a body at this time. He is notably absent from the debate. May I say that it is a regrettable absence for the Prime Minister not to lend his debate to this Bill. The Opposition has indicated that it does not at this stage see the necessity for a body such as this to be set up by this Parliament in such great haste. The honourable member for Bowman( Mr Keogh) said that there are great problems in relation to interstate transport. Of course, anybody who has had anything to do with government would know that it is open to the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) at any time to bring to the attention of his Cabinet or of the ParUament matters or practices which are offensive and which need legislation to correct them. There is no reason why from day to day or from month to month matters of this description should not be brought before the Parliament for correction if they exist. If anybody should get to know of such practices, that person would be the Minister. Many suggestions have been made about this body over the years but none of them, apart from the original body, actuaUy went as far as does this Bill. If one goes back to the debates and to the evidence that was given before the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927 one wUl find that the emphasis there was on the investigatory nature of the Inter-state Commission. Sh Robert Garran, the then Solicitor-General said: Amongst others, there is the function of acting as a Royal Comniission to investigate matters-the principal function which the Commission actually exercised. I think that most of its time was spent in investigating matters relaung to trade and so forth, which were referred to it by the Commonwealth Government. That is a description of the Inter-State Commission as it existed in the years from 1912 to approximately 1920. Mr Nicholas, the counsel assisting the Commission, said: . . . the powers of the Commission, if properly exercised, might be made great instruments in carrying out the designs and desires of Parliament with reference to the maintenance and promodon of trade and commerce and commercial relauons between the States and with other countries. The Commission would have authority, not only to prevent railway preferences and discriminations, but also to prevent any body or any combination of persons resorting to",41,Inter State Commission Bill 1975

It is not good enough to introduce a Bill into this House simply to because it is part of the platform of the Labor potential Party to have a commission of this description. There has to be a good, sound, and viable reason Clause 14 gives wide powers of investigation. for setting it up. When one considers the terms of the BUl, one terms of an existing need to know what is going finds that the powers of the Commission go far on in relation to interstate trade and commerce. beyond powers of investigation.

It reads: The terms and conditions on which a service by way of or in relation to interstate transport is provided shall be reasonThe effect of that sub-clause is that once the able and just.

There are no indicia; no directions as to the BUl reads: (1) The reguladons may authorise the Commission, either generally or otherwise as provided by the reguladons, to exercise all or any of the powers . . . of any authority or tribunal under any law of Australia made under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. The bodies referred to in this clause would include not only those which exercise power in into bodies such as the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal, the aheady been established by this Government are to have a Big Brother in the form of the Interstate inquire into these matters, to consider them and to report on them. In clause 13 of the Bill the to do that is extremely wide. Clause 14 (1) by itself might well be justified in vices by way of or in relation to interstate transport are provided, and that where the Comfor the purposes of proposed section 11 to be reasonable and just. Commission decides that certain terms and conwhat is intended to be reasonable; no directions as to what is intended to be just and yet the Commission is to have the broad power to determine them. The' reasonableness' and 'justice' of terms and conditions are the very matters that this Parliament ought to be considering. It should not fall within the responsibihty of a body even though set up with the high status and great powers of investigation to lay down the law on these matters for the future, without reference back to this Parhament. I know that their decisions may be amended by law, but it is an extremely wide power to give to such a body. In clause 15 onefindsan even wider provision. The Commission is given power to make orders requiring the observance of terms and conditions in relation to the provision of services by way of or in relation to interstate transport. Again as one erected upon the hope that its linchpin provisions reads the Bill one sees that clause 11 gradually emerges as the key provision in the Bill. It is the linchpin of the Bill. I shall come back to it later. Clause 17 contemplates even wider powers under other Acts of Parhament being vested in the Commission. Clause 34 emphasises points that I have already made in relation to the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal. One might ask: What did the founding fathers intend? With respect, they certainly did not intend a Commission of this description. They did not intend one that extended into every area of trade and commerce, State and interstate. They called it an interstate commission and it was intended to deal basically with the interstate transport system in relation to railways. One can say with some confidence that that must have been theh view. Over the years the meaning of the phrase 'laws relating to trade and commerce' under the Constitution has been extended by the High Court. As I have already indicated, laws under section 51 (xx) of the Constitution, relating to corporations, have been treated as provisions relating to trade and commerce. However, it was never the intention of the founding fathers that a commission of this description should be set up under the Constitution. If its activities were restricted to interstate trade and commerce then, of course, it might be able to stand consistent with constitutional history. SoI would suggest that the proposed Commission goes far beyond what was originally intended. One might also ask: Why is there such dupUalready conceded that. A commission which has cation? Why do we need another body to look wide investigatory powers to look into questions over the shoulder of the Trade Practices Comof malpractice and at ways of making interstate mission or to look over the shoulder of other trade more efficient was the original and real investigatory bodies such as the Industries Assistintention of the Constitution. I suggest that that is ance Commission? Why do we need it at a time the only justification for it today in view of what when clearly the Government needs to reduce has happened since 1900 and in view of the fact government expenditure? Why is there a need for yet another body with a multiplicity of public servants and bureaucrats? Why do we need it? These are the questions that have not been answered in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport. I have read the Minister's second reading speech and I can find in it no real justification for the setting up of this tribunal. AllI canfindis a broad assertion. I come back to what I said in the beginning: If there is any injustice, malpractice or anything of that description in interstate trade and commerce, then the Minister ought to bring it to the attention ofhis Cabinet or this Parhament so that we can do something about it. The other matter is that this BUl seems to be wUl avoid section 92 of the Constitution. Clause II of the BUl states: The terms and conditions on which a service by way of or in relation to inter-State transport is provided shall be reasonable and just., The effect of the BUl is to give the power of determination to the Commission. I have taken the House through the BUl. I say to the Minister that it is extremely doubtful whether such a provision wiU survive the gamut of section 92 of the Constitution. The Minister ought to consider the BUl a bit more because although the words 'reasonable and just' sound grand words, greater indicia needs to be attached to them in order for such a provision to survive the gamut of section 92. It is not a question of whether it is good or bad to have such a provision: The question is whether such a provision is constitutional. If that is the linchpin of this BUl it ought to give honourable members serious concern whether that provision does not need amendment in order to give some greater direction to the Commission as to the types of matters which it should take into account in determining what is 'reasonable and just' and to show that, hi terms of section 92 tliinking, the provision is truly regulatory and not a burden on interstate trade and commerce. That is the point to which I am directing my mind at the moment. I suggest that the BUl comes before the House in a form which is not satisfactory. Should there be a commission? It may well be that there are good and sufficient reasons for having a commission of some description. I have that the Government has set up a new Trade Practices Commission with investigatory powers, a Prices Justification Tribunal in that area and an Industries Assistance Commission. It is intended that these bodies look into matters of interstate trade and commerce. I therefore suggest at this stage that the Government should think again about this measure with a view to cutting it down, to making it consistent with the Constitution and also making it consistent with the economic stringencies of this day. The Government should consider making it consistent with legislation which has already been debated and passed by the House and which already provides for wide investigatory procedures and for the making of orders which are intended to deal with malpractices. speakers have said, the object of the Interstate these fathers would be disappointed to know Commission Bill is to etablish an interstate comthat the legislation, expected to provide for mission as provided for and expected under seccarrying out a clause in the Constitution, has tion 101 of the Constitution. Except for the been decried as sociaUst and centralist by the period 1913-1920 the Australian political system Australian Country Party. has acted without an interstate commission.

He said that remedies Ue in appeals to the Minister( Mr Whitlam) stated: A clearly developed and defined role for the commission will evolve over time and in the light of experience . . . one of the great anomalies of Australia's post-federation history that the concept of the interstate Commission, for which the founders of our Constituuon obviously envisaged a major role in Federal relationships, as, except for a brief period 6 decades ago, been ignored by in the same rhetoric he removed them and Australian Governments.

I suppose any speech from the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), in referring to any measure introduced by this Government, would be amiss and a little strange if it did not make some reference to a charge that our measures were sociaUst and centralist. But even the greatest opponents of socialism today could not have erected as great a barrier to the development of sociaUsm suitable for Australia than did the fathers of our Constitution. They were hardly known for their love of socialism. In fact, the greatest barriers to the implementation of socialist platforms or policies in Australia can If this is a sociaUst measure and a door to be High Court and in legislative change. The honourable member for Wentworth was resplendent in his backing and fining today. He mentioned many reasons why there should be an interstate commission. On the same grounds and decried them. Since 1920 there has been a continuous stream of recommendations and expressions of support Labor Government and, oddly enough, I beUeve at times from the Country Party.

'carriage'. The Prime Minister in his 1972 policy speech Morris) said, section 101 of the Constitution said: The Interstate Commission was intended to end the cen104 of the Constitution. Section 104 reads: tralisation fostered by all State governments through their railway systems. It should now provide not only for the coordination of our 6 mainland railway systems and our major ports in the period before the Commonwealth, like other Federal Governments, inevitably takes responsibility for railways and ports; it is also the ideal instrument for coordinating our major roads, and airlines and pipelines. A federal Labor Government will prompdy restore the machinery the Constitution intended and vest it with the Commonwealth's full constitutional powers to plan and provide modern means of communication between the States. As recently as April last year, the Prime Minister in his policy speech stated: The Government will re-establish the Commission this year. We are still within 12 months of the time at which the Prime Minister said that. That promise will be upheld, at least in this House. Several issues have been mooted to be dealt with by the Interstate Commission. They are mainly in the first stages concerned with railway transport. The Commission should have the role of adjudication to examine, for instance, railway rates so that interstate trade is not disadvantaged when compared with intrastate trade and to ensure that all modes of transport are not isolated in planning or in operation but have a co-ordinated and coplanned relationship. The Inter-State Commission should have the powers of investigation which are absolutely necessary before adjudication can be made. It should have a role of arbitration and be a suitable body to arbitrate and enforce its decisions upon competing parties. It would be the ideal body for the transfer of State raUways to Australian Government control, if offered by the many States. In the case of 2 States this has aheady partly happened. It should be an ideal body also to arbitrate on disputes between the raUways of AustraUa and other carriers. It is important to note how matters wiU be brought to the attention of the Commission. It wUl be quite open in its operations and accessible to individuals, companies or corporations, State or AustraUan statutory authorities. Matters can be initiated by the Inter-State Commission or it can operate under either its arbitratory, investigatory or adjudicatory roles at the direction of the Minister. I say that this is important because openness wUl contribute the same quality that has been injected into the field of subsidies and support schemes to industry under the Industries Assistance Commission. This BUl establishes the As the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr must be read in conjunction with sections 92 and Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Comnussion to be necessary for the development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State from other States. I am sure that the honourable member for Wentworth overlooked section 104 of the Constitution when he objected to clause 11 of this BiU and argued that what appeared to be reasonable and just may not be so. I am sure that section 104 utterly dismisses his argument. In fact, his oversight is deplorable. On section 104 rests clause 10 of the BUl. Further, if the Corporation's power is wide enough to enable the Commonwealth to make price-fixing laws applicable to the prices of goods and services sold or supplied by foreign companies and AustraUan trading andfinancialcompanies, as it may be, the Commission could also act as a price-fixing authority, again, of courseand I stress this-in connection with the sale of goods or the supply of services interstate, subject to section 92 of the Constitution. I underline the relationship between the rest of the Constitution and the other bodies which have been set up by the Australian Government because it is on these considerations that part III of the Bill operates. The honourable member for Wentworth decried the status that we have ascribed to the Commission in this BUl. It is important that if it is to operate successfully it have operations similar to the Grants Commission and have the status of the Arbitration Commission. This is what the Government set out to do. The absence of the Inter-State Commission has led to the establishment of many other bodies, such as the Tariff Board, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Grants Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission which have taken responsibUity for areas that might well have been within the purview of the Inter-State Commission. It is because of the neglect by previous governments in not estabhshing such a Commission that these various bodies have needed to be established. The estabhshment of the Inter-State Commission by this BUl must be seen in the Ught of those bodies. Australia is no longer a conglomeration of outpost empires, of colonies. Seventy-five years after our forefathers wrote the Constitution we have emerged from the horse and buggy days into a modern era.

MrM c VEIGH ( D a r l in g D o w n s ) the Prime Minister has not seen fit to participate (5.1)-There is one concept about the Inter-State in the debate. It is a very important piece of legisCommission Bill 1975 with which we cannot lation which has severe imphcations for the argue, but this does not add any saving grace to whole spectrum of Government activity in this the proposition before us. At least the Governnation.

One can be excused tiate, and we are all concerned about whose for advancing the argument that this Comresponsibihty this legislation is to be. We are mission is another 2-pronged attack on the conworried about whether the Minister will be stitutional rights of the States and pnvate swallowed up in another earthquake emanating enterprise.

Possibly we language of the Bill and, secondly, the insidious could not quite say 'It's time' but certainly time and implied threats to our privacy and indepenwill tell. dence which will become a reahty when the net is finally cast and the catch unloaded. The Bill is, therefore, a further item in the long avalanche of of the previous Inter-State Commission and the legislation which seems somewhat straightforconstitutional basis of it. The present legislation ward at first glance but under the lamp of closer has been amply spelt out and the path has been scrutiny has its flaws and deceits exposed. One would gather from the second reading encompasses far wider aspects than mere speech, which was entrusted, probably by the transport. It is the structuring of an all powerful Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), to the Minister body which can override decisions of other statufor Transport ( Mr Charles Jones), that the Bill tory bodies without reference to the Minister or deals primarily with transport, but this is far to the Parliament itself. This is the point of the from the truth, as honourable members from this debate-the overriding of the seat of responsiside of the House have conveyed to the Ausbility by an all powerful commission whose area tralian people. The corridors of Parliament of responsibility is uncharted, uncontrolled and House are buzzing with talk that the Prime Minunchallengeable. Tbis is a dangerous precedent ister will not put the Minister for Transport in to establish and we are not prepared to give this charge of the legislation if and when it receives Bill, in its present form, our imprimatur.

97,Mr Mcveigh,"As the honourable memberAn example of how an industry can be sabotaged can be gained by giving practical examples. The Australian Wheat Board is a statutory authority which gains its legislative teeth from complementary and supplementary legislation by the State and Commonwealth Governments. The purpose for which it was established and for which it has had a continuing charter for many years was to bring an organised approach to the marketing, supply and handling of the Australian wheat crop whilst protecting the rights of the Australian consuming public. It has prospered because it has been firmly anchored to the base of industry control and priand sincere concern at the cavalier attitude vate enterprise. It has been uniquely successful because the men who have controlled it over the years have been vitally interested in its success because they were the real owners, on behalf of the Australian farmers, of the product. Yet this legend of success can be interfered with by this Commission on the basis of trade and commerce-suprem e power in the absolute sense. This is what we are opposed to. There has to be some shackling of control as advanced by the Austrahan Labor Party for otherwise the reins will be snapped from the hands of those who have the constitutional responsibility of holding them-the Parliament. that vital principle by the honourable member basis consultation with the States. for Maranoa and the honourable member for Hume. for Kennedy says, they are good men; I agree have thought that in a country which has a vast with him.

I No wonder this type of legislation has seen the want to conclude on this note. The exclusion of hght of day. It was conceived with the idea of rivers and water usage surely indicates once control and bom with the idea to destroy the again the complete and utter neglect of inland States.

The Opposition is merely trying to consumption of oil and gas obtained from State delay this Bill. Opposition members are using a natural resources? No doubt he has grasped the lot of colourful language about this being a nettle and is swinging the branch in an endeavour to control coal exports from Queensland in the electorate of Kennedy. No doubt he is drawn to the idea that the Commission will examine oil, gas and coal policies so that no preference in these areas is accorded to one State as compared with any other State, simply because one State seems to have closer natural resources at hand. We are opposed to this type of what may be termed a socialised board of trades. I agree wholeheartedly with the amendments to be moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). I share his very deep towards the Parliament which is shown in the almost immoral haste with which the legislation is being rushed through this chamber. Adequate notice should have been given to the Opposition and sufficient time allowed to have an in-depth analysis made of all the details. Much discussion has centred recently on the need to improve Commonwealth-State relations. Yet in one fell swoop the relations that have been built up by the hospitality of the non-Labor State Premiers have been destroyed because the Government did not see fit to consult the States in the matter before framing the legislation. True it is that the Government let fall a few statements here and there, but it did not have meaningful consultation with the States.

103,Mr Coates (Denison) (5.13),"I thank the'monster', 'insidious threats', 'sinister', 'a device to gain complete control' and so on. But what the Opposition is doing is asking this Parliament to ignore the Constitution. It is rather ironic that Opposition members who have been defenders and upholders of the Constitution as it was formulated in 1901, for some reason or other want to ignore section 101 of it which states that there shall be an Inter-State Commission. They want to ignore that. I do not know whether the Tasmanian senator, Senator Wright, still supports it, but to his credit he has been a supporter of the reintroduction of the Inter-State Commission for which the Menzies Government repealed the Act in 1950 even though it was out of existence long before that. The Opposition has described the Inter-State Commission as a socialist plot. Does it also say that the framers of the Constitution were preparing a socialist plot? The Opposition says that, yet it complains about what it calls the lack of ministerial control. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. The Commission is to be an independent body. I do not know why the Opposition has any fear about the Government of the day. In any case, as it has acknowledged, there is an appeal to the High Court on matters of law. That is what the High Court is there for-to interpret the Constitution. But the High Court cannot interpret in a vacuum. It has to look at legislation and deem whether it is in accordance with the Constitution and whether any judgments are in accordance with the Constitution. In any case, the Parhament still remains supreme. If the Parhament disagrees with any judgment of the Inter-State Commission, the Parliament can legislate against that decision. The Opposition has made wild assertions about absolute power, supreme power to the Inter-State Commission, the fourth legislative arm and so forth. But the Parhament still retains its supremacy. It can amend this Act after the BUl becomes an Act, the Parhament can introduce superseding legislation ifit wishes. The Inter-State Commission is set up under an Act of Parhament. The purpose of the legislation is protection of the people-protectio n of the small man, the small business, the smaU State, and the farmer in particular. The Opposition seems to be acting as a puppet for the large corporations in this country and theh preferential position in trade and commerce. I wonder how many communications the Opposition has had from Sir Reginald Ansett in the last couple of weeks? The Opposition wants to delay the BUl so that it can whip up a frenzied and misleading opposition. It does not want to put itself in the position of giving actual opposition to the BiU because of its new form whereby it wants to appear not to be blocking legislation. But deferring a BUl which is as straightforward as this is as good as blocking it. It is a straightforward BUl; it repeats sections of the Constitution and merely gives expression to what the Constitution requires. Clauses 10 and 11 are perhaps the key provisions of the BUl. As the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Elhcott) said, clause 11 is the linchpinI think that is the way he described it. Clause 11 states: The terms and conditions on which a service by way of or in relation to inter-State transport is provided shall be reasonable and just. The Opposition has said that we do not need to have a system to provide that interstate transport shall be on conditions which are reasonable and just. Clause 10 states: It is unlawful, in respect of or so as to affect overseas transpon or inter-State transport, or in or in connection with the provision of any service by way of or in relation to overseas transpon or inter-State transport, to(a) give any particular person, State, locality or class or kind of transpon any preference or advantage; or (b) subject to any particular person, State, locality or class or kind of transport to any discrimination or disadvantage. that the Commission has adjudged to be undue and unreasonable. Surely that is what we need to ensure, that the disadvantages which exist at the moment do not continue? The Commission can investigate; it can arbitrate-and that is an important power. It can arbitrate between people, between companies. Under clause 15 the Commission can, with the consent of the people involved, arbitrate on any matter relevant to or affected by the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce or oflaws made thereunder. I wish to refer briefly to this Bill as it affects Tasmania. It amazes me that the Opposition front bencher who speaks for the Opposition in this House on matters related to TasmaniaI refer to the honourable member for Wentworth-spok e to the Inter-State Commission BUl without once mentioning Tasmania and the importance of the Inter-State Commission to that State. The people of Tasmama are waiting for this legislation. They have been waiting for it since 1972, if l can ignore the previous period. In 1972 the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) came to Hobart and promised that, if elected to government, the Australian Labor Party would reintroduce the Inter-State Commission. At the same time, he made some specific promises about ensuring equaUty of cost per ton mUe for goods transport between Tasmania and the mainland when compared with transport costs between other points on the mainland, which is one specific way in which the Inter-State Commission can adjudicate. If an inter-State commission had been in existence this Government would never have had to set up the Nimmo Commission of Inquiry into Tasmania's transport disadvantages, and I think that even the Opposition will acknowledge that Tasmania has been disadvantages in interstate transport. This Government has made great strides in attempting to overcome those disadvantages, but as far as Tasmania is concerned the Inter-State Commission will be a permanent royal commission into Tasmania's transport disadvantages. It will be a protector of Tasmania's interests, and the same can be said in relation to Western Austraha, which is another small and very isolated State with particular transport disadvantages. As I said, if there had been an inter-State commission in existence there would have been no need for the Nimmo Commission because the Inter-State Commission would have had Tasmania's interests already under control. I should warn the Opposition that if it is conStewart, F.E. cerned about its image in Tasmania it ought not to block this Bill. Support for the amendment foreshadowed by the Opposition will be a vote against the interests of Tasmania. I support the Bill and I hope that it has a speedy passage. protestMotion (by Mr Nicholls) put: That the question be now put. The House divided. Ayes Noes Majority AYES NOES Armitage, J. L.

Therefore, I move: any record of information, however compiled, recorded or stored, whether in writing, on microfilm or microfiche, by electronic process or otherwise; 'goods'includes(a) ships, aircraft and vehicles; (b) animals (including fish); (c) minerals (including petroleum) and slurry; and (d) gas; 'inter-State transport' means transport of goods or persons, being transport constituting part of trade or commerce among the States or transport of goods that are the subject of such trade or commerce; 'meeung', in relation to the Commission, includes a sitting of the Commission for the purpose of taking evidence or hearing submissions at an investigation or for the purposes of an arbitration; 'member' means a member of the Commission and includes the President; 'overseas transport' means transport of goods or persons, being transport constituting part of trade or commerce with other countries or transport of goods that are the subject of such trade or commerce; 'person' includes Australia, a State and an authority of Australia or of a State; 'President' means the President of the Commission; 'terms and conditions', in relation to the provision of services, includes charges for the provision of those services; 'transport' includes the movement of goods through a pipe-line. (2) A reference in this Act to the provision of a service is a amendment. reference to the provision of any service, whether with or without the supply of goods, and includes a reference to the letting on hire of plant or equipment, the leasing ofland or premises and the provision of any facility, including a facility at or in the vicinity of, or by way of, a port, airport or other terminal. ing remarks of his second reading speech the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) had this to say: The object of the Bill is to re-establish the Inter-State Commission in accordance with the provisions of section 101 of the Constitution, which states: There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudicationI will not weary the House by reading the whole of the section. The Minister went on to say, and this is the part which concerns me: Honourable members will note that the Constitution refers to the trade and commerce provisions and laws made thereunder. However it is not the Government's intention at thistimefor the Inter-State Commission to operate under these provisions other than in thefieldof transpon. I submit to the Committee that the definition of goods is a much wider definition than is required if this Commission is to deal only with transport. Transport is obviously an integral part of trade, but the concept of trade is larger than The reference in the definition to minerals and petroleum is an obvious attempt to use the InterState Commission to control the production and movement of those resourcesrightback to their Omit the definition of goods'. for Transport) (5.42)-The Government rejects the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). The definition of ' goods' in the BiU includes: (a) ships, aircraft and vehicles; (b) anirnals (including fish); (c) minerals (including petroleum) and slurry; and (d) gas; These have been set out specifically because they are some of the things that the Government wants the Commission to investigate. It wants the Commission to investigate the manner in which ships, aircraft and vehicles shall operate. That is the whole crux of the Bill. The Government wants the Commission to investigate the practices applying in the operation of these vessels and the manner in which they are handhng the carriage, of freight, passengers and the like. This is part and parcel of what the Bill sets out to do. I repeat that it sets out specifically that these are the matters the Government wants included. Therefore the Government rejects the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) has set out the Opposition's case very expUcitly and very well. Honourable members on this side of the chamber support him. In his speech the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) made it quite clear in nearly every paragraph that the intention of the legislation relates to transport, and transport alone. It is to be extended to cover one or two other areas but it relates predominantly to transport. So the definition of 'goods' which is contained in clause 3 is much wider than would be understood from the Minister's speech or from the speeches of those who have been responsible for the Government's introducing this legislation. After all, what is involved in the Commission is an enormous grant of power, and the Opposition is concerned to ensure that this power be utilised for the purposes for which the Government claims it wants the power. I refer to the statment by Sir John Quick in the debate on the original Inter-state Commission BUl in 1912. He said:",52,Pairs

113,Mr Kevin Cairns (Luley) (5.44),"TheI have always believed, and I still believe, that this grant of power to tbe Inter-State Commission is a very imponant grant of power, and that there is in these apparently simple words relating to trade and commerce an enormous grant of power, a reserve force of power, the magnitude and importance of which probably even the framers of the Constitution in launching it hardly realised. But these grants of power, when analysed from the juridical standpoint, are pregnant with meaning and potentiality. All the Opposition is concerned to do is to ensure that these grants of power have relation to the purpose for which the Bill has been introduced into the House. I beheve that that is an eminently reasonable line to take. After all, when a Minister makes a second reading speech in this House we understand that the BUl which follows the speech purports to put into operation what was stated in the speech. It is for that reason that the definition of 'goods' is proposed to be altered and deleted by fhe Opposition in accordance with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). I believe that in moving this amendment the honourable member for Gippsland is holding to the precise terms under which the BUl has been proposed twice in public places and once in this House by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones). nation of the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) is not satisfactory. I thank the honourable member for LUley( Mr Kevin Cairns) for the additional information he has provided in this debate. But one is inclined to wonder when one reads the definition provided, which states: 'Goods'includes(a) ships, aircraft and vehicles; One would assume, therefore, that the InterState Commission is wanting to control transport by those means; by ships, aircraft and vehicles. But then the next section reads: (b) animals (including fish); I do not know whether the Minister is living in the horse and buggy age and thinks he is going to control the drays that go down a country road, or what. But to includefishreally boggles the mind as to what the Minister might mean. If he does not mean that this new Inter-State Commission is going to invent some new transport form, or he is going to invent some new transport form whereby porpoises are going to tow Australia's freight overseas, or something, or around the coast in the years ahead, he means the alternative, which is that he is going to control the transport of animals. The transport of Uvestock throughout Australia wUl be controUed under the definition of this measure and that will include fish. If the transport of livestock is included, what about the transport of other products? The inclusion of this reference really means control of trade and commerce throughout Austraha. The Minister goes on to prove his own point by including under the definition of 'goods': (c) minerals (including petroleum) and slurry; and (d) gas; If these are to be included in the definition of 'goods', it means that the arrangements for the carriage of crude oU from Barrow Island can be upset by this Commission. AU commercial negotiations and contracts in the field of trade and commerce are put to one side. The Minister does not even know what the BiU means. That is what he indicates when he gets up and talks as he has done. Therefore, the Opposition moves for the deletion of the word 'goods'. the Opposition is going to try to mislead the House about the whole matter of this Bill. The main point that must be made in answer to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) is that if we are talking about goods or trade and commerce, or whatever, and if a particular arrangement is unfair, unreasonable, if it disadvantages or discriminates or gives too much of a preference or advantage, it ought to be adjudged as such. That is what the BiU is about. Surely that is what was intended by the Constitution in stating that the Inter-State Commission should have a trade and commerce power. That is what the BUl is providing. those people who beheves that, as we have, under section 101 of the AustraUan Constitution, an actual responsibUity to establish an InterState Commission with some or all of the powers that are mentioned in sections 101 and 51 (i) of the Constitution. A BiU of this sort ought to be brought down, provided I am convinced that there is sohd ground on which any commission that is established can in fact ensure efficiency in our transport system and in our trade and commerce within the States and overseas. There we have the constitutional provisions. I refer to Quick and Garran. I believe that initially when the Constitution was agreed to it was thought that when such powers of adjudication and administration were given they were judicial powers. If one looks at the 'Oxford English Dictionary' one sees that 'adjudication' has that meaning; it is to award judicially or to decide judiciaUy.

116,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) (5.50),"I am one ofConstitution, which states that the Commonwealth shall have power with regard to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, I see the overall perspective in which we have to look at this legislation. ThenI have to ask myself whether or not such a Bill is necessary. One must remember that very nearly $5,000m last year was expended in capital and current expenditure for the transport industries of this country, let alone all the other ramifications relating to trade and commerce. Again, therefore, I have a predisposition to say that in a country with 6 States where, from the very beginning, there have been inefficiencies and a strange disposition to want to be different, even though it might cause costs to rise and transport and other facilities between the States to be obstructed in some way, there should be an interstate commission to ensure justice and reason. I also beheve that the Bill is thoroughly consistent with the idea of federalism and a Commonwealth system of government. If one looks at Quick and Garran and reads that part of the 'Law of the Constitution' which relates to this clause, one sees that every State wanted an interstate commission. It was Mr Kingston, from one of the States, who moved the relevant part of this clause and ensured that the words 'shall' and ' goods' came into it. But the reason why I come to a different conmeans'vegetables'. clusion than the Constitution justifies as to the passage of this Government's BiU is that I do not beheve enough thought has been given to clauses Charles Jones) can give a clearer explanation of 3 and 13 and the definition of the word 'goods'.

In the case hke this, goods in trade and commerce? The suspicion on where a word like 'goods' is being defined-and the Opposition side is that this BUl is to be allfor a long time it is difficult to find out in the Bill embracing and is to have control over not only itself just where the word 'goods' in fact is used transport between States but also the trading of other than in the definition clause of interstate goods and the pricing of goods.

SoI have to reject, or do all I can to reject, the definition in clause 3(1) relating to goods. I shall also want to take similar action with regard to clause 13 and other clauses of both Parts III and IV relating to investigations and commissions. Australian Country Party) (5.55)I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) to provide that the definition of goods be excluded from clause 3 of the BUl. I am confused as to what it really means. On a superficial reading it would appear that goods are defined for the purpose of identifying forms of transport, but quite clearly that is not so because transport is specially defined. If it was important to include ships, aircraft and vehicles they could have been provided in the definition of transport. Under the definition of goods the Government includes animals and minerals. I wonder whether it has forgotten to include vegetables. We know the old saying: 'Guess what it is-animal , vegetable or mineral'. There is no mention of'vegetable' in the Bill. However it mentions 'gas', 'slurry' and 'minerals'. 'Minerals' is a word with a wide meaning. It even includes petroleum products. 'Animals' has an even wider meaning. It even includes fish. I presume it also includes birds and anything else that Uves.

What astounds me is that the whole aim of the free enterprise Opposition, which can always find something to be said about free enterprise and the desire for competition, has been to defer this Bill which will provide some true competition and get rid of the means whereby the large forwarders, the large corporations and the other people who, because of the amount of goods they are handlingI use the word 'goods' in its normal sense-and the amount of goods they want to have transported are able to stand over certain operators. In the field of commerce we know that the Trade Practices Act was amended to stop restrictive trade practices. The Inter-State Commission Bill will set out to make sure that the little man is protected. It astounds me that the Opposition should oppose this Bill when the small man is going to be protected by it.

They are complaining ambit of the legislation, has been included to that the transport of primary produce in some way or another will be hindered and that the matter should not be inquired into. The Government is saying that when goods are to be transported there should be some means whereby the farmer or the grazier-primar y producers as a whole-wil l be in a position to challenge the freight rates that are being charged or challenge the protection that is afforded in one State as against that which applies in another State when primary produce is being transported within a State as part of an interstate or international movement of goods under terms and conditions which render a disadvantage to a farmer, or whoever it might be, in another State. It may be that a group in one State is placed at a very great advantage relative to another group. The provisions of this BUl would allow the small man to bring to the attention of the Commission unfair and unreasonable practices. In that situation the Commission would be requested to conduct an inquiry. Arising out of that inquiry one of several things could happen: The inquiry could disclose that there was no discrimination or that unfair preference was not being given to The definition of the word 'goods' has been included in the BUl for explanatory purposes to clarify the situation for people who are reading and interpreting this proposed Act.

For the remaining stages, until 9.30 p.m. this day. The Government sought the co-operation of the Opposition in aUowing adequate time for debate on the number of amendments that the Opposition proposed to move, but the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), who led for the Opposition in the debate on this BiU and who thought more of being at the Country Party Conference at Warrnambool last week than being in this ParUament, was not prepared to accept that offer. The honourable member for Gippsland is well known in this Parhament as one who will never co-operate in making possible reasonable debate in this Parliament. We have the situation tonight of the Opposition, having voted to a man against a Bill which contains 41 clauses and saying that it does not want to have a bar of it, now endeavouring to stonewall the legislation by moving amendments to it in Committee. If the Opposition is opposed to the whole of the BUl why is it trying to amend the Bill in Committee? It is having a couple of bob each way. For once the Oxford graduates are in the background and the larrikin Country Party has taken over. As the honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) said, the Liberals, Uke fawning dogs, are fawning at the feet of the Country Party, because today the larrikins are in control for a brief period. I want honourable members opposite to say why, if they are opposed to the BUl entirely, they want any time to debate it at aU in Committee. The only reason they wanttimeis so that they can stonewall the BUl. The Opposition Parties wUl obstruct and desin the Parhament? When all is said and done troy this legislation in another place because they there are only 20 members of the Country Party NOES are opposed to any legislation which comes before this House and before the other place which is any good for the AustraUan people. The fact that they will not negotiate on this matter shows TeUers: that they have not got an argument. The former Minister at the table is completely unprepared for the debate. In spite of what he was told by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) he does not think that his place is in the Parliament. He would rather be at the Country Party conference at Warrnambool in preference to being here and studying the legislation. Today he wants consideration of the legislation postFraser, Malcolm poned because he said he had not hadtimeto Wentworth, W.C. consider it. The honourable member's place is in the Parliament. The new Oxford graduate Leader of the Opposition said so. You be sure to be here when the Parhament is meeting. Stay here and study the legislation and do not run all House debating these measures. In view of the obstruction to this Bill of honourable members opposite, we have no alternative tonight to introducing a restriction on debate on this measure. We are not destroying any arguments because the Opposition has not any. If honourable members opposite are opposed to the whole BiU why are they seeking to amend legislation which they say is no good? It is simply because this is frustration de luxe. Even if we accepted these amendments here the Opposition in another place would obstruct just for the sake of obstruction. Tonight the Leader of the Country Party( Mr Anthony) got up. I heard him speaking in relation to the first clause. One would think from the way his speech was going that he was debating the whole BUl. The Opposition is talking for the sake of talking. We on this side of the Parliament regret that these obstructionist tactics have caused us to take this step. We thought the Opposition would be weU behaved on this occasion, but we find that it is back to its old form again-obstructin g for obstruction's sake. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) who is in charge of this Bill has put forward constructive suggestions. Considerabletimehas been given to debate this measure. Yet we find that there is no desire to do so on the Opposition side of the Parliament. For how long have we to look at the Liberal Party acting like fawning dogs, as therighthonourable member for Higgins said. For how long wUl the Liberal Party kowtow behind the Country Party?

They have learned from their colleagues in North Vietnam that where there is criticism and cism and easier to avoid discussion of it than it is to sit down and permit a point of view to be examined and scrutinised. Tonight these partisans of open government have given us a fah example of what httle truck they have for it. The Government, in initiating this guillotine motion has completely moved away from any opportunity for an open examination of one of the most fundamental BUls introduced into this House. Neither the Leader of the House nor the Minister for Transport can, by buffoonery or by theh despicable negating of parUamentary debating time, avoid the criticism that there is a case to be answered. They have neither the wit nor the abUity to sit and debate it. Obviously the conclusion of the Opposition must be that in the other place we must ensure there is an adequate opportunity to examine the BUl. We are taking our stand because we are concerned that the Bill should be properly scrutinised. We cannot debate a matter which has as many clauses as this if we are given between 8.30 p.m.",59,Pairs

The reason why he did not was that he had nothing to contribute. Let us look at the amendment which was moved. It states: That the Bill be withdrawn and not proceeded with until up, amendments which honourable members after presentation of the Budget to enable the principles of the Bill to be more fully investigated. How much more time does the Opposition want to investigate it? There has been an agreement that the BiU was to be brought in one week and this legislation is to protect the little people in this debated the next week. But what about these country.

If the Or/^sition's amendment were agreed to the result would be that there would be a gap in the investigation of certain sections of the transport of goods. The Commission would be able to investigate so much of it, but other sections would be completely free of investigationfor example, from the factory to the freight forwarders terminal and from the terminal to the mode of transport. AU of that and the warehousing are part and parcel of the transport of goods from point A to point B. If the Commission is in a position to investigate the main journey, that is OK. If one freight operator is being dealt with, he can carry on that portion of the journey according to the requirments of the Commission. It is then possible to load the whole operation in one of the other moves which are made-admit tedly most of them are of short duration. The freight rate can be loaded in those operations and then the Commission has no rights of investigation, no power under the amendment proposed by the Opposition to issue any direction as to unfair and unreasonable competition. We are trying to eliminate the unfair and unreasonable conditions which are built into transport today in the trade and commerce fields. This is the whole set-up of this BUl. This is why I rant nonsense. Furthermore, I have found out cannot make outI keep on repeating this because it is important and something that I cannot understand-wh y this great bastion of free enterpise which calls itself the Oppostion, the Liberal and Country Parties, is prepared to go out on a Umb to protect the large combines which exist in this country. These large combines are able to screw and able to manoeuvre prices and conditions to the disadvantage of the small businessman. If Opposition members are opposed to helping the smaU businessman, the private individual, whether he be in business or a person who is affected by the prices let them go on the way they are going at the present time; let them go on with the humbug of wasting time. We had an example earlier tonight where a division was called by the Opposition when the Leader of the House was prepared to let the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) speak on the matter. But no, honourable members opposite insisted on a division. This just shows the hypocrisy on the part of the Opposition. Honourable members opposite claim they want moretimeto examine the Bill. The real fact of the matter is that they have not done theh homework and they do not know what the BUl is all about. They have not sat down and done their work on it. That is why they want to defer the BUl. The Government rejects the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) because aU it does is create holes in the legislation with regard to the right of the Commission to investigate all the movements of goods from point A to point B.

It can be described as nothing more nor less. For the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) to describe the Opposition's tactics as humbug is simple, sheer humbug in itself. It is a disappointment to me that the Minister should carry on in such a way. We are trying to debate a Bill that carries implications which affect every man in the street. For the Minister to say that all we are trying to do is wanting to protect the multinationals again is sheer humbug in itself. It is absolute arthat the reason he is forcing this Bill through today is that he wants to get off to Perth. That is why he is not prepared to let the Bill be properly debated over a period of time.

If ever I have heard an example of therefore that the Government will see the sense of at least preventing this Inter-State Commission from becoming the commissar of all commissars and a dictator to the Parliament of I want to turn specifically to clause 13.1 have sought to omit the clause because the flimsy reasons put forward by the Minister in his second reading speech provide no justification, in the view of the Opposition, for the creation of such a monstrous instrument of bureaucracy. The Government already has powers to deal with the matters referred to by the Minister through the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Trade Practices Commission and other bodies. Its real motives are obviously undisclosed by the Government and this can only create further fear and uncertainty in a vital national industry. It has been put to me by the Victorian Government that the public will inevitably suffer increased fares and freight charges and a higher cost of living if this Bill is passed in its present form. The Constitution requires uniform freight charges throughhave decreased in recenttimes,and this federal measure can mean only increased charges, fares and freight across the board. One has only to look at the price increases in recent times in respect of federally controlled concerns such as Trans-Australia Airlines, the Australian National Railways and the Australian National Line and compare them with the movement in State transport rates over the same period. On the same point, it is noted by the State of Victoria that decisions of the Commission in the pricing area will override those of the Prices Justification Tribunal.

The Opposition beheves that if there is going to be an interstate commission it ought to have on it State representation. That is what a federal body is all about. That is what the Opposition would seek to do if it were in government. It would not set up some commissar all by itself. can get more than 4 votes in his Caucus he will have a right to speak in that manner. Interstate and overseas transport are so interconnected that it would be virtually impossible for the Commission to operate without dictation to States on internal transport policies and operations. Transport charges are most important components of the States' budgets and social pohcies and the Commission's influence on these charges would be prejudicial to the States' constitutional powers. The proposed power under clause 16(5) to make orders having the force of Commonwealth law could limit or alter the basic functions of State transport authorities. These are the realities that have been pointed out by the Premier of New South Wales in speaking of the wide effect of this Bill which has been so effectively gagged by this Government so that there can be no public debate on a major issue facing the nation. In relation to the ministerial power of direction of the Commission, and reviewing the Bill as a whole, there is potential for a most dangerous concentration of political power, free of customary democratic checks and balances and quite contrary to the whole concept of federalism. In this area, and a whole host of related areas, the Victorian Government believes that the State will be denied the right to determine pohcy, for example, decentralisation pohcies, which may include incentives by way of reduced freight charges to private compames to relocate in rural areas, can be affected by this Commission. This is quite apart from inroads into State transport policy. For example, clause 9 presumably empowers the Commission to rule out of order any limitations placed on road or other transport under the transport pohcies of the State. The Federal Government justifies the Bill by reference to the uncoordinated approach in relation to transport already apparent' between the States; for example, rail gauges, the approach to road networks. The argument is invalid. These factors are largely historical and the trend now is towards co-ordination of the approaches and pohcies of the States. The proposed council of States and the appointment of federal affairs ministers tion and prevent the repetition of history without any need for federal interference. I make the point again that there has been no attempt by this Government to seek the cooperation of the States on the matter of the InterState Commission BiU. This Bill runs far wider than the BUl which was proposed in either the Governor General's speech or the Minister's second reading speech. It carries clauses that are much wider even than those referred to by the Minister for Transport, affecting trade and commerce and prices. The Minister now attacks the Opposition in the House, saying that it is not interested in the subject of prices. The simple truth is that had the Mimster been honest in his approach to this Bill he would have laid down in his second reading speech all the aspects that the BUl wUl cover, including prices and including trade and commerce. The Opposition now has no option but to force debate for a longertimein another place so that the pubhc may be made aware of the horrendous and horrific Bill that has been introduced by this Government. It is a Bill that is socialist in intent, without a doubt, and it is quite clear from methods adopted by the Government in gagging the debate tonight that it wiU stop at nothing to have this BUl passed in the form in which it wants it at this time. Dr GUN (Kingston) (9.9)I rise to oppose specifically amendment No. 5 moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). Proposed new clause 5A seeks to negate the effect of clause 10 of the BUl as far as the 2airlines agreement is concerned. I remind honourable members that clause 10 of the Bill states that it is unlawful to give any person, State, locality or class or kind of transport any preference or advantage. Of course, there is no question that under the 2-airline agreement, brought in and sustained by previous Liberal Party governments, this sort of thing could not be upheld by an interstate commission and so the Opposition has tried specifically to defend its friend, Sir Reginald Ansett, in proposed new clause 5A, which seeks to exempt the Airlines Agreement Act from the powers of the InterState Commission. It was not enough for previous governments to try to insulate the 2-airline agreement against the election of a Labor Government. The Opposition is now trying to prevent this Government doing anything about trying to rescind it. I personally hope that the Inter-State Commission will be able to do something to overcome this iniquitous agreement entered into by previous Liberal Party governments in what must have been one of the most",65,Inter State Commission Bill 1975

166,Mr Nixon,"When the honourable membercorrupt decisions of previous Liberal governments. About one month before the last election the 2-airline agreement was extended from 1977 to 1982. I think that everybody ought to realise that unless the establishment of the Inter-State Commission has some effect on it then there is no other way that the 2-ahline agreement can be rescinded before 1982 at the very earliest. That is because of a condition contained in the Airlines Agreement Act of 1972. I have a copy of it in front of me. It is Mr William McMahon's httle monument to his standard of government. His signature appears with that of the 2 major airlines on an agreement in a Bill to which assent was given on 2 November 1972. The right honourable gentleman knew then that his government had had its day and that the elecuon of a Labor government was inevitable. So he sought to insulate his friend, Sh Reginald Ansett, from the possibility of a Labor government seeking to end the utterly iniquitous and outrageous 2-ahline agreement which had been sustained by successive governments. Let us look at some of the provisions contained individual company. That is not private in the 2-airline agreement. I beheve that the enterprise; that is gross interference with it. Why people of Australia ought to be made aware of does the right honourable member for Lowe not some of the enormous amount of featherhave something to say about that?

I would like to see the Governtween the Government and Ansett Transport ment do everything possible to try to undo the Industries, that is, the whole Ansett group.

I other words, we have to underwrite the operhope that the Inter-State Commission will be ations of the whole group-the television stations able to do something to override it. and the whole lot.

Who knows? A third airline or a fourth are 2 and not more than 2 operators of trunk airhne might come into the picture and be able to route airline services. I notice that the honourable member for Gippsland has said that the Inter-State Commission Bill is a socialist Bill. Can honourable members imagine anything more inimical to private enterprise than the restriction of any further operators from entering into the field of civil aviation? But that is what has been done. I hope that the right honourable member for Lowe will enter into this debate and tell us something about the contributions of ATI to Liberal Party and Country Party funds during successive elections. What else does the agreement do? The agreement then goes on to say something about guaranteeing loans for the purchase of aircraft. Why not do that for all other forms of private enterprise in Austraha? Then we come to section 8 of the Airlines Agreement Act. In it there is a requirement to provide a reasonable return on capital to Ansett Transport Industries. That refers to a return on capital in relation not only to the airlines but also to Channel0 in Melbourne and all the other branches of the group. What a fantastic amount of feather-bedding and protection of an I know, and I applaud, what the Minister for ahead with his cost recovery program to try to ticised for going ahead and trying to recover 80 costs recovered.

Is it proper to give the Minister the call? of order is involved. rejects the Opposition's amendments-the remaining 10 of them. I would hke to give some indication of the reasons in the time available to Mr Chahman. As far as the airlines are conme. I refer firstly to Amendment No. 3, which concerns the deletion of the reference to overseas ition in which it can investigate road operations, transport in clause 3. Interstate trade is just as raU operations and sea traffic but cannot interimportant as overseas trade and vice versa. Therefore, to delete any reference to overseas transport is in my opinion to take away one of the airline agreement is legal. This Parliament is the important responsibiUties of the Inter-State Commission because it would not then be in a position to investigate matters of importance to this country and ensure that our overseas trade is wrote into the Airlines Agreement Act many not being interfered with in any way by private individuals or for that matter by large companies for theh own personal gain. That is what we are setting out to try to do. I turn to amendment No. 4 as moved by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). The effect of acceptance of that amendment would be to delete a very useful clarification of the BUl. The Government is of the view that all the aspects of the transport operations are relevant to the operations of the Commission. So we feel that the deletion of this portion of the operations would destroy the impact of the BUl. I know that the honourable member for Gippsland would like me to comment on the proposed new clause 5A, which relates to the 2airline agreement. Once again we see influence being exerted upon certain honourable members opposite. Whenever one mentions airlines one can rest assured that the Airlines Agreement Act wUl come into it and that the Opposition will come post-haste to the defence and support of agreement being extended for another 5 years under most favourable terms and conditions. It was hammered through this ParUament in the dying hours of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government.

Those government's ensured that it was the instructions of that Committee in relation to buUt as efficiently as any project could be. It is the restricting of power to New South Wales. At true that the idea was launched by the Chifley the time this Committee was trying to break the Labor Government.

Although the Commission has been expecting the Government to appoint one of the highly to date, which includes 16 dams, 6 major power quaUfied personnel who have grown up with the stations, numerous roads, villages, aqueducts project, this has not happened. All that has happened is that Mr CoUins has been appointed Acting Director for the last two or three years. I bemissioners. It seems strange that the Minister and the Government could not take the bold decision The other thing I question is whether the aphis authority. I ask that question and make that allegation because of the experience in 1973 when the Mmister, at the behest of the Comcan be assured that there wUl be no extension of theh period of appointment? A great engineering undertaking such as this, which has cost $800m and all the rest of it will be handed over to a partnot explain anything, other than to say that he time chahman. Surely an undertaking costing $800m and with an income of $50m a year needs a chairman who has a lithe permanency. I know of no electrical authority in Austraha which is run by part-time commissioners or chairmen. Certainly, the New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian electrical authorities have not got part-time chairmen. I think that if we are to get good men of high calibre we must offer these people some assurance that there will be security of office, that they under a person employed in a part-time will not be employed on a year to year basis, that at least they will be there for a substanual period of time. Seven years was considered to be a fah and reasonable time for a person to occupy such an important position. So we wonder why this has been changed. The Mimster has said, as I have said, that the construction stage is finished. That may be so. But it is still a big job managing an undertaking such as this. The Minister talks only about the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. He does not mention anything about the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation which is covered by a separate Act of Parliament. But up to this point oftimethere has been a common chairman or commissioner for both organisations. Mr of the Parliament to get a nice fat juicy jobI can CoUins has been the acting chahman or commissioner-for both of these organisations. I suppose that now we wUl have 2 different heads for the 2 organisations. One of the great beauties about having a joint chahman for both organisations was that there was a chance for overlapping of employment, for knowing the personnel of both organisations and being able to capitalise on the experience and the knowledge of both organisations. But I gather now that we will have different personnel for different organisations. But why does the Minister deal only with the power generating function of the Snowy MounSnowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority? tains Hydro-Electric Authority has been transferWhy are we not also dealing with the Snowy red by an Act of Parhament to the Snowy MounMountains Engineering Corporation?

Do honourable members wonder why we question him? Do they wonder why that great Australian organisation, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority which was producing approximately 5000 kUowatt hours of peak load power, a vital key in our whole electrical grid in New South Wales and Victoria, should come capacity? This is an authority which is supplying about 2 500 000 cubic feet of water for the irrigation schemes along the River Murray Irrigation area. Yet we are told that the Authority should have a part-time chahman, perhaps employed on a year to year basis with part-time associate commissioners. It is very curious that this organisation should be threatened with being down-graded to that extent. The Opposition does not really see the need for this, although we will not resist it. But we genuinely question what is happening.

This is a turning point from a Price is an example ofjobs for the boys I am sure, knowing him as well as I do, that he will be the most surprised person to hear the news.

The has been constructed, and having to go out and fact that all the positions created have been filled demonstrates the shallowness of the honourable member's claim that this is a dodge to create jobs for the boys. As I read the Bill-perhap s there may be some subtlety to it-it will reduce jobs rather than increase them. Having said that, I think that we need to pick up one or two other points from history because, after all, this is a massive scheme which has received world acclaim, a turning point for organisations, one which was created to operate the scheme and the other to generate new business and new achievements for the engineers who built the project. In spite of what we heard from members of the Liberal and Country Parties, history shows that members of the Liberal Party boycotted the scheme when it was commenced in 1949 under the Chifley Government. Not one member of the Liberal Party was present at the opening of the scheme. Yet tonight we heard members of the Opposition claim credit for this scheme. We also heard the proposition that there is an We as a country were able to launch the the engineers of the Snowy Mountains Engineerfind work. One of the new talents that is necessary in the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is that of salesmanship and going out into the world and drumming up business. This is something that did not have to be done under the Snowy Mountains Authority. This small Bill which seeks to amend the original Act proposes simply to bring into line the responsibilities of the Snowy Mountains Authority. It simply provides a directorate for the Snowy Mountains Authority which is commensurate with the reduced responsibilities that the Authority has. It is in every sense of the word a caretaker organisation, a shell of the great organisation which constructed the scheme that we know so well. The Snowy Mountains Council, on the other hand, is a strong and virile group which will exist as long as the organisation is generating power. Most of the comments that the Leader of the Australian Country Party directed at this legislation tonight should have been directed at the Snowy Mountains Council. This legislation has nothing at all to do with the operAustraha. It is for that reason that I speak to this ation of the scheme. It is an acknowledgment of history and at this stage a development of the organisation. I beheve, it is worthwhile just to ponder the significance of what is one of the finest achievements in engineering in the world. The Snowy Mountains scheme which was carried out by Austrahans is a tribute to those who worked on it, and a tribute to the Chifley Government which initiated the organisation. It is a tribute to judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales the faith of that Prime Minister in Austrahans. Although it might appear that we are putting the Snowy Mountains Authority to rest, I beheve that we are seeing the turning point between the Snowy Mountains Authority whose achievements have been discharged in Australia and the new organisation in SMEC which will see Australians demonstrate that they can carry this sort of achievement to overseas countries. I am extremely proud to represent these people as theh Federal member. I can assure them that we will go from strength to strength provided that they themselves bring to bear under SMEC the same drive and innovation as they displayed under the Snowy Mountains Authority. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Connor) read a third time. Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 April on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the BiU be now read a second time. Bill is a most important piece of legislation and it affects a probably unique body in any federation in the world which exists to look after the financial fortunes of the constituent parts of that federation. In other words, the Grants Commission exists, and has existed for over 40 years, to look after the affairs, the services and the standards available to the citizens in each of the States within the Australian Federation. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is not repeated in any other pan of the world, nor has any body in any other part of the world attained the same expertise as the Grants Commission has developed in Bill. The Bill is very short and seeks to amend the principal Act by appointing a new Chairman to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The appointment of His Honour Mr Justice ElseMitchell as chairman of the Commission deserves one or two comments. One of those comments is of necessity a rather sad comment. Mr Justice Else-Mitchell is a lawyer. He was a for a considerable period. No doubt, he is an eminent lawyer. He has been appointed to the chairmanship of the most complex body dealing with complex inter-governmentalfinancialrelationships that exist in this country and I suggest that it is not appropriate that a person with the training of a lawyer be appointed to the Commission. Mr Justice Else-Mitchell succeeds as chahman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Sh Leslie Melville who was an economist and banker of international repute. Sir Leslie has not been followed by a person of similar standing or training. In fact, if the same logic were used in regard to an appointment to the next vacancy on a Supreme Court or the High Court of Australia one might look to the profession of accountant. However, it is not my purpose tonight to pursue that line; I mention it only en passant. What are the results of the operation of the Grants Commission? A sense of equality has been pursued and developed amongst the various States in Australia which has not been",72,Snowy Mountains
188,Mr Kevin Cairns (Lilley) (10.6),"Thisrepeated anywhere else in the world. A monumental study some years ago by the famous economist Williams in Chicago pointed out that the diversity of standards, the dispersion of stanin this House. It has been stated that one of the dards of living and of pubhc services in Austraha are less between one part of the country and another than in any other nation in the world. The work was a monumental tour de force which examined the great nations, the large federations of the world such as Canada and the United States of America, as well as some of the very small nations with their own distinct and distinctive regions. The existence of that equality and the lack of dispersion of standards in Australia can be ascribed very largely to the work of the Grants Commission, especially insofar as the work of the Commission involved the determination of grants as between the States. As we know, the Commission has determined over the last 2 years-it did so for the first time last year-that the standards that apphed were to apply in respect of local government authorites. Even an attempt to pursue a measure of fiscal equalisation or a similar equahsation of standards between the local government authorities in Australia must fail because of its nature. It cannot be done. I would suggest that no matter how many was a judge of a Federal or State court, to have extra appointments are made to the Comthe same designation, rank, status and premission, it will not be able to fulfil in respect of cedence as a judge of the Australian Capital local government authorities what it has been Territory Supreme Court, and also to incorporate able to fulfil in respect of sovereign State governmachinery changes consequent on the existence ments.

But if one to its provisions and not carry on an allwould think for a moment that the work of the embracing debate dealing with the whole quesCommission is going to be a bed of roses, a little tion of the Grants Commission. history would quickly dispel that proposition. For many years Tasmania had a very famous Treasurer by the name of Mr Dwyer Gray. Tas Mr Deputy Speaker, that I would draw to your mama was one of the original mendicant States attention that the title of the BUl allows for very applying to the Grants Commission and, when wide discussion of the principal Act, which is the the Commission did not make an appropriate Grants Commission Act 1973. I have already grant for Tasmama, Mr Dwyer Gray said of the had circulated an amendment with which I may members of the Commission that he 'would not or may not proceed at the appropriate time. care a straw if the Grants Commission were Were it to be proceeded with, that amendment abolished, or if the members so took offence that would apply in respect of the principal Act. In they resigned in a body'. So the new Chairman, fact, the title of the BUl is very wide, and I think whatever his obligations and whatever his tasks, that would be immediately obvious on looking at cannot and ought not necessarily to look forward the title itself. to an easy life without any difficulties and without any trials and tribulations. Above all, insofar as the Commission would pursue and will pursue amend some comparatively quite minor sections the aim of horizontal equality between the States of the principal Act; it does not allow for a of Austraha, it ought to be retained and it ought general discussion on the whole range of pronot to be allowed to go out of existence. It is in respect of that proposition that I must make my first comment on today's events. The Inter-State Commission BiU has just been passed functions that would apply to the Inter-State Commission would be for it to substitute itself for the Grants Commission. That point of view has been stated often by a number of authorities. I put this to the Mimster for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) who is at the table: If the one remaining claimant State is induced to withdraw from the area of the Commission, wUl the Government ensure that the nature of the work of the Commission between the States is continued? There is only one claimant State left. Tasmama was induced to get out of the Commission for thetimebeingOrder! I draw the honourable member's attention to the provisions of the Grants Commission BUl. I think he is moving a little wide of its provisions. In brief, the purpose of the Bill is to appoint a further fuU time member to the Commission to reUeve the onerous physical burden placed on the existing members of the Commission, to amend the Act to enable the Chahman, who immediately before his appointment visions of the Grants Commission.",74,Grants Commission Bill 1975

191,Mr Deputy Speaker,"The Bill seeks towould suggest that it is so wide that it would allow even amendments to be proposed in respect of the principal Act. I wish to refer to the circumstances of the appointment. order. You can speak on matters that are covered in the BUl. The amendment to which you referred wUl be moved in the Committee stage and not at this stage during the second reading debate. the manner in which the Commission wUl function under the new Chahman, that is, I direct my remarks to the Grants Commission as it wUl exist under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Else MitcheU. In those circumstances, and looking forward only a few months, I have requested the Government to indicate what wUl be done to the Commission if, even within a few months, there were to be no claimant State. I am assured that the Minister at the table would be deUghted to give an appropriate answer to that quesuon when he replies to the second reading debate. I suggest that it would not be in the interests of AustraUa if the Grants Commission were to vanish or be induced to vanish by persuading the one remaining claimant State to cease bemg a claimant State. My other proposition is concerned with the activities of the Commission within the next few months. In that regard I refer to a question that was asked of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) concerning the Grants Commission as it wUl exist under the chairman who has been appointed. My quesuon to the Prime Minister was on 5 March 1975 and related to the funds which are due to be given to those States which negotiate a Commonwealth-State hospitals agreement under what is euphemistically called Medibank. I asked the Prime Minister: In the arrangements being negotiated with the States concerning the hospital-that is the government or public hospitals-aspect s of Medibank are assurances included which would guarantee that any relief given to State budgets by a Commonwealth contribution would be disregarded so far as a claimant State's application to the Grants Commission is concerned or, that a claimant State would not be penalised in its special grants due to the Government's scheme. If necessary, to ensure that there is no penalty will the Prime Minister the consideration of the Commission under Mr seek to bring about an appropriate amendmentagain remind the honourable member that the Grants Commission BUl which we are discussing is very narrow hi its provisions. It seeks only to amend 3 sections of the Act. The matters with which the honourable member is now dealing have no relationship whatsoever to this BUl. I must ask him to ensure that he confines his remarks to the provisions of this BUl, which seeks to make 3 amendments to the principal Act, and to the particular amendments for which the Bill provides. Otherwise I wiU have to ask h i m Deputy Speaker. You wiU be aware, of course, if you have examined the second reading speech of the Special Mmister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen), that the BUl provides for the appointment of a further full-time member to the Grants Commission to relieve the onerous physical burden, stemming from the heavy work load and considerable travel, on the 4 existing full time members of the Local Government Division of the Commission. The second aspect of the Minister's second reading speech deals with amending the Grants Commission Act to enable the Chairman, such as the present Chahman, to have a certain designation as the Chairman of the Commission. That being so, I would suggest to the Chair that it would be appropriate to ask what would be the attitude of the Chahman of that Commission in the circumstance that this Bill were passed by the House and in the circumstance that he assumed that designation, role and status as Chahman of the Grants Commission. I beUeve that that would be an appropriate question to put in relation to the BUl and in relation to the only claimant State which appears before the Grants Commission. The Prime Minister very generously in reply to that question stated: I am very glad to give the assurance that the honourable gendeman seeks. The honourable gentleman was myself. It is only in respect of those assurances that I put this proposition to the Minister. It is my calculation that one of the first actions of the Grants Commission under the new Chahman wUl be to determine the grant which applies in respect of my State of Queensland. It is also my concern that if the other standard States do not enter the public hospitals aspect of Medibank the one remaining State which appears before Mr Justice Else-Mitchell could well be disadvantaged. It is in relation to that disadvantage that I put a question to the Special Minister of State who is at the table. If those circumstances are brought about and if an amendment which wUl exclude from Justice Else-Mitchell the payments made under the National Health Act is not proceeded with, what guarantees can be given so that the $ 10m to $30m-that is the amount of the various calculations-of the grant to the remaining claimant State wUl not be surrendered; in other words that the grant will not go into one pocket this year",75,Grants Commission Bill 1975

I have listened to the honourable member for Lilley and I nouce the points he is making in no way relate to the matter before the House. I want to reinforce what has been said. The purpose of this Bill is to appoint a further member to the Grants Commission, to give a designation to the Chairman and also to deal with remuneration. It does nothing else. The proposal about which the honourable member is talking is what the Grants Commission should do in its functioning. This amending Bill merely deals with the number on the Commission, the designation of the Chairman, and remuneration. I submit that the honourable member ought to confine his remarks to these matters. uphold the point of order. I have already pointed out to the honourable member that he is going far beyond the ambit of the Bill. Unless he abides by my ruling in that respect I shall have to ask him to resume his seat. I take the point that the honourable member is trying to deal with a matter which stems virtually from the words 'heavy workload'. He is carrying on from there to talk of a particular State, whether it comes within the ambit of the Bill and so on. That has no relationship to the BUl whatsoever. If the BUl sought to increase the number of full time members in order to do that work the honourable member could talk about that aspect. But the BUl does not do that. I must uphold the point of order. I ask the honourable member to stick to and refer to matters contained in the BUl you are quite correct in your assessment of what I lower echelon of the farming community. I enwas saying.

It is usually a person who has been completely obnoxious to the Austrahan Labor Party. It is usually the big wheeler dealer who comes in. He can afford to speculate for a few years. He can make an absolute and unrealistic profit out of the farming area and he can take his net gain after a period to the detriment of the original owner of the property. Many measures have been suggested to the Government to reheve the current position. Last Thursday night I suggested that the Rural Reconstruction Authority charter should be changed. The main point I had time to make then was that the charter and the scope of the Rural Reconstruction Authority should be extended to enable it to assist farmers where long term viability was not established but where operating expenses could be met in the short and medium term. In such cases total debts could be taken over and the loan could be repaid over 25 to 30 years at a nominal interest rate. I am afraid to this type of farmer. When I say 'this type of to say that the rate would have to be nominal because of the farmers' position. This type of lendland farmers of Western Australia, first genering was conducted by the Commonwealth Development Bank for many of the Ord River farmers so it is nothing new. Total seasonal carry-on requirements were provided year by year upon a crop lien and properly mortgaged security. The expansion of the Authority would require at least some degree of managed credit. When the tide eventually changes and when for who can really say just what the price of a prosperity reappears in the rural areas the farmer product will be in X years time? Within the last could either sell his property upon an improved few years we have seen dramatic rises in the wool land market or he could continue farming, possand beef industries, and such dramatic falls.

It may be that a pension-type scheme, as I pointed out earlier that those who are in a position to snap up these forced sale farms will not in the main be people who are doing so to carry on the farming traditions. They are doing so to make a quick dollar. The average farmer is known to be very efficient. He posseses managerial skills and local experience that allow him to achieve worthwhile results. The present predicament he faces is brought about by political and external contrivance over which he has no control and of which he has httle prior warning. I believe that the Rural Reconstruction Authority has demonstrated that it has the necessary expertise, particularly in Western Australia, and the flexibility to handle the existing scheme effectively. It is well within its capabihties to include for loan consideration those farmers who can meet their operating expenses so that their debts are bedded down over 25 to 30 years at low interest rates. An infant industry principle could be apphed farmer' I suppose I have in mind mainly the new ation farmers, who have developed their land within the last 15 to 20 years, some only recently. They have not had time to establish themselves. For most of them the major part of their existing structure would be loans from the Commonwealth Development Bank. Before they took out these loans they had to prove long term viability. The proving of viability at any time is awkward, 1 call it, could be worked out whereby such farmers could be kept on their land to continue production and to make a contibution to society and be happy in what they are doing. tonight to talk about the attitude of the New South Wales Premier towards the funds that are being given to his Government by the Austrahan Government for local government activities. Recently three men were laid off by the Crookwell Shire Council on the grounds that it did not have funds to employ those men. This occurred about 2 months ago. It occurred at a time when the New South Wales Government received $76.6m from the Australian Government in order to avoid the type of event that occurred in Crookwell. At the Premiers' Conference in February the Treasurer (Dr. J. F. Cairns) insisted that this money would be used by the States to avoid retrenchments in State and local government instrumentalities, yet when the Crookwell Shire Council approached the State Government it was informed that the State Government had no money because the Australian Government was starving it of funds. Not only did New South Wales get this grant of $76.6m as recently as February, but also it received from this Government record grants to discharge its responsibiUties under both tied grants and general revenue grants. Since the Government took oflice the States have received increases of nearly 60 per cent in funds allocated to them by the Australian Government. Yet we find this persistent statement being made by the Premier of New South Wales and his Ministers that they have no funds with which to discharge their responsibiUties towards local government. The Crookwell Shire CouncU is one of a number that has flagged this particular problem. Each time they approach the State Governmrent they are told that the Austrahan Government is starving the State of funds. I believe that there are a number of questions raised. The first is the simple question: How funds to the States. No other Federal Governmuch faith can we place in the State Government and its capacity to meet its commitments? Did the New South Wales Government reaUy take seriously the statement made by the Treasurer when allocating the $76.6m to New South Wales for the purpose of avoiding retrenchments, or did it take that money under false pretences? Not only in Crookwell, although this is the most blatant example in my electorate, butrightthroughout my electorate the State Government has faUed to deliver that money to avoid retrenchments in local government projects. Another point which needs to be considered in regard to the attitude that the States are displaying is whether other mechanisms need to be devised to make sure that local government is not starved of funds. In the roads grant the States were given $1,160m for roads. honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland). If that was not enough then how much less could they expect from the Opposition if it were in government? Three years before, the Liberal Country Party Government gave the States $840m. Since that time, our Government has given the States $1,160m plus adjustmentsa massive increase. We took the full responsibUity for the national highway system in New South Wales; an amount of $28m was budgeted for that highway system which included the Hume Highway and the New England Highway. It was supposed to go to local government bodies but they never saw it. That $2 8m has evaporated into the coffers of the New South Wales State Government. Where did that money go to? The question needs to be answered by the New South Wales State Government. It was all very well for Sh Charles Cutler in the Goulburn by-election to stand up and claim that his Government had spent $53m on the Hume Highway over 2 years. Yet2 months later, such is his judgment of honesty, he claimed that his Government had not spent anything and in fact the commitment by the Austrahan Government to national highways had released no funds. It is great for Sir Charles Cutler to make such a claim on an election platform when it suits him to big-note his Government. It then seems possible for his Government to turn around and take exactly the opposite point of view 2 months later, when it suits him to cry poor mouth to the Australian Government. I beUeve that this is something to which the electorate should have its attention drawn. No other federal government has given such large ment has embarked upon so many community projects that involve the people at the grass roots level. Sir Charles Cutler goes to Braidwood and tells the people that the grants from the National Estate cannot be approved by the State Government. Why could they not be approved? He said that the States needed the responsibUity for that money. He said that it was not proper for the Braidwood Historical Society to have the responsibUity. Sh Charles Cutler, this man who condemns the AustraUan Government for being socialist in its nature, is not prepared to disseminate this money to the people at the grass roots",77,Adjournment

The bitterness, the resentment are deep and universal. others at other times in other parts of Vietnam-for instance, when the communists took Hue. The evidence is there. Mr Speaker, the evidence is not there. The evidence is quite to the contrary, and in this paper that I have here written by that respected scholar, Colin Mackerras, about the Hue massacre, he stated, among other things, that accounts of Hue: have conveniently forgotten the damage caused by American bombing, and one almost gains the impression that they believe that bombs and napalm do not kill people. Undoubtedly the Communists were responsible for some of the deaths, but very much fewer than Nixon and others would have us believe. The Americans bombed Hue persistently and fiercely to re-assert control. One American timated at thetimethat at least 4000 of Hue's residents had been killed in the cross-fire. and he wrote this statementthe' New York Times' on 7 March 1968. member for Boothby will not make a speech while another honourable member is making a speech. I suggest that he remain silent. The honourable member for Diamond Valley will not answer interjections. They are not worth answering anyway. member for Boothby will remain silent. American or North Vietnamese sources of the number of Hue residents killed is 5700. Stewart Harris of the London 'Times' quotes as the most conservativefiguresthose of the Hue chief of pohce, Doan Cong Lap. The police chief in Hue is certainly not someone whom you would expect to be sympathetic to the communists. He stated that the communists were directly responsible for 200 deaths in the city, while civilian casualties due to bombing and cross-fire totalled 3776, with about 1900 wounded. As I said, the Hue chief of pohce can hardly be accused of having Viet Cong sympathies. Marc Riboud of 'Le Monde', a witness to the Hue fighting, has stated: Every remark I overheard, every person I spoke to, blamed the Americans and their blind and systemadc bombThe honourable member for Gwydir has accepted the claim, without looking at more independent evidence, that the deaths at Hue were the responsibihty of 'the cruel communist aggressor, who seems to invest himself with the divine right to inflict the most inhuman savagery on the enemy'. Those are the words of the honourable member for Gwydir. He totally overlooked the massive and indiscriminate bombing by the Americans and the cross-fire during the offensive. the Vietcong were responsible for deaths in Hue and no doubt they did execute people whom they regarded as collaborators. But it is quite dishonest to use arguments similar to the ones that the honourable member for Gwydir used in relation to Hue as evidence for his assertion that tens of thousands of innocent people would be slaughtered and murdered by the Vietcong if and when, as seems Ukely, the city of Saigon falls. paper? ditional evidence on what the situation ismember for Boothby will remain sUent. honourable member wishes to make a speech he should put his name down in the same way as everybody else.

238,Mr Mckenzie,"On Sunday, 6 April, it isThe following answers to questions were circulated: Voluntary Organisations: Federal Headquarters (QuestionNo. 1451) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for the Capital received. Territory, upon notice: (1) What voluntary organisations have requested financial assistance from his Department for the establishment or maintenance of a federal headquarters. (2) What has been the response to the requests. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Over the years a number of organisauons have applied to the Department of the Capital Territory (or its predecessor the Department of the Interior) for the grant of a lease of land upon which to establish nadonal headquarters. I have had some difficulty however in deciding which of the applicant bodies come within the term 'voluntary organisauons'. I have interpreted it to include only those bodies mvolved in social, charitable or welfare work. Direct nnancial assistance has not been sought by any of these applicants but as leases are normally granted to such bodies on a concessional basis, a nnancial benefit does derive. On this basis, voluntary organisations who have been granted leases in Canberra for the purpose of federal headquarters are:The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust The Returned Services League of Australia. Bodies who have expressed interest in building a federal headquarters in Canberra but who for one reason or another have not yet been granted a lease are:The Nauonai Heart Foundation of Australia A.C.T. Table Tennis Association The Equestrian Association of the Australian Capital Territory Australian Council for Overseas Aid Australian American Educational Foundation. Ministerial Press Releases (Question No. 1650) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) How are copies of Ministerial press releases circulated. (2) To whom are they circulated. (3) How many copies are circulated in total. (4) What is the total annual cost, including salary and administration charges, in producing and distributing Ministerial press releases. (5) How many public servants in his Department are involved with the distribution of press releases. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Copies of my press releases are distributed by hand to the Press Gallery by publication in the Australian Government Digest and by mail from my Department. (2) Press releases are distributed to all Members and Senators, media organisations, Government Departments, Embassies, political party organisations, libraries and individuals and organisations from whom requests are (3) About 1000 copies of each release are circulated. (4) and (5) The costs of producing and distributing Ministerial press releases and numbers of staff involved are not readily available as reproduction units are engaged continually on producing a variety of printed material. The costs attributable to the press releases have not been separately maintained. Health Insurance Funds (QuestionNo. 1840) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Has he stated that the health insurance funds will be encouraged to provide insurance for intermediate and private ward patients after the Government's health insurance scheme commences. (2) If so, what financialreserveswill he allow, or what reserves does he believe is essential for these funds to have at thattime,so that they can provide guaranteed insurance protection from commencement date. (3) Will the special account be retained to assist long term patients with insurance in intermediate or private wards. (4) Will any restrictions be placed on the type or length of cover the insurance funds will be allowed to provide. member's quesuon is as follows: I have delayed in replying to the honourable member's question until thistimeas the manner in which private hospital insurance will be conducted after the introduction of Medibank on 1 July 1975 has not been clear. The Government proposed to introduce a special bill directed specifically to the supervision of private health insurance and, as a complementary measure, to repeal those parts of the National Health Act which are directed to the supervision of registered medical and hospital benefits organisations. The honourable member will be aware that the amending National Health Bills wererejectedby the Senate. The rejection of the amending National Health Bills has meant that not only are some aspects of the Government's policy in this matter, as set out in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.14 of the White Paper 'The Australian Health Insurance Program', not achievable immediately, but that other measures providing for the protection of the commumty have also been lost. For example, the defeat of the Bills means that the Government cannot uke over the payment of nursing home benefits for non P.M.S. pensioners that are at present paid by hospital benefits funds, as was proposed in paragraph 5.4 of the White Paper, and also that any health insurance fund with inadequate reserves will not be able to be subsidised as proposed in paragraph 5.7 of the White Paper. The answers to the honourable member's specific questions are as follows:(1) Yes, see paragraphs 5.5 of the White Paper.
