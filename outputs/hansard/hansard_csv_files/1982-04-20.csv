I will come to by officers at the work face that it was a colour that in a moment. That relates to the implications television and that they could not accept this sort of conspiracy. of doublespeak because it was, bluntly, contradictory. What is significant in terms of what I am raising is that an officer was told to shut up.

The information received is that Mr backed by his colleagues who work at that level, Montgomery then contacted Mr Besley, the head someone at the Canberra end persisted in the asof the Bureau of Customs, and that Mr Besley sertion that it was a black and white television set. then contacted Mr Moore, as Minister in charge of Customs.

On a later page a sub-heading states formation or large portions of it, that my officers 'Matter should not be put to rest, say union received from not one but three separate sources officers'.

Again, my office trouble a little more than a week after the incident has received information from a source which I arose-when he arrived in this country-to write would regard as reliable. That information is that to the then Minister in charge of Customs advising either the Prime Minister or the Department of that he was prepared to pay any duty?

Yet, it will allocate only $734m under Queensland, so many people come out to blame this program. I am certainly not one who says that on the state of the roads the high accident rate taxation picked up in a particular area should be that has been so much in the news. I regret to say spent in that area. If that were the case, we could that many of those who have been making such say that the people who are taxed on tobacco remarks and trying to score political points should could expect bigger and better public ashtrays. I know better and, in fact, do. I include in that feel that because of the need for road works the number the Minister for Main Roads in States and local government should expect a Queensland. The state of the roads is one factor higher proportion of the money raised in petrol contributing to road accidents; there are many tax to go into our road works programs. others.

Thus, the ratio was one represent country electorates, to support the accident for each 108 vehicles, but in 1974-75 it proposed amendment. was one accident to 98 vehicles. When we consider that and other factors, the ratio is seen as mon with many other speakers in this debate, I acexample, in 1960 some 2,468 persons, or 8.8 per knowledge that the funds provided to the States 10,000 vehicles, were killed on our roads. In 1980, for roads are insufficient and probably never will 20 years later, unfortunately 3,272 people were be sufficient. The Minister for Transport ( Mr killed. But at that time the ratio of fatalities per Hunt) acknowledged that in his second reading ten thousand vehicles was 4.3, less than half the speech. We all sincerely hope that we will see a 1960 figure. So the ratio is down but I regret that higher priority accorded to road funding in the it is still not as good as it is in other developed forthcoming Budget. There is no doubt that, apart countries, for example the United Kingdom, the from the use of our roads for general purposes, United States of America or Canada. our defence roads system is in a state of disrepair. The big drop in those ratios started in 1970 and I need hardly mention the benefits that better although it is impossible to prove conclusively roads bring to the general economy, to tourism there must be some correlation between the and to recreation, or the very essential point that figures for 1970 and the fact that that year seat good roads keep people in the country, where belts were generally introduced in this country.
