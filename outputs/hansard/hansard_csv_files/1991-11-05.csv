State government in this case, for the raising of its revenue vis-a-vis the responsibility that As the honourable member also knows, it has for spending. So the concept of from his legal knowledge, in regard to excise reducing the vertical fiscal imbalance involves we have this grey area where we have sort of trying to get a closer equation between the franchise fees of the States which are quasiresponsibility that a particular level of excise in their nature.
