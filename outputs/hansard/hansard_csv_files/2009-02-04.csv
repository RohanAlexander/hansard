Wednesday, 4 February 2009 ----the chamber does not have a quorum. Without the presence of an opposition member I cannot start the proceedings of the Main Committee. The Main Committee will stand suspended until 10.30 am or a later hour today. I thank everybody for their assistance. Sitting suspended from 9.33 am to 10.32 am Sri Lanka On behalf of the people I represent I again raise my very serious concerns about the conflict in Sri Lanka. On many occasions I have spoken of the violence and the violations of human rights in Sri Lanka. The many people who have been displaced and the families of those who have been killed surely deserve lasting peace. They deserve the chance to pick up the pieces and to resume their lives without the fear of violence, retribution and human rights breaches. I have heard too many heart-wrenching stories from many families who now peacefully reside in my electorate of Lowe. They are experiences that are difficult to retell and to comprehend, but if there is one thing that this appalling conflict has taught us it is that violence and a military solution is not the answer. Violence begets violence; war begets war. The never-ending cycle of violence has a devastating impact on humanity. Mahatma Gandhi got it right when he said, ‘An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind.’ All reasonable people, be they Tamil, Sinhalese or Muslim, are demanding a negotiated political settlement to bring lasting peace to Sri Lanka. They are demanding a resolution based on resolute political will, not military might. They recognise, as all reasonable people do, that no political, cultural or religious dispute justifies the loss of so many innocent lives. To this end I am pleased that the Rudd government has persisted in its call for all parties in the conflict to move quickly to negotiations which take account of the reasonable aspirations of all people. It is vital that every effort be made to avoid civilian casualties and to act swiftly to mitigate humanitarian hardship in this conflict. That can never happen without a genuine ceasefire. The building blocks of self-determination cannot begin without a genuine ceasefire that is adhered to by all parties. Surely the people I represent here and their families in Sri Lanka deserve nothing less. The pain that many of them have already endured is enough. We must in their names and in their memory seize the opportunity to work together to bring all parties to the negotiating table. Apathy about the conflict is simply not an option. Working together towards an orderly coexistence which brings about peace and prosperity in Sri Lanka is the only option. This is the call from peace-loving Tamils and Sinhalese. It is the call from many national and international observers, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Red Cross. It is the call from my constituents and it is the call I repeat in this parliament today. If we are to emerge from the blindness and the darkness that so concerned Mahatma Gandhi, it is a call we must all embrace today. MAIN COMMITTEE",292,Adjournment

284,Mr Murphy (Lowe,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (10.32 am)Forrest Electorate: Mrs Judith Talbot Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.35 am)-I rise to acknowledge community volunteers; in particular, I acknowledge Judy Talbot from Brunswick Junction in my electorate. Judy was awarded one of the highest national honours, the Order of Australia Medal, on Australia Day for her outstanding lifetime services to the community. Judy is not only a tireless, passionate and dedicated contributor to Brunswick and the Harvey shire; she is also the first person ever from the little country town of Brunswick to receive the OAM. I am sure that her family, her friends and the whole community are very proud and are still celebrating her achievement. There are very few groups and organisations that Judy has not assisted at some time in her life. She has been a member and office bearer of the Brunswick Red Cross unit since 1965, and she has held the office of president since 1995. She has been president of the Leschenault region Red Cross, and she has worked as head steward of the widely respected flower section of the local show as a member of the Brunswick Agricultural Society. The Brunswick Show is widely recognised as the largest one-day show in Australia. Judy was also the society’s publicity officer for 20 years. She is a life member of the Koombana Bay Sailing Club. She has been the club commodore and was the publicity officer for 20 years and radio officer for 30 years. She is the publicity officer for the Brunswick Lions Club and was a volunteer for over 40 years before becoming an official member. Judy has also held the position of Secretary of the Brunswick-Burekup Anglican Ladies Guild. She is a member of the Brunswick Disaster Committee, a life member of the Brunswick Christian Primary School P&C and has been secretary of the Brunswick self-help group since 1992. She is a committee member of the Harvey shire Meals on Wheels and secretary of the Shire of Harvey senior citizens bus committee. With all of this, it is not surprising that Judy has received the Red Cross service award, the rough tough gold medal of the WA Yachting Association and a Harvey shire meritorious service award. The Principal of the Harvey Senior High School at the time Judy assisted their P&C also commented to me that he doubted the school would have been able to fund and build their gymnasium without Judy’s dedication and strong support of the project. The other thing Judy does is to encourage every community member. Local achievers all receive a lovely congratulatory note from her, and families who lose a loved one all receive a very genuine card or note from her. If you are in trouble, Judy is the first one to offer help. She is a wonderful example of the true spirit of small community volunteers in Australia. Congratulations to Judy. Blair Electorate: Cancer Council of Queensland Cancer Council of Queensland. The Cancer Council of Queensland is the leading anticancer organisation in Queensland and provides a vital link between the public and people with cancer in Queensland. Currently, one in three Queenslanders will be diagnosed with this lifethreatening disease. My family has been touched. I wish my father well: he is currently suffering from prostate cancer and bone cancer. It has been my privilege to go to the Dugandan Dive for the last three years. On Saturday, 24 January 2009 it was held at the Dugandan pub and the Dugandan oval. The event is known as the Dugandan Hotel annual skydive. Winnie Parker and her husband Gary have organised MAIN COMMITTEE",294,Constituency Statements
285,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10.37 Am),"I wish to speak about the Dugandan Dive and thethe Dungandan Dive for the last three years to raise funds for the Cancer Council of Queensland. The Dugandan Dive originated in 2007, and its genesis can be traced to Win’s decision to parachute-jump for her 50th birthday to try to overcome her long-held fear of flights and of heights. Win discussed her wishes with the locals at the pub, which is located just south of the township of Boonah. Win could hardly believe how many people dreamed of skydiving themselves. At the time, one of her staff members had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, so the decision of Win and Gary to do this provided a great opportunity for the Cancer Council of Queensland to promote its organisation in the Boonah shire. Sadly, a second staff member was diagnosed shortly thereafter. The Parkers approached a skydive company and learned that landings could be held on the oval just opposite the pub. A country carnival has been created. Rim FM 100.1 operates there. There are vocalists and musicians, and artisans and local businesspeople ply their wares. They have asked for donations, and in 2007 they raised $16,717. In 2008, $35,000 was raised. So far this year over $20,000 has been raised by the tireless team of staff and volunteers, as well as Win and Gary. Win said to me recently that it is nearly impossible to talk to someone who has not been affected by cancer. Nicole Baker, the fundraising officer of the Cancer Council of Queensland has been effusive in her praise of Win and Gary and the volunteers. In honour of the efforts of Win and Gary, the Cancer Council of Queensland has created a research grant which helps fund breast cancer research and the employment of a professor at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. This is an important activity in my area. Congratulations to Win, Gary and the local community. They are a tribute to the whole Boonah shire. Nuclear Energy Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (10.41 am)-I wish to raise again the issue of nuclear power and the Labor government’s secretive and hypocritical stance on the issue. It was reported in the West Australian on 24 January that the Rudd government has secretly maintained a role in a controversial US nuclear energy pact. This is indicative of the dishonest handling of this issue by the Labor government. In opposition, Labor attacked the coalition government for looking to the future of energy provision by having an inquiry into nuclear energy, headed by Ziggy Switkowski. Oddly enough, there appears to have been very little comment from the Left on this new-found interest, albeit previously unannounced, of Labor in nuclear power. No doubt, had it been John Howard who had suggested such a thing, there would have been marches through the streets by the usual cast of skeleton attired professional protesters flourishing the obligatory cardboard coffins. Now we find that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, apparently signed off on a proposal for Australian officials to participate in talks in Vienna last September on how to manage spent nuclear fuel. How can this sudden but admirable about-face by the government be reconciled with its ongoing antipathy towards ANSTO? My colleague Senator Eric Abetz and I have been on the public record highlighting this government’s budget cuts to ANSTO, which will lose $7.315 million under so-called responsible economic management and a further $11.3 million out of the former nuclear collaborative research program. This reprehensible and counterintuitive funding cut by the government is a clear indication that there is no logical planning, no sensible funding regime and total disingenuousness on the issue of nuclear energy. MAIN COMMITTEE If this government had the courage to openly accept the reality of future nuclear power generation, as I know some of its more intellectually credible ministers do, it would not just covertly get behind the only real alternative source of baseload power but also fund its only dedicated nuclear research organisation properly. We do not want to be in the same situation with nuclear scientists that we have been in with trades trained Australians in the past. It takes many years to study to be a nuclear scientist, and you do not get the best brains for your country by slashing funding. I call on the minister to back his scientists and restore funding to Nation Building and Jobs Plan stimulus package for the Australian economy announced yesterday which I am very keen to support. But today I want to make particular reference to the support for housing. I want to talk about two aspects of that. One is social housing, which is very much needed in many parts of Australia. I know that is especially the case in central Brisbane, with a number of people living rough and a number of people without affordable housing. There are a number of organisations that do wonderful work to support them, and I know that they will have been rejoicing overnight at the government’s announcement to provide funding to enable some 20,000 dwellings to be made available in the next two to three years. That will be a very tangible improvement in the quality of life for thousands of Australians, matched, I am glad to say, by a commitment to funds for maintenance. Any of us who have been into some of the public housing stock will know that maintenance is sorely needed. I am also delighted that Australian Defence Force personnel are to be recipients of additional accommodation as part of the government’s announcements yesterday. In Brisbane there are to be some 103 new dwellings created for Australian Defence Force personnel. In this place we often make mention of the work of our men and women in the defence forcesthose on deployment and those here at home. We need to recognise that an important part of support for them is to ensure not just that the equipment that they use in their work, in combat and in trades, is up to scratch but that it is the best available. We also need to ensure that the living standards we afford them are of a high quality. That has not always been the case over the years, and I know that the current minister has a strong commitment to that, as I have had for many years. In Brisbane there are to be 30 new dwellings created in Upper Kedron, another 32 in Everton Park, and another 41 in another area of Upper Kedron, bringing the total to 103 new dwellings in Brisbane. That is part of a much broader package. But in Brisbane, it will, of itself, create some 88 jobs directly in the construction of those dwellings, with an indirect impact on another 200-odd jobs. That is 300 people who will gain employment in Brisbane or have their employment secured as a result of this initiative, plus more than 100 Defence Force personnel and their families who will get high-quality accommodation. The people in Gaythorne, the people at Keperra and those at the Enoggera army barracks will rejoice in that news, and I welcome it wholeheartedly.

287,Mr Irons (Swan) (10.46 Am),"I fear that I will not have enough time to do justice to theate. From refugees and proud local veterans to the working disabled and senior citizens-each has a remarkable story to tell, and all make or have made a valuable contribution to our society. During the 2007 election campaign I met a man who had one of the most remarkable stories of all. When I met Fred Harper he was 100 years old, and it was after his and his father’s war medals had been stolen. I befriended Fred not only because he was a great bloke, in every sense of the typical Aussie bloke, but I considered him to be an Australian national treasure. Today it is my sad duty to inform the House that Mr Fred Harper, aged 101, of Redcliffe, Western Australia passed away on 29 December 2008, peacefully, in his sleep. Born in Adelaide in 1907, Fred and his family moved to WA where his father enlisted in the Army in 1914. Fred’s father subsequently became one of the legendary ANZACs who fought in Gallipoli in 1915. Following the war, Fred’s parents split up, and Fred and his brother were considered orphans and sent to the Clontarf Boys Home-a story which I can particularly relate to, as I was institutionalised myself at the age of six months. In 1941, at the age of 34, Fred departed Fremantle port to serve with the Allied forces in World War II in no fewer than three theatres: Egypt, Palestine and the Middle East. Having survived the war, Mr Harper returned with his medals to live a full life in the West. When Fred’s medals were stolen, it was with the generous help of the member for Bradfield, who was then the Minister for Defence, that it was arranged to get the medals reminted, and we presented them to Fred at an emotional ceremony in 2007. Fred married and had five children. His wife passed away in 1978, and he outlived one of his sons and one of his daughters. In the latter part of his life, he lived with his daughter Leonie and son-in-law John. I know they miss him terribly, and I think they are listening to me now acknowledging Fred in this place. It was an honour to invite Fred to Canberra as my special guest for my first speech last March. During his trip, I arranged for Fred to visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where Fred was presented with a pack containing information about his father’s war experience and record. I believe this meant more to him than the medals he earned. At 101, Fred was still proud to hold a valid driver’s licence. This leads me to speak about something Fred’s granddaughter, Julie Fowder, said at his funeral about ‘Pop stories’. His great-granddaughter Chelsi did a reading at Fred’s funeral, very bravely and with plenty of emotion. At Christmas 2007, after claiming he was too tired and too hot to attend a family function on Boxing Day, Fred was spotted by family members cheekily driving down the Great Eastern Highway with his mate Ivan. When confronted with the fact that they had seen him when they passed him, he quickly replied that they must have been speeding. In this House we are particularly good at offering condolences for those who have died in the course of defending Australia; today, I speak about Fred. He was one of Australia’s national treasures, and I hope to continue to meet people with his spirit in my capacity as the member for Swan.

288,Mr Price (Chifley) (10.49 Am),"I want to place on record my absolute delight about thereally great for all those students in years nine to 12, great for the teachers and great for the parents. Of course, it is true that in Chifley many households already have a computer, but by and large we are an information-poor electorate. Therefore, having adequately resourced computers in our schools is really critical to the success of the students. This was an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, during the 2007 federal election. We have committed $1.9 billion in funding new information and communications technology equipment in Australian secondary schools. I am delighted for the successful schools. St Agnes Catholic High School received 113 computers; Loyola Senior High School, 144; Mountain View Adventist College, 40; Tyndale Christian School, 114; Bethel Christian School, 22; and St Bishoy Coptic Orthodox College, nine. Blacktown Youth College received eight, and they also received 30 in the first round. I know that the Catholic schools have taken the option of buying an off-the-shelf computer and these are being rolled out very quickly. The state schools have opted to develop a ruggedised computer, and that is taking some time to roll out. No public school or high school in my electorate applied in round 2. I am glad that has changed, and I would encourage those high schools that were not part of round 1 to apply for round 3. I also say with great sadness that the extra money flowing to high schools and primary schools in my electorate, announced yesterday as part of the package, is now being opposed by the opposition. It is a worry as to whether or not we can get this money for every primary school in my electorate through what is a hostile Senate. I commend the government for taking this initiative. I can say that in the 12 years of the Howard government no comparable proposal was ever put forward. I do know that the students are really benefiting from these computers. Ryan Electorate: Australian Citizenship our, since this is a magnificent country; there is no better. Our opportunities are only as limited as our imagination. As individuals and as a nation we can become anything. Therefore, I want, in the Parliament of Australia, to pay tribute to and congratulate those new Australians who came from far away as the Russian Federation and as near as New Zealand, and from places as troubled as Afghanistan to places as stable as Singapore. There were so many people who became Australian citizens on 26 January 2009, and I had the distinct honour of conferring citizenship upon people from many parts of the world. I want to name them in the parliament because I know they will consider that to be something special. From Bangladesh came Mohammed Shafiul Haque, who said to me that he thought there was no better country than this one. From Paraguay came Nadia Carolina Alexander, who said that, while she came from South America, she thought that there was no better country than Australia because of the opportunities for her and her family. Both of those people live in my electorate, in St Lucia and Auchenflower. From the UK was John Martin Brown, who lives in Bardon. From the Russian Federation were Daria Aleksandrovna Chernykh and Aksinya Radaeva, who are both living in Toowong. They were very pleased to receive citizenship and felt the poignancy of the occasion. From Hong Kong came Wai Kei Cheung, who said to me that she very much loved the environment in Australia. Green space-ovals and parks-is not a signature of Hong Kong, as in our community. MAIN COMMITTEE",298,Ansto In The Next Budget

In Middle Park in Centenary, there is Mr Ashwami Kumar Garg, Mr Shrey Garg and Mrs Shilpi Gupta, all from India. They said to me that whilst there was a rivalry with cricket, their loyalties were to our democracy, even though they came from a great democracy. While they still supported India in all other respects, they had a deep love for Australia because they knew this was where their children’s future lay. In Toowong, there is Miss Jiayin Li from China. She said that her future was with this country and she would be flying the flag for the rest of the day with real pride. There were many more from other countries that we are familiar with-for example, the Philippines and Ireland. They all have a great love for Australia and feel very proud to be citizens. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Relay for Life lorectal surgeon and avid runner, Dr Gordy Klatt, took the first step of a 24-hour walk and run around a track in Tacoma, Washington. For interest, he clocked up 83 miles and he raised $27,000 in 1985 to support the American Cancer Society. Out of that has grown the worldwide Relay for Life, which is now the world’s largest cancer fundraising event, involving 20 countries. On the weekend of 21 and 22 March at the Dial sports centre in Penguin in my electorate of Braddon we are holding the Relay for Life. We have an ALP team, which will consist of myself and the three state members for Braddon-Bryan Green, Steve Kons and Brenton Best-plus our office staff and friends. The Relay for Life is an outdoor overnight relay fundraising event, held all over the country. I am sure many members here are familiar with it. It involves teams of 10 to 15 people taking turns to walk or run around a track to raise money for cancer support and information services, particularly in Tasmania for the Cancer Council of Tasmania. As well as raising money for cancer research, the relay honours the lives of those touched by cancer and features a survivor’s walk as well as a candlelit ceremony to honour those who have lost their battle with cancer. In Tasmania more than 2,400 people are diagnosed with cancer each year and unfortunately 1,000 of those will die. One in three Tasmanians will receive a cancer diagnosis in our lifetimes. The disease touches us all in one way or another. Relay for Life attracts more than 7,200 people grouped in hundreds of teams at venues right around Tasmania each year. In 2008, Tasmania raised $1.2 million through Relay for Life, or the equivalent of $2 per head of population. The event is not just about the amazing experience of spending the weekend with others in our local communities; it is a fun way that a team can raise money in the lead-up to the day. If anyone listening would like to contribute to my campaign, I am in RG32 in Parliament House and shop 2, 32 Wilmot Street in Burnie. Finally, I am going to dedicate my walk in particular to my late sister-in-law, Marianne Langford Sidebottom, who unfortunately died of cancer at the age of 51 last year. Gippsland Electorate: Fires people who deliberately light fires in our community, causing enormous emotional and physical stress along with the economic losses and the threat to human life. Last week, as the temperatures soared in excess of 40 degrees, fires were deliberately lit in bushland around the townships of Boolarra, Mirboo North and Yinnar.

291,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10.58 Am),"I rise to condemn the senseless and cowardlyfor a moment on the courage, resilience and determination of the people of Gippsland who fought this fire. Deputy Speaker, quite simply, the people were magnificent. The community rallied together and was well supported by firefighting crews from right across the state. From the strike teams on the ground through to the aerial water bombers and support staff at the incident control centres and at the relief centres it was an amazing community effort to combat these fires. It is when we see the spirit of country Australians at its best, standing together shoulder to shoulder against a common cause. Despite an extraordinary effort by firefighters, the losses to the community were substantial as more than 6,000 hectares of forested areas, plantations and private property was burnt. While dozens of properties were saved through the efforts of our firefighting teams, we did lose 29 homes. I inspected the damage on the weekend around the Boolarra area and, heart breaking as it is to see one family home destroyed, to see 29 homes in a line is quite distressing. It is a devastating scene and all our thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered such great losses. It is estimated that arsonists cost our nation $1.6 billion per year and the damage bill in Gippsland alone from these fires will be in the tens of millions of dollars. There are severe penalties existing for convicted firebugs in Victoria and I wish the police every blessing as they try to track down these offenders. But there is an economic, environmental and social imperative for us to do better at preventing fires in the future. I believe the penalties need to go beyond the initial punishment set by the courts. This week I have written to the Prime Minister seeking his support for a national register of arsonists to help prevent a repeat of this week’s fires. I believe we need a national database of people who have been convicted of such serious fire related offences. I am not unduly concerned about protecting their civil liberties in the future once they have shown a complete disregard for the safety and the rights of our community with such senseless crimes. We need to have a national database of every known firebug with strict reporting provisions which require these people to report any change of address and subject them to high levels of scrutiny and police surveillance if required. It would allow our authorities to check on these people during days of extreme danger when firebugs tend to be at their worse. The most serious offenders could be required to report to authorities on days of total fire ban. It is hard enough for our fire authorities to manage lightning, other natural events and accidents without the constant threat of criminal activity contributing to the fire danger period. As I said in my earlier remarks, the people of Gippsland performed magnificently during last week’s bushfires and I have written to the Prime Minister and sought his support for this practical matter that could help to reduce the incidence of these deliberately lit fires in the future. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 November 2008, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE",300,Ansto In The Next Budget
292,The Deputy Speaker (Dr Mj Washer),"Order! In accordance with standing ordersocial security and family assistance to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the SSAT. The SSAT is the first level of external review of decisions made by Centrelink about social security, family assistance, education or training payments. As of 1 January 2007 the tribunal is also the first level of external review of most decisions made by the Child Support Agency. By way of history, the SSAT was originally established in 1975 by the Hon. Bill Hayden to review appealed decisions made by the then Department of Social Security. It is now, as we know, a statutory body established under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to conduct merit based review of administrative decisions made under social security law, the family assistance law, child support law and a raft of other pieces of legislation. The Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 set out the powers, functions and procedures of the SSAT. The SSAT is within the portfolio of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Administrative arrangements of long standing exist between FaHCSIA and the tribunal that have allowed the tribunal to benefit from the department’s administrative infrastructure. Those going to the SSAT are usually people whose interests are affected by a Centrelink decision or a Child Support Agency decision and who want to apply to the SSAT for a review of the decision. Centrelink appeals can be lodged at any time after a review of the original decision by the Centrelink authorised review officer. Yet before the SSAT can review a Child Support Agency decision it must first be reviewed by a CSA objections officer. Child support appeals must be lodged within 28 days of receiving an objection decision. The SSAT generally has the power to affirm, vary or set aside a decision under review. Where it sets aside a decision, the tribunal must either substitute a new decision or send the matter back to Centrelink or CSA with directions or recommendations for further action. Centrelink decisions reviewed by the SSAT typically relate to the following bodies of law: social security law, family assistance law, the Health Insurance Act, the Child Support (Assessment) Act, the Farm Household Support Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. In achieving this mandate, the SSAT’s statutory objective is to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical and informal, and, most of all, it must be quick. People who are appealing decisions by Centrelink or the Child Support Agency should never be required to hang out for decisions that would take months on end-hence the requirement for 28 days after receiving an objection decision. Appeal applications can be lodged with the tribunal in writing, in person or by telephone, though at present Centrelink can only make written submissions. This amendment bill, the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008, will allow Centrelink to be able to make oral submissions to SSAT hearings and allow the SSAT to give oral reasons to explain affirmed decisions by Centrelink in social security and family assistance cases. This will bring these types of cases into line with child support cases, where the SSAT does not have the option to give reasons orally to the parties involved. Allowing Centrelink to make oral submissions in social security and family assistance reviews should-and I emphasise ‘should’-provide greater clarity for complicated or technical cases, and it is imperative that MAIN COMMITTEE",301,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
293,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.02 Am),"I rise to support the minor amendments to laws on the parliament take its responsibility seriously and review the impact of these changes to ensure that the stated intent of making and providing greater clarity to complicated or technical cases is indeed realised. These amendments, again, should give social security and family assistance cases the same flexibility and efficient approaches which the SSAT uses in the child support system, and it is again incumbent upon the responsible minister, and indeed the parliament, to ensure that that flexibility and that efficiency in approach are realised. This bill further extends the term of SSAT members to five years rather than the current three-year terms that members serve. This should promote better planning and decision making through greater longevity, and it is again incumbent upon the minister and the parliament to ensure that better planning and better decision making are a result and that greater longevity does reap the rewards that we hope it will reap. Change for change’s sake is always a nonsense, but change that ensures greater clarity in complicated cases, greater flexibility and efficiency in approaches by the tribunal and better decision making and better planning is, on the surface, for the best. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the goals, worthy as they are, are indeed realised. I have said a number of times in this place that my electorate of Fadden, having grown by 31.6 per cent between the 2001 and 2006 censuses, is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation. As we all know, especially those of us with children, there are always growing pains, and where there are growing pains we need to look at them. Because of the strong growth of my electorate of Fadden, which the library estimates in 3½ years will be 19½ per cent oversubscribed in the numbers of peopleMr Ripoll interjectinging backwards. The electorate of Fadden is indeed going forward at a great rate of knots, so I deal with issues of Centrelink, the Child Support Agency and the SSAT on a regular basis. Because my office is dealing with these statutory authorities and the tribunal on a regular basis, I look forward to seeing greater clarity in complicated cases; I look forward to greater flexibility and efficiency and better planning and decision making. And, with hope for what these changes will do in that regard in the future, I indeed support this bill. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.09 am)-The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008 makes minor amendments to the social security and the family assistance law to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Whilst these amendments are minor in nature, I think that they are quite significant and that they will improve the way the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will operate. They will update some of the legislation that I will talk about a little bit later. The bill also makes technical amendments to several acts, primarily the social security law, to repeal references to redundant payments-and I will talk about that at length in a moment-or to repealed provisions, to correct cross-references, to correct misdescribed amendments and to address similar matters. This bill, as the previous speaker noted, will allow Centrelink to make oral submissions to SSAT hearings. I think this will improve the way the SSAT operates. It will allow Centrelink to elaborate on the reasons for their decisions. It will also ensure that we get a more balanced response. I think the SSAT plays a very important role. Any member of parliament who meets with their constituents regularly will know just how important is the ability to review and to MAIN COMMITTEE",302,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
294,Mr Robert,"I am looking across at the member for Oxley. I gather his electorate is gomake a merit based appeal to a statutory body that is at arm’s length from Centrelink, because invariably many of those reviews will result in the original decision being determined differently. It is important that the SSAT be able to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible, because that benefits all parties. The amendments allow the SSAT to give oral reasons on a case-by-case basis. They also allow the SSAT members to be appointed for a period of up to five years. That is consistent with government policy and is a very prudent reform. All of that is in schedule 1. In schedule 2 there are two technical amendments to the Social Security Act. The bill repeals redundant references to the disability wage supplement and to the rehabilitation allowance, which are no longer paid under the social security law. The rehabilitation allowance was phased out in 1991, when a disability reform package was introduced. At that particular time. I was working in an area where a number of my clients were in receipt of the rehabilitation allowance. It was in fact identical to the disability support pension as to the benefit that was paid and as to the way that it operated. At that time a number of my clients moved to the disability support pension or remained on the rehabilitation allowance. There would be no reason why a person should still be on a rehabilitation allowance some 18 years later, because it related to a person undertaking a rehabilitation program. It was a very structured program. There could be a formal training program. There could be an on-the-job training program. The rehabilitation allowance was provided to a person specifically for that reason. Since that time people have been on Newstart. Special provisions were put in place at the time of the disability reform package being introduced in 1991. That disability reform package did benefit people with disabilities because it had a holistic approach to helping those people enter the workforce. Unfortunately, under the previous government that became very fragmented and it was very difficult for people with disabilities to actually re-enter the workforce. One pleasing aspect is that there has been an increase in the number of people with disabilities moving into the workforce. I congratulate the government, especially the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Gillard. The government has looked at what happened back in 1991, has looked at the changes that the previous government made and has been determined to ensure that people with disabilities find employment. Given the fact that we are moving into a time of economic uncertainty, it is going to be even harder for people who have disabilities to obtain employment. This legislation phases out that rehabilitation allowance and brings it in line with the rates of disability allowance under the current legislation, with an additional supplement. It also makes three technical amendments. It repeals redundant provisions, headings and references, repeals provisions to correct cross-references and corrects misdescribed amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act 2007, the Social Security Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act. This legislation brings Centrelink deliberations into line with child support deliberations, where parties have the right to give oral submissions. It is a very sensible amendment, one that I am pleased to see the opposition support-unlike their decision today to oppose the economic stimulus package, which stands to benefit millions of Australians. Their decision will jeopardise the economic security of Australia and I feel that the opposition really need to revisit the decision they made today in their party room. The opposition need to look at the impact of their decision to deny Australians the package, which has been well thought out and MAIN COMMITTEE worked through by the government. I feel that the opposition will stand condemned if the legislation does not pass through the Senate, as it will have enormous impact in Australia. I conclude my comments in relation to this legislation by saying that I support it wholeheartedly. It brings the legislation into line, gets rid of redundant aspects of previous legislation and brings the Centrelink component when the Social Security Appeals Tribunal looks at cases into line with the child support component. The increase to the five-year term is, once again, in line with government policy. ber for Shortland. I do not think anyone in this House doubts that she cares about her constituents. I do note, however, that she was very quick to compliment the present minister. I have no doubt that the minister is doing her job as well as she can, but as to the member for Shortland’s comments on people with disabilities being welcomed back into the workforce being a good thing, I just point out to the House that that was part of the reforms that the previous government brought in, and it is good to see that the present government is continuing with those reforms. WhilstI take note of her advice concerningorder? Ms Hall-I would like to ask the member if he could provide details of the reforms that the previous governmentwhether I am prepared to accept a question. At this stage I am not prepared to accept a question. She has tried that one on me before, Mr Deputy Speaker! the make-up of the stimulus package, I can assure her that I fully support the action taken by our coalition in opposition and will argue the merits of our position quite strongly and vociferously. Coming back to the matter before us, the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008 makes a number of amendments to the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. My role as a member of parliament, as with other members of parliament, involves regularly dealing with constituents who approach my office with Centrelink or Child Support Agency decisions with which they do not agree. I frequently refer them to the SSAT and encourage them to exercise their rights of review and appeal. Indeed, a member of my staff is a former SSAT member and reminds me that the tribunal offers a mechanism of external review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Certainly for a number of my constituents their appeals to the tribunal have resulted in outcomes to their satisfaction. I have admiration for Centrelink staff and fully understand that in implementing complex government income support policies-more so of late-they encounter frustrated clients. These are the same clients who frequently contact my office to vent their frustration at the inequities of the Rudd government’s income support policies. I might also take this opportunity to thank my front office staff, who also deal professionally and empathically with unhappy and sometimes very angry constituents.

299,Mr Secker,"WhilstI take note of her advice to the opposition about our opposition toThe economic stimulus bonus is one of those issues that has caused some angst amongst my constituents. While I welcomed it in December for the more than 30,000 people in my electorate who received a bonus, the reality is that the benefit for many was short lived. Once the bonus was spent, pensioners and families still struggled to pay the increased costs of living, such as the electricity bill. Many of them will be facing quite a huge increase in their electricity bill in view of the 48-degree temperatures we have experienced in large parts of my electorate. That bill will no doubt be a big one. They still struggle with the increased costs of a weekly basket of food and medicines and fuel-increased charges that pensioners, veterans and families face every day. I will take this opportunity to point out a flaw in the administration of the economic stimulus bonus payment that has come to my attention. Under the Howard government, if a person qualified for an income support payment on budget day when the bonuses were announced, they qualified for the bonus. Not so under Labor. In order to receive the bonus in December a person had to be eligible some two months earlier, on 14 October 2008. Take the case of a 50year-old constituent in my electorate. On 17 October 2008 the constituent and his wife, also in her 50s, were awarded custody of their three young grandchildren by the court. They have asked me not to use their names, because of concern for these children, and I think we can all understand that. At a time when they are of an age to contemplate a quieter life or even retirement, this couple took on the care of three very young children, the youngest of whom is only three years of age. The constituent and his wife receive family tax benefit for their grandchildren but were denied the bonus. They were not paid the $3,000 economic stimulus bonus because they were not in receipt of family payments on 14 October. They missed out by three days. In December the bonus was paid to the children’s mother because the children were in her care on 14 October, notwithstanding that in December she had not had to care for her children for two months, and further notwithstanding that the courts have determined she was not fit to care for the children. The bonus did not reach the children, and it certainly did not reach my constituent who was looking after the children. I understand there has to be a line in the sand, and a start date is the essence of any law. The Rudd government should have made provision for those who came onto allowances in the intervening period-between when the bonus was announced and when it was paid. It is patently unfair to the couple, who now have to provide beds, clothing, toys, school fees and uniforms for their grandchildren, as well as the two months of looking after the children. I give notice to the minister that I will be seeking her intercession for an ex gratia payment equal to the bonus for my constituent. A further constituent approached me about a similar outcome. Mr Peter Olsen, living in an isolated rural area, has been a long-term recipient of a disability support pension following diagnosis of a serious and potentially terminal condition. Mr Olsen received a one-off offer of temporary employment for a few weeks. After medical advice he undertook this employment and when it ended he went back onto the disability support pension but because he was working for those first few weeks he received no payment of pension on the test date of 14 October 2008. This also means that Mr Olsen received no bonus, despite being back on disability support pension a few weeks later-certainly in December when the bonus was paid. Notwithstanding that he received a pension payment for 13 October, he missed out on the bonus by MAIN COMMITTEE one day. What is particularly irksome to Mr Olsen is that at no time was he advised that he would not be receiving the bonus. At the very least it might have been prudent for the Rudd government to make clear to Mr Olsen and other pensioners in this unusual situation that they should not count on receiving that bonus, which as long-term social security recipients, they had understandably been expecting. Regrettably, Mr Olsen has precommitted the bonus funds and finds himself in financial difficulties. I seek the minister’s discretion in this case. Apart from those anomalies I support the legislation, as does the opposition. We think it is important legislation and that is why we support it in full. Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. As the member for Shortland said, this bill will make a few technical amendments to social security law and family assistance law to improve the efficacy of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the SSAT. It does it by way of schedule. Schedule2 makes some technical amendments to repeal redundant references to the disability wage supplement and the rehabilitation allowance, which are no longer paid under our social security legislation. The disability wage supplement was rolled over and put into the disability support pension in 1997. Schedule3 makes very technical amendments to repeal redundant provisions and cross-referencing in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Act, Native Title Amendment Act and various pieces of social security legislation. It is schedule 1 that I really want to talk about today. It makes a number of amendments to improve the operation of the SSAT, allowing Centrelink to make oral submissions to the SSAT in its hearings, and allowing the SSAT to give oral reasons on what are often known colloquially as affirmed cases. It will allow the SSAT members to be appointed for a term of five years, and that is consistent with a whole range of other tribunals and bodies. It is important to note that as federal members of parliament we probably deal with matters of social security and child support and family law more than any other issues. People also need to understand how and why decisions are made which affect them in their daily lives, whether it is in the case of various types of social security payments made to them, payment of child support or how the family law situation and system interposes upon their lives. About 4½ million Australians receive an income support payment and about 1.6 million parents are in the child support system, which is governed by the Child Support (Assessment) Act and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act. The federal government makes transfer payments in the income support system, in terms of social security, of about $70 billion each year. That is a huge sum of money. About $2.8 billion is assessed to be paid in child support cases each year, and if every parent who was supposed to pay child support did pay it, then it would be a lot more. Given the size of the numbers we are talking about and the amount of dollars we are talking about, it is important that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal operates efficiently and effectively because it affects the daily lives of Australians, particularly people in my electorate, including in Ipswich and the rural areas in Oxley. The SSAT is the first level for external reviews of decisions made by the Child Support Agency and by Centrelink that deal with issues of social security payments, family assistance and education and training support. The objects in terms of statute governing the SSAT are that the mechanism of review is to be fair, just, economical, informal and quick. But that said, a lot of the indicia of a court system can MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
300,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.28 Am),"I rise to speak in support of the Families, Housing,be seen in the SSAT. The SSAT was originally established by the then member for Oxley, the former Governor General, and a very prominent member of Ipswich, Bill Hayden. He established that the purpose of it was to review appeal decisions made by what was then known as the Department of Social Security. It took a Labor government to do that, and Bill is to be commended for the work he did in that regard, as well as other reforms such as Medibank that he brought in during his tenure. The statutory body, as I said, is governed by the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and it hears cases. People who have been affected by the decisions of Centrelink or the CSA have a right to apply to the SSAT for a review of that decision. In my previous life as a lawyer, I operated in these areas regularly. Centrelink appeals are lodged after review by the Centrelink authorised review officer of that original decision. It is the same thing under the child support legislation, where a CSA objection officer also hears a review from a departure order which is being sought as a result of an administrative decision made by the Child Support Agency upon application by someone seeking child support. Twenty-eight days is the time to lodge the objection and it costs nothing to appeal to the SSAT, which is important. The SSAT usually conducts hearings face-to-face; people are usually in the same room. The hearings from Centrelink and from the CSA are hearings de novo. In other words, they are not appeals on matters of law, they are not appeals on matters where irrelevant considerations were taken into account or, for example, where material fact was left out. So they are not legalistic, if you know what I mean; it is really to review the whole thing yet again. That is why it is important for people in Australia to ensure that they know that the SSAT hears these things and hears them in a way which is fair and just. The CSA, the Child Support Agency, is entitled to make oral submissions. It needs to seek leave of the SSAT to do that, but it is entitled to make oral submissions rather than, in the circumstances, in the very legalistic way of giving a brief. The applicant in those sorts of proceedings is entitled to make submissions as well, as is the respondent-and there is scope, usually, for cross-examination. So the SSAT is run in a courtroom like manner. It is also entitled to compel people to appear before it. So we are talking about a body that has tremendous powers and that the average Australian can deal with as a result of decisions made in terms of child support and Centrelink payments. In addition to simply supplying the information it already has, the CSA has the capacity to comply with requests made under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act. In other words, the SSAT can exercise powers to compel the CSA to make submissions and comply in terms of the provision of information. This whole process is to ensure that we speedily get through the legal technicalities, get past the legal forms, the rules of evidence et cetera and that a proper consideration or review takes place. It is extremely important that we ensure that the way in which these tribunal hearings are conducted is fair. Currently, the secretary of FaHCSIA, the secretary of DEEWR or the Centrelink Chief Executive Officer may only make written submissions to the CSA but not oral submissions. That has resulted in a number of adjournments. If you have ever been involved in these types of processes, you can see how adjourning the matter would really irritate people-and that happens whether it is the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court or a body dealing with child support reviews. Nothing irritates the average Australian more than going to a tribunal MAIN COMMITTEE or court and finding they have to go away again because some legal technicality has not been complied with. This measure brings the SSAT operations under social security and family assistance, in line with the kind of SSAT operations under the child support jurisdiction. It increases the flexibility and efficiency of the SSAT by providing Centrelink with the option of making oral submissions. That is a very important improvement in the operation of the SSAT. It will help in fulfilling its statutory obligation to ensure that it is quick, economical, just and equitable, and informal in the way in which it operates. The more we ensure that these proceedings are less adversarial, the better for the average Australian. Another change will be on affirmed cases. The SSAT hears decisions of the child support review officer, the objection officer, and Centrelink hears the initial review of the objection. Currently, in cases that deal with social security, they have to give out written reasons. Where decisions are made that simply affirm the decision that was made in the first instance or on review, why shouldn’t they be able to give those decisions orally, and not be subject to the legal technicalities of providing written reasons? A party has the right to request that, and in those circumstances written reasons will be provided. This reduces the time it takes to make decisions, because nothing takes longer in our legal system than the people who preside over tribunals adjourning the case to provide written reasons. Sometimes, months if not years go by before decisions are made by judges and magistrates, and that irritates litigants so much. So the idea of oral submissions or reasons being given in cases where the decision made in the first instance is affirmed is a very significant reform for those people who interface with the SSAT. The final reform deals with the terms of appointment to the SSAT. It extends the maximum period of appointment from three years to five years, which is in line with many other bodies. So what we are talking about here is increasing the transparency of the merit based selection involved in appointing statutory office holders to the SSAT. It will ensure that they are appointed for a period of a duration which allows them to get across the jurisdiction and get across how they can operate. I sometimes wonder whether three years is simply too short. We see that in a lot of appointments. Five years allows people to get across the jurisdiction much better when they are presiding, and other agencies appoint on that basis through this parliament and through ministerial decisions. This is an important reform that we are dealing with today. It might sound technical, it might sound unsexy and it might sound like it is not the sort of legislation that people will go home and read about, but it deals with people’s everyday lives-and the people in my constituency of Blair deal with the SSAT, Centrelink and the Child Support Agency every day. This is a great piece of reformist legislation. It is typical of what Labor governments can do when they talk about law reform. It is typical of what Labor governments can do to help those who are in need, those who face the rigours of legal proceedings, those who face the bureaucratic rigours of big governments. What we are doing here is helping the average Australian to improve their chances in court proceedings and streamlining our legal procedures. That is a great reform, it is a great initiative, and I commend the minister and the government for introducing it. MAIN COMMITTEE Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. In Cowan, just as in all the other electorates, matters arise where the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is required to re-examine the decisions made by officers of Centrelink or the Child Support Agency. It is essential that these often emotional matters be resolved quickly and transparently. The SSAT clearly appreciates the importance of these points because its aims include providing a review that is ‘fair, just, economical, informal and quick’. That is all very important, but the specific aim of this bill is to amend a number of items of legislation that will enable the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to work better, including granting Centrelink the ability to make oral submissions to the SSAT or speak at hearings. It will also allow the SSAT to state its affirmation of cases orally and enable appointment of members to the SSAT for five-year terms. It is my intention today not to mention or comment unnecessarily on every other act that this bill will amend but rather to speak on the substantive measures and their relevance to the electorate of Cowan, so I will state right from the start that it is my intention to speak only on the substantive measures involving oral submissions and periods of appointment. With regard to the first aspect of the bill, the interaction of Centrelink with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, this bill will enable Centrelink to make oral submissions to the SSAT whereas previously only a written submission was possible. This is an important improvement if you want to deliver transparency and fairness, because so often the context of individual cases is difficult to express in written words. An appellant would be better able to seek fairness in an SSAT decision if a Centrelink officer was able to speak and then clarify any additional points during a review. This would also bring Centrelink into line with the Child Support Agency, which is allowed to appear at hearings when required. The period that a member of the Appeals Tribunal holds office is set out in schedule 3 part 1 clause 4 of the Social Security (Administration) Act. However, I wonder why there is the need for item 23 in this bill before the parliament today. Why is there a need to appoint a person for five years when their performance can still be judged after three years, and then a decision can be made as to whether they continue under reappointment? It is fine for the executive director to be appointed for five years, but the members should be assessed every three years and this would appear to be the more appropriate course of action. However, we will see how the appointments and the actions of members of the SSAT go in the future. I would like to see the SSAT strongly support, where possible, the principles of what social security is truly all about. I imagine that all of us here in parliament would agree that welfare payments to the younger and able-bodied members of society are just a temporary means of support until such time as they can find employment and once again support themselves. I certainly look forward to a more consistent approach to welfare support and an end to those rare and inappropriate comments you hear when a person on Newstart starts talking about how much they ‘earn’. I think John F. Kennedy got it right in his inaugural speech when he said: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you-ask what you can do for your country.’ I recently visited and congratulated the ladies who work down at the Uniting Church’s outreach program in Girrawheen, in Cowan. These ladies, known as the Wednesday Club, volunteer to operate the food bank and the second-hand clothing store down on Salcott Road in Girrawheen. They provide a great service to those who are struggling to make ends meet. Every MAIN COMMITTEE",307,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
301,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.41 Am),"I appreciate the opportunity today to speak on theeight weeks, families can attend the food bank, make a gold coin donation and pick up a hamper of food. I congratulate Maureen Le Bretton, Agnes Brunton, Carole Zielinski, Diane Alexander, Lorna Phillips and Maureen Lambert for the great work they do. They provide examples of the very best of the Australian character with the fabulous work they do under the auspices of the Uniting Church in Noranda, and it makes me proud to be their federal representative. I know that the vast majority of their clients greatly appreciate the effort that these ladies put in and respect the sentiments behind this sort of support. Unfortunately, as with all things, there are some people who do not appreciate that support or respect the sentiments behind it. There are some that abuse this support. The forms of abuse range from somewhat rare cases of verbal abuse to those who think that, just because the surnames of husbands and wives are different in some cultures, this means that the wife can show up one week and the husband the next, just to try to maximise what they can get, knowing of course that this then takes away opportunities from others who might need that support. This is not to say that the abuse of the good graces or the intentions of the food bank is confined to one group. No, the small number of people involved in poor behaviour range across a number of different groups in the community. It may be recalled that I mentioned the need for a gold coin donation to participate in the food bank. This is a modest sum that goes some small way to offsetting the outlays that the Noranda church puts into the food bank. They receive no donations. They have to buy it all. It is therefore disappointing that, when asked for that gold coin donation, some people pull a $50 note out of their wallet and then ask for change. Other clients seem to have spent their money on purchases such as body piercings, cigarettes, flash clothes or other excesses that all demonstrate that they prioritise those matters above having good food on the table. Again, I make the point that this is a matter of priority. As parents, as leaders, we should first be thinking about putting good food on the table for our children and supporting our families before spending money on things that are purely excesses. The tragedy is that these sorts of people take some of the capacity of the Noranda Uniting Church and other philanthropic organisations within Cowan and elsewhere away from the genuinely disadvantaged and those who are in unfortunate circumstances through no fault of their own. Once again, I applaud the efforts of Maureen Le Bretton, Agnes Brunton, Carole Zielinski, Diane Alexander, Lorna Phillips and Maureen Lambert from the Uniting Church in Noranda and other individuals and organisations that are committed to the support of those that struggle in this nation through no fault of their own. It is a shame that there are some who abuse the goodwill and the systems in place to provide assistance, whether that is through the non-profit sector or through government welfare support payments. While it is a sad reality that there are and always will be those who abuse the good intentions of others, this bill is about improvements to the system, and I look forward to those improvements being implemented. While I have reservations about whether the extension of the maximum term for a member of the SSAT to five years is really going to be of benefit, I look forward to seeing the benefits of all the changes applied to the cases that affect my constituents in the electorate of Cowan. In conclusion, I look forward to this bill providing a more effective appeals system and I look forward to the best use of social security assistance for Australians-and that assistance should only be taken up by those who are really in need of it. MAIN COMMITTEE Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. This is a good bill. It makes a number of needed amendments and draws into line things that are widely supported and acknowledged across the parliament and the community as things that would make the current system work a lot better. The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the current social security and family assistance laws in relation to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the SSAT. While the system that we have in place could work better, it currently performs well. There are always opportunities for problems to arise and for incorrect decisions to be made. Sometimes, better systems need to be put into place. But it is good that we actually have an appeals mechanism so that people can appeal decisions that are not in their favour. The original Social Security Appeals Tribunal legislation was introduced by a former member for Oxley, the Hon. Bill Hayden, so it would be remiss of me not to mention him in my comments today. It was Bill Hayden who reviewed the appealed decisions made by the then Department of Social Security. Putting in place the SSAT system was a great move forward in ensuring that decisions made in the bureaucratic process are the right decisions and that people have the opportunity to seek more information and to challenge decisions or better understand why decisions are in fact correct. The SSAT has since become a statutory body. Under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 it conducts merit reviews of administrative decisions made under social security law, family assistance law, child support law and various other pieces of legislation. The amendments in this bill will allow the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to give oral reasons on affirmed social security and family assistance cases. It will review cases that affirm the decision made by Centrelink and it will bring those jurisdictions more closely into line with child support and how those systems work. It is important that that change is brought forward and used. In the discussions we have with our constituents, often cases arise where there is miscommunication or misunderstanding or somehow people just do not quite comprehend what is going on around them. Sometimes that cold letter informing people of a decision by a department does not meet people’s expectations. It is certainly a harsh method. I can understand that that is necessary-obviously, these things need to be clearly spelt outbut giving an oral submission and sitting down with people and discussing these things will enable them to better understand what the decisions are, how those decisions come about and how the system works. I think that is a step in the right direction, and I support it very much. As in the child support sphere, the oral decision arrangements will be subject to the right of the parties to request written reasons if they prefer. I think that needs to be there also as a backup system to confirm what people have heard orally. What has been explained to them can also be provided in writing. The SSAT amendments to allow Centrelink to make oral submissions to the SSAT also mimic the child support arrangements, which will bring in continuity and similar arrangements across a whole range of those legislative areas and the departments and services that people access. That is very important in getting people to understand how they work. Often the people who access one of those areas will automatically have access to all the other areas as well. I think it is important to cut down the complexity of the systems that are in place by making them uniform across the different departments. MAIN COMMITTEE",310,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
302,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.50 Am),"I rise to speak in support of the Families, Housing,Centrelink will now be able to ask the SSAT for permission to make oral submissions to it, and the SSAT will be able to order Centrelink to make oral submissions as well. This will increase the flexibility and efficiency of the SSAT and it will help to avoid costly and inefficient adjournments. I think it is a sensible way forward. It is obviously supported by everyone in this place. It is something that I am happy to be a part of. The new power will generally be used in complex cases where further explanation may clarify a complicated or technical matter and assist the SSAT to reach a preferable decision. The amendments to allow SSAT members to be appointed for a term of up to five years, in place of the currently allowed term of up to three years, will also bring the SSAT in line with government policy that appointments of statutory office holders are generally to be made for a period of five years for reasons of stability, efficiency and good governance. The remaining amendments in the bill are purely technical in nature. They do not raise any substantive issues or matters, but they do tidy up the legislation by repealing redundant references, correcting cross-references and addressing similar matters. All in all, I am more than happy to be part of a government that makes these changes and tries to address some of the issues by making people’s lives a bit easier. Any appeals they make about departmental and government decisions will be easier to understand, and I think that is a step in the right direction. I fully support the bill. Services) (11.56 am)-I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. In the present world situation, with millions of people going to the wall financially, it has become a lot more fashionable, even on the conservative side of politics, to speak about mercy, or what Shakespeare called ‘that twice blessed gift to the unfortunate, those on whom the shafts of fate have unfairly fallen in a time’-like now-‘of strife’. This bill amends, broadens and makes more merciful legislation first passed a generation ago in another era of strife, 1975, following the actions of Bill Hayden, a great Australian, a great Labor leader and a great Governor General, when he was the Minister for Social Security. It set up the SSAT, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, whose purpose was to help the unfortunate, the people with disabilities, the elderly, single parents and their suffering children, to keep a roof over their heads, adequate food on the table and blankets on the beds when the basic things could be threatened by bureaucratic errors and injustice in the Department of Social Security, which was then in charge of their lives. The responsibilities of the SSAT have grown since then. It now reviews, questions and sometimes overturns decisions made under social security law, family assistance law and, since 2007, child support law. But its aim, then as now, is to rescue those who have fallen between the cracks of our society, however briefly and however unjustly. It helps those who are suffering from want, poverty, panic or homelessness because of a lack of legal advice, misinformation or errors in proper bureaucratic process. It helps those who have lost what may be the only lifeline for themselves and their families. It is there to give to those in need a system which gives not just the theoretical right but the practical power to challenge incorrect or unjust decisions made regarding eligibility for allowances, their rate, their duration or their perceived doubling up. MAIN COMMITTEE",312,Families Housing Community Services And Indigenous Affairs
303,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sThe SSAT strives to be fair, just, economical, informal and quick. It does not rely upon lawyers. It does not charge for an application to review a benefit. It provides reasonable travel and accommodation expenses and interpreting services to help people make their case. In 2007-08 there were over 13,000 applications lodged with the SSAT, with the number of Centrelink related applications increasing by 35 per cent to 11,596. The main reason for the increase was Centrelink rulings on the Newstart allowance and alleged participation failures, where Centrelink ruled that a receiver of the allowance had not done enough to meet their responsibility to find work. Of the 11,000 cases, 27 per cent, or over 3,000 cases, saw the complaint upheld and Centrelink’s original decision overturned. This shows that Centrelink is a professional, humane organisation that gets it right most of the time, but it also highlights that no system is perfect and there is a need for an independent mechanism of review that is accessible to all Australians. Of course, the case details and the results are confidential, given that they deal with the personal circumstances of people. I would like to provide an example, in summing up, of how the SSAT can work to bring about a just and fair result for someone who is doing it tough. A single parent receiving the parenting payment for looking after a son with severe autism was penalised by Centrelink, who ruled that because she was still legally married, although not living with her husband, she should never have been given the single parent pension in the first place. This left her with a sizeable debt to pay at a time when money was needed for her child with autism-a debt to be paid with money that she did not have and could not earn while she was still looking after herself and her son. The review found that Centrelink had acted incorrectly and had not found sufficient evidence to prove that the couple had remained in a relationship, that Centrelink in this case had jumped the gun. The SSAT found that the money supplied by her former husband was for the care of the child only, that there was not evidence of an ongoing relationship between them, that they were no longer living together and that Centrelink in this case had erred. This common-sense decision delivered a fair result and saved a family and a working mother tens of thousands of dollars. Another valuable aspect of the SSAT provides feedback to Centrelink and the Child Support Agency as to how they can improve their performance in their dealings with clients. In this role, it has helped us develop a pension system that is more responsive and humane towards the vulnerable people that it aims to assist. The SSAT has been performing a valuable service on behalf of vulnerable Australians for 34 years, and this bill will help it continue that work. In summary, several acts within the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and related portfolios are amended by this miscellaneous measures bill. The amendments are minor and technical only. The minor amendments in the bill are to the social security law and the family assistance law. These amendments are to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, including allowing oral evidence and oral decisions in certain circumstances. Oral decisions will be available where the decision of Centrelink is being affirmed. All parties retain the right to request written decisions within 28 days. Oral evidence is likely to be used in complex cases where further explanation may clear up complicated or technical matters and so help the SSAT reach the correct and preferable decision. It should also help avoid costly and inefficient adjournments. The bill MAIN COMMITTEE also extends the term of appointments for members of the tribunal from three years to five years, in line with government policy announced by the Special Minister of State in February last year. Lastly, the bill makes technical amendments to several acts, mainly to the social security law. The technical amendments are to repeal redundant provisions, to repeal references to redundant payments or repeal provisions, to correct cross-references, to correct past amendments that failed for technical drafting reasons and to address similar matters. In conclusion, these amendments further show the Rudd government’s unbending commitment, whatever the budget’s bottom line and whatever the outcome of the present meltdown, to a just and fair Australia where those least blessed by genetic fortune or marital fortune or the fair winds of our times, the circumstantial roulette of a life on earth which brings plenty and prosperity to some of us and privation to others, can at least have a clear, uncomplicated voice, putting their case for mercy and offering sheltering arms against the harsh winds which blow in a time of strife, such as all of us are facing now. I commend the legislation to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Private Gregory Sher Debate resumed from 3 February, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 4 January 2009 of Private Gregory Sher, killed while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. science and personnel and assisting shadow minister for defence to put the opposition’s support for this motion, joining with the government in the condolence for Private Gregory Michael Sher, who lost his life in Afghanistan on 4 January 2009, and extending our thoughts and prayers to his friends and family. Private Sher was born in South Africa in 1978, moving to Australia with his family in 1986. He joined the Army in 1989 as an army reservist infantryman and deployed to East Timor in 2002. In 2004, he completed the commando selection course and joined the 1st Commando Regiment, going on to complete a suite of difficult and demanding Special Forces courses required to become a qualified commando. For his service in East Timor, Private Sher received the Australian Active Service Medal, the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge. Private Sher has also now been awarded the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal with ISAF Clasp, the Australian Defence Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge. As we have heard, Private Sher was killed by rocket fire by Taliban insurgents against the Oruzgan province patrol base a few days into the new year. Sadly, he was 30 years of age. Five days later, in a hot and gloomy airport hangar in Victoria, colleagues and I joined Private Sher’s parents, Yvonne and Felix, and brothers, Steven and Barry, along with his partner, Karen, in attending the ramp service that brought Private Sher home.

304,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.05 Pm),"I rise today as the shadow minister for defenceand colleague. He spoke from one family to another, not of the sorrow they felt in Greg’s loss but of the virtues of his life. It is a sad and difficult duty to bear witness to the loss of a young soldier, and I pray that my colleagues here and I never get used to it. Yet it was on this occasion a rare honour to witness the dignity and devotion with which a soldier paid tribute to his fallen comrade. We are here today to pay tribute to the courage and sacrifice of Private Gregory Sher. I fear my words can do little when compared with those of that soldier. So, with his permission, I would now like to share with the chamber part of that speech: Very shortly, the Commanding Officer of the 1st Commando Regiment will present Private Sher his medals. This is a very special occasion for any soldier, and, for the members of his unit, the chance to share with you the many accomplishments he has achieved. We (his military family) are so proud of him and we want to share with you the reasons why. Greg Sher’s entire military career is characterised as one of being a “volunteer”. Greg was a volunteer when he decided to first join the Australian Army Reserve in 1998. Greg was a volunteer when he completed his recruit and infantry courses and commenced his career as a Rifleman with 5/6 Royal Victorian Regiment here in Melbourne. Greg was a volunteer when, after completing 5 months of build-up training in Darwin, deployed with 5/7 Royal Australian Regiment to East Timor for over six months in 2002 & 2003. Greg was a volunteer when, after earning the Australian Active Service Medal, the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge, set his determined sights on a path that would ultimately lead him to obtaining a green beret as a qualified Commando within Australian Special Operations Command. Greg was a volunteer when he looked east out over the suburbs of Melbourne to the Dandenongs and saw, in the fire access track that splits the mountain, a suitable training ground. Greg was a volunteer, when early on any cold and wet weekend morning, when others were enjoying a warm coffee and hot breakfast at home, he was moving his little (but very strong) legs up and down the “thousand steps” or the “fire access track”, pausing only to re-tape his bloodied feet, motivate his fellow soldiers to keep going or quietly add more weight to his own pack. You see, for close to six months, Greg volunteered to put himself through enormous physical and mental hardship just to make sure that on the day he showed up for his commando selection course he was physically and mentally ready. And ready he was. Greg passed the gruelling commando selection and training course in 2004, going on to obtain a whole suite of commando and special forces qualifications. As a very humble man he was not one to boast about his skills. But just some of the courses that Greg volunteered for and completed included: the infantry reconnaissance course; commando urban operations course; advanced close quarter battle course; commando amphibious operations; close quarter fighting course; special forces roping; special forces heavy weapons course; military driving; special forces demolitions; the combat first aid course; and his military parachute course, (to name but a few). For each of these Greg was a volunteer. For each of these Greg stood out amongst his peers. But, for us in his unit, you need to know that Greg meant so much more than his many operational and special forces accomplishments. Greg was selected to serve within special forces because he had the attributes we were looking for and few have; attributes such as toughness, resolve and intelligence. But for Greg, one attribute stood out amongst all others, and it was his “compassion”. It is in this regard that Greg best personified the special forces soldier-the unique combination of the best team player who is still in so many ways an individual. Greg’s compassion as an individual came out in many ways. One of those was in his justification for why he was a soldier. He saw his role as a soldier being to help those that he loved and to do his part to make the world a better place. Greg was, as many soldiers have said to me this week, a truly rare and inspirational person. I know for me, whenever I saw GregI felt like a whole room just lit up and I wanted to talk to him about everyMAIN COMMITTEE thing. He was a well-read man who would enjoy a considered and meaningful discussion on any world issue. Last night I asked those soldiers closest to Greg what he wanted to talk about most when on gun piquet in the middle of the night. They said “Nothing. Because he would rather listen to you.” He would become so genuinely engrossed in what was important to you, what your dreams were and, when you were finished; say how “awesome” it was. Even if he had just heard the biggest load of rubbish, he would still find what you had to say interesting. He would still find what you had to say important. He would then tell you something about you that he really liked and in a way that you knew was heartfelt. He cared about other people and he made you feel good. For his compassion we went beyond just respecting him. We loved him for it. Another attribute Greg had in abundance was his determination to constantly improve. Even during the worse of days, when any other soldier would feel beaten and be tempted to give up, Greg’s resolve and strength was unwavering. He would say to his friends “When it’s really bad. I take it all in; I step back; regroup… and I come back stronger.” Whether it was mastering a new amphibious craft, honing his weapon change over drills, improving his fitness or learning how to improve new medical skills, he always sought to better himself. Greg always came back stronger. And his motivation for improvement was not one of competition but instead reflected his desire to better serve his team-mates. Greg did not want to let anyone down. And he never did. Over time we will learn more about how Greg had an infectious laugh, how important his Jewish faith was to him and how determined and driven he was. But before we present Greg with his medals for his service in Afghanistan, please indulge us for a moment more. Greg’s brothers will be very aware of a very short but moving poem that Greg used to motivate himself when times were hard or he felt down. He often had a copy on him, knew it off by heart and spoke about it regularly … It is called Invictus (Latin for “Unconquered”) and it is by William Earnest Henley, who wrote it from his hospital bed: Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. Greg, previous generations once bestowed the label of the “Greatest Living Australian” to a Jewish soldier from Melbourne called John Monash who, like you, began his military career as a reservist in the Victorian Militia and, like you, volunteered for everything he could and, like you, never stopped trying to improve himself and, in doing so, stood out amongst all others. MAIN COMMITTEE Greg, we know that our generation’s place in the story that is Australia is still being written. We know that it is being written in the jungles of East Timor and, as we speak here today, by our closest mates in the snow-covered caves of Afghanistan. We don’t know what the final story of this generation will be, but we do know that on a rock in Williamstown, on the war memorial in Canberra, in our history books and in our hearts, there will be several chapters devoted to a young Jewish man who, at this time in Australia’s history, stood up and said “I am Greg Sher and I am ready to serve”. Greg, from that day in 1986, when you, with your brothers and your parents, first volunteered to journey so far and become Australian, you have volunteered every day since. You have made Australia and this world a better place. You have demonstrated to all of us what it really means to be the master of your fate and the captain of your soul. We are all so much better for knowing and loving you. We salute you my friend and we will never forget you. When I heard that eulogy along with my colleague the member for Hunter, I thought it was very moving. These were Australia’s finest and bravest coming together to pay their respects to their comrade. I cannot add to the eulogy, because its words encapsulate the life of Private Gregory Sher. But we must never forget the courage and the sacrifice of such young men nor the grief and loss endured by their families and friends. To Greg’s comrades and colleagues still serving in Afghanistan and elsewhere and whose jobs are difficult and dangerous in often harsh and bloody environments, I simply say that we are proud of your service to your country. Please know and understand that we are committed in our service to you. May Greg Sher’s soul rest in peace. Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and indeed all of those who will make a contribution to the debate on this very important condolence motion. For a defence minister such motions bring both pleasure and pain. The pain is obvious as we are reflecting on the loss of one of our own; nothing is more difficult for a defence minister. The pain far outweighs any pleasantness but there is pleasure. The pleasure comes from an opportunity to pay tribute to a great Australian, an Australian who made the ultimate sacrifice. He gave everything for his nation in a most courageous and professional way. We can all be very proud of all the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. We can certainly be proud of Private Gregory Sher, who was a highly trained soldier, a very effective soldier and a soldier of great courage. He is truly one of our finest in the ANZAC tradition. There are a couple of things which make Greg Sher’s loss not unique but maybe unusual. The first is that he is the first reservist we have lost in Afghanistan. That is sad, but it also helps to highlight the important role our reservists play in the Australian Defence Force. It demonstrates to the Australian community that reservists can reach the highest levels of training, professionalism and expertise-and Greg Sher certainly did that. It highlights to the broader community the important role they are playing in defending Australia’s national security. The second somewhat unusual-and, I would say, very unlucky-thing is that we lost Greg Sher while he was within one of our forward operating bases in Afghanistan. That is unlucky. Despite his high level of training, expertise and skill, nothing could have saved Greg Sher. He was literally a person standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. When reflecting on these events, I think it is always important that we ask ourselves, as members of parliament, how we can say thank you for the sacrifices of people like Private Greg Sher. Of course, the most important thing is to commit ourselves to never forgetting his deeds and his sacrifices. Before the parliament today, I certainly make that commitment perMAIN COMMITTEE",315,Condolences
305,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Minister for Defence) (12.17 pm)-I begin by thanking thesonally. He will take pride of place with those who went before him in one of our most important institutions, the Australian War Memorial. The second thing is not so much a thanks directly to people like Private Greg Sher but a thank you that recommits us to ensuring that those who come after him, and indeed those who still serve, have all the capability, protection and training they need to allow them to do their job as effectively, efficiently and safely as is possible. This is an absolute priority for me and I know an absolute priority for the government. I have often said publicly that military planners spend a lot of time thinking about hedging against the improbable, and that is very important, but we need to spend at least equal time planning for, funding and creating the capability and training we need to ensure that the people who are doing things now on a daily basis in the most dangerous of circumstances have all the protection and capability they need and deserve. Again, I recommit myself to that very important cause. The third thing, of course, is to finish the job, just as Greg’s mates finished their job by continuing on with their important mission despite the loss of Private Greg Sher. And they did so very successfully. Indeed, they met their main objective when they removed from the equation Mullah Abdul Rasheed, a key Taliban leader. Disrupting the insurgency leadership is crucial to better progress in Afghanistan and that is what Greg and his mates were going out to do after they were to leave that forward operating base on that fateful day of 4 January this year. Afghanistan remains a great challenge but we must follow the job through. We must ensure that Greg Sher and the seven other Australians who lost their lives wearing the Australian uniform, and indeed the Australian recently lost wearing a UK uniform, did not give their lives in vain. Again, I say to those still mourning the loss of Greg Sher that we intend to continue on with our determination to ensure that Afghanistan does not once again descend into a breeding ground and a safe haven for those who train for and plan their acts of terror and give them application around the globe, including in our own backyard in this region and potentially right here in Australia. That is our most important task: ensuring the government in Afghanistan is able to take care of its own security in the long term and a government in Afghanistan, which, unlike the former Taliban regime, is not prepared to give a safe house to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda-groups which are prepared to perpetrate those acts of terror in the name of their extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism. Of course, there are other important tasks in Afghanistan, the least not being the opportunity to lift the Afghan people out of a life of abject poverty, to promote human rights-for example, giving women equal rights and the opportunity to secure an education-and to turn off that drug flow that produces around 90 per cent of the world’s opiates. They are drugs that fund terrorism both within Afghanistanthe money is used against our own troops-and around the globe. Some of those drugs obviously end up on the streets of Australia and in the arms of young Australians. So the best way we can thank Private Greg Sher and those who went before him is to finish the job. As I said, we continue to remain committed to the job. There has been a lot of speculation recently about whether we would be asked to do more in Afghanistan and, as I have said publicly on a number of occasions, we will always consider any request from our allies to do more, because this is an important project. But there are some threshold issues: we would expect those undercommitted NATO countries to do more, we would expect the coalition to produce a new plan for greater success and we would expect the request to come with some strategic justification-that is, not more numbers for the sake of more numbers but as part of MAIN COMMITTEE a broader plan to produce that greater success. And of course the risk analysis is always very important-that anything additional we might do carries acceptable risks in terms of the risk it poses to those who are fighting under our flag in that theatre. It remains to be seen whether any such request comes forward, but they are the conditions under which this government would give any further consideration to doing more than we are as a non-NATO country fighting a NATO mission. We are the largest non-NATO contributor and the 9th or 10th-the number fluctuates-contributor overall. The other pleasant thing one experiences in the difficult event of losing a soldier is the opportunity to meet their family and mates. It never fails to amaze me how close our ADF community is and, when you break that down, how close particular units are-for example, the special forces family. I have had the great pleasure of meeting many of the people who trained with and worked with Greg Sher-and indeed trained him-and they are a wonderful group of people, committed to their work. I know they provided great comfort to Greg’s family and I want to pay tribute to the way they have handled the situation and for the support they have given to Greg’s family. It has been absolutely wonderful. The member for Paterson read into the Hansard the eulogy for Greg Sher, presented by a very impressive young captain at the ramp ceremony when Greg returned home. It is interesting to note that the eulogy was written by a few mates in the pub late the evening before. I think there could be nothing more Australian than to have collectively scribed their tribute to their mate over a few beers in the pub the evening before. I thought some of them looked a bit tired that day. We would not deny them that. Greg’s family and friends have established a website, which is quite unusual. It is www.gregsher.com, and I recommend it to members of parliament but also the broader community because if you go into that website you will see the extent to which Greg Sher was both loved and respected. There are pages and pages of tributes from a whole range of people who knew Greg Sher in various forms throughout his life, whether it was at school, in his work or through his involvement with the Australian Army. I recommend it; it is a wonderful tribute to a wonderful Australian. Lastly, the family-what a wonderful family the Shers are: Greg’s dad, Felix; his mum, Yvonne; his brothers, both of them wonderful people; and his partner, Karen, who as much as anyone of course is feeling his loss very strongly. Families react differently to tragic events like this. Some cannot stop shedding tears. Others appear to be, if you like, much stronger, but on the inside the result is just the same. The Shers have been very, very strong and very appreciative of the way the Australian Army have dealt with their loss. Felix specifically asked me to pass on his thanks during the condolence debate today. He was in awe of the way the Chief of Army and those under him have supported the family through their most difficult time. I should say that since becoming the minister that has been my experience on each occasion we have lost a soldier in theatre. The Australian Army are very good at taking care of their own and very good at helping, in any way that they can, the families who have tragically suffered a loss. I thank them for that and pay tribute to them. To Felix and Yvonne, to Steven and Barry, to Karen and the broader family and all Greg’s friends: I extend once again my deepest sympathy. One thing common amongst these families is that they always say that their son was doing what he wanted to do, he understood what he MAIN COMMITTEE was doing, he knew the risks and was prepared to take those risks, and he fully believed in what he was doing for his country. The Sher family certainly fall into that category, and for that I pay tribute to them. They have been supportive of Greg in his ambition to rise through the Australian Army and his skill competencies and they remain supportive of his decision to deploy to Afghanistan, even though the outcome for them has been so tragic. As others have said, Greg was a member of the commandos; indeed, the 1st Commando Regiment, based in Sydney, but more specifically the 2nd Commando Company, based in his home state of Victoria. He previously had deployed to East Timor and was a highly decorated soldier. I will not go through the list of his awards again. That has already been done by others. Again, my deepest sympathies to the family and my thanks to Greg Sher for what he did for his country. He is truly a great Australian. memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. Private Gregory Michael Sher is indeed a great example to all Australians, and it is with great pride mixed with some sadness that I rise to honour this fallen warrior, the eighth since 2002 to give his life serving our country in Afghanistan. I pass on my sympathy and support to his family: his parents, Felix and Yvonne; his brothers, Steven and Barry; his grandmothers, Sylvia and Molly; his partner, Karen; and his aunts and uncles, Bertha and Harold Milner, Hazel and Alan Fine and Rael and Diana Dushansky. Greg was 30 years old, a young man to lose his life fighting on a foreign battlefield. As we age in this place and around the country, age shall no longer weary Private Sher. Remembrance Day this year will see his name etched on the roll of honour, as Remembrance Day last year saw so many names etched there. As the ancient adage has taught us, ‘Good men must die but death cannot kill their names.’ Private Sher was killed in a rocket attack in Oruzgan province at the hand of Taliban insurgents. He was serving with the Sydney based 1st Commando Regiment as part of the Special Operations Task Group. Yet he was born a long way from these shores, in South Africa, and moved to Australia with his family in 1986. He fully embraced our great nation as his new home and joined the Army in 1998 as a reserve infantryman. In 2002 he served in East Timor and was subsequently awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor Medal, the Infantry Combat Badge, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal and the Australian Defence Medal. His family describe him as a man of purpose and committed determination, a quiet achiever who always got the job done. I think we would describe him as a deadset hero and a man who truly put sacrifice above self. Private Sher and those like him are beacons of inspiration for others who strive to defend freedom, restore peace and hope and provide a better future for the people they serve-those of Afghanistan. He fought for those who simply could not fight for themselves. He stands tall, as a man who believes that all people, wherever they may live, should have the opportunity to live in a better world that is free from violence, intimidation and repression. I know it can only ever be a small comfort to his family, but Private Sher sacrificed his life doing what he loved: soldiering and serving his country. The saying, ‘We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm,’ is attributed to George Orwell. If freedom is indeed the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it, then Gregory Sher MAIN COMMITTEE",318,Condolences
306,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12.32 Pm),"Benjamin Disraeli said that the legacy of heroes is astands tall in this nation’s history as a man who had the courage to defend what he believed to be true-in the great tradition of Pericles, the ancient warrior, statesman and king, who founded the Athenian empire 2½ thousand years ago and led that nation for the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. Pericles once said that what you leave behind is not what is engraved on stone monuments but what is woven into the lives of others. The Minister for Defence has just spoken eloquently about Private Sher’s mates. He painted a picture of the boys having a few quiet ales together in the pub the night before Private Sher’s funeral, reflecting on his life and drafting his eulogy. The minister painted a picture of what Private Sher had woven into the lives of others. Such memories cannot be outdone or outshone through monuments of stone; they live and breathe every day in the lives that are left behind. This parliament is very proud of Private Gregory Sher. We thank his family for the great sacrifice they have made. It is unimaginable what it would be like to lose a son, but Private Sher died fighting for his country. He died proudly. He died a soldier’s death. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (12.37 pm)Over the past year and a half in this place, I have come to appreciate that we do experience some very special moments and chances to contribute on very significant issues. This is definitely one of those moments. I deem it a very great privilege to be able to speak on this condolence motion for Private Gregory Sher. He was truly a great Australian, an extremely proud Australian. He lived all of his formative childhood years in this country and considered himself an Australian. He did not really know much about his background in South Africa; he was very proud to be an Australian. His family, his brothers and his partner admired and understood that about Private Sher. As we have heard, Private Sher was killed in a rocket attack. During my year in Iraq, I came under rocket attack many times in that place and watched the destruction and devastation that can be caused by those attacks. I know what it is like to sit there and wash from your gear the blood of your friends; those consequences become apparent from those attacks. TodayI send out my thoughts and prayers to Private Sher’s colleagues, because I know the impact of that experience on them. But I also know that, being the proud professionals they are, they will use this experience to steel themselves for further effort in our cause in Afghanistan. I salute their service. I have spoken to Private Sher’s family, and they are wonderful people-Yvonne and Felix, Stephen and Barry, and Gregory’s partner Karen. They have made wonderful contributions to the Australian community in their own right. It was wonderful to hear Felix talk about the Australian Defence Force and the reserves who serve it. It was wonderful to hear his encouragement for those members, and for people who think about joining the ADF, to continue in that path. He understands the importance of that service and what it means to this country and the international community. SoI salute the family of Greg Sher as well. We have heard a lot about Greg’s biography, his background, and I will not go over that ground. I thank the members for Fadden and Patterson for their contributions, and I particularly thank the minister for his. But there is one aspect that I would like to highlight about Greg’s service-that is, he was a reservist. It is a privilege in my work in this portfolio to be responsible for the reservists. I do not think people truly appreciate, given that Greg Sher was a commando, what extra effort is required to achieve the qualifications of being a commando MAIN COMMITTEE in the special forces, to pass all those courses we have heard about and at the same time to be an ordinary citizen going about your day-to-day life. Effectively, our reservists amount to twice the soldiers because of what they contribute to the community and then the extra effort they make, those extra yards they go, to serve this country as reservists. We are so well served by our reserves. In recent years we have become more and more dependent upon that service. In the last financial year, over 1,800 man-years of service was provided by reservists employed on continuous full-time service and a further 4,500 man-years of service was delivered using reserve days. In addition to that, of course, we have had 3,000 reservists serving on ADF operations, both overseas and within Australia. Over the past two years those operations have included individual deployments involving particular specialties and skills. Our reservists have provided capability bricks in the Middle East and East Timor, carried out border security and UN duties and also served as subunit groups in the Solomon Islands. They took part in Operation Acolyte, which supported the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, in Operation Deluge, which was the APEC effort in Sydney, and in Operation Testament for the Papal visit to Sydney. So we are entirely dependent on our reserves to maintain our operational tempo. They are out there making every effort and committing themselves to the extra effort that is needed to prepare themselves for these operations, make that separation from their businesses and their employment and then come back and pick up the rope again to continue on. It was very special for me to welcome back recently the company group at Holsworthy from the Solomon Islands. I salute the service that our reserve forces are doing in the Solomon Islands. It will be a privilege to visit them later in the year. So that is a special thing to note about Private Greg Sher. We have heard that Private Sher was also a member of the Australian Jewish community, and a very proud member of that community. That community has contributed great things to this country over the years. In fact, as has been referred to, our finest commander, Sir John Monash, was a member of the Jewish community. Private Sher was someone who imbibed the values of that faith very deeply. One key principle of that religion is the concept of the Mitzvot, in effect the need for every citizen to do good deeds. Private Sher lived that credo in his day-to-day life, not just in his ADF service. He also imbibed the philosophy of the great Jewish philosophers over the years-this is really something we should absorb in relation to our struggle in Afghanistan and internationally against terrorism, or Islamist extremism-that there are great daunting tasks in front of us and we sometimes face them and say: ‘What can I do? This is a long battle; it will never be won through anything that I can do. I can’t see the end of this, maybe even in my lifetime.’ But the philosophy of these great Jewish philosophers was, ‘Certainly you may not be obligated to complete this task, but it is up to you to make your contribution, to make a beginning and to make an eventual contribution to success.’ Private Sher understood that-he understood that we were involved in an international struggle against this extremism. He understood the effort and the sacrifices and the threats of his coreligionists in Israel, and that these integrated and networked groups-Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, Taliban, the Jemaah Islamiah group-all have similar characteristics at their heart. It only takes a cursory reading of the charter of Hamas to understand the medieval and desperate ignorance of these people and the destruction and negativity and nihilism that they represent. MAIN COMMITTEE I think it is important for us to understand that we are not involved in an international war on terrorism. We should take these opportunities when we have these casualties to continually remind the Australian public about what it is we are engaged in in this struggle at the present time. It is in fact a war on ignorance. That is what is at the heart of this struggle. That effort must be fought on many levels and the minister has made comment many times about the different levels, nuances and sophistication that we must bring to the effort in Afghanistan and about how it cannot be won purely as a military effort; how it must be won on many levels. So this is going to be a battle as much in the classrooms and madrasahs as it is in the battlefield. Notwithstanding that, we still need warriors like Greg to deal with those whose goal it is to deal out death and destruction to the innocents. So we continue to need people to join our struggle, to join the defence forces and to join the reserves, to make our contribution to that international effort. We have physically lost Greg in that battle, but as a member of the ADF I know and understand that you never lose one of your own. We will always preserve the memory of Greg in our hearts and our minds, and Greg has now added his own page to the proudest history in this country, the ANZAC history. I salute Greg and I salute his family. in Afghanistan, a tragic event which took the life of one of our very good soldiers and a great Australian. That event is an example of the risks that are taking place every day for our servicemen overseas. I would like to make some comments today on the life and the service of Private Greg Sher. I will attempt to do it justice, though I have no direct knowledge of Greg nor was I at the ceremonies where others paid tribute to him. My past has some similarities, insofar as I wore the same sort of uniform as Greg. I would like to begin by talking about the comments that others have made in their writings about Greg-and I know of the great involvement of the member for Melbourne Ports in this matter. From what other people have said about him, Greg Sher seems to have been the classic special forces soldier-the sort we have all met through our service or our involvement with Defence. He was not a big man at five feet eight but he had a tremendous heart-not someone who was just physically tough but an all-rounder. He was genuinely interested in others-his mates and those around him. He was positive, enthusiastic and compassionate. He was a genuine and authentic person. Mention has been made about the fact that he was a reservist. This is a very important aspect. It was typical of those who had not actually served with the reservists to be somewhat critical of them. They were considered part-timers or chockos. Yet when you work with these guys you begin to realise that they are really committed. They love what they do on a part-time basis. They love to serve this country. They make their contribution in civilian life, as most Australians do, and then they give up their weekends and holidays. Then you have people like Greg, who joined the Army Reserve in 1998 and who by 2004 was seriously committed to undertaking the selection course for the Commandos. That is serious training and commitment to a cause. It comes through very strongly that he seemed to enjoy what he was doing. That is fabulous. He was genuinely committed to the service of this country and to his friends, and he was in a great situation where he enjoyed what he was doing. He was so very keen to participate, move forward and make an even greater contribution. What also struck me was that in this country we try not to refer to people by names that would possibly be perceived as denigrating them on religious grounds, and yet in 5/6 RVR, the 5th/6th Royal Victoria Regiment, his initial unit, and then later with the Commandos, MAIN COMMITTEE",321,Condolences
307,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12.46 Pm),"On the first Sunday of this year an event took placeGreg was called first ‘the Jew’ and then ‘the Super Jew’. He was clearly comfortable with that. He was a man who was not afraid to be defined by his religion. But obviously his greatest definition was great actions and great commitment to his cause. What we see in Greg is the very best, an example of the very highest level of commitment by an Australian in the reserve service of the defence forces. I also think of the great contribution that Jewish South Africans have made to our country. In Perth, in particular, we have a lot of people from South Africa of the Jewish religion. They make a fabulous contribution. They are involved across many sectors of the community. Private Greg Sher was an example of someone who took that a long way further. He put his life on the line for his friends and for a cause. It was clearly a job that he wanted to do and that he was fully committed to. He went a little bit further than most Australians in what he was prepared to do. Greg made a great contribution to this country. It is a terrible situation when someone so committed, someone so authentic, such a good bloke, eventually gives up his life for that cause. I am sure that nothing we can say here will ever take away the pain and the hurt that his family and his partner, Karen, feel. Possibly, through the comments that I and others have made today, they will feel some alleviation of that pain. Greg Sher was the sort of guy that we could all look up to. He was five foot eight, but the stature of the man was clearly above most of us. I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the contribution he made to this great country, the cause he fought for and died for. Sometimes it gets to the point where, for our freedoms, for the defence of the weak and defenceless, you just have to fight. This is something Greg knew and something he died for. I pay tribute to his sacrifice. He was a great Australian and we will miss him greatly. spoke in this chamber on the death of Lieutenant Michael Fussell on active service in Afghanistan. It is with great sadness that I rise again to record the death of another brave Australian soldier. This time, however, the sadness I feel is a bit more personal because the death of Private Greg Sher in Afghanistan on 4 January struck very close to home for me. The minister asked me to participate in the ramp ceremony, which I cannot say I appreciated or enjoyed doing, but it was my sacred duty that I did. It was an important thing to do on behalf of the family, but it is the hardest duty I have ever done since being elected, standing opposite that family as the body came back from the C17 through that group of his colleagues, the commandos with their green berets on. Standing opposite Felix and Yvonne as their son was returned in a casket was very hard for all of us who participated in it, but one can only imagine what the family has suffered and will continue to suffer through all the years with the loss of their precious eldest son, Greg Sher. Greg had the honour of being a member of 2nd Commando Company, which is a subunit of 1st Commando Regiment, based in Sydney. It is the first reserve unit to have the honour of being included in formations eligible to go on active service in Afghanistan. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their remarks about Greg in the House yesterday and the defence minister and the parliamentary secretary, the member for Eden-Monaro, for their comments here this morning, as well as members of the MAIN COMMITTEE",324,Condolences
308,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.54 Pm),"It is only a little over two months since Iopposition. I want to thank them on behalf of the family, because they have really appreciated their input and the sensitive way that particularly the minister, who has regularly been in contact with the family personally, has treated them. I also want to thank all of those people who participated in that enormous and moving funeral at Lyndhurst on that blistering hot day in Melbourne, including the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard; the Leader of the Opposition; the Prime Minister; and the Minister for Defence. We also had a couple of very senior military leaders present there: the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, and the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Lieutenant General David Hurley. I know this mark of respect by the country’s political and military leaders was deeply appreciated by the Sher family and indeed by the 2,000 people who attended the funeral. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my deepest condolences to Felix and Yvonne Sher, to Greg’s partner, Karen Goldschlager, to his brothers, Steven and Barry Sher, to all his family and to his colleagues in 2nd Commando and the Community Security Group, which he professionally worked in for some years. There were busloads of proud, leathered, former commandos who attended the masterfully organised funeral service, along with Deputy Premier Rob Hulls and, very interestingly, former signaller in 2nd Commando Minister Tim Holding, who is the local member. He was there with a bevy of orthodox rabbis. I want to record their names, because I want the family to know what honour was done to them. They were Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Groner, Rabbi Dovid Rubinfeld, Rabbi Meir Schlomo Kluwgant, Rabbi Sholom Mendel Kluwgant, Rabbi Mendel Groner, Rabbi Stephen Boroda, Rabbi Stephen Link and Rabbi Faitel Levin, and of course Rabbi Philip Heilbrunn officiated at the ceremony. Greg Sher, as was said, was born in South Africa in 1978 and came to Australia with his family as a child. He joined the Army Reserve in 1998 and later trained to be a commando, a particularly skilled branch of the Army but also one with a high level of risk, as he knew. He was deployed to East Timor in 2002. For his service there he received several awards, including the Australian Active Service Medal, the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge. In Afghanistan he was awarded the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal and the Australian Defence Medal. Greg Sher was the first member of the reserves to be killed in Afghanistan. He is the first Jewish member of the Australian defence forces to be killed in action, I think, since the Second World War. I think he is the first reservist to die since Vietnam. His friends and his family are also very proud. They are proud to have given Australia such a fine young man, willing to risk and ultimately lose his life for his adopted country’s service. They are also proud that he died working to free other people from tyranny and oppression. They are proud that a first generation immigrant family could participate in such an elite unit as the 2nd Commando. I have spoken in the House before about Sir John Monash, regarded by many historians as Australia’s greatest military commander. Like Greg Sher, John Monash was the son of Jewish immigrants, this time from Prussia, not from South Africa, who came to Australia in search of a better life and who valued above all the freedom, equality and opportunity that they found in this most fortunate of countries. In the First World War, as today, all members of Australian forces were volunteers. History has taught us many hard lessons, and one of them is that freedom is fragile and can never be taken for granted. Both John Monash and Greg Sher willingly MAIN COMMITTEE volunteered to serve Australia because they knew Australia was worth fighting for and because they wanted other people to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy here. There is a certain irony in the fact that the people whose freedom Greg Sher died for were Muslim Afghans, the long-suffering people of Afghanistan. As the member for Eden-Monaro alluded to, a very small number of people in Australia have sought to foment conflict between Jews and Muslims here based on hatreds imported from other parts of the world. Greg Sher’s life and death show that such efforts have not succeeded. He was a soldier who went where he was ordered to go but he was also a citizen, a very intelligent and very well-read citizen, who knew exactly what he was fighting for and why. For him, the right of Muslim people in Afghanistan to live in freedom and security was just as important as the right of people in Australia or any other country to do so. As I said in my speech on the death of Lieutenant Fussell, we in this place have no right to send young Australian men and women to risk their lives in foreign fields unless we are certain that the cause for which we are sending them to fight is a just one and that our objectives are clear and attainable. That was not the case, for example, in Vietnam, but I believe that it was very clearly the case in East Timor, where Greg Sher served with our peacekeeping forces. I also believe that this is the case in Afghanistan, although, as the Minister for Defence has explained to many people and as our military chief says, the task is a much tougher one. The defeat of multinational terrorism based in Afghanistan is vital for our own national security as well as for the people of Afghanistan. We are fighting in Afghanistan to give its people the chance of a better future free from violence, oppression, corruption and extremism. None of our boys who have died there died in vain-not Private Greg Sher, not Lieutenant Michael Fussell, not any one of the honoured eight. Counterinsurgency fights are often long and bitter, but I believe that we and our allies can achieve our objectives if we persist and that the sacrifices we are asking of our service personnel and their families will, in the long run, be worthwhile. That is certainly what Greg Sher believed, and we should honour his memory by ensuring that we do not fail in our mission. As the member for Eden-Monaro said, I salute Greg Sher and his family. He would probably describe himself by the line in the poem Invictus, which he kept with him all the time and that is noted by all of his military colleagues as something that was very dear to his heart: captain of his soul, master of his fate. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

311,Mr Marles (Corio) (1.03 Pm),"I move:Hon. Peter Howson CMG Debate resumed from 3 February, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 1 February 2009 of the Honourable Peter Howson CMG, a former Federal Minister and Member for Fawkner and Casey, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. motion for the late Peter Howson, who was a member of this parliament and a minister in a number of governments. For most of his career Peter was the member for Fawkner but, for his final term in parliament, he was the member for Casey. He was in fact the first member for Casey. The seat was created in a redistribution which meant that his seat of Fawkner was abolished, and he took the opportunity to offer himself as a Liberal Party candidate for the new seat of Casey for the 1969 election. He served as the member, winning in 1969 and losing in 1972 when the tide took out a number of seats with the election of the Whitlam government. I had the privilege of meeting Peter on a couple of occasions. Others, particularly the member for Higgins, who knew him very well, have said in the House that he remained a very active and vibrant member of the Liberal Party, of which he was so proud. I met him shortly after my election as the member for Casey at a Liberal Party state council. Following meeting him I took the opportunity to read his diaries. I had heard about the Howson diaries and he motivated me to have a look. They are extensive diaries and a wonderful political read, I would say, for all members of this House. They cover all the major events throughout his time as a member of parliament. I found the diaries to be fascinating reading on many levels. They are very candid. The member for Higgins said in the House yesterday that he was one of the first to read them because he read them in his capacity as a lawyer and he had to clear them for defamation. I found them fascinating inasmuch as they illustrate how some things never change about electoral politics. In those diaries he goes through in some detail the difficult tasks of preparing for election day. He talks in great detail about moving out to the electorate of Casey, campaigning in that first election and preparing for the next one. He talks about some of the great volunteers for the Liberal Party, some of whom are still there as great supporters today. He talks about the suburbs and the public meetings he had and how the suburbs were very different at that point. There has been a lot of growth and urbanisation in the period since he was the member for Casey. Peter talks fondly about going to a meeting of the North Croydon branch of the Liberal party, which was a very active branch then and still is today. His story, which is told so well in his diaries, is a great story about the Australian parliament. He was part of the generation that fought in the Second World War. Born in England, he came to Australia immediately after the war and became interested in politics. He arrived in Australia at the time when the Liberal Party had just been formed, and he worked tirelessly and ran as a candidate a couple of times before he was successful as the member for Fawkner. The measure of the man was very much in his great contribution as a member of parliament and in his wonderful dedication to public policy, not just in his ministerial career but also after MAIN COMMITTEE",327,Condolences
312,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (4.15 Pm),"I am honoured to speak on this condolencehis time as a member of parliament. He remained politically active and dedicated himself to the issues he believed in, particularly Aboriginal affairs. He did that every day of his life.

Honourable members having stood in their placesMs HALL (Shortland) (4.21 pm)-I move: That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Consideration resumed from 3 February 2009. vestiture of the Victoria Cross for Australia with SAS Trooper Mark Donaldson. Trooper Donaldson was involved in an incident on 2 September 2008 in Oruzgan province, Afghanistan, that resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. He was invested by Her Excellency the Governor General of Australia at Government House, Canberra, on 16 January 2009. In acknowledging his bravery, this House notes that the Victoria Cross is the pre-eminent award for acts of bravery in wartime and is Australia’s highest military honour. It is awarded to persons who, in the presence of the enemy, display the most conspicuous gallantry; a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice; or extreme devotion to duty. The incident for which Trooper Donaldson was invested with the Victoria Cross occurred in September last year when Australian special forces, moving in convoy with US and Afghan soldiers, were ambushed by a superior number of well-placed Taliban fighters. The ambush was initiated by a high volume of sustained machine-gun fire and rocket propelled grenades. Such was the effect of the attack that the combined patrol suffered numerous casualties, lost the initiative and became immediately suppressed. Nine Australian soldiers were wounded in the 2 September ambush, the highest number of casualties in a single attack since Vietnam. It was over two hours before the convoy was able to establish a clean break and move to an area free of enemy fire. During that time, Trooper Donaldson-who prior to his investment had been referred to in previous accounts only as ‘Trooper F’-deliberately and repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to draw the fire away from his injured colleagues. In the early stages of the ambush, he moved rapidly between alternate positions of cover, engaging the enemy with 66 mm and 84 mm anti-armour weapons as well as his M4 rifle. This selfless action alone bought enough time for those wounded to be moved to safety. When the Afghan coalition interpreter, who had been shot, fell from one of the humvees, Donaldson ran to his aid, crossing 80 metres of exposed ground under heavy machine-gun fire to reach the wounded interpreter. He then carried him on his shoulders back to the vehicles, where he administered first aid before returning to the fight. MAIN COMMITTEE",328,Condolences

315,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.22 Pm),"On indulgence: I rise today to speak about the inTrooper Donaldson displayed the kind of selfless heroism that history never forgets. There is no greater honour for an Australian soldier, and we know that this honour is shared in some small measure by his friends and family, by his wife Emma, his young daughter Kaylee, and by his colleagues at home and those still serving in Afghanistan. Trooper Donaldson’s distinguished career began with his first posting to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Townsville, Queensland, in November 2002. It was during this time that Trooper Donaldson decided to pursue his ambitions and join the Special Air Service Regiment. In February 2004, he successfully completed the Special Air Service Regiment selection course and was posted to the regiment in May 2004. He was then posted to 1 Troop, 3 SAS Squadron. Since that time, he has been deployed in operations in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. Trooper Donaldson remains posted to the Special Air Service Regiment in Perth, Western Australia. Trooper Donaldson is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia which was created in 1991, before which Australians were eligible for the Victoria Cross and other awards under the imperial system of honours. The medal, inscribed with the words, ‘For valour’, is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon a soldier. Trooper Donaldson’s actions displayed exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril. His actions are of the highest accord and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Special Operations Command, the Australian Army, and the Australian Defence Force. Tradition also holds within the armed service that even the most senior officer will salute a Victoria Cross recipient as a mark of respect, so Trooper Donaldson will now enjoy a salute rate equal to that of our CDF. Trooper Donaldson now joins a rare few who will forever be remembered and revered. We stand united today in saluting this young man’s courage and bravery and thanking him and his colleagues for the incredible work they do. son has indicated, the Victoria Cross is the highest award for bravery and valour in action. The award is, of course, not handed out lightly. Indeed, until recently an Australian had not received a Victoria Cross for some 40 years. Those who are awarded the Victoria Cross, by virtue of that fact enter a hall of legends. Typically they share a number of attributes. They are typically highly skilled, usually super fit and, of course, full of courage. Selflessness is a typical trait, and they are dedicated to their task and their duty. While I cannot say I have known many of them. I have known a couple but have read of others-I sense that modesty is usually present amongst those in this sort of elite club. I, with others, had the honour of attending the ceremony at Government House recently when Trooper Mark Donaldson received his award. It really was a great privilege to be there and to meet him, and to talk with him and his wife and his daughter and his other relatives and friends. There you got an additional sense, talking to friends and family, about the man-what he is, what he has been, and what made him the hero he is today. I also had the opportunity to speak with some of his mates, and, indeed, have a beer with some of his mates-those who were there with him on that day when our troops encountered a terrible ambush in Oruzgan province. I recommend to all Australians with an interest in the issue-in military history, in our military affairs-to read the full citation. The Prime Minister read part of it in the main chamber MAIN COMMITTEE",329,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
316,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Minister for Defence) (4.26 pm)-As the member for Pateryesterday, but he made the point that he had only read a selected part of the citation. To get a full appreciation of what Trooper Donaldson did you really do need to read the full citation. At the risk of putting it in simplistic terms, on the occasion of the ambush he exposed himself and drew fire so that the wounded could be dragged to the relative safety of the vehicles. He then proceeded to break contact with his comrades. There was no room in the vehicles because the wounded were taking up all of that space. Trooper Donaldson broke contact on foot, moving with the vehicles, returning fire all the way. As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday, he then noticed that one had been left behind. A member of the ANA, an interpreteran important part of the unit at the time-had been left behind, some 80 metres back, in open ground. Trooper Donaldson ran back, returning fire all the time. He picked the guy up, put him over his shoulders, ran back another 80 metres or so to the vehicle and put him in the vehicle. He applied first aid. Of course, our special forces soldiers are highly trained in first aid. He then returned to the fight. The incredible thing is how Trooper Mark Donaldson is still alive today. It is probably a reflection of not only his courage but a little bit of luck he had on that occasion. But, as we all know, you make your own luck, and highly trained soldiers are very good at doing that. The whole event serves another very good purpose. The publicity surrounding Trooper Donaldson’s valour provides us with a fairly rare opportunity, as people close to these things, to share with the outside world exactly what our boys are doing on a daily basis. They are doing fantastic work disrupting the insurgency, taking enormous risks every day in very, very difficult circumstances. It is a good thing that we get an opportunity from time to time to portray a picture for the Australian community of what these guys are doing on a daily basis. I said in the House months ago, in response to a condolence motion, that we are a nation which loves its sport. We revere our sporting legends. We respect them and talk about their speed, their skill, their strength and their courage on the field. Yet those are all the attributes shared by these special forces soldiers. For them, of course, the stakes are so much higher. It is not just about a trophy at the end of the season. These guys are fighting for the security of their nation and literally fighting for their lives. Each day, as they proceed out into theatre, they never have any assurance as to whether they will return in one piece. Today we pay tribute to Trooper Mark Donaldson, who, as I said, joins an elite group. It was great to have Keith Payne at the ceremony at Government House too. He is a great Australian who was awarded the VC as a result of his actions during the Vietnam War. So we pay tribute to Trooper Mark Donaldson today, but we also pay tribute to those who were in that battle with him on that day. We pay tribute to those who will be out there today, as we speak, and again tomorrow and the day after and the day after that. We pay tribute to all the men and women who are deployed overseas, doing good work for the broader Australian community. We have lost nine young Australians in Afghanistan, eight in the Australian uniform and one, young Stuart Nash, fighting under the British flag. It is nine too many. As I said on the condolence motion for Private Sher this morning, we as policymakers have an obligation to ensure that they have not given their lives in vain. We must do all we can, as a relatively minor player in the Afghanistan campaign, to ensure that NATO has a properly resourced and coordinated plan to win in Afghanistan. We have an obligation to ensure that, whenever we make decisions about deploying our troops, the proper risk analysis is undertaken and we MAIN COMMITTEE have a clear picture in our mind about why we are there and, therefore, our basis for justifying sending our young people into such a high-threat area of operations. Today, in addition to paying tribute to Trooper Mark Donaldson, we pay tribute, as I said, to all the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are taking great risks, on a daily basis, so that those of us who treasure freedom and democracy and the things on which we base our nation can continue to enjoy our way of life and so that Australians around the globe, not just those on Australia’s mainland, can travel in relative peace and safety. It is a great privilege to be in the federal parliament and indeed to be the Minister for Defence on such a rare occasion-when the Victoria Cross is awarded to a fine Australian soldier. For that opportunity I am truly eternally grateful. only the 97th recipient of the Victoria Cross in Australia and the first in 40 years and, of course, the first to receive the VC of Australia. The Victoria Cross is awarded only for the most conspicuous acts of gallantry. On 16 January 2009 Trooper Donaldson received his VC for such acts while serving with the Special Operations Task Group during Operation Slipper in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan. Trooper Donaldson was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1979. He graduated from high school in 1996 and enlisted in the Australian Army on 18 June 2002, entering recruit training at the Army Recruit Training Centre, Kapooka. Clearly the boy could shoot. He was awarded best shot and best at physical training in his platoon. Subsequently he was allocated to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and posted to the School of Infantry. He excelled in his initial training, again being awarded recognition as best shot and best at physical training and most outstanding soldier in his platoon. Subsequently he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in Townsville. Trooper Donaldson decided to pursue his ambition to join the Special Air Service Regiment and, after completing the Special Air Service Regiment selection course-with which, in itself, it is no mean feat simply to be standing at the end of what I know as the Carter coursein April 2004 he was posted to the SAS Regiment. In May he turned up at the front door, posted to 1 Troop, 3 SAS Squadron. He was then deployed to operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was married to Emma and has a daughter Kaylee. In August 2008, Donaldson was wounded in action during night-time operations in Oruzgan province. Then less than one month later, on 2 September 2008, while travelling with a combined Australian, Afghan and US convoy, the convoy was ambushed by a large contingency of Taliban armed with machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The convoy was overwhelmed by numbers and sheer gunfire for two hours before being able to extricate themselves to a safe area. Several casualties were suffered on the patrol and Donaldson deliberately placed himself in enemy fire to allow the wounded to be carried to safety. He constantly changed positions to find a vantage point while engaging the enemy. The disregard for his own safety allowed time for the wounded in his convoy to move to safer ground. Those who were not wounded, including Donaldson himself, were required to run beside the vehicle to exit the ambush area. Donaldson noticed, though, that, 80 metres behind the convoy, a wounded Afghan interpreter had been left behind. Again, Donaldson put his safety behind that of others and ran 80 metres to assist the Afghan interpreter. Running over open ground, Donaldson came under MAIN COMMITTEE",330,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
317,Mr Robert (Fadden) (4.35 Pm),"I rise to honour Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson VC,intense fire from the enemy. He picked up the wounded man and ran back to safety, carrying and then administering first aid to the coalition force interpreter, constantly being fired at by the enemy with machine-gun and rocket fire. This was an Afghan interpreter-not an Australian citizen but a man of Afghan background whom Trooper Donaldson risked his own life to go back and recover. The full citation for the Victoria Cross is worth a read for all Australians. It exemplifies bravery in the extreme. The Victoria Cross is the pre-eminent award for acts of bravery in wartime and is our highest military honour. It is awarded to people who, in the presence of the enemy, display the most conspicuous gallantry, a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or selfsacrifice or extreme devotion to duty. The Victoria Cross was created by Queen Victoria in 1856 and made retrospective to 1854 to cover the period of the Crimean War. Until the Victoria Cross for Australia was created in 1991, Australians were eligible for the VC and other awards under the imperial system. The Imperial Victoria Cross was awarded to 96 Australians-91 received the Victoria Cross while serving with Australian forces and five Australians received the award while serving with South African and British units. Australians were first recognised for their gallantry in the Boer War and of course more recently, with Keith Payne, in the Vietnam War. Six VCs were awarded in the Boer War, 64 in World War I, two in North Russia in 1919, 20 in World War II, four in Vietnam and, of course, one in Afghanistan. Nine of the crosses awarded in World WarI were for Australians at Gallipoli. The Victoria Cross for Australia was instituted in the Australian honours system by letters patent on 15 January 1991. It replaced the imperial award. The first to receive the Victoria Cross was Captain Sir Neville Howse during the Boer War. He also served in World WarI and later as the Commonwealth Minister for Health, Defence and Repatriation. The most recent recipient, Keith Payne VC OAM, received it for gallantry during the Vietnam War on 24 May 1969. While under heavy enemy fire, he instigated a daring rescue of more than 40 men, many of them wounded, and led the party back to the battalion base. The Governor General awards the Victoria Cross, with the approval of the sovereign, on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence. It may be awarded posthumously. The Victoria Cross is designed in the form of the Maltese Cross. In the centre of the medal is a lion guardant standing upon the Royal Crown. The words ‘For valour’ are inscribed below. The Victoria Cross is suspended from a bar by a crimson ribbon. On the reverse of the cross the date of the act of bravery is inscribed, along with the name, rank and unit of the recipient. The Victoria Cross has, from the first, been made by Messrs Hancock, London jewellers, and is hand fashioned. The metal used is taken from the guns captured from the Russians at Sebastopol during the Crimean War from 1854 to 1856. To quote the ANZAC Day website: The glorious fellowship of the Victoria Cross remains unique, it has no order nor chapel. … … … It is confined to no caste, imposes no religious requirement nor colour bar. In the words of the Warrant ‘Neither rank nor long service, nor wounds, nor any other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of conspicuous bravery’ shall entitle a man to the award. There are only 10 surviving members of this grand fellowship alive today. Words simply fail to express the unsurpassed heroism shown by these recipients. They stand tall and alone and separate by their sheer deeds. MAIN COMMITTEE If freedom is indeed the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it, then Trooper Donaldson VC stands tall in our nation’s history, especially in our nation’s modern military history. As I said previously in the House, in the great tradition of that ancient warrior, statesman and king, Pericles, who founded the great Athenian empire 2½ thousand years ago and led that nation during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War, ‘What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.’ Trooper Donaldson risked his life to save an Afghan national, crossing 80 metres of ground criss-crossed by machine-gun fire. His heroism inspires countless generations and touches lives around the world. It stands as a true testament of the capacity and the calibre of man. We honour him today. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (4.43 pm)-It is a great privilege to be able to speak this afternoon on a positive note in that, wonderfully, Trooper Mark Donaldson VC is still with us, which is something in itself to celebrate given that so many past Victoria Cross winners were awarded it posthumously. Of course the acts that are involved in achieving the award of a Victoria Cross obviously involve a great deal of personal risk, being risk to life and limb. It is wonderful that we have a living VC member with us now in Trooper Donaldson VC. Just saying those words ‘Trooper Donaldson VC’ really does send a tingle up the spine. When I first heard the news that we had a new VC for this generation, I was really excited and thrilled, as I have in my portfolio responsibilities for the honours and awards issue. Also, the day that the actual award was presented to Trooper Donaldson at Government House was a memorable occasion because, as has been mentioned, Keith Payne VC was present. In effect, we had the two representatives of the book-ending of the VC in Australian recent history in that Keith Payne was awarded the last of the imperial VCs and then, after a 40-year intervening break, we had Trooper Donaldson being awarded the first of the VCs for Australia. It was wonderful to have the two of them there together. Keith Payne observed that he did not understand how Trooper Donaldson had actually survived that engagement. You read these words of his engagement on that day and they roll off the tongue when you say, ‘He moved rapidly between alternate positions of cover, engaging the enemy with 66 millimetre and 84 millimetre anti-armour weapons as well as his M4 rifle.’ But to reflect on that for a second, he was, in effect, utilising three different weapon systems in this engagement. Of course, none of them are light or easy to be proficient with in the circumstances of a hot engagement. It just goes to illustrate the incredible professionalism of the special forces personnel that he was able to effectively use those three weapons systems at the same time. Really, that should tell people of the standard of the special forces soldiers that this country is so privileged to have at its service. Trooper Donaldson VC is not a stranger to the risks that he was taking when he was involved in this engagement because on 12 August 2008 he was wounded in action in a night operation in Oruzgan province. So it is not as if he did not understand the risks that were involved in what he was doing. I think that adds an extra element to the impressiveness of his particular physical actions and courage on the day, and certainly they were in the finest traditions of the VCs as so many of the Australian VCs have involved the rescue of mates and the selflessness of looking after fellow soldiers serving in those environments. As the member for MAIN COMMITTEE Fadden pointed out, he rescued an Afghani interpreter, so his selflessness was not only extended to Australians but also to his Afghani colleague. Trooper Donaldson VC has also served in East Timor and Iraq as well as Afghanistan. He has only been a member of the Australian Army since 18 June 2002. So, in these short years, this individual has had three significant deployments, and we certainly have come to rely very heavily in recent times on our special forces in these environments. The reason is that the special forces soldiers, with their incredible professionalism and skills, give us the rapier that we need to deal with these counterinsurgency situations. You have a couple of options when you are in these circumstances. You can try to fall back on firepower and incur some of the massive collateral damage that is sometimes involved with that. In a counterinsurgency environment, that will often entail a loss of support amongst the general community and alienation, pushing people into the arms of the insurgents that you are fighting. And so to have this capability where we can isolate the enemy to engage with them as a rapier in a directed, targeted and surgical operation gives us and the international community great capability of pursuing our efforts in this counterinsurgency struggle that we are engaged in at the moment in Afghanistan. During the break we had a discussion in the community about the comparisons of courage. Certainly since I have been in this place I have come to appreciate very much the political and moral courage of the people who enter parliament on both sides of this House. I particularly think of people like the member for Kooyong and the great courage he has displayed in his political life. But I do think it is wrong to compare that courage with the courage of a VC winner like Trooper Donaldson. Unless you have actually stood there and faced the physical threat of having your limbs ripped from you, of having 7.62 millimetre rounds tearing through your body, hot shrapnel burning into you, seeing comrades or colleagues or other people in the vicinity torn apart by explosives, knowing that any moment of your existence in those theatres could be the last on two legs or with all of your limbs and faculties, or of your time on this earth, then I think you just cannot compare the respective levels of courage that are required in those circumstances. Upon reflection, those who might have made that comparison will think better of that. As I say, I certainly would not want to detract from the courage that is required in politics in this place, but Trooper Donaldson VC occupies a special place in the esteem of this community for the special courage that he has displayed. The VC is a very distinct part of our culture and history. It resonates so deeply with Australians, and that is because it really does encompass the values that Australians hold most dearly-the values of not only the physical courage to face the enemy but also the courage to look after your mates and to put your mates and your unit before yourself. Lastly, I would like to highlight the fact that Trooper Donaldson VC, by his actions and by the award of this decoration, has served as an incredible inspiration to the rest of his colleagues in the ADF. The news of this award went like an electric current right through the Australian Defence Force. It has inspired his colleagues and comrades and all of us who have worn the uniform to aspire to better and higher, to match the achievements of Trooper Donaldson, at least in effort if the circumstances do not offer opportunities requiring the physical courage that he displayed in that situation. I salute Trooper Donaldson and I salute the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are contributing in whatever way MAIN COMMITTEE they can in tribute to the courage and the sacrifice of all members of the Australian Defence Force in our operational commitments. Trooper Mark Donaldson VC. A lot has been said so far today and I do not intend to go back over the same ground, but I would like to begin by talking a little bit about the terrain and the circumstances-a bit like the previous speaker, the parliamentary secretary, did-to put his effort into some sort of context. I have never been to Afghanistan, but I have travelled through Pakistan, up through the Khyber Pass, and have been able to observe the valleys of Afghanistan below. I believe that the ground is very similar. The ground is just made for ambushes. The terrain is very difficult for vehicles, and in many ways it gives great possibilities to those who look to set ambushes and attack the coalition forces that fight so hard for democracy, the preservation of democracy and the freedom of people in Afghanistan. So the risk of ambush is a real, present and in fact realised danger, as we have seen and as we are seeing through the citation regarding the awarding of this Victoria Cross. I would also like to make some comments on the weapons that Trooper Donaldson used during the engagement. The M4 is a rifle four to five kilograms in weight. We should also remember that the equipment that Trooper Donaldson would have been wearing would have had some weight in it as well, because he would have carried ammunition and other supplies on him. The 66-millimetre anti-armour weapon is a one-shot article of weaponry, but again we are talking about seven or eight kilograms there. It has a very short range-up to 150 metres. He would have had to carry this with him as well while he was doing this movement and engaging the enemy in the combat zone. Then there was the actual 84-millimetre anti-armour weapon, which we know as the Karl Gustav. Again, this is a significantly heavy weapon. My recollection is that it is somewhere between 15 and 20 kilograms-no, in fact it would be more than that. It would be about 25 kilograms, and the round that is fired would have to be six or seven kilograms. You can fire the weapon either on the shoulder, which is obviously a very exposed position, or there is a small stand so you can fire it from a lying position. When you fire it, it seems to suck the oxygen out of the air around you. It is like being hit in the chest by a medicine ball thrown hard. If you made the mistake of having the venturi-the blast distribution device which restricts the recoil on the weapon-at the back it would be just above your bottom and would blast down your legs and your legs would be badly burnt; you would be on fire. So these sorts of weapons are not light and they are not easily deployed. Also, the ability to engage the enemy when they are shooting back at you-the two-way firing range-requires great presence of mind. As was referred to by all the previous speakers, all Defence Force personnel in the Australian services are well trained, but those in the special forces are the best in the world, in my opinion, and they are very, very well trained. It is no surprise that we send those guys if we want a job done like the job we need done in Afghanistan. There have been plenty of mentions of Trooper Donaldson being a hero, and there is no doubt that he is a hero, in the truest sense of the word. When someone puts their life on the line for others, for the defenceless-for the wounded, in this case-there is no doubt that they are a hero. While he might be uncomfortable with the term, the view of the Australian people is rightly that this is the sort of man that is a great hero. MAIN COMMITTEE",332,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
318,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (4.51 Pm),"I rise today to make my own tribute to the efforts ofIt is a real shame, though, that we have people involved in sport or in other capacities who are also called heroes. When you make a decision, when you are just trying to push through a pain barrier in sport, when you take a mark on the football field or a catch in cricket and win a game, that is great-but there is simply no comparison between an event on a sporting field and someone putting their life on the line for others. I think that those who call sportspeople ‘heroes’ greatly devalue the word. However, in the case of Trooper Donaldson we have a modern, contemporary example of someone who is a hero and who epitomises what is great about Australians-the mateship, the commitment to a cause. This is someone that the nation is justifiably proud of, and I am sure his unit, the SAS Regiment, and his family are proud of him as well. Despite the tragedy that occurred in his youth, the loss of his mother-he was orphaned by the time he was 19Trooper Donaldson has risen well above the circumstances that fate dealt him early in his life. Just in closing, I would say that the operations in Afghanistan are about the defence of freedom and democracy. That is what is at stake. Sometimes you just have to fight. Sometimes there is no other course of action but to pick up weapons and fight. Tragically, sometimes people have to be killed. In protecting the wounded Afghan interpreter, Trooper Mark Donaldson VC saw his duty; it was clear, and he acted with ‘conspicuous gallantry’ to save that man. Throughout the entire action, over some four hours, he kept presence of mind, used his training and used his personal courage to do what needed to be done. People would say that he had done his best even if he had not done these things. If he had tried and not succeeded because the circumstances had possibly been too much for an ordinary person then people, knowing the circumstances, would probably have cut him a break. But Trooper Mark Donaldson’s professionalism, presence of mind, courage and character saw him through, as they saw a lot of people through that day. It is my honour to at least say some words to try to add my appreciation to the salute that this nation has given Trooper Donaldson, the award that this nation has given him and the respect that this nation will always have for him and all those who serve in the uniform of this great country, including those who unfortunately die in the service of this great country. We are proud of them all. I think Trooper Donaldson deserves all the accolades he has received but above all the greatest respect from a grateful nation. indeed a great privilege and an honour to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and to join with others, including the previous speaker, the member for Cowan, in congratulating Trooper Mark Donaldson on receiving the prestigious Victoria Cross for Australia. As others will have said, Trooper Donaldson, aged 29, is the first Australian in almost 40 years to be awarded the Victoria Cross, the Commonwealth’s highest military honour. We know that Trooper Donaldson was born in 1979. He left his home in New South Wales to join the Australian Army in 2002. We have read of the tragedy of his early life and the fact that he was orphaned. But it should not surprise us-this is a really good and great Australian story-that someone who had much hurt and pain early in his life has now made an enormous and historic contribution to the Australian record. At the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka, Trooper Donaldson was awarded prizes for best shot and best at physical training in his platoon. Given what we now know, it should not surprise us to learn that he was later presented with the award for the most outstanding MAIN COMMITTEE",336,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
319,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (5.00 pm)-It issoldier in his platoon at the School of Infantry in Singleton. In 2004 Trooper Donaldson completed the Special Air Services Regiment selection course-no easy feat-and was subsequently deployed on operations in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. On 16 January this year, at an investiture ceremony to mark the occasion at Government House here in Canberra, Her Excellency the Governor General of Australia presented Trooper Mark Donaldson with the Victoria Cross for Australia. I had the privilege of attending that ceremony, where Trooper Donaldson was accompanied by his wife, Emma, and daughter, Kaylee. It transpired that I had previously met Trooper Donaldson at the SAS headquarters at the Campbell Barracks, Swanbourne, in Perth, on the range during a visit last year. As we have learnt, Trooper Donaldson’s receipt of this most significant of awards comes as a result of conspicuous acts of gallantry in action which he displayed during an incident on 2 September 2008. As others have said-and it is now clearly on the public record-Trooper Donaldson displayed exceptional courage under incredibly dangerous circumstances. The incident occurred when an Australian, US and Afghan vehicle convoy was ambushed by a numerically superior enemy. Again we know from the public record that Trooper Donaldson saved the life of a severely wounded coalition interpreter. While doing so, he exposed himself to intense and accurate machine-gun fire, placing himself in danger to assist another. As Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, I am constantly aware of the outstanding achievements of our service men and women. Indeed, less than a month ago I was in Afghanistan with the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. During the visit I saw first hand the professionalism and dedication of the serving Australian Defence Force personnel. But clearly, as the record again tells us, we do not often have the opportunity to pay tribute to exceptional courage and self-sacrifice of the type displayed by Trooper Donaldson in September last year. Because of the rarity of the award that he has been given, Trooper Donaldson now joins 96 fellow Australians who have also received this prestigious award. In the Boer War, six Victoria Crosses were awarded. A total of 64 were awarded in World War I. Two were awarded in northern Russia. Twenty Victoria Crosses were awarded in World War II, and in Vietnam four Victoria crosses were awarded. Trooper Donaldson, not long after he was given the distinction of this great award, put the award on display at the Australian War Memorial, where it joins 62 others, so that it can be shared with the Australian community. This, of course, is the largest publicly held collection of such medals in the world. Trooper Donaldson’s resolve to return to combat operations in Afghanistan is further testament to his commitment and dedication to his service and his country. As the Prime Minister stated yesterday: Through his deeds, Trooper Donaldson has brought a great honour upon himself, his family, the Australian Defence Force and our nation. We should know that the intense battle that led to Trooper Donaldson being awarded the Victoria Cross also saw other exhibitions of great heroism and courage. I want to now take the opportunity to publicly acknowledge another Australian soldier, one of Trooper Donaldson’s comrades, for his actions in this battle. As part of the Australia Day honours, a second special operations command soldier has been recognised for his exceptional service during the same conflict for which Trooper Donaldson was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. Lance Corporal S, who has protected identity status and so cannot be named, has been awarded the MAIN COMMITTEE Medal for Gallantry, the second highest award we can make in the military. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate Lance CorporalS for his outstanding courage and his extraordinary efforts. During this incident, Lance CorporalS ‘selflessly exposed himself to enemy fire to protect a severely wounded Australian soldier’, ultimately saving the life of his comrade. This is yet another example of the self-sacrifice, courage and exemplary professionalism which is displayed often by Australian serving personnel but most particularly on this day of struggle, when Australian soldiers were wounded, by Trooper Donaldson and Lance Corporal S-and on a daily basis by their fellow service men and women who remain deployed on operations. You meet some tremendous people in your life, Deputy Speaker Schultz, as I am sure that you have in the course of your work. But I am constantly amazed by the extremely high standards that are set by the Australian military. That is not to say that there are not some rogues and that they do not enjoy a drink on occasions. But the underlying features of their work are their commitment to and love for one another. They show great teamwork and have great respect for their comrades. I was delighted that the comrades of Trooper Donaldson and Lance CorporalS were at the investiture ceremony at Government House. I know that they enjoyed the celebration of the occasion. I am also aware that Trooper Donaldson VC talked at the time and subsequently about the commitment that he has to his mates and the commitment that they share for one another. He remarked that he did nothing outstanding but that they all would have done it. The fact is, though, that he did something really outstanding and is deserving of this great award. At the investiture it struck me just how important this award is, and what great status it has-not only in the general community but within the Australian Defence Force-when, after Trooper Donaldson had been awarded his Victoria Cross by the Governor General, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston walked up to Trooper Donaldson and saluted him. It is a tradition that senior people salute Victoria Cross recipients, regardless of their rank, in recognition of the courage and professionalism that they have exhibited during the course of their service and which has been recognised through the awarding of this great medal. It has been a great privilege for me to be able to participate in this debate-although it is not so much a debate as an opportunity to express our feelings about this award and about Trooper Donaldson and the lance corporal whose name we cannot know. We congratulate them on behalf of a grateful nation. for Defence Science and Personnel. This is a debate in which we can all agree wholeheartedly on paying tribute to Trooper Mark Donaldson and Lance Corporal S, as the minister referred to him. During my maiden speech, I acknowledged and paid tribute to the commitment of those who are in the Australian defence forces and those who have been in the Australian defence forces in the past, particularly those who have given their lives in defence of our great country, our great free land. A time like this is, of course, an opportunity to again acknowledge the commitment these people make to our country, to our democracy and to our freedombecause, without a strong defence force and strong policy to defend our freedom, there are threats in the world that wish to take it away. These people fight day in, day out in faraway places, and they have done so for many, many years. I think this is a great opportunity for MAIN COMMITTEE",337,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
320,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (5.14 Pm),"I join with and acknowledge the remarks of the Ministerboth sides of this House, and it is pleasing to see such agreement in these sorts of matters on paying tribute to our Australian defence forces. In particular, in this case, the acts of Trooper Mark Donaldson simply go beyond words. The member for Cowan commented on how the word ‘hero’ is thrown around too much at our sporting champions and the like, and he is probably right. The media and others seek words to explain feats in all sorts of ways, but there is nothing that can actually explain the sort of behaviour and acts that Trooper Donaldson engaged in on that day in Afghanistan in September last year. While reading the citation, it is hard to imagine that a Hollywood producer could come up with such a scene: ambushed, running across a stretch of 80 metres of exposed land, firing three types of weapons and carrying across an Afghani interpreter-not an Australian mate of Trooper Donaldson but someone who he probably knew only a little bit but was willing to sacrifice his life to rescue-exposing himself to live fire. It is quite an extraordinary thing to think you could do. It is something that I imagine Hollywood scriptwriters would struggle to come up with, but this act occurred, and it occurred under our flag. It is something that we should all be very proud of. I know all members of this House are very proud of what he has done. There are 96 others who have been awarded VCs-which first began in 1856, as I understand it-through our history. The VC, to me, brings back images of Gallipoli. I could be wrong on this, but I think several VCs were awarded for the acts that were undertaken in that battle at the Nek in Gallipoli where they jumped out of trenches and ran at machine guns. It is just impossible to imagine-and, thankfully, it is something that does not occur today. While that does not occur, the same courage, displayed by Trooper Donaldson, does, which is a great thing. Many in this place have reflected on what the citation has said and what Trooper Donaldson did, and now of course we acknowledge Lance CorporalS as well. I will not go into that too much, except for acknowledging exactly how great the acts were. But I think it is worth reminding ourselves why we are in Afghanistan and why our troops are displaying this sort of courage. The Afghanistan commitment from Australia occurred after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 on the United States. We invoked the ANZUS treaty, went in with the United States of America and several other countries and took on terrorism in its home, in effect. It is a battle which continues and which will continue for some time yet. It is a sacrifice that eight of our troops have already made and potentially more will make. We in this place-particularly those in leadership in this place-are the ones who have the obligation of making those decisions and commitments, and we should never take those decisions lightly. I know those decisions in the past have not been taken lightly. But what we do there is important. We are fighting for our freedom. We are fighting for democracy. We are fighting for the values we hold true. AndI think in that respect it is very important that the government consider in great detail the request that the new President of the United States is making about additional commitments to Afghanistan. It is a battle that we should win and that we must win. On that note, I will conclude by saying that we salute Trooper Donaldson, as the head of the Australian Defence Force did. a brief statement in respect of Trooper Mark Donaldson VC. I do not personally know Trooper Mark Donaldson, nor have I met him, but I have taken the time to listen to other MAIN COMMITTEE",339,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
321,Mr Zappia (Makin) (5.20 Pm),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I too seek your indulgence to makespeakers and to read about him, both out of respect for him as a person and as a soldier, and out of respect for the men and women who wear the Australian Defence Force uniform and who Mark represents. My personal interest arises because, over the years, I have developed a close relationship and friendship with many serving and retired Defence Force members and with most veterans’ organisations in my community. Only last Friday, I attended the 10th anniversary dinner at the Lutheran village RSL. And on the 19th of this month I hope to attend a service to commemorate the bombing of Darwin, at the Salisbury RSL. Through those relationships, I have learnt a great deal about the defence people who have served and who presently serve our country, and my respect for and admiration and appreciation of them all has grown immensely. So when Trooper Mark Donaldson was awarded a Victoria Cross-an award issued, I believe, only 96 other times previously in Australia’s 153 year history of that award-it became evident that Trooper Donaldson had demonstrated extraordinary bravery and extraordinary personal qualities. My interest was also aroused because Keith Payne, who was the last recipient of the Victoria Cross, for his actions 40 years ago in Vietnam, is a person whom I have met and spoken with on several occasions. I want to briefly reflect on Keith Payne and what led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross. It is reported that, in May 1969, Keith Payne was commanding the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion in Vietnam when it was attacked by a strong North Vietnamese force. His company was isolated, and surrounded on three sides. Payne’s Vietnamese troops began to fall back. Payne, by now wounded in the hands and arms, and under heavy fire, covered the withdrawal before organising his troops into a defensive perimeter. He then spent three hours scouring the scene of the day’s fight for isolated and wounded soldiers-all the while evading the enemy, who had kept up regular fire. He found some 40 wounded men, brought some in himself, and organised the rescue of others, leading the party back to base through enemy-dominated terrain. Payne’s actions that night earned him the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 19 September 1969. Of particular note is that Keith Payne has never stopped caring for his defence colleagues. I have met with Keith Payne because he has travelled, on occasions, from Queensland to South Australia to support his Vietnam veteran colleagues in South Australia, with whom I have a close association. He never stopped caring about his mates. As with Keith Payne, I suspect that Trooper Mark Donaldson’s actions in Afghanistan reflect more than just a spontaneous act of courage but, rather, an underlying special quality about Trooper Donaldson’s character. The actions which led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross are quite remarkable. The Prime Minister and other speakers have detailed the heroic actions of Trooper Donaldson in Afghanistan, and I do not intend to repeat what has already been said. I do, however, want to quote what Trooper Donaldson said when asked about the incident that he was recognised for. He said: I’m a soldier … I’m trained to fight … It’s instinct and it’s natural … I just saw him there, I went over there and got him, that was it. In other words, he did what came naturally to him-at least, that is my interpretation of what he did. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Defence earlier on use the word ‘modesty’ in his description of some of our defence people; it seems to me that it certainly applies in the case MAIN COMMITTEE of Trooper Mark Donaldson. As with Keith Payne, what I have just quoted truly says a lot about Trooper Donaldson’s character: it is the character of a person who genuinely cares for others. It also says a lot about the ethos of the men and women who serve in Australia’s defence forces. It is not a role all people are up to, and those who do serve deserve all the recognition they receive. It must be a terrible thing to be caught up in military conflict. I could not help but listen to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support only a few moments ago when he was talking about what it is like to be caught up in the midst of conflict. I took his words seriously because I know that he knows what he is talking about as someone who has been in that situation. It certainly made me think very carefully about what it must truly be like. He too referred to the analogy that is often used comparing sporting greats and military people; I cannot help but agree with the parliamentary secretary’s interpretation of who the true heroes are. As the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia, Trooper Mark Donaldson has rightly earned himself a place in Australian history. Of greater significance is that he has undoubtedly earned himself a place in the heart of the wounded coalition force interpreter he rescued; in the hearts of his fellow Afghan, US and Australian soldiers, whom he protected and cared for; in the hearts of his fellow soldiers, whom he continues to serve with; and in the hearts of the people of Australia, who value our defence men and women. Trooper Mark Donaldson clearly embodies the very best qualities which distinguish the defence men and women of Australia and the very best in human nature. I take this opportunity to add my personal admiration and pay tribute to Trooper Mark Donaldson for his much deserved recognition in being awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. discussion in relation to the award of the Victoria Cross for Australia to Trooper Mark Donaldson, because Australia, despite being a young country, is one of the world’s oldest continuous democracies and almost from our beginnings as an independent nation we have been defined by the actions of our service men and women. From Gallipoli and the jungles of Kokoda and Vietnam to modern-day Iraq and Afghanistan, our service personnel have done us proud. They have defined this country in the eyes of the world. But why have the military defined this country in the eyes of the world? I think the words of Winston Churchill give an insight into why. He said: Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because … “it is the quality that guarantees all others.” I think that is a very important point that Churchill made, that courage is the quality that guarantees all others. Only recently, in the awarding of the Victoria Cross for Australia to Trooper Mark Donaldson, we have seen courage on display, courage writ large. I would like to recount to the House the citation he received, which says: On2 September 2008, during the conduct of a fighting patrol, Trooper Donaldson was travelling in a combined Afghan, US and Australian vehicle convoy that was engaged by a numerically superior, entrenched and coordinated enemy ambush. The ambush was initiated by a high volume of sustained machine gun fire coupled with the effective use of rocket propelled grenades. Such was the effect of the initiation that the combined patrol suffered numerous casualties … lost the initiative and became immeMAIN COMMITTEE",340,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
322,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (5.27 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to thisdiately suppressed. It was over two hours before the convoy was able to establish a clean break and move to an area free of enemy fire. In the early stages of the ambush, Trooper Donaldson reacted spontaneously to regain the initiative. He moved rapidly between alternate positions of cover engaging the enemy with 66mm and 84mm antiarmour weapons as well as his M4 rifle. During an early stage of the enemy ambush, he deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire in order to draw attention … away from wounded soldiers. This selfless act alone bought enough time for those wounded to be moved to relative safety. As the enemy had employed the tactic of a rolling ambush, the patrol was forced to conduct numerous vehicle manoeuvres, under intense enemy fire, over a distance of approximately four kilometres to extract the convoy from the engagement area. Compounding the extraction was the fact that casualties had consumed all available space within the vehicles. Those who had not been wounded, including Trooper Donaldson, were left with no option but to run beside the vehicles throughout. During [the extraction], a severely wounded coalition force interpreter was inadvertently left behind. Of his own volition and displaying complete disregard for his own safety, Trooper Donaldson moved alone, on foot, across … 80 metres of exposed ground to recover the wounded interpreter. His movement, once identified … drew intense … machine gun fire from entrenched positions. Upon reaching the wounded … interpreter, Trooper Donaldson picked him up and carried him back to the relative safety of the vehicles then provided immediate first aid before returning to the fight. On subsequent occasions during the battle, Trooper Donaldson administered medical care to other wounded soldiers, whilst continually engaging the enemy. Trooper Donaldson’s acts of exceptional gallantry in the face of accurate and sustained enemy fire ultimately saved the life of a coalition force interpreter and ensured the safety of the other members of the combined Afghan, US and Australian force. Trooper Donaldson’s actions on this day displayed exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril. His actions are of the highest accord and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Special Operations Command, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force. I make this contribution today not only because of the merit of these very courageous actions by Trooper Donaldson but also to recognise in this House that Trooper Donaldson grew up in Dorrigo, within my electorate. He is certainly a very well-known member of the Dorrigo community. Regrettably, the dangers of military service were brought home to our region quite recently by the tragic death of Sergeant Matthew Locke, a young man who came from Bellingen-also within my electorate. I think it is totally appropriate that, within this House today, we recognise the great deeds of Trooper Donaldson. We should also recognise the efforts of all Australian Defence Force men and women who serve wherever they are asked and do the duties which they are asked. They do Australia proud. They are always there. They always do their share of the heavy lifting. They are a tribute to this country. me; however, his story is certainly one that has captured many of us, including me. In particular, I acknowledge the connection with the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, with his growing up in the town of Dorrigo in the electorate of Cowper. His award of the Victoria Cross has been followed very closely by many residents on the mid-North Coast. I just want to put on the record how incredibly respectful of him and his actions we all are, and I do that on a number of fronts. Firstly, I address his achievement as an individual trooper. We have heard, from the Prime Minister down, the commendation he received with the Victoria Cross, so I will not repeat that for the record. But it is hard to read the account and not put yourself in MAIN COMMITTEE",342,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc
323,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (5.32 Pm),"Trooper Donaldson was not personally known to that situation and ask yourself the ethical question: ‘Would you do the same?’ It is very hard to say yes, which makes it an extraordinary act which has been performed. Trooper Donaldson’s commendation is certainly well deserved. Secondly, it is hard not to mention his team and his fellow troopers. This is an opportunity for the parliament to send a very strong message of thanks to his colleagues. I know that Trooper Donaldson would certainly want his colleagues recognised also-those who served alongside him and continue to do so. We are incredibly thankful for the ongoing work that you do. Thirdly, as a young man from the mid-North Coast, he is, without doubt, an example to others-so much so that, when I was doing the rounds of the electorate, as we all do on Australia Day, he was one of my two examples in the Australia Day speeches to the young people in the audience. The other was Nancy Bird Walton, who died in the week before Australia Day and who was also from the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. They are two examples of people who grew up in small towns in a regional area and yet went on to do extraordinary things for their country. Dorrigo has an old dairy farming connection. The dairy farming term is, ‘He is a lead cow’-he is an example for others. Trooper Donaldson’s story is a leadership one, and hopefully it is an example to others from the region. In their teenage years everyone goes through a time when they wonder what it is all about-whether there are opportunities and whether there will be a future. The example that the Trooper Donaldsons of the world provide to the young people of the mid-North Coast is that, yes, there is a future. If you work hard and pursue whatever interests you have you will be successful. I thank him for being such a fine example and such a fine lead cow. Fourthly and finally, I want to acknowledge, as a young father myself, that it was very noticeable in the media reports of the award presentation and, a week later, of the subsequent return of the medal to the national estate, that Trooper Donaldson has a young child and a very obviously loving wife. Whilst the Victoria Cross and commendation stand alone, regardless of personal circumstances, it was certainly very hard for me not to recognise and acknowledge his wife and child in the media images and then to reflect on his decision making process in the line of fire, and the increased decision making with regard to family that goes with that. It would be very hard for those issues of family and the love of family not to come up in what were extraordinary circumstances in the line of fire. BecauseI have three young children at home it particularly struck home to me that here was a man doing incredible things while he had a family at home whom he must have been thinking about and whom he certainly would love dearly. In short, I have a direct message to Trooper Donaldson, if he takes the time to read Hansard. It is very much a thank you on behalf of the parliament of Australia. He has certainly done himself proud. He has done his fellow troops proud. He has done his region-the midNorth Coast of New South Wales, where he grew up-proud. He has done his nation proud. The final point, which I think is important to most of us here, is that he has certainly done his family proud. So, Trooper Donaldson, in short: thank you. MAIN COMMITTEE Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 February, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time. tee that in the House it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. ety-that exists today. I call it the deficit or debt club. It remains unique. It knows no bounds or restraints. It is confined to no faction. It imposes no intellectual requirement and no geographic location. In the words of the mantra: union membership is required and blind adherence to collectivism is needed. No other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of lazy spending, shall entitle a Labor leader to membership of this fellowship as all post-war Labor leaders have received it. I rise today to make comment on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009, yet it is difficult to make comment on appropriation by a Labor government of some $3 billion without contextualising it with what the Labor government is doing with respect to its attempt to spend $42 billion-money it does not have. If the Prime Minister simply put his hand in his pocket and threw in a dollar coin, at least it could be said that he had raised some of it. So today we draw a line in the sand, a line that divides the experienced, prudent economic management of the coalition with its track record from a panicked and deficit-ready government. We draw a line in the sand that divides the coalition, which paid off the last of Labor’s government debt of $96 billion, from this government-which this morning put forward a bill for an act of parliament of one page that seeks to increase the bond issuance and therefore takes the national debt to $200 billion. We draw a line in the sand that divides the coalition, as best able to manage money, from Labor in a long line of deficits from Whitlam, Hawke, Keating and now the Prime Minister. Today the Prime Minister has demanded that the parliament approve his plans for $42 billion within 42 hours-a billion dollars an hour-and has refused to discuss let alone negotiate the package with the coalition, so today we draw a line in the sand. Almost all economists agree that the recession has a long way to go. It will not be a V recession. The Lord knows we hope it will not be an L recession. But it will be a U recession, and this Labor government is panicking. It has fired all its bullets at the first engagement. Rather than a few, well aimed shots and then working in concert with others around it, it has blattered off the full magazine. Let us look at the history of Labor governments as we look at Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), because leopards do not change their spots. They apparently just hide behind economic conservatives. The Prime Minister before the election may well have stood with glass and the skyline of Brisbane at his back and said in his nonchalant way, ‘Some people have described me as an economic conservative.’ I spend time in my Gold Coast seat of Fadden and, when I go to Brisbane asking whether there is anyone out there who MAIN COMMITTEE",343,Trooper Mark Donaldson Vc

325,Mr Robert (Fadden) (5.38 Pm),"There is an ugly fellowship-a not-so-secret sociwould describe this member of the deficitand debt-laden fellowship as an economic conservative, you can hear the whisper of silence. Mr Whitlam had a massive increase in spending and a massive increase in tax revenue to cover it and the Australian people, after being on a high through the ‘It’s Time’ campaign, threw him out on his ear where he belonged. The Hawke-Keating government came in ’83. In the first year of the Hawke government, debt increased by $7 billion up to $16 billion. By the time the nation threw out the subsequent Keating government, $96 billion in debt had been accumulated. Over $60 billion in public servant super liabilities had been left to go and grow. In 1996 there was $8 billion in interest payments per annum. By the time that debt was paid off and $60 billion was put away in the Future Fund, the combined amount of money that had to be raised to cover the debt and the future fund liabilities and to pay the interest was something like $200 billion-and it took the coalition 10 years to pay it off. Now this Rudd Labor government is seeking to raise $200 billion of debt again, because that is what Labor governments do. That is what the fellowship of the deficit debt club does. You cannot enter the fellowship without thrusting the nation into debt, because that is all you know. This debt is not productive debt. It does not look for tax cuts or for R&D expenditure in cuts. It does not look for cuts in capital gains tax to get cash flow back into businesses. It does not look to cover superannuation liabilities to restore cash flow. This is as Obama-esque as it comes in funding all of Labor’s pet projects under the guise of the global financial crisis. Is it any wonder that not a single House Republican voted for Obama’s package? Not one did, because in Obama’s $800 million package they would be lucky to have $100 billion worth of actual productive expenditure. The rest of it is all typical left-wing pet projects. Now Prime Minister Rudd joins the fellowship of the deficit and debt club. In 2008-09 he had a budget surplus of $22 billion-granted, a lot of that was from cheeky accounting tricks and other things put into it. It will now be a $22 billion deficit-a fairly impressive performance and turnaround for a first year in office. In his first year in office, how has he contributed to this great, unique fellowship of deficit and debt? A $44 billion turnaround in his budget position would have to be history-making. His $10.4 billion cash splash proved to be ineffective as an economic stimulus. That is not to say the people who received it did not appreciate it-I am sure they did. But looking at the spending increase in retail sales of a mere 3.7 per cent seasonally adjusted, with a maximum of a $500 million increase even though increases were building in November, let us say that the increase did not continue but stopped and that $500 million extra is due to the stimulus, which means only five per cent of the stimulus was spent. No wonder that has been no stimulus at all. That follows the US example where $125 billion was put into the economy and the figures showed a sharp increase in income but no reciprocal increase in expenditure. Now we have $42 billion, all debt. Every single cent will be borrowed. We are expecting a budget where the forward estimates may well have debt going out to $115 billion. And we have that offensive one-page bill which seeks to raise $200 billion in debt to the issuance of government bonds. How any Labor parliamentarian can sleep at night is absolutely and utterly beyond me. When questioned how the debt will be paid off, we had the Treasurer stand and say, ‘As soon as the economy starts to grow above the trend, we will start to pay the debt back.’ What does ‘grow above the trend’ possibly mean? He then wanted to say, ‘As soon as growth autoMAIN COMMITTEE matically kicks in, we’ll start to pay the debt back.’ Does he stand there, praying to the great financial gods and saying, ‘Please grow above the trend, please automatically kick back in.’ It is no plan to pay off one-fifth of a trillion dollars to say, ‘As soon as growth increases above the trend or growth increases automatically we will pay back the fifth of a trillion dollars we sunk this nation into.’ If you add in state Labor debt, which is approaching $100 billion, we now have a combined debt position put in by the Labor governments of this country approaching one-third of a trillion dollars. How in the name of all that is decent, how in the name of our children’s futures, is one-third of a trillion dollars going to be paid off? I guess Labor do not care because after the failed Whitlam experience the coalition took care of it; after the appalling, abominable Keating years, the coalition took care of it. I guess in their haphazard thinking deep down, in places that they do not talk about at parties, after the failure of the Rudd government and the one-fifth of a trillion dollars largesse being left to the children, they are hoping and probably praying that the coalition will come in and pay it all back again. The largesse does not stop here. There is a political strategy but clearly no economic one. The Prime Minister has declared 12 wars: wars on drugs, cancer, inflation, unemployment, global unemployment, whale hunting, Aboriginal disadvantage, downloads, pokies, alcopops, doping in sport and bankers’ salaries. Wars cost money. If you are going to declare war on a problem, I expect the community would expect to see solutions and solutions will cost money-$42 billion in debt being thrown away, on top of existing debt provisions, $200 billion more in total, and here we have 12 unfunded wars. We also have 160 unfunded reviews, summits, commissions, inquiries and conferences, all reporting back within the next 12 to 18 months, all with a range of recommendations which, I suggest, will cost money. Perhaps that is where some of the fifth of a trillion dollars is going. Have you had a look through Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009? It may simply be a mere $3 billion, but it will be $3 billion borrowed from the future of our children. There is $13.95 million for climate change and the government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I gather that is for advertising, to put some more scare campaigns out there about what is happening rather than speak scientifically and legitimately about the science-an appropriate response. There is $101 million extra for solar panel rebates, rebates the government said were not needed until the coalition pressure overturned them and Minister Garret saw sense. There is $10 million extra for the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to meet higher costs of the broadband project assessment process. This was the $4.7 billion broadband project, an election promise. Prime Minister Rudd said today that all promises will be met, but this promise was that within six months we would have the tender process well and truly finalised and ready to go. Here we are, 13 months later, and it is nowhere near finalised and we have an appropriation for $10 million more to meet the assessment process costs. We have a real increase for Defence of $278 billion due to ‘other expenditure reduced’-something like $580 million reduced. Labor is selling the future of our children by loading them down with debt. Whilst these appropriation bills and some of their major areas are not contentious and will be passed by the coalition, there is no way known on this green earth that we will stand by on this $42 billion unproductive giveaway and allow its passage through the House or the Senate. MAIN COMMITTEE The ugly fellowship of the deficit debt club knows no bounds, it knows no restraints, and after question time today it knows no hide or cheek. It belongs to no faction, there is clearly no intellectual requirement and there is no geographical location. Union membership is binding. Adherence to collectivism is needed. No other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of lazy spending, entitles a Labor leader to membership of the fellowship. Prime Minister Rudd has now shown conclusively that he will join Whitlam, Hawke and Keating as members of the fellowship who have loaded the future children of this nation with unproductive debt. Ms HALL (Shortland) (5.52 pm)-I have to say that that was one of the most interesting and strange contributions to any debate I have ever heard. The previous speaker, the member for Fadden, mentioned intellectual capability. It really has me worrying about the future of the opposition, of the Liberal Party, if what he portrayed to this House tonight was some form of intellectual capability. I think the other side of politics in this parliament is in real trouble. I note that he was highly critical of President Obama, attributing the budgetary problems in the US to his leadership, which only demonstrated to me that not only does he have a very limited understanding of economic matters but he really is not up to date with what has been happening in the US. The enormous budget deficit that exists there can fall squarely on the shoulders of President Bush, whom I think the previous speaker may consider to have been an outstanding president and somebody whose policies, plans and legislative program he would have followed-but enough about the previous speaker. Let us talk about the legislation that is before us tonight, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009, which are for about $3.1 billion. There are a number of important items in this legislation. It looks at climate change. It makes provisions for health. It makes provisions for the Human Services portfolio and AusAID. I must say I am extremely proud of the contributions that this government has made in the area of overseas aid assistance to developing countries. It is something that has been long overdue and something that I know all of us on this side of the House are very proud of-and I know that there are members on the other side of this House who are also very pleased with the action that this government has taken in relation to overseas aid. I would also like to spend a little bit of time on the stimulus package that was presented to parliament last year, the Economic Security Strategy package. It gave the $1,000 bonus to families receiving family tax benefit part A; the $1,400 one-off payment to single pensioners; the $2,100 one-off payment to pensioner couples; the $1,000 payment to those who receive carer allowance; the first home owner grants of $21,000 to buyers of newly constructed homes and $14,000 to people purchasing established homes; and of course the 56,000 new training places. There has been much comment in the House by the opposition on the effectiveness or noneffectiveness of these measures. I have to report to the House that not only do the figures that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer presented support the fact that they have been very successful measures but so does the news I bring to this parliament from the electorate that I represent. There has been no end to the number of pensioners contacting my office saying how welcome that bonus they received before Christmas was, how they have put it to really good use, how they were able to do things that they were unable to do before-pay for things, buy things-and just what it meant to them at Christmas. I have even had letters that constituMAIN COMMITTEE ents have asked me to hand-deliver to the Prime Minister because they were so grateful for the help that they received. They utilised that help and they wanted the Prime Minister to know what they used that money for. I have a friend who has a business that is called Walk on Wheels, which supplies motorised scooters to elderly people, and services those scooters. My friend reported to me that they had an enormous increase in sales of their scooters prior to Christmas, and she attributed it very much to the bonus that pensioners received. The other interesting aspect of this is that, in January, as part of her business protocol, she rings around and talks to those pensioners who have purchased scooters, and she reported to me that this year every pensioner she rang to ascertain whether or not they needed their scooter serviced actually undertook to have that servicing done. She said that was very different to what usually happens. It is obviously good for her business, but it is also good for the safety of those pensioners who rely on motor scooters to get around. So for pensioners the bonus was very welcome. Families have also found it very useful. Some of the families in my electorate have been able to purchase things for their children or organise their sporting equipment-things that they would not otherwise have been able to do. I had one mother come to see me. Her children all played representative sport. She reported to me that that bonus had enabled her to buy the equipment that her children needed. So those people who are being very negative about the last bonus should talk to people in their electorates, because I know that that money was put to very good use. Then we need to look at first home buyers. I have been going out and looking at homes with a first home buyer. I know it is very difficult to actually find established homes around the price that first home owners who are entering the market can afford, because there has been such a take-up of the first home owners grant. There have been a number of people who would not otherwise have been looking for houses who have decided that, given the fact that this grant is there, they are going to buy their first home. That is very good for those people, and it is also very good for our economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, you can see that the first package was well and truly utilised for the benefit of people within the electorate of Shortland. They truly appreciated what the government did. The other aspect of Appropriation Bill (No. 4) that I would like to concentrate on is in relation to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. There was $300 million allocated to councils. In the Shortland electorate there are two councils: Wyong Shire Council and Lake Macquarie City Council. Wyong Shire Council was allocated $1.529 million and Lake Macquarie City Council was allocated $2.117 million. I must say that both councils have chosen projects that are worthwhile. Both councils have chosen projects that will provide much-needed infrastructure for their local government areas. Dr Jensen interjectingTangney to speak a bit softer, please.

329,Mr Katter,"It was a bit rich. He was louder than the speaker!interrupting my train of thought. I do not present written speeches, so I needed to be able to gather my thoughts rather than listen to what the member for Tangney was saying on the telephone. In both local government areas, the councils have consulted with the community, looked at projects that were ready to go and chosen wisely. They have chosen projects spread throughout their local government areas so as to provide benefits to all their residents. They will provide not only infrastructure but jobs for people within those local government areas. I welcome their embrace of the money given to them. I know that the projects they have chosen will be extremely useful and worthwhile in the community. The money that was provided through the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will see much of the neglect of the previous government addressed. Obviously there will be still more to do. Our next budget will address some of those issues. This week there were some steps taken to address some of the neglect of the past and to look at stimulating the economy yet again. This week we have had the second economic stimulus package. The first area I would like to concentrate on is the money going towards building schools for the future. in nuclear power stations. Rather, we are investing money in a way that will enable children to attend schools that are not run down and neglected and where there are science blocks, and to attend high schools where there are language laboratories. I think this is an excellent way to create jobs. It is not only creating jobs in the construction industry but also building infrastructure that has been long sought after. I have many schools in my electorate that applied for funding under the previous government’s program, and the approach was very subjective. This is long-term investment to improve the quality of facilities. I talked about the high schools and primary schools, about gyms and libraries. This is for multipurpose halls and libraries. We are looking at around 500 new science laboratories being built in schools and at providing $200,000 to schools for maintenance, renewal of buildings and minor works. ple who could be doing that work will be unemployed. I believe that this aspect of the stimulation package is particularly important because it is building the education revolution. It is not just providing computers and all the other things that are so important but concentrating on investing in our schools, our future and our children. Whilst investing in our schools, our future and our children, we are providing jobs within the construction industry-which has been very adversely affected in this downturn. This $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan that we are currently debating downstairs and will be debating well into tomorrow, and which I will be speaking on, I think, at about 10 minutes to 4 o’clock in the morning, will provide insulation for 2.7 million homes-that is, free ceiling insulation. It will also upgrade buildings in every one of Australia’s 9,540 schools. It will build more than 20,000 new social and defence homes. Under the previous government money was ripped out of housing, and social housing, public housing, declined enormously.

334,Ms Hall,"If this maintenance work is not done, the schools will deteriorate and the peohouse is 13 years. Somebody who is in desperate need of housing has to wait 13 years! It is absolutely disgraceful. You put this together with the National Affordable Housing Strategy which invests money in the private sector-and I might add that there has recently been housing approved under that scheme in the Shortland electorate-and you have a real attempt by our government to address the housing shortage in this country. I might add also that in the Shortland electorate the vacancy rate within the rental market is 1.8 per cent and, when three per cent is presumed to be a crisis level, 1.8 per cent is untenable. The package will invest money in housing and, at the same time, invest money in construction and in the future. Unlike the previous government, which missed every opportunity to prepare for the future; unlike the previous government, which thought that the mining boom would never end; unlike the previous government, which allowed the worse skills shortage in Australia’s history to eventuate; unlike the previous government, which just sat on its hands; the Rudd government is acting now for Australia’s future to ensure that we handle the global financial crisis much better than it would have been handled under the previous government and much better than most other countries in the world. (Time expired) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009 and two rather interesting realities. The first is that probably two per cent and maybe as much as four per cent of North Queensland is currently under water. You can fly for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres and not see much land-virtually no land at all. Australia is a dry continent but the north-eastern quarter of Australia is not dry, nor is the north-western quarter. They are not dry places at all. The extraordinary fact about our country and the reality of government and where it has dismally failed our country is that the top third has 300 million megalitres of water and the bottom two-thirds has only 80 million megalitres of water. It is really very dry, and 95 per cent of our agricultural production comes from the dry area. There seems to be something very strange here. Our water comes in a great rush, as it is doing at the present moment, and then it is all gone. We need to build little receptacles to hold some of that water back so that we can use it later in the year or in our dry years. They are called dams. Every other country on earth has maybe seven or eight per cent of their entire rainfall run-off retained and available through dams and irrigation systems. For those that say these things are destructive, the Chinese built most of their canal system 1,000 to 2,000 years ago and 1,300 million people attest to the sustainability of their agricultural approach. The second thing that dominates the current consciousness is, I think, the financial crisis. The most powerful leader on earth now is a man called Barack Obama and when he was asked whether he would give tax concessions-that is really a handout to people-he said no. He said that they were going to expend money that would provide jobs into the future. A lot of what the previous speaker said was very laudable, but her basic premise is that of the current government. Yes, I applaud the current government for what they did before Christmas. Yes, I applaud the current government for spending money in the building and construction industry. But not one single permanent job will be created by the current government program-not one. If you look back to the Great Depression in Australia, you see that it was characterised by the hopeless failure of government in Australia. And if the Prime Minister is looking for advice from Treasury here, well, you can thank them for a country that has no manufacturing base, a dwindling and negligible agricultural base and a mining base MAIN COMMITTEE",350,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
335,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (6.12 Pm),"I rise to speak about Appropriation Bill (No. 3)that has collapsed because of world prices, which we in the mining industry know are cyclical. Any person in the mining industry can tell you: ‘Do not rely upon the situation that exists.’ They would have told you three years ago, they would have told you four years ago and they would have told you two years ago: ‘Do not rely on this. This is a spike in the market.’ I come from the mining industry, and I have been in and out of mining all my life. That was what I was doing before I came into parliament. But I was not someone who worked as a labourer, although I did for quite a long time, in the mining industry. I owned my own mines, I found my own ore reserves and I floated my own company. I know the industry inside out and backwards. My entire livelihood for almost all of my life has depended on knowing that industry, and I was Minister for Mines and Energy in Queensland. AndI can tell you that only Third World countries rely upon mining. That is for African countries, not for advanced countries. If you base your economy around mining, you are so foolish-and I say that as a person who represents the mining industry. I am sorry that the current government policy does not agree with the policy of the American President. He is looking at creating jobs out into the distance. Every single thing that this government has done in this great package of expenditure has provided jobs for two or three years, that is all. At the end of two or three years, it will all be gone. WhereverI go in the northern half of Queensland people say, ‘Do you ever get sick of bashing your head up against a wall?’ AndI suppose that you really have to say that. Currently, the state government of Queensland has done a dirty, filthy, slimy deal-for which the AWU is going to stitch them up very shortly-with the Greens to get their support in the forthcoming election. They are very stupid people. Didn’t they see what Mr Latham did in Tasmania? Yes, you will get five per cent of the vote from the Greens; you most certainly will get their preferences. But the 95 per cent is what I would be going after in an election. It is the mistake Mr Latham made, and the mistake the Queensland government is making now. If you take 25 per cent off each of those sugar mills, they will all close-every single one of them. They could not possibly take a 20 per cent reduction in their gross. They will all close and 50,000 people will be out of work. This government has given the stamp of approval to the last government’s decision to bring bananas in from overseas. I don’t know whether I live in a lunatic asylum! Does anyone look at the figures? Australia is a net importer of food, in fruit and vegetables. We no longer feed ourselves. We went from a $400 million surplus to a $50 million deficit, to a $90 million deficit, to another $90 million deficit, and last year it was a $300 million deficit. That is something we can be proud of as a nation: we can’t feed ourselves! If you bring the bananas in, it will blow out to a $700 million deficit, assuming there is no growth, which of course would be a ridiculous assumption. So there is no doubt that one-seventh of our fruit and vegetables next year will have to come from overseas. We will not employ Australians to grow and produce fruit and vegetables and their downstream products; we will provide jobs to people overseas. Does anybody think about this parasitic economics, where you go and borrow money, you print money or create money, and then you go and spend it on self-indulgence? Sure, it will be nice to have a lot of new schools. Sure, it will be nice to have a lot of community halls. Sure, it will be nice to have plenty of work doing up our houses. But what happens in three years time? MAIN COMMITTEE The argument of the current government against the last government is, ‘You blokes have based it all on the mining industry.’ I do not know. The current government seems to be basing it upon nothing at all. I do not know whether anyone is cognisant of the current account. I am only a lowly Cloncurry boy; I would not know these things. But Mr Keating, who was Treasurer of Australia for 12 years and Prime Minister for another four years, said, ‘When the current account is $15,000 million, we are going to be a banana republic.’ The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, who was himself Treasurer for some four or five years and then became Prime Minister for 12 years-a man who should know-reminded Mr Keating of this and said, ‘You said we would be a banana republic at $15,000 million but it’s now $23,000 million.’ I am only a simple Cloncurry boy, but it is now $75,000 million and rising. That means that this country has to borrow $75,000 million from overseas this year. I am rather intrigued to know who is going to be loaning us $75,000 million. That will be very interesting indeed. Substantially, money has come from the Americans. It came from the Arab countries, from China, from India and from Brazil, those countries that are going forward at a hundred miles an hour-the BRIC economies, as they are called. They have a lot of money to spare. They have been very competitive and they have given money to the Americans to invest, who have loaned it to us. But that most certainly will not be occurring this year. So it will be rather intriguing to find out. We are talking about a $20,000 million package for this year. The whole package is over three years. Madam Deputy Speaker, let me tell you what it should be spent on. Firstly, this government should decide that we will put ethanol in our petrol tanks and not petrol. Petrol destroys the atmosphere and is causing global warming-I do not know about that, but it is certainly causing problems in the ocean which will get worse. Why would you not use ethanol? We have a record flood in the Burdekin River, the third-biggest river in Australia. The Murray-Darling, which produces 60 per cent of our agriculture, has 22 million megalitres. The Burdekin has 12 million megalitres, so it is smaller but not all that much smaller than the Murray-Darling. It is running at a record height. I have not seen it-I left before it really rose-but it is at the highest level in white man’s history. Surely we can build a dam in the Upper Burdekin to hold some of that massive outflow and use it to produce ethanol? A dam was proposed at Hells Gates above Charters Towers to hold a tiny bit of these flood waters back. This year, the Burdekin River will probably run 20 or 30 million megalitres. We just want one million megalitres a year out of it; that is all. If you give that to us then we will give you 1,200 million litres of ethanol every year. At maybe a dollar a litre, we will produce $1,200 million of wealth. That will not stop in two or three years time, as this program will. That will go on forever and ever. We can produce our fuel forever and it is not harmful to the environment. At Georgetown, the Gilbert River is nine million megalitres. Remember that the Murray-Darling, which produces 60 per cent of our agriculture, is 22 million megalitres. This one is nine million megalitres. The Gilbert River is very suitable for farming. You can get 2,400 million litres of ethanol a year out of a moderate scheme on the Gilbert River. The deputy head of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet in Queensland observed to me that there are fools out there who talk about the Bradfield scheme. I said, ‘Sonny’-and I used the word ‘Sonny’-‘what university degrees do you have?’ He said, ‘I’ve got a degree in MAIN COMMITTEE engineering.’ I said, ‘And what have you built?’ He had not built anything. He had not even built a hole in his backyard. He had built nothing in his whole life. He was a very young person and a quite intelligent person too. I said: ‘Dr Bradfield built the Sydney Harbour Bridge. He built the Story Bridge in Brisbane. He built the University of Queensland, the beautiful old sandstone building there. He built the underground railway system in Sydney and he built two of the biggest dams in Australia even to this day. He may know a little bit about what he is talking about. I have to say, with all due respect to you, you do not have any experience at anything that would qualify you to make an authoritative statement like that.’ Dr Bradfield’s scheme is nothing very dramatic. It just takes a little tiny bit of the flood waters from where it rains all the time at a very high level-in Innisfail, Tully and the heartland of the electorate of Kennedy-and puts it back through the ranges. We can only do a little tiny bit at the top, but it is a very big picture if you put it out on to the western plains. The western plains currently have an area the size of Tasmania where all flora and fauna have been destroyed by prickly acacia trees. That is how we are husbanding the resources of Australia. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We should replace the prickly acacia tree with ethanol-producing crops. Ethanol from sugar cane reduces CO2 emissions not by 29 per cent, like corn ethanol does, but by 194 per cent. Not only is that magical in itself but also with sugar cane we will be producing about 1,000 megawatts of electricity, so there will be another $400 million or $500 million in electricity income coming in as well. Once again, this is something that will go on forever. It will create jobs for forever and forever and forever. If that power station, which also has coal, is built, it will supply much-needed power to the greatest mineral province on earth, the north-west mineral province. I am being quite technical. It produces $13,400,000 worth of product every year. There is no area as small as that in the world that has anything like that amount of mineral production. But, big as it is, we have 500 million tonnes of iron ore that has not been touched. We have the Roseby copper, silver, lead and zinc deposits and the Rocklands deposits. The Cannington will double its size, and that is BHP’s most profitable mine in the world-or it was the last time. I looked. That is the biggest mining company on earth and its most profitable mine and it wants to double it in size. None of the other projects-not the oil shale nor the vanadium at Julia Creek, which are world-class resources, nor the iron ore, silver, lead, zinc or copper-are as big. Joe Gutnick is proposing an eight million tonne a year phosphate production operation. If we could convince him to process that in Australia, that would be $8,000 million a year for the Australian economy. But, however you look at this, if you can enable and facilitate these mines to open we will double that $13,000 million production. This is not just a job for the next two or three years. Mount Isa Mines started operation, I think, in 1926-at the latest, 1929. It is now 2009. That mine has been operating for 80-odd years. It has created great wealth for Australia for 80 years. We have people being put off at the giant nickel plant in Townsville. I do not doubt for a moment that we will be putting people off at the giant zinc plant in Townsville. Both these plants employ a thousand people. But they have very expensive electricity. People must understand that aluminium, for example, is just congealed electricity. The vast bulk of the price of aluminium is electricity. If you have cheap electricity you will get aluminium processing. If you have cheap electricity you will get nickel processing and zinc processing. If you do not have that, then these great projects will close down or they will find it very difficult to keep going. MAIN COMMITTEE There is not a single baseload power station in Northern Australia. If you were to draw a line across Australia stretching from Rockhampton across to Geraldton, you would find that there is no baseload power north of that line. Yet all of Australia’s mineral wealth-except for coal, of course-is north of that line. It is crazy that you would put the power stations away from where you need the power stations if you want to be internationally competitive. It costs an awful lot of money to take power great distances. But if you were to build the Hells Gates dam and you built a power station beside it on the coal reserves there, you would produce 500 megawatts of hydroelectric power and renewable power from bagasse, and you would produce 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired power. The proposal that we have there is for zeroemissions power-but that will be a story for another day. The great Dr Bradfield proposed that we fill up Lake Eyre with water. I do not think it would be a good idea to fill it up with water from North Queensland. But if you were to dig a ditch and fill it up with water from the Spencer Gulf, it would cost about $3,500 million. And you could put 100 square kilometres there under salt production. You have a giant lake of which you could take a small proportion-I am not quite sure of the exact proportion, but 100 square kilometres would produce $2,000 million worth of salt every year. It could be barged out in the irrigation ditch through which the water comes in, at virtually no cost at all, and we would become one of the great salt producers of the world. One of his alternative proposals was to fill Lake Eyre with a ditch dug between the lake and Spencer Gulf. SoI stand up today and say Joe Gutnick-to be very specific-says: ‘Yes. I will open up that mine and I will build a phosphate plant here and I will process that phosphate into diammonium phosphate-which is very, very valuable: $1,200 a tonne-and maybe send two-thirds of it overseas unprocessed because my partners are Indian and they want it unprocessed. So we will do that for you. We will produce $4,000 million or $5,000 million dollars worth of income for Australia. But I need land to build houses for my workers on’-land which our forebears fought and died for at Eureka-‘and I want some water. I want some electricity. We are on a 90-days water supply.’ Now we are in a record flood but, you know, a month ago we were on 90 days supply-to close down all the mining operations in north-west Queensland! ‘If you give us that electricity and that water, we can give you $20,000 million a year, and jobs that will be there year after year, out into the foreseeable future-or even the unforeseeable future. Those are the wonderful things we can do for you.’ We plead with the government to redirect some of that money away from self-indulgence, from nice little things that are wonderful to have. You have to sacrifice yourself to build for the future, as Barack Obama has said. (Time expired) 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is for $2.05 billion and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) is for $1.04 billion. These additional estimates bills seek authority from the parliament for additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the budget. The total additional appropriation being sought through additional estimates bills No. 3 and No. 4 this year is $3.1 billion, or about 4.1 per cent of total annual appropriations. The total appropriations being sought this year through Appropriation Bill (No. 3) of $2.05 billion arise from changes in the estimates of program expenditure due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases and program take-ups, reclassifications from policy decisions taken by MAIN COMMITTEE",351,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
336,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (6.32 Pm),"I am supporting the Appropriation Bill (No.the government since the last budget, and many new policy initiatives that have been welcomed by the community. I will try to go through both of these appropriation bills and look at what is there. There is a vast array of particular funding items, but it is important to go through them all because the bills set out part of the Rudd agenda in terms of how we assist Australia on a range of issues, many of which were neglected for many years under the coalition. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides additional funding to agencies for expenses in relation to grants to the states under section 96 of the Constitution, for payments to the territories and to local government authorities, and for non-operating purposes such as equity injections and loans. In particular, in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 4), I would like to talk about, later in my contribution, the local government authorities’ money and the plans for that money in my electorate, particularly from Wyong council, and just how welcome that has been. The principal factor contributing to the additional requirements since the 2008-09 budget is the proposed increase of $791.2 million in payments to states, territories and local authorities. The main items under Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 include $157.2 million to AusAID as part of the government’s commitment to increasing Australia’s overseas development assistance over the long term. The Department of Defence will be provided with $87.8 million to reimburse it for the costs of extending Australia’s military participation in stabilising and reconstruction activities in Iraq to 30 June 2009. There is $307 million to address pressures in a number of areas, including the graded other ranks pay structure review, superannuation, rental allowances and higher fuel costs. This funding is matched by reduced estimates for Defence in later years. There is $153 million for Defence to meet additional costs arising from movements in exchange rates and $29.4 million to cover unavoidable overspends on operations in the previous financial year which are funded by the government on a no win, no loss basis. The sum of $21.3 million from this appropriation bill will go to the Department of Health and Ageing to increase the number of organ donations and transplants across Australia by implementing a comprehensive set of initiatives. The substantive legislation in relation to this has already passed, as has most of the substantive legislation in relation to these appropriation bills. In terms of organ donation, Australia on the one hand is a country that has been internationally recognised for its strong record of successful organ transplants. More than 30,000 Australians have received transplants in the last 60 years and we have been leading the world, right at the cutting edge, in the tremendous work in transplantation that our doctors and health professionals have done. But on the other hand, ironically, we have one of the world’s lowest rates of organ donation. Demand massively outweighs supply in Australia, and the consequence of this is that a substantial number of people will die while waiting for suitable organ donations. In fact, in Australia about 200 organs are donated each year on average, with 1,800 people on the waiting list. So there is a shortfall of around 1,600 each year. That is why the legislation that passed through this place last year went to set up a comprehensive national system that will assist with organ transplants. The appropriation bill that we are discussing today allocates $21.3 million to make sure that that aim of increasing organ transplantssomething that is vital for this country-is achieved. Also for the Department of Health and Ageing there is an additional $7.5 million to be provided to increase the number of places available under the general practice placement proMAIN COMMITTEE gram. Another item under the same department is a return of $21.4 million to the diagnostic imaging industry as part of the recently expired memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the industry, and $14.4 million goes to the department to meet costs associated with the increased uptake of a breast cancer drug provided under the new Commonwealth program. These are all good initiatives. These are all initiatives that have come in the first year of the Rudd government. These are all initiatives that show that the health and well-being of Australian citizens is at the forefront of this government’s mind in deciding policy steps that need to be taken and need to be implemented. Thirty-nine million dollars will go to the Department of Human Services for a Job Capacity Assessment program to meet higher than expected demand for assessments. This will provide for an additional 139,555 assessments to be undertaken in 2008-09. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will receive $101 million to meet the increased demand for household rebates under the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. This is a program with a very high demand. This is a program that, after the Rudd government made changes in the budget, we were told was going to founder because there was not going to be enough uptake. There has been quite the reverse. What we have in fact found is that this program has been so popular that additional funding that was not envisaged has been brought forward to meet the high demand. This is good for Australia. This means that we have people taking advantage of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. This means that in terms of renewable energy, Australians are keen to move in that direction where they have an opportunity and government incentive. There is $61.6 million being made available to assist small block irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin affected by drought who wish to cease irrigation farming but stay on the farm. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will receive $57.1 million and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be provided with $4.5 million. For the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, an additional $59.4 million will meet commitments for which funding was provided last financial year but, because of program delays, payments were not able to be made until the current year. From that funding, $43.4 million is proposed to fund drought assistance grants to irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin and $16 million is proposed for the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement to enable the department to meet commitments that were entered into in 2007-08. Again, these are important initiatives. These are initiatives that go to the green credentials of the Rudd government, initiatives that have been dramatically built upon in the legislation that is being debated in the main chamber at the moment, but which the opposition are seeking to reject, in relation to the latest stimulus package. But these earlier initiatives are very important for making sure that the commitments we made to renewable energy and to trying to repair some of the damage that has been done to the Murray-Darling Basin are commitments that we take very seriously. This appropriation bill, in part, provides funding for that as well. The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research will be receiving an additional $93.3 million, and that is proposed to meet the increased cost of the LPG Vehicle Scheme arising from the additional customers who are expected to access the scheme in 200809. It is good that the government is having to provide this additional money, because it shows that where this government has put in place incentives for the community to take on MAIN COMMITTEE board new technology that is green, that is going to decrease the carbon footprint, Australians are not only willing but also eager to take it up. Again, it is an example of an oversubscribed scheme that needs to be topped up. There is $37 million for the Ethanol Production Grants program to meet an anticipated increase in expenditure due to the New South Wales government’s two per cent ethanol mandate, their expansions of the Manildra facility at Nowra and CSR’s facility at Sarina, and a new ethanol production facility at Dalby. In the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism there is a reallocation of $99.4 million for the establishment of a global carbon capture and storage institute. The institute will accelerate the take-up of carbon capturing projects by facilitating demonstration projects and identifying and supporting necessary research on related topics, including regulatory settings and regulatory frameworks. Funding in 2008-09 will be provided by the redirection of amounts from the National Low Emission Coal Initiative, formerly known as the National Clean Coal Fund. This additional funding is also partially offset by savings in other programs. Australian financial regulators, who in the last 18 months have been under more scrutiny than ever before, will receive $21.5 million in 2008-09 and $83 million over the next four years to help maintain the strength of Australia’s financial system during the global financial crisis. This will provide the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority with an additional $9 million in 2008-09 to meet the increased demands being placed on it to undertake a range of additional supervisory services. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will receive an additional $10 million to undertake market monitoring and enforcement activities, while the Department of the Treasury will receive $2.5 million to ensure Australia’s regulatory environment continues to be world’s best practice and to pursue reform of the global financial architecture. There is probably no more important time than now for this to be taking place-making sure that our regulators, who are amongst the best in the world, remain that way by making sure that we properly fund them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is to receive $18.8 million to account for the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Again, this is an important appropriation that needs to be there. It helps our ability to make payments to both the international peacekeeping organisations and other international organisations on behalf of the Australian government. With its long-standing support of the UN and other multilateral peacekeeping and peace related operations, Australia has a good name in international peacekeeping. Australia continues that tradition today and is an active contributor of personnel and financial support to the UN and other multinational peace operations throughout the world. Our personnel, both military and police, are currently present in countries including Cyprus, Egypt, Sudan and Timor Leste. This country’s peacekeeping roles also include being part of multilateral peace operations in the Solomon Islands. Australia is an active participant in efforts to further improve global peace operations. Australia’s contribution to global peace operations is a demonstration of our commitment to the UN Charter and efforts to resolve disputes through the international system. It is important that this work is done. I would like to talk, in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009, about the $300 million for the regional and local infrastructure program, of which $250 million is being distributed to local councils. In my electorate we have two councils, one of which, the Gosford Council, is predominantly in the electorate of my colleague the member for Robertson, with a small part in my electorate. The Wyong Shire Council is the shire council that covers the maMAIN COMMITTEE jority of my electorate. Both of these councils received around $1½ million out of this fund, which was a tremendous boost to them. In the Wyong shire amongst the programs that this is funding is an upgrade of the netball courts at Wyong. This is very important. The Wyong netball courts are amongst the busiest in New South Wales. By upgrading them and building new courts it will enable the area to put bids in for state championships and the like, as well as providing first-class facilities for the locals on a weekly and daily basis. There was also money that went to the establishment, at Canton Beach, of a second disability playground, which is vitally important. Only last year, through fund raising and local government efforts in the Wyong shire, we established the first disability park on the Central Coast at Long Jetty. That was almost completed but a small amount of money coming from the $1½ million for Wyong shire will also go to complete the disability toilets at Long Jetty. Not only is this money providing local infrastructure in my electorate-and electorates right around Australia-but by doing so it is providing local jobs where they are needed in particular projects that are ready to go, starting to work right now. It was interesting to gauge the response of the community and the elected council to this. The mayor of Wyong shire was absolutely lavish in his praise for this particular initiative, and could not say enough about this Rudd government initiative. One might ask: ‘Well, is this mayor a Labor mayor? It is Wyong shire; is this someone who has spent his life in the Labor Party and is his public appreciation of this initiative in some way a payback to the Labor Party?’ Quite the contrary; this particular mayor at one stage was the state Liberal Party member for The Entrance. But he can seeMs Neal-He saw the error of his ways. initiative by the Rudd government and has been lavish in his praise and support. These types of programs are reaching through and getting to all levels of the community, and the community and their representatives, whether their history has been on the other side of the political spectrum or not, cannot but support these great initiatives that the Rudd government has brought about. For that reason, there is broad support in the electorate and with those local elected councillors. There are literally a dozen other very important initiatives in these appropriation bills. Clearly, the time available is not going to allow me to go through them in any detail that will give any real justification for the importance that they actually have to the community. But going through and touching on those initiatives that I have mentioned so far in this contribution gives a taste of the important work that this government has undertaken not just in the May budget of last year but since then and incorporated in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). These are important bills. This is important work. This is nationbuilding work that has been carried out by the Rudd government. These works provide jobs locally. They ensure that the community is involved in many of these issues, and they are broad-ranging issues. WhatI have touched on today is the importance of issues going to the environment and the uptake that we have seen from the Rudd government’s initiatives in relation to that area, to health and the important role that the government has played and continues to play in trying to encourage greater organ donation, and to the direct stimulus to the local economy through the local council initiatives. These are very important initiatives that these two appropriation bills incorporate, and I commend both of these bills to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE",355,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
337,Mr Craig Thomson,"He saw the error of his ways, saw the wisdom of this particular(No. 4) 2008-2009. I want to make reference to the fact that I will be quoting extensively from a study, which has come from the Australian Local Government Association, titled the National financial sustainability study of local government. It is a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that was released in 2006. But, whilst I quote extensively from the study, it is not verbatim. I just wanted to put that on the record for Hansard. This report has drawn upon studies by Access Economics for state local government associations in Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, as well as a detailed analysis by the Municipal Association of Victoria. The research was complemented by financial analysis of over 100 Australian councils. I rise to speak specifically on this because I would like to go to the possibility of a constitutional recognition for local government. Within my speech on this appropriation bill, which deals with local councils and local government issues, I will also try and touch upon the drought relief and drought measures within this bill. I want to talk about some of the issues associated with drought and a single desk, particularly for wheat growers within my electorate, but I do want to raise the issue of whether or not we should constitutionally recognise local government. I was formerly a councillor of Wagga Wagga City Council. I was Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga City Council prior to coming into this House. Local government, being the government closest to the people, deserves recognition. I personally believe that we need to revisit the issue of constitutional recognition of local government. It is a fact out of this report, and I know, through working closely with local governments right across my electorate of Riverina and beyond, that local government is responding to rising community expectations. There has been significant cost shifting, particularly from the New South Wales state government, to local governments. In the last few years what was once a New South Wales state road has been downgraded to a local road so that it has gone off the New South Wales government’s books. It is incumbent upon local government, when the supply of medical infrastructure is low or doctors are not available, to try and find solutions and resolutions. There is a growing expectation that local governments will provide the range of essential services and infrastructure that underpin local communities. The growth in input prices generally has exceeded the average rate of revenue growth, resulting in a significant number of councils who are now developing financial deficits. That is significant, because many decisions are imposed upon local government. Take, for interest’s sake, when there was a separation of land and water. The proponents of separation of land and water did not anticipate the impact that separation would have on local government, particularly in my electorate of Riverina. Water was always the most extensive of financial assets in land and water, particularly in the MIA and around the Hay area. When the water value is high, you have a separation and there are no rates applied to water, council is left with an enormous shortfall of revenue with nowhere else to get funds. Rates revenue then comes only from land, the value of which may go down by two-thirds. Yet, local government is still expected to provide the same facilities. So there has been a tendency for local governments to defer or reduce expenditure that could aid and abet infrastructure renewals in their local government areas. Councils may have no option but to cut back on the level of local community services and infrastructure, for the very reasons that I have just pointed out. MAIN COMMITTEE",359,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
338,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (6.52 Pm),"I rise in the House today to speak on Appropriation BillThe PricewaterhouseCoopers report says that up to 30 per cent of local government councils might not be sustainable, and I think that is a tragedy. I think it is an absolute tragedy. That report is consistent with state based reports that between 25 and 40 per cent of councils in states could be financially unsustainable. This report, which was done involving local government, called for a range of reforms to deal with the national total backlog in local government infrastructure renewal work. That was worth an estimated $14.5 billion. During our term in government, we delivered Roads to Recovery money directly to local governments and they directly spent it. No money was siphoned off by the state bureaucracies. I believe that should take place in health initiatives. I lobbied hard when we were in government to get health money delivered directly to local governments, and we succeeded in many of the programs that we put in place. But there is a greater need to deliver money directly through local government and to bypass states. AmI a proponent of the dissolution of states? Probably yes. I am certainly not a proponent of local government not getting recognition. Many community centres and aged-care facilities, health clinics and sport and recreation facilities were established in the 1950s-and earlier-and are not being sufficiently upgraded because local governments have a lack of funds. A detailed analysis by Access Economics of over 441 councils completed over 2005-06 across four states-New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria-found that the average infrastructure renewal backlog per council was $20.8 million. This is significant because they seem to have to provide an enormous number of services that were once provided by the states. If this average result is applied across 700 councils, the aggregate national renewals backlog would be, according to this report, around $14.5 billion. The estimated funding gap to clear the backlog and to cover the annual underspend on renewals was estimated in this report to be $3.1 million per council per annum, or a $2.16 billion package nationally. This indicates the plight of local government. But the sustainability problem is typically more acute in our smaller councils, which are primarily in rural and remote areas. It is a significant issue for numerous regional and more remote communities, and local government is generally the only institution present in many of the economic activity drivers in these areas. So it seems that over the past 30 years the range of functions that has been undertaken by local government in Australia has expanded well beyond the physical infrastructure of roads, rates and rubbish that we have always seen, and it does include an enormous number of important social and human services. Again, as this report indicates, this has come about through a combination of community pressure and expectations, state and Australian government inducements, and the withdrawal of services by other levels of government. For many of the 60 per cent of councils that are rural or remote, static or declining populations have tended to translate into static or declining revenue. Councils in agricultural areas have more pronounced viability problems than their metropolitan counterparts. These councils typically appear to have a relatively larger scope for internal reforms, but they battle against lack of scale, so they cannot share resources because of the tyranny of distance and the expectations of their community, and they really do require additional funding for community infrastructure. There were programs that were funded under the old Regional Partnerships program that renewed and built community infrastructure. WhilstI stand, I will declare that I had enormous success in my Regional Partnerships projects. Each one of the projects in my region stacks up MAIN COMMITTEE on its own merit and I will back them 1,000 per cent. Each delivered, in spades, benefits to the community. I will never, ever say that the applications from the communities that I represent were funded on the basis of anything but merit. I have local governments and councils that are having to refurbish community centres and public halls, and upgrade senior citizens centres-make provisions for senior citizens centres. They are responsible for the renewal and refurbishment of theatres, galleries and museums. Hay used to be an area I represented, and that little town has five museums, including curators. It is just an extraordinary town. I love Hay-I was so sad that it was removed from my electorate-and I will continue to represent the needs of Hay, because it is a vibrant, can-do community that continually gets kicked and knocked back because government decisions impact on it enormously. There is also responsibility for the enhancement of main streets and the upgrading-in more coastal areas; certainly not in mine-of boat ramps, jetties and wharves. Above all there is the upgrading of recreational facilities to enable communities to come together: swimming pools and playing fields. These are essential recreational facilities for rural and regional communities. Councils are also responsible for the improvement of park equipment, such as playgrounds, benches and barbecues, because the people who inhabit rural and regional communities also have an expectation that they deserve a quality of life and deserve to enjoy these things. Local governments and councils have an amazing amount of responsibility that is certainly not understood. I tried desperately-and I will continue to try-to get what I call the Runways to Recovery Program funded, the R2R of aviation, for airports in rural and regional communities to upgrade and maintain aerodromes, airstrips et cetera. The airports are used to fly in essential services such as health services, including mental health services. In many cases the fly-in services provide the only access that these communities have to health services. There are libraries and information centres. I note that the Prime Minister’s package includes upgrading libraries. That could certainly help local government. Then there is the refurbishment of kitchen and council facilities which provide meals on wheels. These are things that local governments and communities provide for members of their communities. These are things that fall to the local governments to do. I stand here recognising as best as I can the enormous job that local governments do. Why shouldn’t they have constitutional recognition? Why shouldn’t they be completely included in budgetary processes et cetera? I feel very strongly about this, and I felt that this evening was an obvious time to raise this issue. I will finish by highlighting the impact that the dismantling of the single desk last year had on my electorate. I have farmers who are at breaking point. They have just tried to market their grain and have been told that the 27 tonnes of prime hard wheat they have just delivered out of the millions that they should have is worth less than the price of feed wheat. That was just a few months ago. We have imposed this significant decision on the people who live in rural and regional Australia. They are incensed about the decision to deregulate the export wheat market in a year such as we have just had. It has been a horrible year. Of all the years to make a decision of the magnitude that was made by the Rudd government and the minister! We were staring down the barrel of the subprime collapse. It was certainly not the year to irreversibly put wheat farmers against the wall. MAIN COMMITTEE In the month the Labor Party deregulated the wheat desk they concentrated on workplace changes and the rights of unions to again dominate a workplace and to collectively bargain in the sole interests of workers yet the minister removed the right of growers to collectively bargain with their grain. Minister, you have taken away their rights. You have given rights to every other Australian and have removed the rights of my growers to collectively market their grain. They are now at the mercy of these grain traders who are simply not able to be found. They have picked off my growers one by one. It is a tragedy. I will continue to outline and highlight this tragedy not because it is a political issue but because it hurts and burns my heart and my soul intensely to see the people I represent so badly affected by that decision. The pools that are operating at the moment are ineffective. They do not have the advantages of a large national pool. There is no parcel of grain accumulating with enough hedging attached to it to offer any sort of competitive pricing. I have had AWB openly making it very clear to growers that the pools will open and close as they please and that sellers should lock in early to avoid missing out. There is no sense of security. The growers have been decimated by drought and have been hurt in recent years through forward selling grain. A large national pool would have carried stock from previous years into a weaker harvest and not have left our growers exposed to the weaker position that they now find themselves in. I think all growers would concede that, whilst the highs of the pool may not be the one-off extreme high-buyers or risky futures-swaps might offer, the plummeting lows could certainly have been ridden out and their effects cushioned. The price of Australian grain has fluctuated substantially through domestic consumption and demand. During this drought the demand has been worth $100 per tonne to the grower, which effectively has meant that grain has been worth more than the US futures price. Our basis has gone from positive to negative, however, and is now negativing our grain to the tune of A$40 to A$50 per tonne in comparison with US futures pricing. We have a tragedy. There is not a single national pool to ride the current lows and carry grain for longer periods to ensure a greater average return coupled with an upfront payment to keep farming entities afloat into sowing. It is a harsh reality that our bank managers are not willing to sit back and let farmers carry their grain to attempt to avert the current paltry returns. Much was made during that inquiry by both Liberal and Labor senators of the fact that grain could be stored on-farm or warehoused at receival sites. I kept saying, ‘This cannot happen; this is simply a nonsense,’ and that is exactly what it was. Until a few days ago farmers in our area were holding prime hard grain valued at $270 per tonne. Its value has now fallen to less than $240 per tonne. If they were to hold this grain, as was suggested in this inquiry, and store it on-farm, it would cost them 10 per cent interest on their overdrafts, which would easily take off $13.50 per tonne. Six months of warehousing at receival sites would have cost $1.25 per tonne per month in storage fees, which would equate to about $7.50 per tonne. So, before growers could even get out of bed they would need to be looking at $300 a tonne to profit if they held onto the grain. This is what we were trying to explain. This is just a nonsense. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) talks about drought. I talk about reality. This is a travesty of justice. This has been imposed upon the people I represent. I detest what has been done. I feel strongly about this, and I will not stop raising it until some relief is given to those people who have been so badly affected by the policies of this government. MAIN COMMITTEE member for Riverina. I assure her that she took me on a trip down memory lane there, from when I coached in Temora. I have some friends who live in Temora, Mimosa, Ardlethan and Ariah Park who are farmers. She will be happy to know that I have invited them to come to this place later this month to meet directly with Tony Burke. It is a meeting that Tony is very keen to have with young farmers, so they can say first-hand how that system worked and be able to put their concerns to him. Mrs Hull-Thank you. (No. 3) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. These additional estimates bills are presented during a crisis that is unprecedented in our lifetime, a time where strong and decisive action to support jobs and the economy is required. The additional estimates bills seek appropriation authority from parliament for additional expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget. I will outline some of the major appropriations processed in the bill that are particularly significant to the people in my electorate of Solomon. This bill provides the Department of Defence with an additional $87.8 million to reimburse it for the cost of extending Australia’s military participation in stabilisation and reconstruction activities in Iraq to 30 June 2009. The Department of Defence will also be provided with $153 million to meet additional costs arising from movements in the exchange rate; $29.4 million will also go to the Department of Defence to cover unavoidable overspends on operations in the previous financial year, which are funded by the government on a no win, no loss basis. Very importantly, the Department of Defence will be provided with $307 million to address pressures in a number of areas, including the graded other ranks pay structure review, superannuation, rental allowances and higher fuel costs. Well over 5,000 ADF men and women are based in Solomon at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin Naval Base and Headquarters Northern Command located at Larrakeyah Barracks. The Australian Army has a large presence at Robertson Barracks and NORFORCE is at Larrakeyah Barracks, and of course there is the Royal Australian Air Force at RAAF Base Darwin. Defence personnel and their families are an integral part of our vibrant city in the north. I must say that both during the campaign and since being elected I have been extremely fortunate in meeting so many members of our Australian Defence Force community. I know these commitments by the Rudd Labor government deliver for the Australian Defence Force community. These bills demonstrate our government’s strong commitment to the Defence Force and, through a significant military presence, they also build the economy of Solomon. On 19 February, we will remember the bombing of Darwin, a significant event in the history of Australia. These measures show that the Australian Defence Force and their families are front and centre with the Rudd Labor government. They build on the existing funding programs, from child care to health care to housing. It was fantastic to hear the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel reply to my question regarding the role Defence Housing Australia will play in yesterday’s announcement in parliament of the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. As a result of our package, the government will provide $251.6 million to the Defence Housing Authority to construct 802 dwellings in metropolitan and regional centres. Importantly, these new houses will not be built MAIN COMMITTEE",360,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
339,Mr Hale (Solomon) (7.12 Pm),I would like to acknowledge the contribution from the,364,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
340,Mr Hale,"No worries. I appreciate that. I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Billin just one or two areas of the country. Seventeen different regions across Australia will benefit from the initiative, including 185 new houses to be built in Darwin. Not only will this ensure Australian Defence Force personnel have appropriate, quality housing available to them but it will also mean a huge boost to the local construction industry across all 17 regions. Building will commence in April this year and continue until mid-2011. The government will continue to support employment initiatives for spouses, assistance with housing, relocation, childcare programs, health care, the transition to civilian life at the end of a military career and a number of other support services. As many of my colleagues often say, it is ‘recruit the member, retain the family’. I know these types of initiatives are of great benefit to the fantastic Defence Force personnel and their families who live and work in Solomon. Back in December the government brought all the mayors and shire presidents from around the country to Canberra. It was a historic moment and one I was proud to be involved in. Not only were partnerships between federal and local government strengthened but also it was about setting local infrastructure projects that would be federally funded. The two lord mayors in my electorate-Graham Sawyer, the Lord Mayor of Darwin, and Robert McLeod, the very enthusiastic Lord Mayor of Palmerston-had a fantastic time. This bill appropriates $300 million to local councils and shires across Australia, including $250 million to be allocated between all councils through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. As we heard yesterday, the government will provide an additional $500 million over two years to expand the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. These are fantastic initiatives by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, bringing the federal government to a greater understanding of and being of greater assistance to local government. These are grassroots projects. They help local businesses to create local jobs at the grassroots level. As the member for Riverina touched on, it brings local pride and builds community. That is what we are all about. We have gone so much away from building community in the last 12 years. In Solomon, councils have been allocated $661,000. This money would never have been allocated under the previous government; it would not have happened. They would never have brought all the lord mayors to Canberra to talk to them about how federal government could assist local government. There was $313,000 to the Darwin City Council and $196,000 to the Palmerston City Council. I know the money was extremely well received. Both my lord mayors, Graeme Sawyer and Robert Mcleod, are very passionate about their patch and what they can do. It is just the shot in the arm that both councils and local contractors needed and something that I know that the people of Darwin and Palmerston are particularly happy about. This bill provides funding for local projects-things like community centres, swimming pools and sports grounds-projects that will need to meet the program’s guidelines and be approved by the government before funding can be provided. I have been working with, and will continue to work with, councils and shires in my electorate to put forward projects that our community really needs. This means worthwhile projects that stimulate our local economy and support jobs in our communities during this global financial crisis. The Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program is yet another example of our government taking decisive action at a local level to support our local economy through these types of initiatives. These are unprecedented times. Many countries around the world have already slipped into, or are slipping into, recession. We have two options. We can either sit on our hands and do MAIN COMMITTEE nothing or we can act swiftly and decisively to continue to grow Australia’s economy and to continue to save Australian jobs. This bill will also provide almost $100 million to establish a global institute to speed up the development of carbon capture and storage technology. Through this institute the Rudd government will work cooperatively with other countries to help reduce the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. The government has offered to host the institute in Australia and would continue to contribute up to $100 million per annum towards its operation. Developing and commercialising this technology is vital for Australia’s future. In fact, CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Geoff Garrett said that the initiative would significantly reduce the time frames currently projected to develop and deploy critical carbon capture and storage technologies on a commercial scale. Australia has already held informal consultations with industry and foreign governments over a possible model for the institute. This will pave the way for its commercial deployment across the world by the end of the next decade. It is an initiative that proves once again that we on this side of the House are serious about climate change. The commitment was again apparent yesterday with the second stimulus package initiative and the Energy Efficient Homes Program, for instance, which will assist in the insulation of homes and the rebate for solar panels to assist in reducing our power consumption. This is an unprecedented financial crisis, a crisis of a magnitude never seen before. Australia is not immune to it. It will be a hard year, a hard fight. However, it is a fight we will win. The decisive action in this crisis by the Rudd Labor government will enable us to fight through these uncertain times. I commend these bills to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Laming) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 7.23 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Employment Services (Question No. 500) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of funding currently made to employment services providers, what percentage was spent in the 2007-08 financial year on jobseekers: (a) with a Job Seeker Classification Instrument rating of (i) 019, (ii) 20-28, and (iii) 29 plus, and (b) who have had a Job Capacity Assessment. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The fees paid to service providers and other expenditure for the various employment services programs are not directly based on Job Seeker Classification Instrument score ranges of this kind, or by the individual job seeker’s participation in Job Capacity Assessment. As examples, the amount a Job Network provider may expend in Job Seeker Account funds to purchase assistance for a particular individual, or the service fee paid to a Work for the Dole provider are not set on the basis of the job seeker’s JSCI score. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations does not, therefore, record employment services expenditure information for specific job seeker categories of the type specified by the honourable member. It is not feasible to provide an answer to the honourable member’s question as highly extensive and unreasonable resources would be required for the Department to develop the capacity to report employment services expenditure in the requested detail. Employment Services (Question No. 501) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of the tender process for the new Employment Services Contract 2009-12, how many: (a) staff of her department worked on the tender assessment panel; and (b) hours were worked on the assessment.

Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: 438 tenders were lodged in response to the Request for Tender for Employment Services 2009-12. Employment Services (Question No. 503) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of the new Employment Services Contract 2009-12: of the tenders received by the 17 November 2008, how many were received from companies whose head office is overseas. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Tenderers for Employment Services 2009-12 that are foreign companies are required to be registered under section 5B.2 of the Corporations Act 2001. This registration requires companies to have a registered office within Australia. The tender document did not request information regarding the tenderer’s head office as it is not material to the tender process. The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (January 2005) require that “Procurement methods must not discriminate against potential suppliers due to their degree of foreign affiliation or ownership, location or size”. Employment Services (Question No. 504) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of the new Employment Services Contract 2009-12: what mutual obligation requirements will people over 50 have to undertake. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Under existing arrangements, job seekers who are 50 years and over do not have an annual Mutual Obligation requirement. These job seekers will not have an annual work experience activity requirement under the new employment services but will be able to participate on a voluntary basis in the full range of work experience activities. National Disability Recruitment Coordinator Program (Question No. 505) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of the National Disability Recruitment Coordinator program: what is the maximum number of commencements for which the program’s provider will be paid over the duration of the current contract.

A job placement fee is payable to the provider for each eligible employment placement after the job seeker remains in the job for a minimum of four weeks. The maximum number of job placement fees that can be paid to the provider of the National Disability Recruitment Coordinator service is 1500 annually. Employment Services (Question No. 506) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 3 December 2008: In respect of the recent tender for the provision of Employment Services from 2009-12, what proportion of tenders incorporated subcontracting for provision of: (a) stream 4 servicing; and (b) Work for the Dole work experience.

Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: On 29 November 2008 COAG agreed to consider a National Partnership for the delivery of training under the Program. The Agreement was not signed at the COAG meeting of 29 November. Once the Agreement is signed a State or Territory will be required to submit an Implementation Plan.

Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) On 21 November 2008, the landlord served Centrelink with a notice to vacate the building by 24 December 2008. The landlord’s eviction notice was acknowledged on 24 November 2008 and acted upon by Centrelink. (b) The existing lease at 55 Currie Street expired on 31 July 2008. Centrelink has been negotiating a lease renewal at 55 Currie Street since November 2007, but has been unsuccessful in agreeing to terms with the landlord. (c) Approximately 80 per cent of the customers who regularly use Currie Street do not live in the Adelaide CBD and these customers continue to have access to their local Customer Service Centre (CSC). The current customer base will be serviced by a combination of appropriately targeted out servicing and CSCs. Within six kilometres of the Adelaide CBD there are three CSCs, at Norwood (3.37km), Torrensville (2.82km) and Enfield (5.68km).

Australian Apprenticeships Centres (Question No. 534) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 4 December 2008: In respect of the Australian Apprenticeships Centres: (1) Has she undertaken any consultation on their future role; if so, what consultations have been held. (2) How has their performance rated against the five key performance indicators in the 2006-09 contract. (3) What funding will the Government provide for Australian Apprenticeship Centres from 1 January 2010. (4) Does the Government plan to transfer responsibility for the Australian Apprenticeship Centres to the State and Territory Governments. (5) Has any funding within the National Skills and Workforce Development COAG Agreement been allocated to the Australian Apprenticeship Centres, or a body fulfilling a similar role. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Has she undertaken any consultation on their future role; if so, what consultations have been held? The Minister for Education has not undertaken any consultations on future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprentices. No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprentices. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will continue to liaise closely with all stakeholders in the coming months regarding future arrangements. (2) How has their performance rated against the five key performance indicators in the 2006-09 contract? The Australian Apprenticeships Support Services (AASS) Contract 2006-2009 has five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPI 1 Accuracy The data below is based on the monitoring periods that have been finalised to date. This includes the monitoring periods from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008. This data has been consolidated to provide the average national outcome. Benchmark National average MeasureA Overall accuracy in the administration of AASS 96% 98% MeasureB Training contracts processed within 10 day turnaround 90% 87% MeasureC Claims processed within 10 day turnaround 90% 90% MeasureD Advice letters processed within 10 day turnaround 90% 81% MeasureE Accuracy of assessments for incentives eligibility 90% 97% KPI 2 Satisfaction Level The satisfaction survey measures the level of satisfaction of employers and Australian Apprentices with Australian Apprenticeships Centres service delivery. The data below has been consolidated to provide the average national outcome. Benchmark National average 2007 Employer Satisfaction Survey 85% 92% Apprentice Satisfaction Survey 85% 95% 2008 data has not yet been finalised and is therefore unavailable at this stage. KPI 3 Marketing and Promotion KPI 3 is a qualitative measure of how satisfactorily each Australian Apprenticeships Centre has met or not met the intended marketing and promotion objectives and strategies as detailed in their annual Business Activity Report. Rating Marketing & Promotion 96% of contracted provider results were rated as satisfactory KPI 4 Key Priority Groups KPI 4 is a qualitative measure of how satisfactorily each Australian Apprenticeships Centre has met or not met the intended objectives and strategies. This includes: Servicing Key Priority Groups (including Indigenous Australians, people with a disability, Australian School-based Apprenticeships and mature aged workers); and Skills shortage Occupations Business Plan. Rating Key Priority Groups 97% of contracted provider results were rated as satisfactory Skills Shortage 95% of contracted provider results were rated as satisfactory KPI 5 Retention and Completion Rates KPI 5 is based on completed monitoring periods up to 31 December 2007 only. This is due to the time lag between commencing and reaching the six month point of an Australian Apprenticeship. Consequently retention is always reported one or two monitoring periods after the commencement date. The benchmarks for retention and completion rates are based on the historical rates as at 30 June 2005. For the retention measure, 86% of Australian Apprenticeships Centre contracts have achieved within 10% of their benchmark or above. For the completion measure, 94% of Australian Apprenticeships Centre contracts have achieved their benchmark or above. (3) What funding will the Government provide for Australian Apprenticeships Centres from 1 January 2010? The Australian Government is currently considering the future arrangements for Australian Apprenticeships Support Services in line with exploring strengthening linkages and pursuing better alignment of servicing arrangements for Australian Apprenticeships. No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprenticeships. The Department will continue to liaise closely with all stakeholders in the coming months regarding future arrangements. (4) Does the Government plan to transfer responsibility for the Australian Apprenticeships Centres to the State and Territory Governments? No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprenticeships. (5) Has any funding within the National Skills and Workforce Development COAG Agreement been allocated to the Australian Apprenticeships Centres, or a body fulfilling a similar role? The National Skills and Workforce Development COAG Agreement does not allocate funding for support services for Australian Apprenticeships. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: Staffing (Question No. 539) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 4 December 2008: What action has been taken to address the reported high turnover of staff in his department (Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Annual Report 2007-08, page 260). Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The DEEWR Annual Report 2007-2008 (Table P3.6, page 260) shows that 1286 people separated from the former DEST, former DEWR and DEEWR between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2008. The report indicates that a considerable proportion of these separations (355 or approximately 28%) were initiated by the Department, mainly through the expiry of non-ongoing employment contracts. The majority of the balance of separations (916 or approximately 71%) were initiated by staff. between the median (12.83%) and the 75th percentile (17.58%) of a benchmark of a number of Federal Government agencies (Infohrm HR Benchmarking Program). While this rate is slightly higher than the department’s target range, it is not unexpected given the level of organisational change over the past 12 months. DEEWR continues to monitor voluntary staff turnover and has a range of strategies to ensure we retain the workforce capability required to deliver our business including: an attractive and flexible set of employment terms and conditions a performance management system that engages and supports all staff to achieve their full potential recruitment and orientation processes that are effective in bringing new staff into the organisation promoting strong employee engagement through improved leadership and enhanced career and learning opportunities. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: Staffing (Question No. 540) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 4 December 2008: Will the reported increased staffing levels in her department be maintained, or will redundancies occur as a result of the efficiency dividend (Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Annual Report 2007-08, page 260). Mr Brendon O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The increase to DEEWR staffing levels from 30 June 2007 was the result of the creation of the new department which combined three distinct entities: the Department of Education, Science and Training; the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations; and the youth and child care function from the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. DEEWR expects its staffing levels to reduce during the 2008-09 financial year as a result a number of government decisions including the decision to increase the efficiency dividend from 1.25 per cent to 3.25 per cent. DEEWR is not expecting to offer redundancies as a result of the efficiency dividend. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: Staffing (Question No. 541) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 4 December 2008: What proportion of reported increased staffing in his department is at the Senior Executive Band1 or above (Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Annual Report 2007-08, page 260). Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The 2007-08 Annual Report for Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is the first report of its nature for the Department. It contains staffing data as at 30 June 2008. It does not contain previous year data. Dr Southcott refers to page 260 of the annual report in his question however, this is no commentary on this page referring to staff increases. It is therefore not possible to answer the question. Employment and Workplace Relations: Graduate Program (Question No. 542) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 4 December 2008: How many graduates were employed by his department in 2008; and of these, how many were initially taken on under the department’s graduate program. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: In response to the above questions, the Agency provides the following information: The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) is unable to provide information on how many graduates were employed in 2008 as it does not collect this information. ate program, with 170 completing the program in 2008. Employment and Workplace Relations: Graduate Program (Question No. 543) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 4 December 2008: How many graduates of his department have been offered paid positions in his department in 2009. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) has offered 100 graduates paid positions in the 2009 graduate program. Voice Over Internet Protocol Telephones (Question No. 544) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 4 December 2008: What cost savings have been made by her department from introducing Voice over Internet Protocol telephones. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The former Department of Employment and Workplace Relations commenced a project in December 2006 to transition to Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) technology over a period of approximately 12 months with expected savings and improvements in administration and support of the Department’s telephony system. Savings from the project were expected to accrue only after full implementation which was planned to be completed early in the 2008/09 financial year. Due to the machinery of government changes and the resulting merger of the Department with the Department of Education, Science and Training, the scope of project has increased and the project is now scheduled for completion in the 2009/10 financial year. The Department anticipates that savings from the deployment of this technology will now begin to accrue during the 2009/10 financial year. Based on original estimates, these savings are expected to be approximately $800K per annum over the costs of maintaining the Department’s traditional telephony systems. Fair Work Australia (Question No. 545) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 4 December 2008: Has her department made any provision in the 2008-09 or 2009-10 Budgets for advertising expenditure relating to Fair Work Australia; if so, what sum has been budgeted. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: No, my department has no provision in the 2008-09 or 2009-10 Budgets for advertising expenditure relating to Fair Work Australia. Great Barrier Reef (Question No. 547) Mr Katter asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 4 December 2008: (1) Will he provide a comparison between the damage done to the Great Barrier Reef by Agricultural production and that done by urban settlement. (2) Given Green Cane Harvesting (GCH) and its protective ‘trash blanket’ of organic matter have obviated the need for cultivation and thereby reduced erosion to near negligible levels and similarly reduced herbicide requirements, will he provide figures quantifying the reduction in (a) sediment, (b) fertiliser, and (c) chemical run off following the introduction of GCH. (3) Can he indicate what volume of (a) nitrates, and (b) phosphates are outletted onto the reef from (i) farming, and (ii) non-farming city and town activity. (4) What action has been taken to (a) reduce waste from urban activity, (b) provide riparian rock training walls, and (c) assist farmers to make further improvements. (5) Can he advise what quantitative evidence exists of reef destruction in light of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s (GBRMPA) claims that the health of the reef has improved. (6) Can he provide quantitative and specific data to support GBRMPA’s claims. (1) A significant body of work has been undertaken in the last 20 years that has quantified the impacts of poor water quality on marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs. The main contaminants affecting these marine communities are excess nutrients, sediments and pesticides. The reef communities don’t distinguish where these contaminants come from, just that there are too much of them. A synthesis of this research was released recently at the Reef Summit to support the latest Scientific Consensus Statement. This report highlights again that agricultural run-off contributes the bulk of the contaminants entering the Great Barrier Reef. (2) Green Cane Harvesting indeed improved protection of soil from erosion. Coral coring research undertaken by the University of Queensland in 2007 in the Mackay Whitsunday region indicates a reduction in sediment being incorporated into the coral skeletons in this area with the widespread introduction of this practice in the mid 1990s. However this practice does not affect either nutrient or pesticide applications, which are not activities associated with harvesting. These are activities associated with planting and growing crops and so have not been reduced by Green Cane Harvesting in any significant manner. (3) A number of assessments have been published in the last 5 years, including most recently the Scientific Consensus Statement on Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef, and all are consistent in their findings. Between 80 and 90% of the loads of sediment, nutrients and pesticides entering the Great Barrier Reef come from diffuse sources in agricultural lands. (4) The Government has supported a range of actions to address the improvement of water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. For example, by far the largest urban source is nutrient output from sewage treatment plants. The Government has been supporting the upgrading of urban sewage treatment facilities in Queensland, from secondary to tertiary treatment (that is removing nutrients), for many years and strongly supports Queensland’s policy, which requires the upgrade of all coastal sewage treatment plants to this high standard by 2010. Further the Government is providing $200m through its Reef Rescue package, over the next 5 years, to support on-ground-actions to improve water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, much of which will be targeted at supporting farmers improve their practices. The Government has been supporting the Queensland Wetland Program for the last 4 years, which has included around $8m for on-ground works, like riparian rehabilitation you describe. Further financial support for this important work is earmarked in grants recently announced to Regional Natural Resource Management Bodies this year. (5) Quite the contrary, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not made any claims in recent times suggesting the overall health of the Great Barrier Reef has improved. While it is true that by world standards the Great Barrier Reef is arguably the best managed and healthiest system in the world, this is a relative situation. It is true that some aspects of reef health have improved following the rezoning in 2004, including the bounce back of some specific fish species. However, the Au-",364,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
341,Mr Garrett,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:thority’s view is that the Great Barrier Reef remains under significant pressure. This in particular relates to the growing impacts induced by global climate change and the impacts from poor land practices driving a decline in water quality, which underpins the health and resilience of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. This is why the Government has recognised the importance of addressing this insidious problem and is investing significant resources through programs like Caring for Our country. (6) AgainI reiterate that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not made any such claim. I would direct Mr Katter to the most recent publication by the Authority on the Climate Change and the Great Barrier Reef a Vulnerability Assessment to answer his question on the depth of the Authority’s concern with regard to the pressures on the long term health of the Great Barrier Reef. The publication is available on the GBRMPA web site and hard copies are available upon request to the Roe Highway (Question No. 549) Dr Jensen asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 4 December 2008: In respect of the construction of Roe Highway Stage 8, west of Kwinana Freeway: (a) does the Government strongly support this project; (b) what level of funding will the Government provide for this vital transport link; and (c) are there any other actions, proposals or decisions of the Government relating to this project, especially any environmental restrictions on the use of land reserved for the project. (a) (b) (c) The Government has made no funding commitment to the extension of the Roe Highway beyond the Kwinana Freeway. The Government is aware that there is a range of community, environmental and economic issues that would need to be addressed by the Western Australia Government in the planning and development of such a project. National Affordable Housing Agreement (Question No. 551) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 4 December 2008: Under the National Affordable Housing Agreement, will the Government support community housing providers to hold title to their capital properties, enabling them to leverage those capital assets to reinvest in expanding their social housing stock; if no, why not. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: As part of the National Affordable Housing Agreement, the Australian Government and States and Territories have committed to a range of ongoing reforms in the housing sector, including enhancing the capacity and growth of the not-for-profit housing sector. Under the National Affordable Housing Agreement, State and Territory Governments will continue to be responsible for deciding whether community housing providers hold title to properties funded by government. Rotary Youth Driver Awareness Program (Question No. 552) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 4 December 2008:",382,Questions In Writing
342,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Does the Government intend to follow through on the commitment made by the former Coalition Government to fund the national rollout of the Rotary Youth Driver Awareness Program; if not, why not. The Australian Government is committed to improving young driver safety. The Government has committed $17 million over five years to implement the keys2drive election commitment. The keys2drive program, being developed by the Australian Automobile Association, will encourage learner drivers across Australia to get more on-road experience prior to gaining their licence. It will also assist supervising drivers to become better informed in undertaking their important role. The Government recognises the contribution being made by several education programs such as the Rotary Youth Driver Awareness (RYDA) Program. However, given the scope and focus of the keys2drive program, the Government does not intend to fund the national rollout of the RYDA program. Veterans’ Affairs: Staffing (Question No. 554) Mrs Markus asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 4 December 2008: (1) What was the number of employees in his department as at: (a) 1 July 2007; and (b) 1 July 2008. (2) What is the forecast number of employees in his department for 1 July 2009. (3) What were the locations of offices in his department which were closed during the five years before 1 July 2008. (4) Does he have plans to close any offices in his department before 1 July 2009; if so, which ones. (1) (a) On1 July 2007 there were 2372 employees. (b) On1 July 2008 there were 2355 employees. (2) The forecast number of staff in the Department for 1 July 2009 is 2085. (3) No. (4) No.",383,Questions In Writing
