Ever since the spring racing campaign opened, the receipts on the line have steadily grown week after week. week was a recorda long way ahead of the previous week, which was up to that time also a record. Last week there were 426 calls over the line, as against 391 the week before. This is the first time since the 'inauguration of the line that the number of calls has gone over 400. The receipts last week were £q6 , as against £§1 for the previous week. With the average receipts as large as this, the line would pay handsomely. Indeed, if there were any prospect of last week's business being maintained, there is little doubt that the Postmaster-General( Mr Mauger) would again cut down the charges made for using the line. I desire to ask the honourable gentleman if the Department has taken it upon itself to reduce the fee which was fixed for holding a conversation over the trunk line between Sydney and Melbourne, and, if so, whether the Minister cannot now take it upon himself, contrary to the regulations, to reduce the charge which was fixed in respect of the telephone line from West Maitland to That recommendation of the DeSydney? man supposes a case and then proceeds to knock it down.

In reply, I have to lniorm you that the only arrangement of this kind which has been entered into is in connection with the contract between the New Zealand Government and the New Zealand and African Steam-ship Companyj for a cargo steam-ship service between New Zealand and the West Coast ports of the Unit-d Kingdom. The provision in the contract affecting the matter as referred to by you is as follows :"" In consideration of the premises the Government undertake to ship one-half of all cargo under their control from the West Coast ports of the United Kingdom, and one-half of such cargo coming forward from London by the Contractors' line of steamers, provided that the now hindering. Contractors give sufficient public notic: of the sailing dates of such, steamers, and that should any cargo at any time be shut out, the Government shall b° at liberty to make other arrangement for the shipment of such cargo."" This line of steamers received no subsidy from the Government. . The only consideration given was in respect of goods shipped under the above clause of the contract. I am at present unable to say what amount in freightage was paid to the contractors, and it would entail considerable labour to get the figures If , however, these are of importance to you, please, let me know, and they will be prepared andsent to you as early as possible.

Postmaster-General a question, without notice, I desire to quote a paragraph which appeared in Saturday's Argus, and which reads ns followsThe Postmaster-General recognises that the only way to effectually deal wilh sweating is Oy the employment of more hands. In this, however, he has been blocked by the Treasurer ( Sir William Lyne), and the Public Service Commissioner ( Mr D. C. McLachlan). The employment of a number of temporary hands was sanctioned by them. Mr Mauger instructed the count of ill-health, be granted to the honourable Deputv Postmaster-General in Sydney to nt member for Adelaide. once engage as many as have been allotted to him. I desire to know whether it is a fact that account of ill-health, be granted to the honorthe Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney able member for Wentworth. has applied for 600 additional hands, of which number only one-half has been allotted ? man is again wrong in his facts. The Deputy Postmaster-General did not ""apply No. 74 (Provisional) Statutory Rules 1907, No. for 600 hands; and everything pertaining 114. to the permanent employment of those officials was stated by the Treasurer ar.d also by myself on two or three occasion'.; in the House.

It naturally is not quite as comprehensive as my statement; but it applies clearly enough to what I was referring. Speaking of the relations of the Colonial Office with Australia in particular, and the Dominions iri general--the relations which were discussed at the Conference, which have been, particularly in this State while it was a Colony, a frequent subject for discussionI took exception to their present character. The proposal that this Government submitted for the establishment of a connection between Conference and Conference bymeans of an office in which all the Dominions should be represented at one joint cost is our remedy.

That is why I have indicated at the present stage the nature of his proposition. The stipulation that these piece goods shall not weigh more than 4 ounces to the square yard is designed to rid us of a very troublesome position which has arisen in the past in connection with the administration of the Customs Department. Such a condition will prevent the use of a superabundance of wool, since the weight must be kept down. light dress materials? How would they be described ? for making up.light dresses for women and children, ancl sometimes clothing for men living in warm climate's. T think that honourable members will approve of what I propose to do. Much time has been devoted to this matter, and considerable information has been obtained. The proposal is in the direction of reducing in most cases the duty upon these imported piece goods, which stand in a somewhat different position from other items. The reason for the proposal to add the words "" rubbered waterproof cloth of any material "" is to afford better protection to the local industry for the manufacture of rubbered waterproof cloth. There has been a great deal of difficulty in deciding what is and what is not rubbered waterproof cloth. waterproof cloth trade are in opposition to this proposal, are they not? ' Sir WILLIAM. LYNE I do not know ; ancl I do not think that we should be influenced by such a consideration, provided that we are satisfied that the course proposed is a proper one to take. In such circumstances why should we be etuded solely by the desire of the trade ? They sometimes want something which it might not be right to concede. pose to do anything in"" relation to jute? the free list. At present woollen rubbered waterproof cloth is dutiable . under item 124 paragraph A, but cotton rubbered waterproof cloth can be dealt with only under the present sub-item 124E, at io per cent, or 5 per cent., according to the country of origin. As that is an anomalous position, the amalgamation as set out in the words of the amendment is necessary. I therefore move That after the letters ""n.e.i.,"" paragraph A, the following words be inserted :"" and rubbered waterproof cloth of any material."" use of the words "" of any material'"" is really a departure from this line. We understand the term "" woollen or containing wool,"" but we do not understand the proposed addition of the words ""of any material.""

54,Mr Fuller (Illawarra) [3.29],"I2. Local proofing would be impossible for the following reasons :cause it is done here. given. to determine whether or not they are sufficient. (a) The local proofing firms are our competitors in the trade of waterproof garments, and if they did our proofing would derive an unfair advantage over us, in knowing all our patterns, and what we were doing, generally speaking, besides which they would naturally give a preference to their own materials; furthermore, there would be nothing to prevent them making a prohibitive charge for the proofingwhenever it suited them to do so, knowing that we would be entirely in their hands (b) It would not be feasible for any one of us to start a .process of proofing cloth on account of the excessive cost of the necessary plant. An estimate from a ' reputable English firm , puts down the cost of a small plant (capable of proofing twenty-five pieces per day), at £3,000 ; this expenditure is exclusive of the import duties on the machinery and the erection of the buildings, &c. . {c) So rapid is the process of -waterproofing cloth, that it would not pay any manufacturer to start a factory for this purpose alone, for a small plant working constantly for two months could proof all the cloth used in Australia for twelve months.

The waterproof trade is at any time a very capricious one, owing to the uncertain cl'matic conditions and the droughty nature of Australia generally speaking, so that nb encouragement is afforded for expenditure of large sums for proofing plant. 4. We would respectfully submit that if cloth made waterproof with Indiarubber were made a special line with a duty of 15 per cent, ad val., it would afford an ample protection for firms proofing cloth locally, whose interests are guarded by item 124 (page 49 of the schedule), and we might mention that in New Zealand, a strong protectionist colony, waterproof cloth is actually admitted free of all duty. In conclusion, we earnestly press the claims of the large number of hands engaged in the It is not impossible, be waterproof garment making, as against the dozen or two who may be employed in the proofing process; and as indicated above, as the retention of the present duty pf 30 per cent, ad val. It will be for honourable members would make it quite impossible for us to carry on against the existing monopoly, we sincerely trust that you will see the vital importance of this matter to us and those we employ in the trade. The letter is signed by the firms whose names I have indicated. Considering the purposes for which this material is used, that the business gives employment to such a large number of hands, and that the establishment of a proofing business would mean the employment of so few in addition, I think the Committee ought seriously to consider the position. Waterproof cloth is really the raw material of an industry which gives a large amount of employment.

Of course, if the Minister is prepared to take that course I have nothing more to say. are 188 hands employed ira the manufacture of waterproof clothing in Victoria. Only a very few are employed in the manufactuie of the cloth. would require the employment of only a very few more of the latter to supply the whole of the Australian requirements. This is a question as between the industry of making up garments and of manufacturing waterproof cloth. is that whilst the makers of these garments carry on their business under Wages Board conditions the manufacturers of waterproof cloth would lae subject to no such regulations. posal it means wiping out the making-tip industry. I am astonished that some of the Victorian members have not taken note of this fact, because I do not think that there is any doubt that the effect of the proposal will be that the chief material employed in making up will not be obtained. proofed in this country ? here hands are employed in that industry, whereas there are 188 employed in the manufacture of waterproof clothing under Wages Board conditions.

T h a t is so It seems to me that the Committee are entitled to hear something from the Minister in answer to this letter. I find, on inquiry, that this question of waterproof clothing did not come before the Tariff Commission, and, therefore, we are bound now, as a Committee, to look into the matter for ourselves.

Unless the Minister, or the honourable member for It is evident that it South Sydney-wh o is now engaged in writing a letter, but who says that the statement placed before us cannot be true -is prepared to place some contrary evidence before the Committee, we have no alternative but to act, so far as we can, on this letter from the manufacturers.

By that means there would be a difference of. 10 per cent, between the duties on the made-up article and the piece goods respectively. This would meet the difficulty mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes. I am quite with the honourable member for South Sydney in taking up a rather sceptical attitude towards the letters and circulars so frequently addressed to honourable members. It is very embarrassing and confusing to honourable members to have conflicting sfatements put before them by ' manufacturers and importers. That is why I have so forcibly advocated following the Tariff Commission where they have had an opportunity of hearing evidence, on oath, from both sides, and of judging judicially between them. But the honourable member for South Sydney should notice that in this case no evidence af all was given to the Commission. We have nothing but this letter to guide us, and tire Minister either has no knowledge of the subject, or does not choose to put it before the Committee. of the imports? substantial. There is a big industry concerned. I do not think the honourable member for South Sydney does justice to the authors of the letter when he says that it is absurd on the face of it. They do not say that it is impossible to manufacture the material here, because they admit that it is done. They state that there is already at least one substantial firm manufacturing it, and that enough can be manufactured by from twelve to twenty men in two months to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is another raw material in the shape of the woollen or cotton fabric, in addition to tlie water-proof. Upon, that fabric the india rubber surface has to be placed. It is very probable that this can be done by machinery at a very rapid rate. made. The process is not very rapid. The number of men mentioned is ridiculously small. that the application of the india rubber to the fabric is done almost wholly by machinery under the guidance of one man. The honourable member for Illawarra has placed in my hands a schedule showing that the value of cloth-made water-proof imported has been as follows:-1902 , , £ 2 2 , 0 0 0; [206] 1 9°3> £ 3 > ° ° ° i 9 ° 4 . £ 5 3 > ° ' > and 1906, 2 I 00 ,£39,ooo -WhilstI regard with great scepticism these ex parte statements made by manufacturers on the one side and by importers on the other-alway s in their own interests and not too carefully drawn for the guidance of honourable members-the statement which has been put before the Committee is one to which there is practically no contradiction, and although it may appear'improbable, it is due to those who have made the statement for the' information of the Committee and addressed it to the Minister that it should be met by some authoritative counter-statement. If , as they say, the wafer-proof material can be made for the whole of the Commonwealth by such a small number of people, and the industry of manufacturing the cloth into garments is so substantial, we ought to be very careful before we dismiss off-handedly and without information their statement as to the hardship which will accrue to the four or five substantial firms engaged in the industry.

The writer saysI have the honour, by direction of the Adelaide Warehousemen's Association, to bring under notice the administrative effect of the proposed Tariff on some lines of textile goods in Tariff 'division 5, and the certainty of further complications with the items 108 and 118 passed by the House of Representatives on the 6th and Slh inst. respectively. [206]2 The administration of item 124F is such that unless it is taken out altogether or the list of articles extended in E, almost everything in the way of cotton piece goods will eventually f a l l under Fa higher duty than silk piece goods. I have only to mention that the Customs have decided in respect to some pocketings, ordinary cotton shirtings, cotton tweeds,' and the like, that because a microscopical examination or axi imaginative official mind traces a treated surface they are liable to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., an increase of 15 per cent. The Tariff Commission, as the result of an exI intend to reduce haustive inquiry, recommended items 124B and 124F should pay the same rate of duty as 124E, viz., 10 per cent, and 15 per cent.

Perhaps 15 per cent the former rate-wa s rather below what the manufacturers should get. But it must be remembered that they have been doing very well. The merchant tailors of Sydney are utterly opposed to any increase, and have passed a resolution to the effect that a duty of 30 per cent, on woollens is opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth, and that 15 per cent, will give sufficient protection to the Australian woollen manufacturers. ness of those who passed the resolution is importing. the proposed rates will crush out many tailoring establishments. I do not think that the Minister wishes to do that. import. so far as the honourable member in that belief. Another resolution of the tailors reads as followsThat since Australian woollen manufacturers are unable to fill requirements, we are of opinion that if this Tariff is passed inferior woollens will be imported into the Commonwealth. That is their opinion, which, of course, they are entitled to hold. I have in my hand one or two paragraphs in a communication from the 'Queensland Warehousemen's Association. After referring to the duty on woollen piece goods they state that the classification is not correct. They point out that a distinction ought to be made between piece goods used for men's clothing and piece goods used for women's dresses. They sayIn classing woollen piece goods a distinction should be drawn in goods that are made or can be made in Australia, and those which cannot t e produced under existing conditions. All agree, I think, that goods wihich we cannot produce) if not placed on the free list, should be allowed to come in at a very low rate of duty. The writers go on to savThe piece goods which can be made include Ivsavy tweeds and serges, chiefly for men's wear. We suggest a duty of 20 per cent, on this class. . . The goods which cannot be made may be describe'd generally as fine texture/ light weight all wool, woollen and silk, Or woollen and cotton mixtures used in making up of ladies' apparel or for lining men's apparel. They include fabrics in endless varieties of designs and colourings, which ever-changing fashion demands, and they are known as cashmeres, voiles, delaines, nun's veiling, fine twills, amazons and face cloths, Italians, Venetians, Sicilians, lustres, Bieges, Eoliennes, silk and woollen mixtures, Panama cloths, hopsacs, and similar goods under various names. Eor reasons well understood in the trade, many of these goods are not made in Great Britain, and the same reasons in a much greater degree will prevent their being made in Australia. The public taste demands these goods, and the Tariff cannot alter this. The high rate will hinder or prevent the making up in Australia of garments made up from these materials, the duty on ready-made articles being a very little more. I hope that the Minister will not ask the Committee to pass higher duties than 25 and 20 per cent, respectively. I am quite prepared to support those rates.. The honourable member for Angas has referred to the mixing of wool and cotton in the manufacture of piece goods. .1 have here a sample which the Ipswich Woollen Company sent to the honourable member for Moreton, who has been obliged to pay a visit to Queensland, and who otherwise would have, exhibited it to honourable members. I have had considerable experience in connection with this kind of ' industrv, and I assure the Committee that, I have not seen a better sample, than this one. The goods are guaranteed by the company to be all wool. They are quite prepared to allow their goods to be analyzed with a view to discover if any cotton has been mixed with the wool.

I hope that the Minister will consider this matter, and propose an amendment with the object of insuring that the whole of the work involved in the making of Australian cloth shall be carried out in Australia.

The honourable member who has moved this amendment must surely realize by this time that it is futile to attempt such a reduction. If , instead of doing that, he and those who think with .him would join with those who are more moderate than the ultra-protectionists and endeavour to come to an arrangement to support less drastic duties, we should get on with the Tariff much quicker .or four members who think that duties should be reduced considerably, they are entitled to express their opinion. Colonel FOXTON 'the honourable member, but to fight in order 'to be hopelessly beaten every time is futile. Personally, I am in favour of duties, of 25 per cent., and of 20 per cent, on goods imported from the United Kingdom. protectionist members of the Tariff Com-mission propose. Colonel FOXTON -The A division of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 per cent., and, as most of these goods come from the United Kingdom, it may be said that the Government have practically adopted that proposal. But I am not prepared to'go so high. I think .that a duty of 20 per cent, against the Old Country is ample. It is 5 per cent, more than we had under the old Queensland Tariff, under which the Ipswich Company was established. It is also 5 per cent, more than the duty under the old Federal Tariff. Under the circumstances, I think that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty would be sufficient protection, and' I intend to vote for that. not dispute the accuracy of the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle, but I deny that our woollen, factories, as a whole, use imported yarns. I have been in several woollen mills and tweed factories, and know that they use none but Australian wool for the manufacture of their tweeds. I hold in my hand a declaration-signe d before^ a Justice of the Peace-by Mr Robert Hogarth, proprietor of the Waverley WoollenM ill , Tasmania, in which he states that all his goods are made from pure Australian wool. He does not import any yarn. His factory has been established for thirty-three years. I have been through it several times, and have also been through several other mills which are conducted on the same principle. A number of honourable members went through some Victorian factories a little while ago, and are well aware that the process of manufacture includes dealing with fhe wool as it comes .off the sheep's back until it comes out in the form of the manufactured article. whole thing readied up for the parliamentary visitors? member for Hunter think that a factory If there are only three is established at a cost of several thousand pounds simply to be seen by. halfa-aozen members of Parliament?

He is to be congratulated on giving the Committee such information, which undoubtedly came from a good source. .£90,000 worth of yarn is imported. do not dispute the fact, but I object to the deductions which the honourable member sought to draw from it . deduction was, that because this yarn is imported, we ought not to protect our woollen industry. I hope that the honourable member was not serious in advancing that argument. with more thoroughness, I think that he would urge the Treasurer to insist upon -a good, substantial duty. We can make cloth; and I think we should make all the materials of which cloth is composed. A story runs through my mind in connection with the woollen industry in America. There, a writer was such an ardent free trader that he got quite indignant over what he deemed the ridiculous action of < the American Government in allowing dirty wool to be imported at a lower duty than was clean wool. That man quite forgot thatemployment was required in America -that Americans desired to have the clean: ing of the wool. But this man went f u r ther, and said fhat America was being ruined by the "" hoofed locusts,"" as he termed the sheep, who were said to be ruining the land.

I was delighted tohear the honourable member' for Brisbane say that woollen goods were manufactured within his State from Australian wool, and I have it on authority that all, or nearly all, the manufacturers in Australia make their own yarn. In England, the cloth makers do not need tp. make their 'own yarn, because it is turned' out by special mills. I must express my admiration for the -waly in -which the re-presentatives of Queensland fight for the He tells us that industries' of their State; and I desire to I put in a little plea for a woollen mill in New South Wales.

In important towns in New South Wales,' tailors are found to be without Australian tweeds, and customers are told that people w ill not buy them. What nonsense* it is to talk of people not buying goods which they have never seen ! Seeing that we produce all the raw material, the sooner we encourage the production of Australian tweeds, the sooner will people get good ancl cheap clothing in the place of imported shoddy. I agree with every word uttered by the honourable member for New England. Many years ago, in the United States, it was impossible to buy American cloth in any tailor's shop; customers were told that only imported goods were kept. The same thing is going on in Australia, and it would be worth our while to impose a duty of 15 to 20 per cent, to teach Australians to respect and love their own country. For my part,. I should make the duty prohibitive. member's hats made in Australia? hats I now wear are made at the DentonH a t Mills. goods of this kind are made in Australia, but the importing habit has prevailed so long that people are ashamed to tell their friends that they wear locally-manufactured articles-it is deemed a sort of disgrace to be dressed in Australian material. I would make the Tariff so high that people would be only too glad to try Australian goods, when, I am sure, they would never dispense with them. people who can afford to buy imported goods buy Australian goods ? all descendants of English, Scotch, Irish, German, and other people, who would climb a thirty-feet greasy pole to save a pound. Heretofore, the local manufacturers have had no chance; and now that we are putting on a Tariff, we ought to determine to make the people of Australia respect their own country. If we cannot make them respect it , we can make them obey its laws. M. McKay case? was not made in a day. McKay will come in time to recognise that, to be a Christian man he must do his Christian duty in a Christian country. We ought to impose a duty on every article that can be manufactured in Australia, and thus enable Australian manufacturers to pay Australian wages, based on civilized conditions. The differentiation ought to be high enough to enable local manufacturers to compete against the cheap-jack wages paid in foreign countries. That is the kind of Tariff that I shall vote for. I am following the Government throughout these proposals. I only hope that the Opposi-. tion, staunch free-traders as many of them, are, will, like Saul of Tarsus, f a l l clown in front of the great light of protection,; and thank God for their conversion.

222,Mr Maloney,"I want to prevent theagainst drawing false conclusions upon practical questions. We are living in a fool's paradise if we imagine that our woollen goods contain nothing but wool, especially in view of the report of the Tariff Commission that Victorian flannels in some cases contain as much as 81 per cent, of cotton. We have these very high duties claimed for Victorian products on the ground that the raw material from which they are made is on the spot. No greater fallacy was ever uttered, because if these' flannels or woollens contain so very large a percentage of cotton, that raw material comes from the United States of America. Some of us-and I include myself among the number, although I think I am not guiltv of the credulity which I am pointing out-ar e willing to put high duties on these goods on the strength of the old gag that the raw material is ""on the spot."" It is not on the spot. member for Fremantle has satisfied meas I think he must have satisfied every impartial mind in the Chamber-that no less than £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 worth of woollen yarn is imported into this country. Is it not a strange thing that in a country in which we are imposing these extraordinarily high duties, in order to encourage the production bf materials of which we imagine we have the raw material on the spot we are importing woollen yarn for the purpose? . wool ? pose it is.

When he first stated what was in the paper he was about to read, he was met with all sorts of ridiculous epithets; but when he went on to say that the statement he was about to make was confirmed and authenticated by the Comptroller of Customs honourable members seemed surprised to learn what he said. Whilst woollens and flannels locally manufactured contain this very large percentage of cotton, and a percentage, Avhether large or small, of imported yarn, we have woollen manufacturers inviting us to admit yarns free, in order that The honourable imported yarns may be used to a larger extent than at the present time.

It is not likelv that the amendment \vill be agreed to, but I think the Minister will find that a duty between that which he proposes and that suggested by the honourable member for Lang will be passed. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Lang, and, if it be not carried, for an amendment proposing the next lowest rate. honourable member for Parkes has given us a great deal of cry and very little wool.

I wish to put up a fight for Australian industries. It is a shame that They said they wished the we who produce wool in such large quantities are compelled to purchase our woollen goods from abroad. The honourable member has stated 'that cotton is used by Australian manufacturers. If we need cotton we should be .able to import it free of duty; we should be able to import free everything that we cannot make here. But I cannot understand those who profess to view these matters from an altruistic standpoint arguing in favour of such conditions as obtain in the older countries of the world. Do honourable members not 'know These industries have been estabthat those who work in factories at Home have to live in dog kennels, a family in field, and even in Edinburgh, families live in what are known as closes, which -sometimes occupy as much' as a square mile. Tenement houses, in rows of sixty, with spaces of 10 feet between them, sometimes accommodate a family to each room. Will it do Australia any good to assist the industries which give those people employment? What we should do is to build up industries in this country, and we can do so by imposing protective duties. Honourable members talk about the dearth of, and the need for increasing, population here. We now have an opportunity to increase it. Surely, if we can make anything, we can make woollen goods. It behoves us to try to do this, seeing that we need population-to get which we must provide employment-and that we are cut off from other parts of the'world. We, more than any other people, should busy ourselves in developing our resources so as to obtain some measure of independence. Are we to be ever the sucking child of Great Britain?

The honourable mem: ber for Parkes endeavoured, as usual, to depreciate. Australian productions; but, in speaking of the amount of cotton in Australian woollen goods, he failed to mention that the Tariff Commission recorded the opinion that the second set of samples obtained by the Customs Department was no more representative than the first set for the purposes of comparison, and that an exhaustive examination ""of imported flannels would, probably, disclose the fact that, on the whole, as much cotton is used in their manufacture as is used in the manufacture of the Australian article, while there is more shoddy in them. We are getting more shoddy and rubbish from abroad than we make here, because the devices for converting rags and tatters into cloth are better known elsewhere than they are here. We shall be able to control whatever industries we may establish here, the representation in Parliament being a registration of the sentiments of the community, and the public is against imposition and fraud being practised on either consumers or workers.

With regard to the manufacture of woollens, there is one aspect of the question which I desire to put before the Committee. A pound of wool, when shipped from Australia to the Old Country, is worth about is., but on its return in the shape of cloth is worth anything up to 12s., the whole of the -added value having been given to it abroad. The primary producer is not materially benefited by the exportation of his wool instead of its manufacture here. He would receive more assistance if Australian manufacturers bought more of it , and if , instead of being compelled to submit to the temporary derangement of markets at Home, he could obtain a certain market here, and have the additional value to which I have referred given to his product in Australia.

It has been stated frequently that they are unable to immediately supply the orders submitted to them. The mills find themselves m that position mainly owing to the restricted output which they have. members have said, and said wisely, that the real problem is the question of patterns.

That is not a fact, because I have seen very many patterns which have been originated in Australia at the suggestion, of those who supply fhe public with particular brands of tweeds.

They were conservative then, but they are prepared now to meet the popular demand, and the result undoubtedly will be a very much larger output. here for years. was made by an honourable member sitting on the front Opposition bench that no patterns have been made in Australia. I contradicted the statement at the time, and can assure honourable members, from: personal knowledge, that a number of men are engaged solely in the work of designing, ancl that it is being carried out under most satisfactory conditions. With respect to the duty wihich is asked for, I have made very eareful inquiries, and satisfied myself that there is no hope of the mills getting the proper machinery which is necessary not only to cope with the demand which will arise but with outside competition, which will undoubtedly exist, unless we can secure to our own people the greater part of their home market. stances, I intend to vote for the duty as proposed by the Government. must refer very briefly to the last two speeches.

If we cannot carry the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang, I hope that, at all events, the duty will be reduced, because the history of these duties is not encouraging.

In Australia, theyreceive from 30s. up to £ 2 . Layers receive 6s. 6d. per week, and other workers as little as 3s. n d . per week. suppose.

Macquarie is quite correct in bringing this matter before the Committee. I am prepared to meet the honourable member fairly and squarely in assisting in any effort to . improve the condition of the workers. We should try every method to prevent our workers being employed under similar conditions. Great Britain to-day is deplorable; and, much as we may desire to give a preference to goods imported from the Old Countrv, we must insure that our workmen and workwomen do not have to compete against the goods of those who pay_ their employees only 9s. a week, whilst our manufacturers pay them 32 s. sire to clear the air a little in regard to the construction placed by the"" leader of the Opposition upon what I said a little while ago. With that aptitude for which he is so famed, he twisted my remarks into a misrepresentation of my meaning..

The fanfare of the right honourable member-o r the. pyrotechnical display with which he favoured the Committee-were simply indulged in with a view of diverting the attention of honourable members from tiie solemn and sorryfacts which I brought under their notice. The right honourable member, I think, traduced, the dignity of the Committee when he proceeded to ridicule statements which showed how the life-blood, of human beings and the welfare of the nation are concerned in such facts as have been disclosed to honourable members. Then, again, the right honourable member twitted, me with placing secondary industries before primary industries-wit h putting the roof on before the foundation of the building is laid. But he knows better, than any one present how difficult it is to stimulate the primary industries of this country, thwarted as we are by landlordism and by the abominable land laws of the States. It is for that reason that we cannot deal with our primary industries as we can with our secondary industries. As we cannot legislate with regard to the land as I should like to see it dealt with, we are compelled to do what we can to develop our secondary industries.

338,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [6.14],"I deis weary of well doing? If the right honourable member had seized the opportunities which presented themselves to him in years gone by, Australia would have been in a better position than she is in today. He might have placed himself at the head of the democratic forces of this country, instead of attempting to block their path. Instead of endeavouring to keep back the march of democracy, he might have been the manWho makes by force-his merit known, And lives to clutch the golden keys, To mould a mighty State's decrees, And shape the whisper of the throne. But instead of that, we have him supporting a policy' which would degrade the worker, and put a stumbling block in the path of the young Australia party which is trying to improve the condition of the people. The right honourable member might surely find some more useful scope for the exercise of his abilities than in endeavouring to prevent us from doing what we desire to do for the development of Australia. Ring out a slowly dying cause, And ancient forms of party strife; Ring in the nobler modes of life With sweeter manners, purer laws. That is what I meant by the remarks to which the right honourable member has taken exception. I think that in laying down a policy for this country, it may be profitable to look to the condition of affairs that obtains in other countries. What Tariff has been found necessary there in order to establish their industries? In Canada, according to Kelly's Tariffs of the World, the duty on woollen clothing is from 25 to 35 per cent., and in the United States from 40 . to 50 per cent., while the duties in both France and Germany are very high. We are only a young country, and, in' laying the foundations of the Tariff, we ought to draw some valuable lessons from the experience of older countries. able member any figures showing the comparative production ? would be in favour of the country which produces least. not made on high prices, but on the general turnover. tralia have succeeded, in many instances, in making large fortunes, not because of excessive prices, but because of an immense turnover.

I thoroughly agree that we should avoid casting any reflection on the older countries, especially on Great Britain; but still we ought to profit by experience in our endeavour to secure better conditions in Australia. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 40 per cent, on clothing, but the Committee agreed to a duty of 40 per cent, for the general Tariff, and 35 per cent, as against Great Britain.

The Victorian witnesses before the Commission made very strong representations that the industry would go down unless the duties were restored to the rates at which they stood years ago under the Victorian Tariff. The .industry in Victoria had the advantage of very high protection for a great number of years. The men who shrieked out loudest for protective duties for the benefit of the Australian woollen industry were those Victorians who had had the advantage of high duties in the past, and it was only because the Victorian manufacturers approached those of Tasmania, The PostmasterSouth Australia, and New South Wales, that the latter fell into line with the request of the former for higher duties. As I stated before on the question of apparels and textiles, the Committee is entitled to know from the Treasurer why, in the first instance, he proposed a higher protective duty than the highest asked for by the manufacturers who came before the Commission.

The names of at least four mills which had gone out of existence under the Victorian Tariff were mentioned to the Commission. Does the evidence of Mr Grainger and other representatives of the Victorian woollen mills furnish any reason why the Committee should agree to the high duties now proposed by the Treasurer? On the contrary, even since the comparatively low duties in the first Commonwealth Tariff were imposed, the Victorian mills have been working full time, their employees are receiving to-day higher wages than ever they received during the whole previous existence of the mills, and everything, according to the evidence submitted to the Commission, shows that instead of agreeing to. a proposition for higher duties, we should, at any rate, grant none higher than those imposed by the Tariff of 1901. I wish to quote .figures to show the number of hands employed in the Victorian millsin given years. I quoted the same figures in connection with employment so far as apparel and textiles were concerned, but honourable members, and the public generally, ought to know these figures, because they show that as the duty decreased more hands were emploved in the woollen mills, not only of Victoria, but of Australia. They are as followKate of Year. 1878 11 per cent. ... 736 1881 1886 1887 1889 1890 33 per cent. 1892 ... 44 per cent. ... 552 There was an immediate reduction from 791 to 552 the moment the duty was increased by 11 per cent. member infer that the increase of the duty was the cause of the decrease in the number of hands employed ? need not look so self-satisfied. I know as well as he does that there was in Victoria a boom which burst, and I am prepared to ascribe as much to that cause as the honourable member is, but these facts appear right through the figures long before we come to the boom time. 1893 1895 1899 27I per cent.

It is' marvellous that under the lowest duty which has been applied to the industry for many years, as compared with duties nearly four' times as high, there has been such an increasing number of operatives employed in those mills. I put that contention forward, and claim that the Treasurer, or someother member of the Ministry, is entitled to answer it.

We had evidence from Mr C. E . Moore, a South Australian witness, that the progress of the industry in that State was ;not due to the Tariff at all. They found 'that they had been carrying on the business under an old and obsolete system, and they changed their system, with the result that 'to-day in South Australia Mr Moore, the principal woollen manufacturer in the 'State, is carrying on the industry successf u l l y , and, according to his own evidence, fus success is not to be attributed to the 'duty.

He puts it down, not to duties, but to changes of methods of manufacture. So far as Tasmania is concerned, the manu""facturers there have stated that a duty of 20 per cent, is high enough for them, and that they do not desire the high rate asked for by the Victorian manufacturers. obsolete machinery who want protection. generally must admit that the Tasmanian factories are flourishing and prosperous. It has been said in this chamber, and oublished in the press, that, in consequence of the substitution of the old Commonwealth duty of 15 per cent, for the Victorian duty, the Victorian mills largely changed their output from tweeds to flannels ; but statistics do not bear out that assertion, because there was a large falling off in the production of tweeds in Victoria more than a year before the Commonwealth Tariff was introduced, the Victorian out^put of tweeds in 1899 being 1,051,832 yards, and in 1900, only 971,267 yards. eration in 1899, and anticipated then the destruction of her industries. -in for the production of worsteds, because of the large bonus offered by the Victorian Government for the manufacture of that article. thoroughlv conversant with the relations No . In view of the between the Victorian Government and the local woollen mills, but fhe figures which I have quoted disprove the assertion-that it was in consequence of the introduction of the first Commonwealth Tariff that the Victorian mills began to produce flannels rather than tweeds. As a matter of fact, the mills now manufacturing flannels have more work to do than .they can perform, and will not take orders, commissions given to them six to twelve months ago being yet unexecuted. What justification is there then for the proposed increase of duty ? The honourable members for Batman and Macquarie spoke of the difference between Ihe rates of wages here and those prevailing in the Old Country. I shall not deal with what was said about pauper labour, because those statements have been finally answered. According to the Statistical Register of New South Wales, the rates of wages in that State are similar to those in Victoria, the average wage being 20s. 5d. I am giving honourable in New South Wales as against 20s: 9d. in Victoria. Since Federation, the tendency has been for wages to f a l l in New South Wales, while in Victoria, under the operation of the Wages Boards, they have risen slightly. Still, we may take it that in the two States the prevailing rates are practically the same. Examined on the subject' of"" rates of wages in the woollen industry It is those who use in the Old Country, Mr C. J. Ripley, a Sydney warehouse manager, gave evidence which the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission were unable to upset. He saidYou have been informed that Australian, rates of wages are 50 per cent, higher than those ruling in Great Britain, but it is not so. Two years ago I was speaking to some of the largest manufacturers in Great Britain, who showed me their wages sheets, and I am convinced that there are plenty of mills turning out the same kind of material as is made in Australia, whose rates of wages are not 10 per cent, below the Australian rates. The hours of labour in this industry are in Australia forty-eight, and in Great Britain fifty-six per week, the-difference being equivalent to eight weeks in the year. The free-trade members of the Tariff Commission, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, reported thatIn every £100 worth of goods produced in 'Australia the value of the labour is £30 as against ^20 paid by the British manufacturer. Therefore,' on an extreme estimate, the total Australian labour disability is not more than io per cent, of the value of the goods produced.",46,Brown Ha S The Honor But The Proposal Seems Worthy Of Favorable

398,Mr Fuller,"I do not pretend to bet u t t in g it in another way, from a protectionist stand-point, and ignoring the natural protection of freights, a duty of 10 per cent, on the goods in question would equalize all the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer in respect of higher wages and shorter hours. The protectionists who came before the Commission admitted that the manufacturers here enjoy a high degree of natural protection, especially in connection with blankets, by reason of the freight, cartage, insurance, and other charges which, have to be borne by importations, so that with the 15 per cent, given by the former Tariff, their total protection amounted to at least 40 per cent. Yet the Minister, without the slightest explanation, has asked the Committee to increase the duty by 15 per cent. The whole of the evidence which was given to the Tariff .Commission does not justify for a moment any proposal to increase the duty of 40 per cent. On the contrary, it shows that our woollen mills are in a flourishing and prosperous condition.. want establishing. stand up and give a reason for granting any more protection. As I am reminded by my honourable friend, the woollen mills do not want establishing, but are in existence and doing well. then, is there for the higher duty proposed? I do not wish to go into the various matters which I discussed in connection with the manufacture of blankets. alleged disabilities in connection with the manufacture of woollen, goods applied in connection with the manufacture of blankets, which is part of our woollen industry. There were enumerated five disabilities, which I shall state shortly. In the first place, it was claimed that, with regard to the buying of the raw material, the conditions here are unfavorable. Now, is there any unfavorable condition in that respect, so far as the Australian woollen manufacturer is concerned ? Has a single honourable member to-night referred to that in any way ? the Ministerial side of the chamber who can stand up and prove that an Australian manufacturer is placed ""in an unfavorable position as compared with his English competitor ? the evidence, except in the case of one South Australian manufacturer. Does not the honourable member think that? evidence shows that, so fa r as the purchasing of the raw material is concerned, our manufacturers occupy a more favorable position. Certainly, when we remember that the English manufacturers get their wool from Australia to a very large extent, have to pay ocean freights, insurance rates and all the other charges incidental to its transportation, have to manufacture the. wopl, and pay all the various charges on"" the transport of the manufactured article to Australia, it will be recognised, I think, that that natural protection against the. British competitor ought to be sufficient for any manufacturer in Australia. It has also been claimed, on behalf of the Australian' manufacturer, that he has to pay higher wages to men who, in their turn, work shorter hours. I have shown fro m the figures I have quoted that the total disability in connection with those two items is j i o per cent. 2 per cent, for equipment, 12 per cent, is the total disability under which the AusI ask the Minister to tralian manufacturer labours. It was also claimed that he is handicapped by local prejudice. That is said to be a great factor against the use of Australian goods.

Outside the manufacturing classes which exist in our large towns, and live under good conditions, and whose emplo)'es enjoy all the advantages of social life, do not honourable members think that we ought to have some regard for the numerous consumers in Australia?

Are those men to receive no consideration from the Committee? after time that the men who are developing the industries which have made Australia what she is, have received very scant sympathy indeed, and that the whole consideration has been given to putting on high duties in order to make our rich manufacturers richer than they are, to put money into the pockets of men who, when they went before the Tariff Commission, and were subjected to cross-examination , were not able to substantiate their claim, and were afraid to produce their balance sheets for inspection. the position which they would have us believe they occupy, they would have been only too willing to allow us to see their balance-sheets, and prove that they were in a languishing or strangled condition.

It proposes an increase of 5 per cent, against the foreigner, whilst the duty in regard to the United Kingdom would be the same as under the old Tariff. Perhaps honourable members would like me to indicate to what goods the amendment will applv. I will not attempt to explain them; I will simply give the names of the goods. They are-Bengalines , cashmeres, cashmerettes, cheviots, clan tartans, crepalines, cordehines, chenilles, crepe de Chine, dress, serges, dress tweeds, delaines, French flannels, hopsacks, lustres, nun's veiling, Silicians, taffetas, voiles, and winseys. These goods all contain more or less wool.

But in the former case the weight of the stuff is reckoned at 6 oz. for the square yard, which admits of a larger range of material than in the United States. In Canada the duty is 17^ per cent, as preference to the United Kingdom, the intermediate duty is 22J per cent., and the duty against the outside world is 25 per cent.

I then asked to see some Australian tweeds or serges for men's suitings, and was offered a choice of more than a hundred very attractive patterns of beautifully finished tweed. Buckley and Nunn were also unable to give me anything for my own wear, but would make me up anything from their stock of men's tweeds. But I want something cool and light, and also less expensive than the men's stuff, although it seemed to me to be excellent value for the price asked. So, not being able to afford the really good Australian product, there is nothing left me, but to buy a woollen material, .which never has been, and most likely never will be, made here, and pay the extra cost. I did not confine my inquiries to the city shops, I tried Geo. Stirling and Sons, and Love andLewis, in Richmond, so as to get a fairly representative idea of how. all sorts and conditions of women fare under the Tariff. .At the last-named place, I was shown dress lengths, of which an enormous quantity are sold, and the price has ad'vanced from 7s. 6d. lo ios. With reference to the dress stuffs question, it appears that because our mills have been able lo turn out an excellent suiting for men which pays them well, every woman in the Commonwealth is to be penalized, though she is not even given the chance of refusing the local product. The reasons given for the infinitesimal output are as follows :-The fashions change so rapidly, that it is only the great European manufacturers, -with their enormous production, and practically world wide markets, who can afford the expense . involved in the multiplicity of patterns, designs, and colours, which have become a recognised necessity of even the lowest priced goods. America, in 1905, imported from Great Britain and Europe 45,000,000 square yards of dress material, and as her fiscal policy cannot possibly be construed into a leaning towards foreign products at the expense of her home industries, this fact may reasonably be considered to have some bearing on our Tariff. manager assures me that the Albion Mills' representatives f u l ly recognise the fact that in the interests of the wage-earners there ought to be a difference in the duty upqn men's tweeds and women's dress stuffs, in favour of the latter, and more, they are prepared to support such a proposition. I am sending; in concrete form, the Tesponse to my'request at Buckley's for patterns. The Australian material is not procurable, except in the shape of a suiting tweed, whilst the choice offered by the imported goods speaks for itself. My observations, necessarily limited as they have ""been to a couple of hours' time, point strongly to one conclusion. The retailers are practically unaffected by the duty. Clothes will continue to be bought, and the woman who goes A shopping with 20s. of her husband's wages in her purse will hand it over just the same. The difference will be that she will get very much less for it than she used, which inevitably means, in the case of diminutive incomes remaining stationary, much real hardship and privation. ber mean to say that the Geelong mills cannot turn out women's dress goods ? They could not take my order, had Geelong mills cannot turn out ladies' dress goods, but they cannot turn out the variety that fashion dictates. Fashion is queen; and I suppose there as many patterns as there are inhabitants of the United Kingdom. None of the materials to which I refer could possibly be manufactured in Australia. The question of the duty on these goods is so involved with the woollen industry as to necessitate its discussion in connection with the conditions now prevailing in that trade. On Saturday last, I went over the Albion and Union Mills, Geelong. The former turns out travelling rugs and tweeds, the latter confines itself to the manufacture of blankets and flannels. Both establishments are making additions to their buildings, for the installation pf new plant. The manager of the UnionM ill informed me that he did not in the least fear the competition of the imported article; that a steadily increasing demand for his goods had set in, and his mill is working at high pressure to fill orders. The duty just agreed upon, from his po'nt of view, is eminently satisfactory. At the AlbionM ill , an immense variety of men's tweeds were in process of making, and the manager told me that every six months between two and three thouspnd new patterns and designs were originated and made up. I asked what he could show me that would do for dress material, and he produced a pattern of a coarse, loosely woven white serge, suitable for seaside wear, as the so.le product of his recognition of women's sartorial needs. When, however, he showed me the process of manufacture, and explained to me the time, expense, and labour involved in the setting of a pattern, I did not wonder at his preference for making men's suitings. He lold me that the manufacturers in the European centres, holding, as they do, the trade of the world in dress fabrics, are able to turn out, comparatively speaking, a mile of stuff, where an inch would suffice in Australia. And that is all the difference between profit and loss. At Buckley and Nunn's the best, he could not expect to sell more than fifty yards of each pattern he made, and the expense of altering his cear every time he put on a fresh design would be prohibitive. This confirmed what I had been told by Buckley and Nunn's manager, and I then inquired what chance there was of fine cloths such as are used for opera coats and mantles being made here. He said, "" None, for many a year to come."" As to Astrakhans, sealettes, and materials which are extensively used for trimmings, he was"" emphatically of the same opinion.

This case .affords an instructive example to us of an Australian lady anxious to wear an Australian dress, but unable to obtain a suitable material owing to a number of trade difficulties, which even the most enterprising and intelligent manufacturers cannot overcome. Indeed, it is well known that manufacturers, even in the Mother Country, with their marvellous powers, cannot compete with Continental countries in certain lines. It was proposed by the Government to impose a duty of 30 per cent, on dress materials of a. kind which could not possibly be made here-thereb v placing a heavy handicap upon the women of Australia. This is a class of light dress stuff which is absolutely necessary in this warm climate. How could we expect the women of Australia to wear Colonial tweeds on a summer day like this? Even the Treasurer has been ill all day in consequence of the suit that he is wearing. The honourable member for Parkes, who has a new suit of Colonial tweed, has been suffering in like manner. It is a grand material, but a little heavy for summer. I am glad that this proposition has been made, and that tbe Government .have accepted it. sire to propose an amendment to make these goods free of duty. I have listened with the greatest possible pleasure to the honourable member for Melbourne, who has. made out a very strong case for the articles to be free.

I looked with apprehension upon the prospect of Australian labour competing with the labour of Belgium, and with labour even in the Mother Country, which-accordin g to the statements made by honourable members this evening-is paid an altogether inadequate wage.

He will gain a very unenviable reputation very soon. I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier. I cannot for the life of me understand what possible excuse a protectionist Government can find for proposing the imposition of such duties as these, nor can I discover what excuse a free-trader can offer for voting for them; nor, further, what possible excuse the members of the party to which I belong can put forward for doing so. I see absolutely no justification for the proposal. It was stated before the Tariff Commission and in this House, and it is very obvious, that it is quite impossible to produce these goods in Australia in any extent or variety, whilst they must be regarded as. the raw materials of a dozen or more industries. They are. necessaries to, I suppose, ninety-nine one-hundredths of the population of the Commonwealth. To impose such a burden as was contemplated by the Government in submitting duties of 35 and 30 per cent, on these goods is, on the face of it, outrageous. Now the Treasurer says that he is prepared to reduce the proposed duties to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. The duty can be proposed for no other purpose in the world than that of raising revenue, and I venture to say the honourable gentleman will raise abundant revenue from his so-cailled protective duties. It is one of the most astounding things in the history of economics, and especially in the so-called non-experimental legislation, that it is impossible to put duties up sufficiently high to prevent the importation of certain articles. Let honourable members consider the revenue that is derived through the Customs of the United States of America, where the duties imposed are, as the Treasurer told us the other night, like grown men compared to children when contrasted with the duties imposed under our Tariff.

When ever now I have been told that a duty is merely revenue producing, I have voted for the lowest possible rate. The Treasurer has admitted that the articles to which this duty applies, cannot be manufactured here, and so, too, ihas the honourable member for Melbourne, a protectionist of protectionists, who has been referred to by the Postmaster-General, himself a leading protectionist, as one of the moat scientific and able protectionists in Australia. being so, I appeal to those protectionists who on the platform have again and again stated that they are prepared to allow to come here free goods which cannot be. manufactured in Australia, to vote to allow these, goods to be admitted free. The honourable member for East Sydney has pointed out on many occasions that the burden of high duties falls mainly on the shoulders of the poor, and in days gone by, it was his great triumph that he was able to largely reincrease? move them, and, by imposing direct taxation, to make the rich bear their share. I am glad that to-day he is prepared to take similar action, and to l if t a burden from the poor, Tariff was to cause the bonds to become even, I take it , at the risk of allowing the imposition of direct taxation. not concerned with the motives of honourable members who vote for low duties, or for the remission of duties to deplete the revenue. If they can get a majority of the electors to agree to some policy which they favour, they will be able to give effect to it , whatever the state of the revenue, while if they cannot secure a majority, eifect cannot be given to it. But in any case, no one need have any anxiety for the revenue. Labour Party, and regarded the depletion 'of the revenue as the shortest road to direct taxation, I should not vote steadily fov rates which will increase our Customs returns by £2,000,000 a year, which seems to be the probable result of' this Tariff. Members of that party may sincerely believe that by increasing duties they will diminish revenue; but the experience of the United States of America, which is very instructive on this point, is that, notwithstanding rates almost twice as high as the highest here proposed, the Customs returns became so enormous that the authorities did not know what to do with the money, with the result that their infamous pensions system was established, 150,000,000 dollars to 200,000,000 dollars a year are being paid to the grandchildren of those who fought in the war forty vears ago, and there are now more pensioners than there were ten years after the war» system is not so bad as the Victorian Public Service pensions system. must be a very bad one. In my opinion, judging by the immediate results, the effect of this Tariff wihich the Labour Partv is That supporting will be to give an overflowing Treasury. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No . to a probable increase of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 a year. The Treasurer, in introducing the Tariff, estimated an increase of .£986,000 to commence with. Mr W. H. IRVINE I s it possible at this stage to correctly estimate the probable judgment, these high duties will prove veryfruitful. The immediate effect of the congested. A t the present time, merchants are taking out of bond as little as possible, hoping that the rates proposed by the Government will be reduced, so that the -normal revenue will be larger than that which we are now getting. The bonds are now crammed almost to bursting point, be' cause merchants are clearing only what they absolutely require for immediate use. In view of this probable large increase of revenue, a loss of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 need not be ' seriously considered. The women and children of Australia are being cruelly If I were a member of the taxed, and in this instance free-traders and protectionists can honestly join in an attempt to lighten their burden. I do not care how poor a man is, he likes to see his wife and children dressed, not only decently, but with a certain amount of taste. Surely that is a laudable and natural feeling. Surely we want to see the masses dressed tastefully and well. Why should this be the luxury and prerogative of persons who have an abundance of money, .and can buy the more expensive forms of dress material? It appears that this is a cheap, seasonable material, which is capable of producing ai becoming raiment.

The honourable member for Bass has said that the Commonwealth has been built up under a protective or revenue-producing Tariff. the Treasurer came into the House to destroy that Tariff. every-day "" shandy-gaff ' protectionist, and that he 1 came here to establish protection on a scientific and glorified basis. From time to time he advocates a duty of 40, or 30, or 25 per cent., and if he had his way he would propose still higher duties. Therefore, the Treasurer wants to destroy the Tariff of which the honourable member for Bass is so proud. He comes, here now for the purpose of promoting protection and destroying a revenue Tariff. mind him that at the last election he was not averse, if necessary,, to imposing a tax on the unimproved value of land for certain purposes, and I was very glad to hear it. I do not know that he is averse to direct taxation in other forms; I am not, and never have been. A great many other honourable members are in exactly the same position. When the honourable gentleman gets up, and says that this duty is proposed, not for protective purposes, but simply for revenue purposes, I claim the vote of every honourable member who was not returned on a revenue Tariff basis. In view of that statement, every, honourable member of that class must vote directly with the honourable member for Barrier. It is clear that no honourable member who believes in direct taxation can for a moment cast his vote in favour of an item when the honourable member for Bass has declared that the very purpose for which he wants it is not to build up protection, but to get revenue. That destroys the very purpose for which we, as a party, came into Parliament. It destroys the very purpose for which the Treasurer and his party came He says that this duty will not establish an industry, but will raise revenue. is the last method of raising money for which I shall vote.

Treasurer' should certainly take into consideration the duty that has been imposed upon silk used by umbrella workers. If we retain the rate which was agreed to the other night, when a majority of honourable members were under the impression that the item had been postponed, the manufacturers of umbrellas will be very seriously handicapped. It may be suggested that the the words ""' Sealette and Cloths imitating Furs, difficulty can be remedied by allowing silk Astrakans"" be inserted, and after the word which is cut in bond to be admitted free.

It seems to me that he is proposing to insert in paragraph D some goods which are included in paragraph E, and dutiable under that paragraph at 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. By placing them in paragraph D, the honourable member would render them liable to duties of 20 and 15 per cent., and I am sure that is not what he desires.

If ' the amendment were'accepted, all the cloths which it covers, and which are made of cotton, would be subject to a higher duty than under the item as it stands.

They would not come into competition with any goods manufactured here, and the better classes of Italian cloth are made almost wholly, of wool.

It is some years since I was associated with importing, but I know that lustres, lustrines, and similar materials used for linings, are sometimes called Italians. These materials were, under the old Tariff, dutiable at a lpw rate, in order to assist the local makers of ' clothing. They are now dutiable at 5 per cent., but, if put under some other heading, they may have to pay a higher rate.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE Committee to deal with this proposal, and with two others, one of which relates to piece goods other than woollens or silks, and deals really with flannelette. As soon as we have disposed of the item relating to piece goods, I shall be prepared to consent to progress being reported. should have been glad had the Treasurer seen fit to agree to the request that progress be reported. It is all very well for those who live in Melbourne to urge fhat we should go on, but, having regard to the fact that many of us were travelling last night, I think it is only fair that the Government should be prepared to agree at this hour to an adjournment. A t the same time, I am willing to remain here a little longer. such a proposition. I would remind honourable members that this is a proposal to tax the poor people of this country to the extent of ,£166,000 per annum. If it were proposed to impose a land tax, which would yield that amount of revenue, we should have a good deal of opposition from some honourable members who are inclined to let this item go. I hope that cotton and linen, as well as jute, will be placed on the free list. This is a purely revenue producing duty. Not an ounce of cotton or linen material is produced in 'Australia. Ipswich which is producing some cotton goods. made in Australia, 10 per cent, is not a much higher duty if it is to be protective in its incidence. But this is only a revenue producing duty. I venture to say fhat the effect of a duty of 10 per cent, will be to raise the cost of these articles to the consumer.. The English manufacturers will printing paper is concerned, within . twenty-four hours of a preference of 5 per cent, being given to the English manufacJute used for turer, it was cabled out that the price was to be raised 5 per cent. In regard to linens, there is practically no competition outside England, and consequently the English manufacturer will have so much the better opportunity of raising prices. If linens are placed upon the free list, the tendency will be for more shirts to be made. I wish the here. Already the Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria has publicly announced that a shirt was made in Australia that fitted him and was suitable for his purposes. That gives hope of the establishment, of a very large shirt-making industry. The cheaper the linen the easier it will be to make shirts in Australia. there is an item in the Tariff about which the members of the Labour Party should raise an outcry it is this duty on cottons and linens, which includes dungaree and corduroy. In the northern districts of Australia, tihe people derive the greatest benefit from wearing linen suits in the hot weather. The goods are brought out very cheaply, and can be obtained at a very low price. The effect of this duty will be to raise the cost to the consumer considerably. Other goods affected are denims, which It is very easy to make arc largely used by working men, like painters, to protect their clothes. If any item should be on the free list, it is this. that there is a great responsibility resting on protectionists in this matter. The new Tariff has occasioned a certain amount of outcry in the country, and for my own part I am not inclined to vote for duties which are not of a protective character. . I do not believe in voting for revenue duties which are advocated by free-traders. ' I think, moreover, that in the absence of internal competition, the raising of the duty from 5 to 10 per cent, against the. foreigner will mean that the cotton and linen manufacturers of England who, at present, work upon a margin of only 2J per cent, will be able to exclude the foreigner from the marI f linens can be ket altogether, and we shall, consequentlv, be at the mercy of British manufacturers high enough.'

Already the scope and range of the Tariff has been so wide and expansive as to make it just as much a revenue Tariff as it is a protectionist Tariff. The framers of the Tariff seem to have had revenue in their minds as much, if not more, than the protection of an Australian industry. Therefore we could very well afford to abandon this duty, affecting, as' it does, so large (Parramatta) a number of the poorer classes of the community. The proposalbefore us is just another instance of sham preference to Great Britain. We are told by the honourable member for Barrier that there is of imports from foreign countries, but I venture to say that a preference of 5 per cent, will not Have any appreciable effect I think I only make a on these importations. The duty will only have the effect of making it more difficult for the people to obtain the goods, while it will not give Great Britain and her cotton industry one pound's worth more. In my judgment, even if we make this Tariff protective, there is no need, in addition, to make it bear more heavily on the people of this country who use these articles. member does not favour a revenue duty?item, in regard to which I should be prepared to abolish the duty so far as Bri tish imports are concerned. I do not think that the matter need be delayed tomorrow. Sir WILLIAM LYNE W ill the honourable ' member agree to a vote being taken within' an hour of the House meeting to-morrow ? concerned, I will allow it to be taken within half-an-hour. All I wanted was to have the vote taken in a fuller Committee. I made a reasonable request to the honourable member, and he ought to have met it at once. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.46] I am very anxious to make more rapid progress with the Tariff. It is heart-breaking to have two or three items These goods debated all day and then make no advance of any moment. If we do not go faster than -we have been going, Heaven knows how long it will take. I understand from the deputy leader of the Opposition that he will exert his influence to. allow a vote to be taken on this item within an hour of the House meeting to-morrow. Progress reported.
