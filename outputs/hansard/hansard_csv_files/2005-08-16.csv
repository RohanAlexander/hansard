(2) Can the Minister confirm that aircraft refuellers, including tanker crew, and the wives of personnel are also experiencing health problems as a result of the negligent OH&S practices. (3) When will the Government take action to assist these people and their families by properly compensating them for their illnesses and for their inability to be employed because of these illnesses. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) A Board of Inquiry convened by the Chief of Air Force reported in July 2001 on a number of OH&S issues associated with the deseal/reseal programs. The report was made available to the public. Fifty-two recommendations were made, which were accepted and have been acted on. (2) The results of the Study of Health Outcomes in Aircraft Maintenance Personnel do suggest an association with exposure and a number of health conditions. However, these conditions are also prevalent among the general community. Therefore, it is important to recognise that these findings only highlight risks associated with such exposure and individuals should not assume that these risks have resulted in the onset of any health conditions they may be experiencing. (3) All current serving Australian Defence Force personnel have access to medical services through Defence Health Services and compensation through the Military and Compensation Scheme. Those who believe they have an injury or illness relating to their service should lodge a claim with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Queensland civilian contractors should contact Queensland WorkCover. National Security Hotline (Question No. 689) (1) How is information received on the National Security Hotline stored. (2) Are there procedures providing for information to be checked against state criminal investigation databases.

Information received is entered into the National Security Hotline database and original hard copies are classified confidential and stored in an approved C Class container in accordance with departmental guidelines for the storage of classified material.

171,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anThe Guidelines for the programme are set out in two parts, (a) for residential and (b) community buildings. Cash rebates are available for grid-connected or stand-alone photovoltaic systems. The current rebate level for new systems is $4 per peak watt, capped at $4,000 per residential system and $8,000 per community building system. A lesser amount of $2.50 per peak watt of output is available to extend existing systems, up to a total of $2,500. In addition there is a Developer component which has been run through a tender process. A. Residential Guidelines Eligible systems PVRP rebates will be available for residential PV systems that can be either grid connected or stand-alone. Equipment requirements Major equipment items included in the application (PV modules, inverters, battery regulators and batteries) must be new equipment and not second-hand. Applicants seeking to extend existing systems should check first with the relevant State authority or the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) as appropriate. Installation at owner’s principal place of residence The PV system must be installed at the applicant’s (owner’s) principal place of residence as shown on the electoral roll. The Commonwealth will only fund one rebate per residence. An applicant may qualify for a rebate for a new house under construction and should check with the relevant State authority or AGO as appropriate. Rebates are payable on owner occupied houses and owner occupied units within a body corporate. Rebates are also payable on owner occupied transportable homes, provided the owner occupier owns the land, or is a long term lessee of the site (minimum of five years). Ownership must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the State authority. Joint Ownership of PV Systems The applicant must be the owner of the PV system that is the subject of the application. The AGO will consider an applicant to be the owner of a PV system where: (a) the applicant is the sole owner of the entire PV system; or (b) where the applicant is: (i) the sole owner of the PV panels attached to his or her residence; and (ii) a part owner of all other equipment comprising the PV system in circumstances where the AGO considers joint ownership of equipment to be appropriate (for example, in situations where owners of strata title units install a single large inverter on one building). The applicant must satisfy the AGO or, where appropriate, the State Agency, of the ownership requirements set out above and that it will continue to meet those ownership requirements for a minimum of five years. The AGO and the State Agency reserve the right to reject any applications that the Agency considers, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not meet the ownership requirements set out above. Competent designer and installer To be eligible for a rebate the applicant must be able to show that the person who will carry out the PV installation is suitably qualified and experienced in accordance with this condition. Such a person will usually be accredited (full or provisional) for design and installation by the Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE). Applicants should check this with the relevant State authority or AGO as appropriate. System design requirements AS4509 for stand alone systems and AS 4777 for grid-connected systems must be followed and the person designing the system must be BCSE accredited. Warranty The Supplier should provide a ten-year performance statement setting out agreed load and other system parameters. A minimum ten year performance warranty must be offered on solar panels installed as part of the system. A minimum two-year maintenance contract should also be offered. The onus is on the new owner of the PV system to obtain a warranty from the Supplier. Wherever possible, applicants should seek more than one quote for the supply and installation of the system. Required standards There are required safety standards for stand-alone and grid-connected systems and all of these standards must be met. They include AS 4509 for stand-alone power systems and AS 4777 for gridconnected systems. System installation must meet all relevant standards, building codes and local government requirements. B. Community Guidelines Equipment requirements Major equipment items included in the application (PV modules, inverters etc.) must be new equipment and not second-hand.

defined in the tables for each financial year, refers to a unique service reference number that received funding at some stage during the respective financial years. Duplicate service names may exist where services transferred, resulting in the creation of a new service reference number, within the Child Care Operator System (COS), for the newly transferred service. The old and new services involved in the transfer are treated as separate services (each has the same service name but they have different service reference numbers). (2) Funding data for 2004-05 refers to the period July 2004 to May 2005. Source: FaCS State and Territory Offices. Family Initiatives (Question No. 1133) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Does the (a) Department of Family and Community Affairs (FACS) and (b) Office for Women collect and analyse data on employment conditions (eg the availability of maternity leave, sick leave, carer’s leave) for casual workers and, in particular, for women; if not, why not. (2) What policy initiatives have been developed to encourage more family friendly workplaces in the private sector. (3) What are the Government’s main priorities to help families achieve a better work/family balance. (4) What is the Government doing in relation to employers to help families achieve a better work/family balance. (5) What are the main barriers or problems facing employees who want to change their work/family balance. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) and (b) The Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), which includes the Office for Women (OfW), commissions a range of research, which, while not necessarily focusing on em-",140,Limited Kds Questions In Writing
173,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followployment conditions, can contain some data on casual employees and women. However, primary responsibility for collecting workplace data rests with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR). (2) Australia’s workplace arrangements, taxation and the integrated social support systems work in a complementary way to provide a comprehensive system of support for families from the time of birth of a child, and ensure that support for families is broad-based, practical and long term. The Howard Government has introduced a range of policies to encourage more family friendly workplaces. The Australian Government has also supported and promoted extensive public debate about work and family issues including balancing work and family responsibilities. This has led to increased public awareness of options and benefits, including increased employer flexibility around hours of work, starting and finishing times and part-time employment. (3) Australia’s strong economic position, continuing low inflation and low interest rates are key contributors to supporting families’ well-being. This has led to growth in real wages, employment and productivity. The Australian Government’s responsibility is to ensure broad economic and social policy settings provide an environment where families have the best opportunity to realise their goals and make their own choices in balancing work and family. The Australian Government has provided unprecedented support of $21 billion towards payments like Family Tax Benefit, Maternity Allowance, Child Care Benefit and Parenting Payment to help families with this choice. (4) The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides the basis for a flexible workplace relations system that provides choice for working parents. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations produces a range of resources to promote awareness and understanding of work and family issues and the range of flexibilities offered through the workplace relations system. (5) The Australian Government seeks to assist families to make choices around work and family that best meet their aspirations, needs and circumstances. Employees wishing to change their work/family balance will face different issues depending on their individual circumstances. Child Care (Question No. 1134) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) How many (a) long day care (LDC) and (b) after school centres are operating legally but do not have CCB-funded places. (2) For each electoral division, what is the average level of Commonwealth subsidy (other than CCB) given to LDC services. (3) Can the Minister explain why the Long Day Care Incentive Scheme is available only to providers for long day care centres in rural and outer metropolitan areas and not also available in inner metropolitan areas where there is a shortage of places. (5) Has the Government considered expanding the Long Day Care Incentive Scheme to apply to any area where there is demonstrable, chronic undersupply. (6) What Commonwealth subsidies are available to prospective LDC providers in inner metropolitan areas. (7) Is the Government planning to address unmet demand for child care in inner metropolitan areas; if so, what are the details. (8) For each electoral division, how many set-up assistance grants have been (a) awarded and (b) rejected since July 2004. (9) What is the application and approval cycle for the Minor Capital Upgrading grants and when is funding made available. (10) What are the selection criteria for the Minor Capital Upgrading fund and will the Minister provide a copy. (11) For each electoral division for the last three financial years, which child care services have been granted Minor Capital Upgrading funding and when were the grants paid. (12) Is it the case that private LDCs that are approved by the Government and have CCB places are not eligible to apply for Minor Capital Upgrading funds. (13) Which grants may (a) LDC (b) Family Day Care (FDC) and (c) after school existing and prospective services apply for in (i) inner metropolitan areas and (ii) outer metropolitan areas and regional Australia. (14) When did each State and Territory Planning Advisory Committee (PAC) meet since January 2002. (15) Will the Minister provide a list of all minutes from PAC meetings since the decision was made that they should be publicly available. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Department of Family and Community Services keeps information on Australian Government approved services receiving Child Care Benefit.

The Department of Family and Community Services assess applications for eligibility against the selection criteria, prioritise applications and make recommendations to the Minister for approval. The McU funding is made available at the end of the application and approval cycle. (10) The selection criteria for the Minor Capital Upgrading are contained in the Guidelines for Applicants which are sent to eligible services with the letter inviting applications. An extract from the Guidelines is provided below: Eligibility Criteria In order to be eligible for capital upgrade funding, a project must meet the following criteria: The project must be specifically to address health, safety or licensing concerns. Services must submit documents from an independent source confirming that such concerns exist, justifying the urgency of the project including a timeframe, and that the project to be funded addresses these concerns. The following list provides examples of appropriate independent sources: State/Territory Government licensing authority; OH&S reports from a trade union or Workcover Authority (or State/Territory equivalent); Fire Services report; Council health or building inspectors; Note: Council reports are not considered independent if the Council is the service sponsor or the owner of the property. This also applies to similar sponsorship situations. State/Territory Departments of Health; Pest control officers; Independent consultants with relevant expertise or qualifications. * Please note that if the project relates to a licensing issue, the supporting statement from the licensing authority must directly relate to that project and must indicate the urgency attached to the work. The service will continue to operate from the premises being upgraded for five years. Services must currently be setting aside provisions for ongoing repairs and maintenance as is consistent with normal business practice. This information must be provided in the application. Long day care centres must be participating in the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System (QIAS). Eligible Items The following list provides examples of items eligible for funding: shade cover soft fall drainage fencing air conditioning heating access ramps hearing loops safety glass bathroom and kitchen upgrades, excluding white goods (eg. stove, fridge, dishwasher, microwave, washing machine, clothes dryer). Exclusions Projects requiring less than $5,000 of Commonwealth funding (excluding GST) will not be eligible. It is expected that services will meet the costs of smaller projects from within their own budgets. Projects requiring more than $100,000 (excluding GST) are also outside the scope of the minor capital upgrading program. A service is not eligible for further funding if there are outstanding (overdue) acquittal requirements from a previously funded project, with the exception of 2004 grants. If your service falls into this category and has urgent requirements please contact the Departmental office in your State or Territory to discuss the matter. Funding is not available for work that has already been completed, unless exceptional circumstances likely to cause a serious health or safety threat to users of the service make it necessary for the work to be carried out immediately. Such rare cases should be discussed with State or Territory office staff of the Department. Please note that the following items are ineligible for funding: General maintenance Outdoor play equipment and seating Plants Driveways Car parks Watering systems Landscaping, including artificial turf, unless the project relates to a health safety and/or licensing issue. In this case, the supporting statement from the licensing authority must directly relate to that project and must indicate the urgency attached to the work. Painting, unless in relation to a renovation or the removal of lead based paint Toys Computers Office equipment White goods Increases to floor space related solely to the increase or maintenance of the number of licensed places. Modifications of office areas, unless the report from the State/Territory Government licensing authority indicates that this directly impinges upon the centre’s health, safety and licensing.

(20) Has the Government decided to establish and fund a new agency to monitor the Professional Support Providers in each state on the basis that this is a more efficient mode of provision than having the department perform this function; if so, can the Minister explain how this can be so and provide a summary of the cost-benefit analysis supporting the decision (eg including the expected savings, if any). (21) Will companies be eligible to tender for the PSC function; if so, will there be any restrictions on the profit a PSC can make from performing this function.

(27) Can the Minister confirm that all the services currently being provided by the Ethnic Child Care Family and Community Services Co-operative will continue after its funding has ceased; if not, which services currently run by the Co-operative would the Minister allow to cease. (28) What services will be available to culturally and linguistically diverse families in NSW at 1 January 2006 to help them find child care that meets their special needs. (29) Does the Minister support any or all of the child care-assistance programs currently run by the Ethnic Child Care Family and Community Services Co-operative being funded under the Stronger Families and Communities Program; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) From1 July 2006, the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) and the Disabled Supplementary Services Program (DSUPS) will be replaced by the Inclusion Support Subsidy. Eligible services currently supported through SNSS and DSUPS will be supported under ISS. (2) Yes, funding to increase the hourly rate paid to In Home Carers caring for children with ongoing high support needs is consistent with the DSUPS guidelines. A child’s ability to participate in an alternate care setting is not a determinant of DSUPS support. (3) Yes (4) In Home Care is a targeted form of child care where the care is provided in the child’s own home by an approved carer where no other child care options exist. The In Home Care Review is looking at the costs of child care support provided by carers for children, including children with disabilities (although this is not solely the focus of it). The In Home Care Terms of Reference specifically include the requirement to identify the costs of providing In Home Care. The review has not been extended to look at financial support provided to the family of children with disabilities. (5) The review of In Home Care was not conducted in response to representations from parents. The national peak body made representations for In Home Care. . (6) Care arrangements for children with a disability are decisions made by parents. (7) The Community Link consultation report (dated August 2003) suggested that not all child care services could consistently access support through the Supplementary Services Program or funding through the SNSS in timely manner. The Inclusion and Professional Support Program will ensure equitable access for services. (8) The gaps identified were not in respect of individual children with disabilities and therefore not specific to any particular disabilities. (9) The Inclusion and Professional Support Program will be fully operational in all states and territories by 30 June 2006. The decision to place an intellectually disabled child in child care is not made by Government but by the child’s parents. (10) The following number of Inclusion Support Agencies (ISA) will be created: a) 67 in Australia b) 18 in NSW c) 17 in Victoria d) 13 in Qld e) 5 in SA f) 8 in WA g) 1 in the ACT h) 2 in the NT. (11) The ISA funding process is expected to be advertised in July 2005 and the application documents will be available at that time. (12) This information will be provided as part of the application documents being made publicly available. (13) This information will be provided as part of the application documents being made publicly available. (14) It is expected that the outcomes of the tender process will be announced in November 2005. (15) It is not feasible to provide this information. (16) The In Home Care Program is a current program. From1 July 2006, the Inclusion Support Subsidy Scheme will replace the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme and the Disabled Supplementary Service Program. These changes are not intended or expected to produce program or administrative savings but amalgamating the two payments types will provide more responsiveness in turnaround times and payments.

176,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow(19) (a) to (h). Refer to attached PSC Application Guidelines*. (20) The new Professional Support Program service delivery model was developed in response to recommendations from the review of the Child Care Broadband conducted in 2002-03. The new model aims to deliver more equitable access to nationally consistent service levels. It is not a savings measure but a measure to improve service delivery and quality. (21) Refer to PSC Application Guidelines*. (22) This information crosses a number of agencies and cannot be provided within the time available. (23) It is not clear what organisations are referred to in this question and as in the answer to question (22), this information crosses a number of agencies and cannot be provided within the time available. (24) Two new Resource and Advisory Agencies have been funded since the results of the Broadband review were announced, and these agreements are in place until 31 December 2005. (25) All current services are eligible to apply for funding under the Professional Support and Inclusion Support arrangements. (26) See answer to question (25). (27) See answer to question (25). (28) Services available to assist culturally and linguistically diverse families in NSW at 1 January 2006 to assist in meeting needs include: The Child Care Access Hotline a national telephone information service that provides parents and employers with information and assistance on child care. To assist callers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds the hotline uses a telephone interpreter service. Centrelink Jobs, Education and Training Advisors (JAs) and Personal Advisors (PAs) are able to discuss any issues that may affect the parent’s choice of child care service type including such things as the need for care appropriate to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) families. Under the new Inclusion and Professional Support Program child care services will be able to access specially trained bicultural support workers to assist in integrating children from diverse background into a quality care environment. The Commonwealth, and all State and Territory governments have endorsed the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society, under which all government agencies are responsible for ensuring their services are accessible to Australia’s CALD communities. (29) Stronger Families and Communities Strategy funding is on a tender and application basis. The Cooperative has been provided with information on funding opportunities under the Strategy. * The PSC Application Guidelines are available from the House of Representatives Table Office.

Marine Security (Question No. 1148) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Is he aware of an incident that occurred at the Port of Wallaroo in South Australia on 12 March 2005 involving the merchant bulk carrier the Flecha (IMO 8022456) where the master of the ship falsely called a Level2 security alert as a means of dealing with an industrial issue. (2) Were the appropriate measures taken to notify the Australian Office of Transport Security that the ship was on Level2 alert; if so, what were these measures. (3) Was the action taken by the Flecha in breach of the Maritime Transport Security Act 2004 and the International Ship and Port Security Code; if so, what action was taken against the (a) master of the ship and (b) shipping agent in relation to the breach of Australian legislation. (4) Will this incident be investigated by the recently appointed Inspector of Transport Security; if so, (i) what will be the terms of reference of the investigation and (ii) will the results be made public; if there will not be an investigation, will he explain why. (5) How does the Government intend to ensure that ships, ports and port facilities are prevented from misusing maritime security alerts in similar circumstances. (1) I am aware of reports that the master of the bulk carrier Flecha declared his ship to be at security level 2 while berthed at the Port of Wallaroo in March 2005. (2) Only a Contracting Government to the SOLAS Convention can raise a ship’s security level. If the ship’s Flag Administration had raised the ship’s security level, then it would have been appropriate that the Office of Transport Security be notified of this. However there is no evidence that the Flag Administration raised the ship’s security level, and the Office of Transport Security was not notified that the ship’s security level had been raised. (3) No. A public declaration that the security measures adopted by a ship are other than they actually are is not a breach of the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 or the SOLAS Convention / International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Under the SOLAS Convention, the Master of a ship may implement such measures to protect the safety and security of the ship as are deemed necessary. (4) No. A public declaration that the security measures adopted by a ship are other than they actually are is not a transport security incident. The question of whether such a declaration is appropriate is a matter for the Flag Administration, and my Department has written to the Flag Administration about this matter. (5) The Government accepts that, under the SOLAS Convention, the master of a ship may implement such measures to protect the safety and security of the ship as are deemed necessary, and that this may include denying access to persons whose access is not otherwise mandated on the grounds of “security”. However the Government considers the making of a false declaration about the security level at which a ship is operating to be an inappropriate use of the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. As noted above, the question of whether such a declaration is appropriate is a matter for the Flag Administration. In the case of the Flecha, my Department has written to the Flag Administration. Airport Security Measures (Question No. 1149 Supplementary) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Further to the answer to question No 353 (Hansard, 14/3/2005, page 109), are the administrative costs of the Government’s smaller airport security program recoverable from the $35m budget allocation. (2) In respect of each airport which has had a payment approved for the upgrade of its security, (a) what is the nature of the security upgrade and (b) what sum did or will the airport receive. (3) What are the details of the payments made to each regional airline that has received a payment from the Securing Our Regional Skies initiative? (4) What sum remains for future payments under the Securing Our Regional Skies initiative.",195,Questions In Writing
178,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Australian airports are not able to recover the administrative costs incurred in the development of a Transport Security Program under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 from the $35 million Regional Airport Funding Program. The Regional Airport Funding Program offers funding support to airports that are new to the regulatory regime. The funding is available for the installation of basic security infrastructure such as fencing, lighting, surveillance equipment and alarm systems. The funding is not available for ongoing staffing costs or consultancy costs. (2) (a) To ensure the best security outcomes are achieved by each security regulated airport it would not be prudent to publicise the exact nature of security measures in place and being installed at a particular airport. In general terms, the measures that can be approved for funding include installation of fencing, lighting, surveillance equipment and alarm systems. (b) The Regional Airports Funding Program is managed by the Australian Airports Association (AAA). The airport applies to the AAA for funding for basic security measures that have been approved by DOTARS. Following a value for money assessment by the AAA, funds are provided for the installation of the security measure. The decision to provide funding and the final amount of funding provided is the subject of agreement between the AAA and the airport concerned. (3) The details of payments made to each regional airline as part of the Securing Our Regional Skies hardened cock pit door initiative can be found in Attachment A. (4) The estimated sum remaining for future payments to regional airlines under the Securing Our Regional Skies initiative is approximately $1,500,000.00 as of 14 June 2005. Attachment A.

181,Mr Downer,"On behalf of the Minister for Trade and myself, the answer to the honour",218,Questions In Writing
182,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) What is the breakdown of funds allocated to Indigenous organisations from the (a) NHT (phase 1 and phase 2) and (b) NAP for each year since its inception, by State and Territory, in total and as a proportion of funds allocated. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) and (2) The name of the project proponent is recorded for all Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) funded projects. However, the proponent’s name does not necessarily indicate the level of Indigenous involvement in project implementation. Many thousands of projects have been funded during the life of the NHT Phase One and Phase Two and the NAP and it is not practical to undertake a manual assessment of the degree of Indigenous involvement where the proponent does not indicate that they are primarily an Indigenous organisation. I provide the attached data for which we are confident that the organisation is primarily an Indigenous organisation. In providing these data, I must advise that the figures would be an understatement of funding provided to groups where there is Indigenous involvement or where projects generate direct or indirect benefits for Indigenous communities due to sponsoring arrangements or joint involvement. In many cases funds are allocated to regional organisations, such as catchment management authorities, which in turn use the funds for Indigenous purposes. I also provide the following examples of larger-scale projects that involve substantial Indigenous participation but which were not picked up in the data search based on proponent name: The Northern Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Association (NAILSMA) was a joint recipient of $3.9 million of NHT regional funding in December 2004 to undertake a major project on Turtles and Dugongs covering all of Northern Australia. This will fund the development and implementation of five community-based regional action plans and will integrate traditional knowledge with scientific research to build community capacity to make responsible resource management decisions and improve management of these threatened species. The proponents and beneficiaries are not solely Indigenous and the recipients were not identified as such and the project not included in the data provided in the attached Tables. There is major Indigenous Community involvement in the $2 million Natural Heritage Trust funded ‘Ghost Nets’ Project that will seek to substantially reduce the amount of abandoned foreign fishing nets and other debris in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This debris threatens marine wildlife, such as turtles, dugong, dolphins and sea snakes, and cause losses to the fishing industry through entanglement of nets and lines. The project is managed by the Northern Gulf Resource Management Group Incorporated and involves numerous Indigenous Communities around the Gulf, the Australian fishing industry, a number of non-government organisations and State Governments, but was not picked up in the data interrogation as funding for Indigenous projects. I add that the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board has recently approved projects under the Regional Competitive Round of the NHT allocating funds to Indigenous organisations amounting to $1,356,977. Encouraging Indigenous engagement was a specific theme for this funding round and is consistent with current Australian Government emphasis on increasing the level of Indigenous participation in NRM programmes.

Container Examination Facilities in the ports of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane operated for all of 2003/04. The Fremantle Container Examination Facility commenced operations in November 2003 and there was a 13 week ramp up period. TEU inspected is comprised of containers x-rayed where Customs has container x-ray systems (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle) and containers physically examined in the other ports. (3) Figures provided by the stevedores indicate that on average containers are delivered to the Container Examination Facilities around 43 hours from when the container is unloaded. Once cargo arrives at the Container Examination Facility, an x-ray inspection and analysis of the resulting image takes around 10 minutes per TEU. A physical examination can usually be completed within a few hours, but may take 24 hours or longer depending on a range of factors such as the presence of fumigants in the container and the type of cargo.

Danish Royal Visit: Travel Costs (Question No. 1250) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 11 May 2005: What sum was spent by the Commonwealth Government on: (a) travel, (b) accommodation, (c) security, and (d) all other expenses for the visit to Australia by Their Royal Highnesses, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark between 27 February 2005 to 11 March 2005. I am advised that as at 31 May 2005 the sum spent by the Commonwealth Government on (a) travel, (b) accommodation, (c) security and (d) all other expenses for the visit to Australia by Their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark was: (a) $115,387.23 (b) $62,192.25 (c) The costs related to security for this visit are for the close personal protection officers assigned to the Crown Prince and Crown Princess. These amounts are included in (a), (b) and (d).

(2) In this matter, how does the position of an Administrator serving for an extended period (such as Sir Guy Green in 2003) differ from the position of the Governor General. lows: (1) It has been the practice of successive governments to not provide Administrators of the Commonwealth with Cabinet minutes. This practice avoids any conflict of interest for an Administrator in relation to his or her ongoing role as State Governor. (2) The period of time that an Administrator serves has no bearing on the principle set out in response to question (1).
