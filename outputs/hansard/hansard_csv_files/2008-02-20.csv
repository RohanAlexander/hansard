One of the incause it is my responsibility to outline the congruous things about this bill, which I will case there. return to in a moment, is the $100,000 limit. One of the reasons Western Australia had What the Labor Party and the minister such a good result at the last election was have done-and I think it is quite good, acthat so many people on AWAs were happy tually, even surprising-is, in place of the with their lot. A former Labor senator, John individual agreements that were on offer as Black, in an article in the Australian newsAWAs, put in this bill the individual transipaper pointed out the correlation between tional employment agreements or ITEAs. individual workplace agreements and voting ITEAs are for people who are currently on intentions.

If you choose to be better days-there was an award for picnics-for off and stay on an ITEA, that is good-there higher wages, what is the matter with that? is nothing wrong with that.

The problem is clear. After 88 days in office the new Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, has had one meeting with the Victorian Premier. This issue is real; it is important; it has an impact on lives. Those throughout the Murray-Darling Basin and in particular those in South Australia and near Adelaide suffer extraordinarily from any inaction in relation to the adequate and fair provision of water resulting from the flows of the Murray. In 88 days there has been one meeting: this is a symbol of powerful inaction. We need action in response to that. The previous government set out a National Water Initiative. We pulled together the states, but for political reasons Victoria held out. This was an act of political thuggery which has very little parallel over the last 100 years. In order to make sure that there was not an agreement before the election, the Victorian government held out. There are real consequences for farmers, for people and for the environment. So the message now is absolutely clear: there must be an agreement in which the Victorian government-and I say this as a Victorian-gets to the table, agrees on a fair distribution, agrees on steps forward and agrees that it is part of the Australian Federation and that it has a responsibility to help with the distribution, the balance and the saving of water from the Murray. The message to the Prime Minister is very simple: your minister is not doing the job. You were elected as a government to do a number of things, one of which was to ensure that Australians had fair and adequate water supply. That is not happening. It is a signature failure in the first three months of this government that something as significant, something as important, something as timely and something as urgent as this has simply not been acted upon. So at this point, at this moment, at this time, the Prime Minister has to step in because his minister has failed. We need the Prime Minister to get the states together now-not to be engaged in some long industry working group-because there are farmers who are suffering in the Murray-Darling Basin, the Adelaide water supply is at serious risk and the Coorong is in an extraordinarily bad state. This is the time and the moment when we need prime ministerial intervention because the minister is failing. The Murray River needs an agreement and it needs it now. I urge the Prime Minister to step in today.

280,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (9.33 Am),"I want to talk about Work Choices and thecent in the seat of Dobell, so we do not have a pool of labour that can use its market position in any sense. So when the unfair Work Choices legislation came into effect it affected the citizens of Dobell far more than it did some of the other citizens around the country. Of concern to me and to the families in Dobell is the position of the opposition. We are not quite sure where they are in terms of Work Choices. We have the deputy leader out there one day saying that she needs to fight to the death on AWAs. Yesterday she made a press statement and quite clearly no-one could understand what her position was. We know the Leader of the Opposition will take any position that gets him a couple of votes in the caucus room because he is just concerned about his job and whether he will still be the leader next week. And what about the member for Wentworth? What position is he going to have on this issue? In his position, he is so far removed from reality and ordinary people that he certainly cannot understand ordinary working families and the pain that they have. What we have here is an opposition that is all over the place in terms of Work Choices. We as the government have a clear mandate from the Australian people. Work Choices was the single most important issue in the last election that was voted on by the Australian public. It is something they want to have changed and, even with all this indecision, this flip, flop, flapping, that we have from the opposition, we still have them in the Senate trying to draw this process out and make it longer than it necessarily needs to be. What we need from the opposition is for them to accept that they actually lost the last election. They lost the election largely because they were out of touch with the Australian people and largely because of their position on Work Choices. They need to take a reality check, move ahead and ensure that the position that the government put forward before the election is one that can go through as quickly as possible and is one that will not in any way be slowed down by the opposition. It is one that we need to have as quickly as we can. Indigenous Affairs: Landownership you how to use a three-minute segment doing something that is good for this nation. I was very disturbed to see in the paper this morning that there may be a roll-back by Labor of the 99-year lease system in Aboriginal communities in Australia. Those of us who know about these things-and I have 8,000 Indigenous Australians in my electorate-know about the three Ls that are the fundamental issues that have to be addressed if Indigenous Australia is ever to get out of the severe disadvantage that it finds itself in. Those three Ls are: leadership; law, order and governance; and landownership. That is why I am concerned about this apparent announcement today that Labor will roll back possible landownership for Indigenous Australians. I appeal to my Labor colleagues: we cannot continue to have Indigenous Australia living in Soviet style collectives-and that is what they are. I have just been to Vanuatu. The indigenous peoples there all own their own little piece of the village. They take pride in their little piece of the village. They can deal in that piece of the village; they can move to another village if they wish. They take pride in the home that they build on that piece of land that is theirs in the village. Why can’t we have that in Australia? Why can’t we have the opportunity for Indigenous Australians to be the same as any other Australians? Why can’t they take pride in their piece of land, build their house and look after it? That is what would happen if landownership were available. Of course, there is also another dimension to this issue: Indigenous Australians should be able to deal in their own land. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
281,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.36 Am),"That was a waste of three minutes. Let me now showThat is what brings economic prosperity to Indigenous Australia. It brings jobs to Indigenous Australia. On Palm Island, in my electorate, nobody can own anything, so you cannot talk to the banks to borrow money because you do not own anything. Palm Island is probably the most beautiful island on the Barrier Reef, but we cannot take advantage of it. Indigenous Australians are denied the opportunity of having their own enterprise on Palm Island. It has to stop. I plead with the minister not to review this and to in fact extend it. I plead with the Queensland Labor government to extend it, get rid of this dreadful deed of grant in trust land title that currently exists in Queensland and give Indigenous Australia a fair go. With leadership in Indigenous communities, with respect for law and order and governance and with landownership, Indigenous Australia can take its rightful place in our country. (Time expired) Darfur member for Herbert, moving to the government side, was designed to show the opposition’s flip, flop, flap, but anyhow-whatever is behind it-I’m over here, if he’s over there. Twenty thousand people fled into Chad on 10 February, and another 150 people were killed in western Darfur after a continuing attack on villagers by the Janjaweed militia, backed by the Sudanese government in Khartoum. The United Nations has taken a very strong stand and asked that the hybrid United Nations force, UNAMID, be deployed there with 22,000 troops. That still has not happened. Australia has supported this very strongly at the United Nations and only the 8,000 African troops are there at the moment. They have proved ineffective to date because of their inability to transport themselves around to places that the Janjaweed militia attack. A tribal sheikh, Musa Hilal, described as ‘the poster child for Janjaweed atrocities in Darfur’ has been given a senior government position by the Sudanese government. Musa Hilal, who is accused of leading militias in a state-sponsored campaign to ethnically cleanse Darfur of non-Arab farmers, will act as special adviser to the minister of federal government in the Sudan. This follows the September appointment by President Omar al-Bashir of Ahmad Muhammad Harun, one of the two men sought by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, as state minister for humanitarian affairs. I think this indicates, very sadly, the attitude of the Sudanese government and why the United Nations force has not been able to be deployed there. The situation in Darfur overall remains that hundreds of thousands of people over the last four years have been murdered there. These are hundreds of thousands of black African Muslims, all Sudanese citizens, living in refugee camps in Chad. The United Nations-in an effort that was eventually not blocked by Russia or China, who receive most of Sudan’s oil supplies-agreed to deploy this United Nations force. But despite the UN resolution regarding the deployment of this force, this remains blocked by the government in Khartoum. On the ground in Darfur the situation continues with the massacre of innocent civilians, and Australia and other Western nations need to continue to put pressure on Sudan and its allies at the Security Council and the General Assembly to see that that United Nations force is put between the people of Darfur and the murderous Janjaweed and its backing by the Sudanese government. Unless there is a Western country that is willing to step up and provide the transport assets that will enable the UN force to be effective, I am afraid that the innocent people of Darfur will continue to be murdered by their own government.

282,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.39 Am),"I do not know whether the manoeuvre of theMr John Lawton Lawton of Benalla in my electorate. It was with great sadness that I learned of John Lawton’s passing on 11 February. John Lawton was an English World War II veteran who proudly fought in the Battle of Britain and also in South-East Asia, India and Burma. He always wanted to live in Australia and spent the remaining years of his life here. In October last year the family Australian flag was stolen, and I was very pleased to personally visit the Lawtons and give them a replacement. The two cut a dashing figure throughout that township of Benalla with their unique two-seater buggy, affectionately known in town as ‘the love buggy’. They proudly flew the Australian flag from their vehicle and together they were indeed a Benalla institution. Marg recounted to me how helpful the buggy was in getting around town. She said, ‘It gets John out and about and everyone talks to him while I shop’-a very useful pastime for any husband while his wife is shopping. Marg and John married in 2005 in the garden of their Benalla home. They adjourned to the Farmers Arms Hotel. At the reception, the couple happily spoke of their age difference-John was 88 and Marg was 68-to which the publican exclaimed in horror, ‘Child brides!’ John then admitted, without a hint of reticence, ‘Yes, I’m a cradle snatcher.’ Their beautiful story shows us the bonds of community, where local people interact and socialise, building the necessary social capital upon which happy, stable communities are built. The residents, the shops, the local health care providers, the local art gallery and the pub-all these aspects of life in Benalla were a feature in Marg and John Lawton’s happy coexistence. In the case of Marg and John, this was a love story that younger couples can only hope to emulate. Theirs is a great model for reinforcing the importance of marriage in giving stability to our society. I pay tribute to John for all he did. It was a well-lived life. I wish Marg all the best as she remembers the best times of her life spent with her beloved John and carries on during this difficult time. Bangla Fair which was held at Campbelltown Sports Stadium last Saturday. The Bangla Fair is a function put on by the Bangladesh Welfare Society of Campbelltown. This event draws around 2,000 to 2,500 people from all over Sydney. It is a very colourful, vibrant and culturally diverse event that occurs in the south-west of Sydney. This is the fourth time Campbelltown has hosted the Bangla Fair and it is the third time. I have had the opportunity to attend. It is a celebration of a unique culture through food, music and other social activities. In addition to the Bangladesh community being able to celebrate their culture, it is also an opportunity to share that culture with the people in the south-west of Sydney. I was particularly impressed, as I have been in the past, at the organisation, commitment and also the embracing nature of this event in terms of the people who attended from the south-west of Sydney generally.

His death has certainly been mourned by the Bangladesh community in my area, but, even more than that, his passing has been mourned by the community of Campbelltown generally. He was a very good man, a very good family man and a man committed to cultural as well as community ideals. He is very sadly missed. Events like this really do show the value of multiculturalism. That is something I am particularly proud of in my electorate and in the south-west of Sydney generally. It is something that shows that we can all live in happiness and in a way that complements one another. (Time expired) Fadden Electorate associations and residents associations in Fadden. I have said before in this place that Fadden is the fastest growing electorate in the nation. In the last six years it has grown by 31.6 per cent, compared to the closest electorate growth of 25 per cent. In such a high-growth area, with more people wanting to come to Fadden on the northern Gold Coast than any other electorate represented in this place, progress and residents associations play a significant part in organising communities, providing a voice for people and getting people together. The roles of progress associations are many and varied. They inform, they equip with research and guidance, they allow the combined voice of residents to be heard and, of course, they bring the opportunity for residents to join together to lobby for change, reform and outcomes. In Fadden, we have a number of very active and prominent progress and residents associations. A few that spring to mind are Paradise Point Progress Association, Jacobs Well Progress Association, Park Lake Residents Association and Helensvale Residents Association. I would like to specifically mention the Paradise Point Progress Association, so ably led for many years by Fred Woodley. This progress association has led the charge on many local community reforms within the electorate of Fadden. Recently, it has been working with the developers on the Paradise Point Esplanade and shopping precinct redevelopment, working on the ‘no cruise ship terminal’ campaign in the Broadwater, working to try to get the Broadwater dredged and, of course, raising environmental concerns about the desalination plant that is going ahead within the Gold Coast. I salute the Paradise Point Progress Association for taking an active involvement and interest in the community and especially Fred Woodley’s involvement in so ably leading the progress association with all that it is doing on the northern Gold Coast. Lindsay Electorate: Old St Marys Council Chamber that has recently occurred in the electorate of Lindsay. On Saturday, 9 February 2008 I had the privilege of attending the official reopening of the refurbished St Marys Council Chambers. On this important occasion I joined my councillor colleagues, including the mayor and the deputy mayor, Councillors Greg Davies and Jackie Greenow, who I know have been passionate supporters of this project. Originally opened in 1933, the St Marys Council Chambers served as the seat of local government in the district until 1949 and later served the local community well as a baby health MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Statements By Members

286,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.50 Am),"I rise to inform the House of a significant eventcentre and a library. It was a long wait for the St Marys municipal council, which was first incorporated in 1890. For more than 40 years after its first elections, the council lacked a home of its own. The council met monthly in the Protestant Hall, paying rent of five shillings per meeting. At the original opening of the building, MrJ Jackson MLA was reported in the Nepean Times as saying: I know of no sweeter word in the English tongue than ‘St Marys’. Any man entering this village from the hilltop gazing across the panorama, if he dwells here, can feel nothing but pride in the fact that in this township is his residence. It is a township that has a very wonderful history. As a serving East Ward councillor I wish to breathe some contemporary life into the words of Mr Jackson by echoing his sentiments today. The chambers is a beautiful building with heritage and local historical significance. It has a great deal of potential that can now be more fully realised. The chambers will become the home of many user groups-significant local groups building the social infrastructure on which our local community depends. I wish to acknowledge those groups-in particular, the St Marys and District Historical Society, the St Marys Development Committee, the Chrysanthemum Society, the Encore Sewing Group, the Porcelain Painters and the Tapestry Group. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the St Marys and District Historical Society and, in particular, to its indefatigable president, Norma Thorburn, and her husband, Tom. I wish to thank Margaret Dwyer, Lyn Forde and Charles Connelly for their ongoing involvement in the project. Mr Connelly, an old stalwart of the district, was instrumental in researching the building and putting in place this proposal. I acknowledge the leadership of Penrith City Council, its officers, including the general manager, the director of city services and its former facilities and operations manager, Mr Gary Dean. I thank Linda Sack and Michael Mendham. I also acknowledge the assistance of the St Marys Rotary Club. Also present on the day was Mr Tony Biddulph and his wife, Sheila. Mr Biddulph is the president of the St Marys Development Committee. I also saw the publicity officer, Isobel Lowe, and her husband, Neville. He was on hand, as he often is, to capture the occasion on film. It was a great occasion and I am certain that this facility will be a great tribute to the efforts of those who have contributed to it. Cowan Electorate: Graffiti dents of the federal electorate of Cowan, and no doubt every other electorate around the country, who are fed up with the extent of graffiti vandalism that afflicts our residential, business and public buildings and open places throughout our suburbs. While the numbers of sworn officers within the WA Police are woefully inadequate and getting worse, the police are unable to get on top of the problem. In Western Australia, just like in New South Wales and Victoria, so I am told, it is very clear that the state governments have no political will to address this problem. Graffiti is very expensive to remediate and is a seemingly endless problem for private citizens, business owners and local governments. The state governments prefer the soft option of reaction or, even worse, toleration. They, in fact, leave the problem to private groups and local governments-a soft option by soft, ineffectual and unresponsive state governments. I therefore have proposed that a plan be instituted MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Statements By Members
287,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.53 Am),"This morning I speak on behalf of the many resito crack down on the sale and control of spray paint cans. In spite of the locking up of these cans in hardware stores, graffiti vandalism remains at epidemic levels. My proposal is that the state parliaments pass laws to require serial numbers to appear on all cans and that the sighting of photographic identification and the need to keep records be imposed on suppliers. In this way cans found in the possession of vandals could be traced back to the purchaser and action could then be taken by the police. Obviously, this would significantly increase the cost of spray cans. That would be acceptable, however, when compared with the cost imposed on innocent members of the community caused by the scourge of vandalism. These laws would impose a serious responsibility on purchasers. In cases where a can was found at the scene of vandalism or in the possession of a vandal, the original purchaser would have to have reported the theft of the can or subsequently face a fine. I recommend such a hard line on this matter with strict and absolute liability being applied. The people of my electorate have had enough and, I suspect, the country has had enough. The people of Australia want action, and I therefore recommend to the parliament this hard line to address the problem of graffiti. Kingston Electorate: Sport Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (9.55 am)-I rise to bring to the attention of the House the recent international achievement of the Adelaide Icicle Magic synchronised ice-skating team. Adelaide Icicle Magic recently represented Australia in the Cup of Berlin and the Prague cup. The results the team achieved need to be commended. In the Prague cup, Adelaide Icicle Magic came fifth and in the Cup of Berlin they came fourth. This is a very good result especially as synchronised ice-skating is not a well-publicised and popular sport here in Australia. The majority of teams they were competing against were ones from northern Europe, where ice-skating is a way of life. Adelaide Icicle Magic were the only team in the competition to represent Australia and comprised 17 young people. Synchronised ice-skating is a very difficult sport: it requires a group of ice-skaters to skate in unison with each other while looking graceful and remaining in time and completing complex manoeuvres. This is no easy feat. The teamwork, practice and dedication required to achieve this is great. The team trains for long hours at the local ice-rink in Noarlunga and is supported by a number of dedicated parents and other volunteers. Without these volunteers providing the day-to-day organisation and administration of the club, these young people would not have the opportunity to be involved in the sport that they love. I would like to congratulate the volunteers that support Adelaide Icicle Magic and also the volunteers at all the other clubs in my electorate, who work tirelessly for very little reward to ensure that young people get the opportunity to participate in team sports. It is important now more that ever, with the problem of childhood obesity, that we encourage children and young adults to participate in sports. It is important for both physical and psychological well-being that young people are active and engaged in exercise and sport. This is becoming harder with the attraction of computers and game consoles. The added social element that comes with playing a team sport also can teach young people the valuable life skills of working together. Therefore I would like to express my support for all the clubs in my electorate for the great job they do in supporting young people to be their best. MAIN COMMITTEE 193, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 February, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time. issue of climate change during this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008. Clearly, this is one of the main issues that is resonating with mainstream Australia. Through the actions of the Rudd Labor government in its first days of office, we saw a very positive response to the views that were foremost in the minds of electors during the last election. We saw the Rudd Labor government ratify the Kyoto protocol which, quite frankly, brought Australia back to the international bargaining table on climate change. We have had 11 years where that has just not occurred. We have seen a government that has taken all care and no responsibility when it comes to climate change. On the first opportunity that this government had, it did what it always said it would do-that is, it ratified the Kyoto protocol. It is time that we started taking responsibility not just for the problem but for actually developing solutions. Being involved in tackling climate change should not simply be the province of doom and gloom. It should be the province of our best minds, working collaboratively together with the support of government, to do something responsible to address the issue of climate change and the level of impact that mankind has on a deteriorating environment. These are things that we do need to apply ourselves to. It is not just Australia. I have always acknowledged that-but for us to be in a position to influence the views and actions of others does mean that, as with any other set of negotiations, we must be at the table, and that is somewhere we have not been when it comes to something so fundamental to people as climate change. As someone who has spent a lot of time prior to coming to this place working in the renewable energy sector, I know the opportunities that currently exist out there, but I can only imagine what those opportunities are going to be like into the future. This is where we do need to commit funds as a form of incentive to commercialise innovation to develop the responses to climate change. This will be the hallmark of this government when it comes to developing responses to and taking leadership in climate change. Another matter I would like to briefly touch upon is the importance of high-quality investment in our people. As important as it is to invest in our roads, our infrastructure, our high speed broadband services and the tackling of climate change, the investment we put into our people now and into the future is going to be just as important. That is why I support the Rudd Labor government’s commitment to high-quality education. It has been reported for years that there are problems with a tight labour market and a skills shortage has emerged-mainly the product of a lack of investment in skills development. Madam Deputy Speaker, can I suggest to you that skills training through local high schools, investment in computers in our schools so that kids between years 9 and 12 all have access to computers and computer generated learning and the view of Australia’s national innovation system all point to a future where MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members

289,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.58 Am),"As to where I left off last night, I was talking about theAustralians will not need to choose to compete on a race for the bottom in wages and comparable conditions but can aspire to benefit from the skills and the abilities of this nation’s primary resource-that is, its people. Our ability to compete in future is going to be directly related to the ability of this nation to harness the potential of its own people. It largely rests with us to generate those ideas and also to provide the infrastructure necessary to develop the youth of this country to secure the future of Australia. In conclusion, I am no longer troubled about the prospects of future generations in this country. After more than a decade of squandered opportunities under the Howard government, I look forward to the coming years of this government. I look forward to a government that actually does focus on developing an education revolution; a government that does focus on developing high-speed internet broadband so people can benefit, whether they be students or in industry; a government that will put the resources into developing national road and rail infrastructure to assist the development and the efficiency of our ports and our communication generally; and a government that will meet its challenges in respect of climate change. (Time expired) congratulations on your well-earned elevation to the deputy speakership. My comments today go to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008. BeforeI make those remarks, I congratulate the member for Werriwa on his re-election but reassure him that he may no longer be troubled, as he put it, about the challenges young people face in the future. I would say to the member for Werriwa, who I value as a friend: you can never be complacent; you must always be vigilant. You may not be troubled today, but the young people of Australia require the best of all of us every day, and new challenges emerge. Remain vigilant, Sir, and that will be in the best interests of your young community. I am pleased you are not troubled at the moment. Many of us are troubled, though, by what we are seeing going on, and some of what we see going on is captured in these bills. The Labor Party are trying to recreate themselves as fiscal conservatives. We heard it right throughout the election campaign and it proved to be quite an effective appeal-one of those things where if you hear it often enough you might actually believe it. We have heard about targets such as surpluses of two per cent of GDP and the like. I think all bar two budgets brought down during the Howard government were in surplus. They were difficult budgets year on year, but there were nine surpluses. We know the hard work that is involved in that. We know also, before the Howard government was elected, of the spending bonanza of the Keating government. It could not save itself despite enormous spending and despite reassuring statements in the lead-up to, and even during, that election campaign that the budget was in surplus. We know that to be nonsense: the deficit was over $10½ billion and the incoming government had the difficult fiscal management task ahead of it of how to deliver on its election commitments and maintain the essential works and services the nation required, while ensuring we as a nation were not living off the bankcard, off the Visa card. The task of rebuilding the fiscal strength of the Commonwealth began under the Howard government. The Rudd government today is basking in the glory of work that others have done for it. It needs to do, frankly, nothing to achieve what it set itself as challenging goals. This seems to be the hallmark of the Rudd government’s early days-lots of spin, lots of theatre, but little MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
290,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (10.05 Am),"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, andsubstance. Here is another example: setting oneself a fiscal target that has already been delivered and gifted to you is no evidence of fiscal management. We look into these appropriation bills before the chamber today and we see an interesting story unfold-the claimed savings, the new expenditure, how it has been tough and difficult. In many respects, what Labor is doing is trying to create a budget crisis to justify wiping out things it did not like so much to put in things it wants to put in. That is an incoming government’s prerogative and I do not decry it, but let us be honest about what is actually going on. This is an attack on projects, initiatives and programs valued by many in the Australian public implemented by the former government but not to the liking of the incoming government. They are getting wiped out and replaced with other things. That is what is going on, and to mask it under some poorly created veil of a budget crisis is just utter nonsense. As time goes by, I think the Labor government will fall over itself as its own rhetoric comes back to haunt it. In these bills, there are a number of funding supplementations for agencies and programs, and many of those are welcome and worthwhile. However, the programs and initiatives that are not featuring in this document require some attention. You see embedded in these measures calls for additional two per cent efficiency dividends. That is an interesting approach; it does not show any considered or thoughtful review of what agencies and departments are actually doing. The government is just saying, ‘We want a two per cent yield out of all of you.’ That is hardly being fiscally conservative; that is hardly a zero based budgeting approach where one values and evaluates activity. That is an across-the-board impact. The challenges in the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the department for which I used to have responsibility, include the increasing demands being placed on departmental staff. While the number of veterans is diminishing, they are ageing and, therefore, require more care. This required an increase in the coordination of the support that was provided. Anybody who takes a broad-brush look-as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation seems to have donewould not have even apprised themselves of that reality. SoI say to those people, particularly the many public servants who probably thought it was a great result for the nation to have the Rudd government elected: be careful about the ham-fisted, clumsy, brutal approach that Labor is already displaying in its budgeting process. Be mindful that important projects, programs and activities can be cut for no other reason than they are disliked by the Labor Party. Be mindful, too, of the attack on rural and regional Australia in these two bills-so many resources are being dragged out of those areas. Another thing to be mindful of is where we started. Contrast the challenge facing the new government with the contrasts that faced the previous government when it was elected. In 1996 there was an enormous Bankcard bill from the $96 billion debt Labor had accumulated and a budget deficit of $10½ billion on day-to-day outlays. We as a nation were spending $10½ billion more than we were bringing in in revenue. That presented some real budget challenges. Those challenges were addressed and overcome and the fiscal circumstances of the nation were turned around. Now we have an incoming government with a rolled-gold economy, swimming in cash, that is saying there is some kind of budget crisis. It is utter, unsustainable nonsense. I think more Australians will come to reflect on this matter. To scream about a crisis at a time when they are rolling in cash is extraordinary. They set targets which MAIN COMMITTEE have already been met and then claim credit for meeting them. That gives us another extraordinary insight into the behaviour of the Rudd government even in these early months. Let us be clear: to cut programs and projects because you do not like them is okay-make that case; and to say that funding should be directed to other priorities is okay-make that case. I note from some of the information provided here that people are getting stuck into rural and regional projects which are creating focal points for activity and enterprise in rural and regional communities-as though that is a bad thing. But if you look into where the money is being directed, you will see a little bit of that character coming through in some of the new funding allocations. Let us be clear: it is just a choice. Knock off things you do not like, even if they are working and making a meaningful contribution. Knock them off and put something else in there. That is okay. Governments can do that. But they should at least be frank about why they are doing that and be open about that being the motivation. They should not invent some kind of bogus fiscal crisis. The bills touch on a couple of important areas. We have touched on the efficiency dividend and the hairy-chested bravado the minister for finance displays when he says, ‘We’re getting a two per cent efficiency dividend out of everybody, regardless of the impact.’ That is not terribly smart, but that is a decision that has been taken. I have provided one very simple, familiar example about how that can be a very poor approach. Embedded in Labor’s policies are a number of undertakings which create obligations for agencies. Take the ABC, for instance. Nowhere in the ALP arts policy was there any commitment for additional funding, just some warm words. That is okay; that is the way much of the policy was developed. But embedded in it was a requirement that the ABC meet the Australian drama production standards that the commercial television networks are required to meet. The ABC do not currently have that obligation, but Labor is saying they should. That is also okay. But that will put a $60 million new requirement on the ABC to meet those Australian drama production requirements. It was not previously imposed upon them, but now it is to be imposed upon them. There is no extra funding but, in effect, there is a $60 million obligation jammed into the existing funding envelope of the ABC. What is going to be cut? How are they going to meet that commitment? The creative arts community, understandably, welcomed that commitment. But how will it be funded? The ABC have not received any reassurances from Labor policy that there will be any new funding or anything of that kind, just that Labor policy is to value the ABC-like the vast majority of Australians do. Welcome aboard to the Labor Party! How is the new $60 million obligation which is being imposed going to be accommodated within a budget that is not growing? These are some of the fiscal management challenges that are being created by the ALP. This is not fiscal conservatism; this is fiscal decreeing by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and then letting everyone else mop up the mess. I challenge the Labor Party to be clear on where the $60 million is going to come from. What is going to be cut in the ABC to finance this new obligation-an obligation which the ABC currently does not have, which the Labor Party wants to impose upon it, at a time when there are no additional resources to do so? The former government used to say to the ABC: ‘We’d like certain things done. We recognise these things are over and above the charter of responsibilities.’ We have seen the rollout of additional services, activity in rural and regional areas and some effort to ensure there is local content on ABC regional radio. These were all MAIN COMMITTEE sound measures, but the budget came with them. If you are going to ask for additional effort and activity beyond what has been shaped as the strategic plan and priorities for the ABC from its global budget, you supplement the global budget. More demands on and more requirements of the ABC require more resourcing. It is not a difficult equation, but it is now very difficult for the ABC. The board is faced with this challenge: where is the $60 million going to come from to finance this couple of lines in the ALP arts policy which say that the ABC now needs to meet local drama production requirements, just as the commercial networks need to do? This legislation also talks about a topic quite close to me-that is, NetAlert. In estimates in the last few days we saw the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, doing a great jawboning down of NetAlert as a program, as a process, as a way of equipping Australian families with tools to help them manage their family’s interaction and access to the internet. Senator Conroy was decrying the take-up rate of NetAlert and the utilisation of the software funded through it. It seemed to be a reverse argument for his poorly conceived clean-feed idea. I do not know too many people who think that is a clever idea, given the dynamism in the internet world and how URLs can change quickly and you can get around some of the clean-feed devices. It emphasises the need for parental supervision-that it is key, supported by tools that help them manage a range of different people in a household using the one unit. Also, ISPs can offer value-added services such as making devices, technology and software part of the service. If parents want to go to whitelisting services and then shape access to those sites designed and specifically selected to be suitable for children of different ages, that would be fine too, but that is a collaborative approach where the parents are at the core of it. It worries me greatly that the Labor Party’s clean-feed proposal, already ridiculed and shown to be ineffective in the UK, would deny whatever somebody-and this is yet to be determined-thinks is inappropriate content. It would apply consistently right across all age groups and types of computer users, regardless of their circumstances, and we have already seen that it does not have too many fans. So what does Senator Conroy do? He does not address this issue but tries to run down NetAlert. There is further evidence of it in these bills. He is complaining that the take-up rate of NetAlert is not what it should be and, therefore, justifies ending the program. When you look at these bills, you see that Senator Conroy has sucked out the budget set aside for NetAlert-to communicate its availability, its potential benefits for households, the way in which families can interact with it and update protections in any way they see fit-to stop public education of the communications campaign. What a cunning plan, Senator Conroy. If you want to make sure no-one takes something up, do not tell them about it and, therefore, just suck the very budget out of something designed to inform the Australian public not only about the risks but also about some of the tools and assistance that are available to help people manage their family access to the internet. These are the things in these budget papers that people are less keen to talk about. Then there is the work around BroadbandNow, which tries to help communities that may be wanting to access broadband services to interact with those providing services and make sure they know what is available at their premises. That consumer help centre with its telephone and web information was a great tool. That BroadbandNow program was an ally to MAIN COMMITTEE broadband users to access the kinds of services that they were angling for. That is going as well. Is the Labor Party simply setting up these programs to fail to justify its confused, poorly thought through, almost foundering at the first rock proposals for activity in this area? It is something that needs closer examination. I would also like to touch on a couple of budget issues that are very relevant to my electorate of Dunkley. During the election campaign we put forward a number of proposals for our community. Our local plan was very well endorsed. Our campaign put forward this local plan that took advantage of the momentum and opportunities being nurtured at a national level and translated them into very real and very practical outcomes for our local community. People came up to me and contrasted our campaign with the almost stealth like campaign from the ALP, which did not comment on any of the local issues and did not put forward any local plan-in fact, it simply traded on the cult of Kevin. The cult of Kevin was what was being perpetuated in the electorate. That was their campaign strategy choice, and that was a decision for the Labor Party. The local community did not seem to feature at all in that. I think that campaign reminded people of what was said by the last Labor member for Dunkley, back before 1996. At the time of the last Labor federal government, the Labor member for Dunkley quite openly said that our community had been forgotten. There were so many outer metropolitan areas, particularly down in the south-east, that just did not seem to feature on the radar screen. It was an interesting confession by the former member. He is a very decent bloke-perhaps that is what led to that confession. I am pretty certain that it resonated with the local community. It certainly did not help his electoral prospects, but it was true. We are already starting to see that again here. In appropriation bills Nos3 and 4 there is no funding for the Frankston bypass. The former government made a commitment, if re-elected, to fund that in partnership with the states, because we have got EastLink dumping 25 per cent more traffic onto the Frankston Freeway-a freeway that is already clagged at the end where it intersects with the Frankston-Cranbourne Road-not to mention the extra traffic that is going to be drawn towards it as the area continues to develop. There is no mention of that-nothing. Then there is the support for our local young people who may be gifted and skilled but who may not be academically engaged in the secondary school community. We reached out to them with a commitment to build a new Australian technical college. That was welcomed with great enthusiasm in the local area as a real priority. In the secondary school where I was a former school council president, Monterey, these were the kinds of initiatives that we were dreaming of just to engage young people who might not necessarily have seen the link between the academic course of study they were exposed to and their future life prospects. These talented young people have skills and a promise for a bright future. We were aiming to give life to that. Young people are looking to pursue a pathway at a technical college designed for year 11 and 12 students and commence their trade qualifications and get a grounding in business management and those workplace competencies that employers are looking for. Employers are telling me that they cannot recruit anybody. This was a very sound and responsive local initiative and there was nothing but silence from the ALP. Sadly, you see none of these things embraced in these appropriation bills. There has been wonderful progress with the CCTV network in Mornington and a good early start in Frankston. There have been a number of commitments tackling not only hot MAIN COMMITTEE spots around the taxi rank and linking the railway precinct with the entertainment precinct on the Nepean Highway but also the foreshore and some additional areas, including the Seaford station, where many commuters park their vehicles. The rollout of this technology was extremely well received. These are issues that are not in these appropriation bills. These matters were embraced and valued by the local community. These are things that I think the new government should take into account. I would hate to see our community forgotten again because we have now got another Labor government. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.25 am)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008, which seek appropriation authority for the additional expenditure of funds from consolidated revenue in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the budget. The total additional appropriation being sought is $3.3 billion, approximately 4.5 per cent of total appropriations. Many of the items that are not in these bills represent the first stages of our government’s commitment to rein in government spending. Many of the items not in these bills represent the last desperate gasps of the Howard government as it attempted to buy itself another term. During the election campaign we made a promise to the Australian public that we would manage the public purse with diligence. This government made a commitment to the Australian people that we would identify areas where reductions, savings and offsets could be made from the previous government’s spending program. Unlike the previous government, we know we have a battle on our hands. The onus is on us, as a government for all Australians, to manage fiscal policy responsibly. We are serious about tackling the inflation problem, we are serious about the impact that 11 interest rate increases in a row have had on borrowers and we are serious when we say that it is crucial for all levels of government to manage public finances appropriately and effectively. At present, underlying inflation is at 3.6 per cent-a 16-year high. This rate is now threatening to go even higher. Today is the day to act on the challenge of rising inflation. I acknowledge that the member for Dunkley may feel very passionately about many of the things that he has spoken on. However, the previous government failed to deal with inflation and we have been left to do it for them. Our government is serious about this challenge. Every decision we make on public spending has to be made on a long-term basis. These proposed bills are merely the start of a long road of thoughtful public spending. This government has already announced a five-point plan to fight inflation. The first point in this plan was to ensure that the government takes pressure off demand by running a strong budget surplus. This government will show fiscal restraint. This government is committed to a budget surplus above 1½ per cent of GDP. To achieve this is not easy. To achieve this, we need to make tough decisions today. During the election we said that we would have a review of spending. We did not attempt to hide it-we said we would have a review of spending. Now our razor gang has been working to cut the waste out of the budget. In the bills that I support today this government has identified $643 million worth of savings over the next four years, including $243 million in 2007-08. We want to put maximum downward pressure on inflation. We want to do everything in our power to ease the financial burden on working families that are impacted by interest rate and inflationary pressures. This is not just some academic exercise that we are engaged in. Everything we do in this place-every spending decision we make-has a direct impact on the capacity of working families to pay their mortgages, to buy groceries or to pay their childcare fees. MAIN COMMITTEE There is still more to be done. The Rudd Labor government will continuously look at spending money wisely, and we will continue to review the spending of all departments to show fiscal restraint. These initial savings are just the beginning. More savings will be announced on budget night. The previous government squandered millions of taxpayers’ dollars to buy votes. Public money was pork-barrelled, public money was squandered and the economic opportunities of the mining boom were carelessly fed to the inflation monster that this government now has to fight. Four hundred and fifty-seven million dollars was spent on government advertising in a 16-month period under the Howard government. Three hundred and fifty million dollars was spent in a single year on Work Choices. Both of those initiatives alone represent the savings that we found in this budget. Imagine if the previous government had not spent that money on its profligate advertising campaigns. This bill brought to the parliament once again shows the Rudd government’s firm guarantee to the Australian public that we will follow through with our own election commitments. That is what we were elected to do. One of the key capacity constraints in the economy today is the skills crisis. Addressing the skills crisis was one of the core planks of our election campaign. This bill sees the implementation of the first part of our government’s agenda to overcome the skills crisis: $242.1 million will be provided to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to enable a number of programs that work to tackle our skills crisis. Of this $242.1 million, $100 million will go towards establishing the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund. These grants will provide up to $1 million for schools to provide new or upgraded ICT equipment for students in years 9 to 12. This is welcome news for the schools and students in my electorate who have already shown a keen interest in taking up this funding. Thirty-three million dollars will also be provided for the Skilling Australia for the Future program. This program will see 450,000 new training places over the next four years, at a cost of $1.3 billion. This program is set to start in April this year-Labor getting on with the job. In 2007-08 the Skilling Australia for the Future program will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce. Also, $92.6 million will be provided to the department to meet extra costs associated with the previous government’s Skills for the Future program and to extend the current program until our new program commences in April-all things that will assist in easing capacity constraints within the Australian economy. This appropriation also sees the implementation of the government’s election promise to establish Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will be a statutory authority that will set a clear agenda for this government’s investment in infrastructure: $2.5 million has been allocated within these additional estimates to support Infrastructure Australia’s establishment by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Once this funding has been allocated and Infrastructure Australia has been established, their first task will be to undertake a national audit of Australia’s infrastructure-something the previous government neglected to do. It was more interested in pork-barrelling infrastructure projects in coalition seats than having a strategic approach to this country’s infrastructure needs. Infrastructure bottlenecks are just another area of economic efficiency that this government is tackling, and this first step is only the beginning. MAIN COMMITTEE The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research will also be supplied with $15.2 million to introduce the Enterprise Connect program, replacing the previous government’s Australian Industry Productivity Centres. This program is designed to help Australian businesses become more innovative and to boost productivity, something that we will welcome desperately in regional Australia. During the election, in terms of the Health and Ageing portfolio, we promised to the people of the Ballarat electorate that a GP super clinic will be provided in the Ballan area. Once again I would like to reiterate this promise. A GP super clinic is needed in the Ballan area to attract doctors and other health professionals to service the needs of a growing community. Labor’s GP superclinic will be a one-stop shop for medical and allied health services. Once completed, the Ballan GP superclinic is expected to include: privately practising GPs; a range of allied health services, such as physiotherapy and podiatry; mental health services, including counselling; and desperately needed dental services. This will result in patients having to travel shorter distances, being less likely to be placed on waiting lists and being assisted in receiving the basic health care that they all deserve. Currently there is a lack of consulting space for GPs and allied health services in Ballan. A GP superclinic in Ballan will provide a great boost to this area and much improved health services for our local community. Today as part of this appropriation $33.1 million will be provided to the Department of Health and Ageing to provide upfront capital grants and recurrent funding for the establishment of 31 GP superclinics around Australia, and to provide incentive payments to GPs and allied health providers to relocate to these clinics. AndI am happy to say that the Ballan GP superclinic is one of these 31 that I am supporting today. Additional funding proposed for the Department of Health and Ageing also includes $31.6 million for investing in hospitals and community health under the Better Outcomes for Hospitals and Community Health Program. You do not need to look too far in the electorate of Ballarat to see the ongoing impact that climate change is having on the world. Just last week, Ballarat’s famous high school rowing regatta was shifted to Geelong. It was shifted because Lake Wendouree in the centre of Ballarat has once again, for the second year in a row, dried up. This was once the home of the Melbourne Olympic Games rowing. The Rudd Labor government has also ratified the Kyoto protocol, demonstrating this government’s commitment to tackling climate change. The Kyoto protocol is considered to be the most far-reaching agreement on the environment and sustainable development ever adopted. But there are also practical solutions to fighting the effects of climate change that we need in my community. That is why during the election a Rudd Labor government promised the Australian people that we would make all of Australia’s 9,612 private and public schools solar schools within eight years. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will be provided with $50.8 million for the National Solar Schools Plan under these additional estimates. Federal Labor’s National Solar Schools Plan will allow all Australian schools to apply for: up to $20,000 to install two-kilowatt solar panels that will provide average greenhouse gas savings of up to 2.8 tonnes per year and up to $30,000 to install efficiency improvements so schools can invest in energy and water measures-a terrific initiative to help our environment. This plan will encourage improved energy and water efficiency in schools and set a great example to our future generations about what is needed to combat climate change. The sum of MAIN COMMITTEE $31.8 million will be used to provide rebates to households that join the climate change fight by installing solar hot water heaters to encourage improved energy efficiency in homes. During the election Labor also announced a National Water Security Plan for Towns and Cities to secure water supplies by repairing water pipes and reducing leaks, wastage and evaporation. Dry conditions have contributed to a 30 per cent increase in the number of water mains bursting around Ballarat alone. Ballarat has over 1,435 kilometres in the underground network of water distribution pipes, some of it well over 100 years old. Labor wants to fix as many leaks in our water system as possible. There is yet another practical response to the fight against climate change. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will also be allocated $15.2 million in these estimates to take early action on the National Plan for Water Security. Within the allocation provided by these bills, $189.8 million will also be provided to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to assist people with disabilities, their families and carers. An annual tax-free payment of $1,000 for each child under the age of 16 with a disability will be given to any carer who is receiving a carer allowance (child). This annual payment is a financial acknowledgement of the effort and the challenges that carers face every day. Carers provide a great service to the community and by acknowledging the increases in costs for carers we recognise the economic benefit to Australia as a whole of supporting them. There are many additional costs associated with caring for a person with a disability. Aids such as wheelchairs, communication aids and hearing aids can hit hard on a carer’s hip pocket. And let’s not forget about the hidden opportunity cost of the inability for carers to find substantial employment. This allocation will go some way to assisting those families in the Ballarat electorate who struggle to make ends meet while juggling both their own lives and also caring for their children. An amount of $9 million has also been allocated to increase the support available to people in disability business services. Also under these bills, funding of $723 million in additional appropriation for non-operating expenses is outlined in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Of this, a significant contribution of $466.4 million will be provided to AusAID for our nation’s contribution to the International Development Association. This funding will go to assisting some of the poorest countries in the world by helping them address the cost of basic health services, clean water and primary education, just to name a few. It will subsequently improve the long term living conditions of those most in need. An amount of $17.6 million will be provided to the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research for the Innovation Investment Fund. An objective of the Innovation Investment Fund is to establish a revolving self-funding scheme, and the $17.6 million represents the profit on the fund’s investment. Also recognised within appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No.4) are additional payments to the state, territory and local government authorities. Payments to the state, territory and local government authorities of $172 million include such things as: a bring forward of $20 million under the AusLink program to assist the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government with an early initiation of projects; $63.7 million to the Department of Health and Ageing to provide funds to invest in hospitals and community health under the Better Outcomes for Hospitals and Community Health Program; and a MAIN COMMITTEE $33 million increase for the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, something that went into decline under the previous government. The government promised during the election campaign that we would show fiscal restraint, and that is what these bills represent. We promised a number of very important programs during the election campaign that will help bring inflation under control and will ease the capacity constraints that have arisen in the Australia economy. Those matters are important to take pressure off interest rates as well as taking pressure off inflation. Those are the promises that we made during the election campaign. It is absolutely critical for the Australian government to do everything in its power to ensure that hard working families enjoy a strong Australian economy. But it is important that we make tough decisions when dealing with the public purse. We cannot go on with business as usual, pretending that nothing has happened. The tough decisions we have made begin with implementing our election commitments and cutting the waste out of the budget to meet our target of 1.5 per cent budget surplus of GDP. We have begun with investing in areas of economic inefficiency, such as the skills crisis and infrastructure bottlenecks. These tough decisions are complemented by transparency in initiatives like Infrastructure Australia, initiatives that will take the pork-barrelling and rorts out of funding and will ensure that this government is one that looks out for all Australians-particularly, I hope, all regional Australians, not just those who live in coalition electorates. We as a government have a responsibility to the Australian people. Australian families are the ones that have worked hard and paid taxes and they are the ones that are hit hardest by interest rates and inflationary pressures. They are the ones bearing the brunt of the previous government’s profligate spending and their inability or unwillingness to tackle the hard issues within the economy. These bills represent a responsible first step in enacting our election promises whilst equally showing fiscal restraint. The Australian people voted for this government on the basis of those promises. I support these bills. marks by commenting on and referring to the speech made in the other chamber by the member for Kennedy criticising me in a very vicious and unprovoked way in relation to a whole range of issues. I once admired and respected the member for Kennedy, and I have to say that I just feel sadness at the way in which he has degenerated into a fantasy world. Every paragraph of his vicious assault on me contained factual errors. I will go through those quickly and briefly. He first criticised me in relation to the import of grapes from California, saying I allowed ‘grapes in from California in the same month that one-tenth of the entire grape production in California was wrecked by pierce’s disease’. That statement is factually wrong, but it also puts aside acknowledgement of the fact that our quarantine system and our import risk assessment is a science based process. The legislation specifically precludes the minister from having a role in making decisions about what products should come into Australia. The member for Kennedy went on to comment on pork, talking about a case before the High Court which he said produced a ‘scathing indictment of the quarantine services’. The case was actually before the Federal Court and the Federal Court determined that the permits to import pig meat were legal and the analysis to determine the roles associated with imports of pig meat was comprehensive, science based and rational. The member for Kennedy then MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
291,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (10.41 am)-I need to begin my rewent on to comment that ‘every single quarantine official said’ that black sigatoka had come in from the Torres Strait. That also is factually inaccurate. There have been previous outbreaks of black sigatoka and, as far as I am aware, no-one is aware of how the disease came into Australia. But, if the Jardine ferry has a role in it, then the member needs to remember that intrastate quarantine is of course the responsibility of state governments. The member for Kennedy commented that foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the Indonesian archipelago. That is factually incorrect. He commented on citrus canker and allegations that citrus material was smuggled into Australia. I met the person who made those allegations. I found him credible, but in the end there was no collaboration for the stories that he presented. If the member for Kennedy has evidence that somebody smuggled citrus material into the Emerald district, then he must put that evidence forward. The Crown prosecutors examined the evidence and were not prepared to proceed with any kind of prosecution because they regarded the evidence as insufficient. The member for Kennedy claimed that I allowed beef to come in from Brazil, a foot-and-mouth disease country. The beef that he was referring to was processed beef. It came from areas where there was no foot-and-mouth disease. It was disposed of when not required in Australia, in accordance with New South Wales law. He then went on to say that I have made negative comments about ethanol-completely false. The reality is that I was the one who announced the very first commitment by an Australian government to ethanol. In the 2001 election campaign, we committed to having 350 million litres of ethanol in our fuel mix by 2010. I have been a committed and enthusiastic supporter of ethanol and actually delivered results. It is sad that in the bill currently before the House this government is actually cutting assistance to the ethanol industry in a very backward-looking initiative. He also spoke about an ‘outbreak of white spot which has devastatingly damaged the prawn-farming industry of Australia’. That simply has not happened. He then criticised me for supporting the harvesting of flood waters in Northern Queensland. Of course this is fundamentally a state responsibility, but as minister I funded over $1 million of projects to identify ways of harnessing the waters of Northern Australia in an environmentally friendly way to make better use of the opportunities that are provided in that area. He criticised my role in the introduction of the mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector and in the debate about the managed investment schemes. Frankly, he was never in the cabinet room so he has no idea what I argued in relation to any of those issues, but what he has said in those paragraphs is completely wrong and totally misrepresents my position. He also criticises me for commenting that we needed to address the issue of woody weeds, particularly the prickly acacia tree. Again, weed management is a state responsibility, but under my term as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry we introduced a range of major new eradication programs for weeds and I put before the parliament a practical way to take those initiatives forward in an environmentally friendly way. He criticised the assistance packages which the federal government has provided for the fishing industry, the tobacco industry and a number of other industries which have been adversely affected by deregulation. Does he suggest that the government should not have provided assistance to those industries? He accuses me of winding back the tobacco industry and MAIN COMMITTEE then providing compensation for the farmers. The reality is that the wind-back occurred before my time as minister. The compensation package was after my term as minister, so he has given me credit there where it is not in fact due. He blamed me for the deregulation of the egg, the sugar and the dairy industries. There were no federal regulations to be eliminated in any of those sectors. It was the states that eliminated the regulation of the egg industry, the sugar industry and the dairy industry. We came in to assist sugar producers and dairy producers because the states would do nothing to mitigate the impact, the appalling impact on those industries as a result of deregulation. So we put in place a $2 billion assistance package at the request of the dairy industry and something like $400 million to support the sugar industry. The egg industry deregulation fundamentally occurred before my time, so his references there to compensation are also inaccurate. The member for Kennedy then went on to suggest that Ian Causley had resigned within four years because of his dissatisfaction with deregulation of the dairy industry. Ian’s name has been taken in vain. He retired, I think everyone would accept, because he had served a long and faithful time in the parliament-eight years after dairy deregulation. Then perhaps comes the saddest part of all. At the end, the member for Kennedy made a statement that he has made before: ‘every four days in Australia a dairy farmer commits suicide’-every four days. That would mean 90 a year, 720 since dairy deregulation has occurred. I know there have been suicides in the dairy industry and indeed in a number of other industries, and it grieves me deeply, but it is simply ridiculous to suggest that a dairy farmer is committing suicide every four days. We did put in place programs to try to support farmers through these difficult times. The statement is simply wrong. And finally he said that a sugar farmer commits suicide every two months. Again the statement is simply factually inaccurate. It is disappointing that the member for Kennedy resorts to these vicious personal attacks. His entire speech, with just one or two lines excepted, was a personal attack on me. I think it was unbecoming of him and certainly it did not reflect well on the processes of the parliament. The bill that we are dealing with, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008, essentially involves some new government programs, but I want to talk particularly about the savage cuts that are included in this legislation. The venom with which the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Labor Party in government are attacking people who live in rural and regional Australia is alarming. The cuts that are being dealt with in this legislation will attack the victims of inflation and higher interest rates, not those who are causing the problems. The biggest cuts to a range of programs have been in rural and regional areas. Many are targeting the poorest Australians. They will weaken the economy, not strengthen it. Labor said before the election that it would support the needy and the underprivileged, reduce petrol and grocery prices, deal with the skills shortages and plan for the future in areas of infrastructure and the environment. That was in 2007. Just a few months later Labor has cut funding that helped drought-stricken farmers and regional communities. It has speared research into alternative fuels. It has stopped a funding program for broadband internet access. It has smashed an apprenticeships scheme to skill rural workers. It has cut funding for the Bureau of Meteorology. It has abolished a program to help sea-change and tree-change communities deal with rapid growth. It has stripped funding for a program to protect children from internet perverts MAIN COMMITTEE and it has sliced into one of the most important plans for Australia’s future: the National Plan for Water Security. Many of these cuts represent broken election commitments. The excuse that the finance minister has made for these cuts is that they will put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The reality is that we all know that, even if these $600 million cuts were genuine, their impact on inflation would be negligible, particularly since an underestimation in one government announced program has already taken up $400 million of that money. Labor announced a program to give tax concessions to overseas companies in Australia which they costed at $15 million. We already know that the cost of that program is $400 million. So essentially all of these so-called cuts have already been lost. But many of the cuts are not real. The minister has gone to great lengths to point out that no farmer will actually lose any of their drought assistance, and yet over $110 million of the $600 million comes from drought assistance. This is because there was a lesser number of applications than expected and so the funds will not be used. So in this instance it is not a real cut at all and its impact on inflation will clearly be nothing. However, there are genuine cuts to drought assistance. The decision to take $10 million off research and development for drought is a real cut and it means that this critical area of research and development will be lost. Once more, it breaks a Labor Party election promise. Labor said they would not cut research and development; within months they have slashed $10 million from important research and development work. It has also decided to abolish the promotional campaign to make farmers and small business aware of their entitlements under the drought relief program. Labor is not technically cutting the drought assistance-not at this stage, anyhow-but it is not going to tell anybody how you can access it. It is not going to give any information to the very people who may need to access that information. In fact, I heard the Prime Minister say yesterday in question time that he is going to send the drought bus, which was part of the information program, up to Mackay, to the flood victims. The flood victims do need assistance, although Mackay has a fine Centrelink office and staff who have been able to do that work. The drought bus is being taken into the flood areas to keep it active because the government does not see a role for it anymore in telling drought-stricken farmers or businesses about their needs. These are real cuts that are clearly designed to disadvantage those people who need to access this funding. The government wants to address inflation issues, and that is reasonable-it should do that. Good economic management requires that inflation be kept under control. However, Labor is making much of its five-point plan to deal with inflation and, frankly, none of those five points will do a single thing to put downward pressure on inflation for at least a decade. It is an empty plan. It has no vision at all on how to deal with inflation in the short to medium term. Let us look at the five-point plan as announced by the minister on 6 February. The first point is: ‘achieve a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09, provided growth prospects remain as currently anticipated’. If, in fact, growth prospects remain as currently anticipated, we will have a 1.5 per cent budget surplus. The government do not have to do anything to achieve that. That has been delivered to them by the previous government and its sound economic management. So the first point is absolutely empty. MAIN COMMITTEE The second point is: ‘examine all options to provide real incentive to encourage private savings’. No plan-just an inquiry. An inquiry into private savings is not going to deliver any downward pressure on inflation, and we all know that. The third point is: ‘tackle chronic skill shortages in the economy’. It is important to deal with the supply of labour and skills to our economy. But, if the only solution to upgrading skills is to build trade colleges, that will take at least a decade, and probably even longer, before it delivers any significant additional numbers of skilled tradesmen into the workforce. It is not a solution for inflation today-or even next year or the following year. It is something that may need to be done, but it is something whose benefits are a decade off. The fourth point is: ‘provide national leadership to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks’. It is a little unusual to have that claim coming from Labor, since it is the Labor states that failed to invest in the ports, neglected the rail system and ensured that bottlenecks were created in the first place. The previous government had committed huge funding sums to roads and to rail; and yet, in the first round of announcements, we are told that all of the commitments that the previous government made to infrastructure are now going to be sent off to a new bureaucratic organisation to be reviewed. So, in fact, nothing is going to happen to deliver relief from infrastructure bottlenecks for years while this bureaucracy re-examines all of the decisions that have been made previously. Never forget that the choice of priorities was not something that the previous federal government did alone. The state governments-all Labor state governments-were involved in the development of the priorities of the projects. The other very interesting thing that has come through from Senate estimates is that the promises that Labor has made are not going to be subject to any scrutiny. They are just going to go ahead. But ones made by the previous government are going to be dissected and dealt with again. Labor in the last election campaign promised to spend less money on infrastructure than did the coalition-less money. So how can their current programs do anything to deliver downward pressure on inflation? The final point is: ‘provide practical ways of helping people re-enter the workforce and remove disincentives to working hard-to lift workforce participation’. That is fine. Why, therefore, did the Labor Party oppose the Welfare to Work reforms, which were designed to increase workforce participation and to provide assistance to people who can enter the workforce to do what they can in the community? The fact is that this five-point plan is economic illiteracy. The government has no plan to address inflation over the medium term. It would be at least a decade before these initiatives could have any effect whatsoever. I have to say that I really dread the day when the Prime Minister realises that his first choice of Treasurer is not up to the job and he appoints the finance minister to take his place, because the venom and the viciousness with which the finance minister has attacked programs-in his first round of cuts-which are designed to support some of the most disadvantaged people in the community is particularly disappointing. In the short time that is left to me, I will refer to some of these specific cuts. It is interesting to note that the cuts will be made across quite a range of areas where the incoming government professes a particular interest. For instance, Labor says that it believes in reducing global warming, that it wants to do something about addressing greenhouse emissions, and yet these cuts take $15 million away from the FutureGen project. They take $16 million from the Asia Pacific Forestry Skills and Capacity Building Program and the energy technology MAIN COMMITTEE network. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority is to lose $45 million from its critical work in trying to address the water issues in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Low Emissions Technology and Abatement program loses $2 million and, in another attack on people who live in country areas, the Renewable Remote Power Generation program is to have $42 million taken away. Does this government believe in renewable energy, or does it believe that is it just city people who should have renewable energy and people who live in remote areas should be denied that support? As I mentioned previously, $16 million is going from the ethanol support program. This government clearly does not believe in alternative fuels, because it is slashing the very program that would have been designed to achieve our objectives in relation to renewable energy. The government has slashed the Australia Connected BroadbandNow program, designed to give regional people access to broadband services. And then the Growing Regions program has gone. Labor says it is interested in dealing with infrastructure. This was a program to provide infrastructure for the most needy communities in Australia-the fast-growing areas, the tree-change, sea-change areas, where there is a desperate need to provide infrastructure to support those fast-growing populations. This program was axed altogether. A government that says it is into infrastructure cuts road funding, cuts rail funding and cuts the program that would have provided infrastructure support for the most needy communities in Australia. These cuts are ill-targeted. They will do little or nothing to reduce inflation. The government has no plan to deal effectively with inflation, and these cuts can therefore only be seen as a get-square by a government wanting to attack people who live outside the capital cities. (Time expired) the Nationals, the member for Wide Bay, basically trying to make an argument that the Rudd government is not facing up to inflation pressures which his government left to the incoming government. And then he decided to argue about expenditure cuts that the present government is trying to make to get control of inflation and to keep interest rates under control. That was a very poor effort from the Leader of the Nationals. I want to take this opportunity, in the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008, which will ask for money from the parliament for more expenditure on different needs of the country, to speak about health and the challenges facing the nation with regard to health. The new Rudd Labor government has inherited a health scheme that has suffered from 11 years of total neglect. We have had the blame game. It has been detrimental to health services and thus detrimental to the health of communities. It says something when, as a new government, we have had to commit to spending over $2.5 billion to improve hospital waiting lists, increase nurse training positions and develop new infrastructure through GP superclinics, and yet this will barely scratch some of the surfaces. We know that more will need to be done. This is just a start. We are playing catch-up because the previous government had no understanding of health. It had no vision for the future and no plan. We do have a plan-a plan to restore services such as dental health and a plan to build services such as GP superclinics. We have a plan and a vision for the future, to improve health outcomes for everyday Australians, particularly in primary health care and the prevention and management of chronic diseases. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
292,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.02 Am),"What a lot of codswallop that was from the Leader ofBut we need to be careful how we spend the money, we need to make sure we get value for money and we need to bring the people of Australia with us on this journey. We know that it will be a rough journey at times. The previous government did not spend a lot on health in my electorate-and they did not spend much on roads either. So there will be a few rough roads that we have to ride on this journey of reform. Any reforms that we make, any changes that need to occur, must be made in consultation with communities and not forced upon them. Labor has some good policies on health, which like all our policies have been developed through extensive consultation with stakeholders. This needs to continue. Rural and regional communities feel vulnerable. They have limited services, limited health services and limited opportunities for training and employment. We need to look after regional communities. It is when there is change that regional communities feel most vulnerable. Some communities in my electorate have recently seen health services removedhospital beds and aged care beds-and 24-hour emergency outpatient services have changed from face-to-face care to a phone call centre service. The state government was forced to make changes after years of neglect in funding by those in the previous federal government. Those opposite may disagree all they like with this assumption, but I remember the last healthcare agreements, when the states were bludgeoned into signing an all-or-nothing proposal. We all remember the previous health minister’s remarks when he was asked to commence the current round of negotiations. He was not concerned. He was only concerned about the election. He was much more concerned about the election than doing his job. That is the truth and I think everybody in Australia knows it. It has been upsetting to see how people have played politics with the communities of my electorate that have been affected by the changes. The state government announced the changes in May last year. In September, some three months later, the federal government announced up to $1 million each for the Ouse and Rosebery hospitals to restore services. Why then? Why wait three months? We got the answer on Monday night courtesy of Four Corners, didn’t we? There was a particularly bad poll-that is, bad for the government of the day-in early September, at the time of APEC. So the former health minister scrambled in desperation and threw $1 million to the local councils to use. They did not see the colour of the money. They only got weasel words that built up an expectation in a community desperate to keep services they had become familiar with. It was a hoax. No money came. It was never handed over. This was bad policy, bad politics and bad use of taxpayers’ money. There was no plan, no vision and no outcome because there was no follow-through. It was also thoughtless and thoroughly disturbing for communities who had had their hopes built up by a few feral politicians and then dashed because they were not told the truth. I am continuing to help people to develop a proposal for Rosebery, just as I have lobbied for and helped the people of Ouse, who have developed a proposal for an MPS. Both the state government and the new federal government have agreed to consider the feasibility of this. We are moving forward at Ouse, working with people to develop their ideas and then seeing if they can work. We will do the same for Rosebery. But there is not a quick fix for either community-certainly not the quick fix that the previous government tried to make out that there was. Care must be taken. We cannot afford to waste money but we cannot afford to neglect the health of rural and regional communities. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the keys to good health is access to services-and quality services at that. A report on rural health by the Institute of Medicine in the United States acknowledges the obvious: it is harder to deliver quality services in rural and regional areas. Of course it is. It is also important that we provide those services, but it may mean bringing much more innovation to the service delivery. The government’s National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission will be asked to explicitly identify a long-term plan for improving rural health services. The government’s other commitments include funding for new clinics, services and health infrastructure in individual rural centres and a new program to improve the health of Indigenous children. Specific rural workforce commitments include $2.5 million to double the number of John Flynn scholarships available to undergraduate medical students to undertake placements in rural and remote medical practices, $6 million to support the Specialist Obstetrician Locum Scheme and expand it to provide support for GP proceduralists, $2.5 million to establish a rural and remote clinical placement scheme for allied health students and $9 million to support specialists delivering outreach services to rural and remote areas through additional funding of the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program. So Labor has promised extra funding for rural placements for medical students, extra university training places for nurses, including some reserved for regional universities, and a $50 million commitment to my state to help repair the neglect. We must take care now in spending health funds, and regional communities must be the beneficiaries of this funding as well as those in the cities. The future health of communities in my electorate, in my state, in my country depends on responsible planning and administration and not on knee-jerk reactions to bad polls just before an election. It is going to take time, and we are only just beginning, but the plan is there and the will is there, and I think the understanding of the Australian people is there. There are many ways of developing our health care, and now is the time to start exploring those options. What our system tends to do is deal with sick people, and usually when somebody’s illness reaches a critical point we want to relieve symptoms. This is always the expensive end of things. What if health care was more involved with keeping people healthy or, when they have been sick, helping them to recover their health and keep healthy? Where do we go for advice? There is nothing under our current system that allows an individual to go to a one-stop shop to help them set up a health program to remain healthy or become healthy. It is time to deal with current lifestyles, to start looking at those at risk and to try and move the time when they seek help so that they have the opportunity to deal with a problem before it becomes a medical issue. For example, a lifestyle disease such as type 2 diabetes, seen as a major problem across Western nations, could be dealt with earlier. There are many other potential problems for which, with intervention at an earlier time, critical medical treatment could be circumvented. We have become so reliant on medical expertise and machinery that we seem to have lost the ability to take some responsibility ourselves. We need to be retaught and, in seeking that tuition, to take responsibility for our lives and our health. There needs to be some assistance. It should be part of the overall health care and, therefore, attract Medicare assistance. The National Health Act, which came into being just after the Second World War, has remained geared to deal with communicable diseases, or MAIN COMMITTEE those that deal with bacteria and viruses, and environmentally based diseases stemming from war deprivation and primitive hygiene conditions. Today perhaps we should be looking at lifestyle diseases and all those troubles that we in our affluent society bring on ourselves: heart problems, diabetes, stroke, cancer from smoking, alcohol and drug related sicknesses, obesity et cetera. There will still be some traditional medical problems, but even some of those can be caught earlier and dealt with if people know where to go when they have some idea that something is wrong. Tasmanians have always been innovators. There are some interesting developments there in dealing with lifestyle health issues. I believe this will lead to major changes in the way we view health, and the community will want to learn how to prevent getting sick rather than having to go through treatment because of illness. Hopefully, this will lead to valuing our doctors more and allowing them to delegate some of their less medical activities to other professionals to let them get on with their own crucial task of helping those who are sick. Lifestyle health is linked to the ability to afford healthy foods and a reasonable roof over one’s head. As we all know, rents and grocery prices are rising and those on fixed incomes will suffer most. Labor has promised to try to help here and understands the link between good health and good fresh food and food preparation. The fast food syndrome has helped busy people both looking after families and in the workforce, but it has more undesirable side effects. We must act smarter and we must involve the community more in dealing with the problems that come from our current lifestyles. They are so different to those of 50 years ago, and we need new ideas to deal with them. I am really glad to be in a new, fresh government that is forward thinking and is considering the difficulties that all Australians face today. We can work smarter and we can have alternatives to the way things have traditionally been done, whether in health, housing, cost of living, education or any of the major expenses that we face in our lifestyles today. am)-I would like to address the appropriation bills in the context of some of the government’s programs for the country and also my own electorate of Charlton. One of the central challenges for any government is the management of the economy and utilisation of the country’s economic capacity for the social progress of its people. That is the Labor way. We are a forward-looking party that looks, in particular, to use economic progress to achieve social dividends. We are a party keen to make progress on both economic and social fronts to make a better and more just society. In contrast, since entering this place, I have been struck by the somewhat backwardlooking nature of the opposition. They appear unwilling to turn their minds to the future economic and social challenges we will face, intent perhaps on defending a somewhat flawed record on economic management. I come to this place keen to be involved in facing this challenge for the future, which I see as essential not only for our present generation but for future generations. The bills I am addressing today outline part of the government’s plans for the key economic challenges facing the nation. The bills also address another area of my interest, given my role as the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement-namely, defence matters. I MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
293,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (11.18would also like to give an update today on progress that has been made on specific commitments relevant to my electorate of Charlton. Firstly, though, I turn to the economic challenges that the country currently faces. As I see it, I think there are two key challenges that the government is facing on the economic front. They are the war on inflation, which has resulted from a previous government’s neglect of inflationary pressures that have been building for some time, and the need for strong, sustainable and responsible economic growth in an uncertain international economic environment. These important goals are not always complementary in terms of the policy responses they may evoke. But what is required is a thoughtful and considered approach-and this is not what we received from the previous government. Instead, their negligent management of the economy has left us with a situation where we have had 11 successive interest rate rises and we are currently experiencing a 16-year high in the underlying inflation rate. Inflationary pressures are still high, as we know. The minutes of the Reserve Bank meeting in February, which were released yesterday, reveal just how much that is playing on the mind of the RBA board. It debated whether the change in the cash rate should be an increase of 25 or 50 basis points, given its concerns. The bank is also predicting that inflation will remain as high as 3½ per cent until around the middle of 2010. In recognition of the significant challenge that we now face, the new government has released a five-point plan to combat inflation, which also allows for investment in the future growth of the economy. It is a plan that encapsulates both macroand micro-economic initiatives aimed at addressing demand and supply side inflationary pressures. Firstly, the government will exercise fiscal restraint, as we have heard, to take the pressure off demand. As outlined by the Treasurer and the finance minister, the government will run a strong budget surplus of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP. Secondly, in the period ahead, the government will be examining all options to provide real incentive to encourage private savings-and that is very important in reducing inflationary pressure. Thirdly, the government will be unfolding our plan for tackling chronic skill shortages in the country-and I will say a little more about that in a moment. Fourthly, the government will provide national leadership to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks. Fifthly, the government will provide practical ways of helping people to re-enter the workforce and to remove disincentives to working-in other words, to lift workforce participation. For the longer term, the government is determined to deal with the chronic investment deficits on the capacity side of the economy in skills and in infrastructure. As can be seen by the initiatives contained within the appropriation bills, this is more than just an abstract commitment; it is a concrete guide to the way the government will be addressing the challenges we face. But one of the first components and important elements of the bills addresses the need for fiscal responsibility and constraint. It includes the first stage of the government’s Expenditure Review Committee processes. The ERC is essentially fulfilling the government’s commitment to identify reductions, savings and offsets from the previous government’s spending program so that such reductions, savings and offsets may be redirected to better and more effective program priorities. Already the government has been able to identify over $642 million of taxpayers’ money that was being spent unnecessarily by the previous government, generally for its own political purposes. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to talk just briefly about one of the types of savings we are talking about, which has been of some interest to me. Within the bills is contained a $30 million saving in 2007-08 due to administrative efficiencies arising from the transition from Australian workplace agreements to collective enterprise agreements and statutory individual contracts. This is just one of the direct costs of the former Howard government’s extreme industrial relations laws and it is evidence too that the system of AWAs was complex and placed excessive burdens and demands on employers and employees. In contrast, Labor’s approach to workplace relations will be far more flexible and, of course, far more fair for employees-and I will be speaking on the government’s transitional Workplace Relations Bill later today. The government’s ERC in a very short time has been able to explode the myth that the previous government was somehow fiscally prudent; of course it was not. There were multiple cases of profligate and porkbarrelling expenditures exacted by the former government that have caused harm to the economy. The fact is that, on economic management, the former government had some serious failures. It was irresponsible and it did contribute to rising inflationary pressures through spending but also because of its failure to address the capacity constraints that are confronting our economy. Notwithstanding a 50 per cent improvement in the terms of trade-a historical increase in the terms of trade for this country and a perhaps once in a generation opportunity to invest in the nation’s future and to address supply-side constraints-the former Howard government failed. One important area in which it did fail was in relation to skills. The appropriation bills will help to rectify that failure. To give just one example of the inflationary pressure generated by the skills shortages-and the previous government’s failure to address them. I will refer to the labour market in the defence industry, where anecdotal evidence is now demonstrating that wage pressures due to skills shortages are generating potential wage increases in the order of approximately eight to 12 per cent at the higher skill levels. These of course will add to costs in the defence acquisition and sustainment processes. So we have demand rising faster than supply. There are two ways to rectify this: firstly, we can increase inputs, capital and labour, to increase output to more approximate demand; and, secondly, we can become more efficient at using our inputs so that we produce more with the same inputs-in other words, increase productivity. Increasing skills formation achieves both of these goals. Regular surveys identified the availability of skilled employees as the No. 1 constraint on business investment. According to the previous government’s own estimates, Australia faces a shortage of more than 200,000 skilled workers over the next five years. By increasing skills formation, we will allow businesses to produce more, thereby relieving inflationary pressure. Secondly, by increasing the skills base of the country, we will increase Australia’s human capital, and this will encourage productivity growth-increasing our international competitiveness and allowing us to produce more with the same quantity of inputs, thereby placing downward pressure on the inflation rate. I am pleased to say that the appropriation bills that are before the House contain a number of measures to tackle Australia’s current skills deficit. Included in these is the establishment of the National Secondary School Computer Fund. The Australian government has committed $900 million for the National Secondary School Computer Fund, which will be delivered over the four years 2008-2011. The fund will allow all Australian secondary schools to apply for grants of up to $1 million, dependent on enrolment and the need to assist them to provide for MAIN COMMITTEE new or upgraded information and communications technology for their students in years 9 to 12. All schools providing secondary education will benefit from the fund. Funding can be used to purchase computers, data projectors, interactive whiteboards and other information communications technology equipment and support. The first $100 million of the fund will be directed to schools with the greatest need from June 2008. These schools will be identified by a preliminary survey to identify the number of computers currently in secondary schools. The survey results will facilitate the commencement of the application process for these schools in early March 2008, with applications closing in April 2008. I am encouraging all of the local secondary schools in my electorate to apply, and I know the Deputy Prime Minister has also written to them. That is an extremely important program in the electorate of Charlton, as I am sure it is in many other electorates around the country. Many schools have few computers, poor access to the internet and little capacity for students to learn all that they possibly can from information and communications technology. Another program designed to address the skills deficit is the government’s Skilling Australia for the Future Program, which is to start in April 2008. This program will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places aimed at people currently outside of the workforce, thus lifting our participation rate. As members of my electorate and the Australian public generally well know, the previous government failed completely when it came to vocational education. The funding of 20,000 vocational education and training places by the new government will begin to address this problem, but it is just the start. Our commitment will extend past these initial places to cover 450,000 over the next four years. This will significantly help to address one of the capacity constraints that we are currently facing and that the previous government failed to fix. Developing additional economic, social and innovation infrastructure is also essential if we are to improve the performance of the economy and our quality of life. It will relieve capacity constraints further, increase productivity and put downward pressure on inflation. We are seeing the impact of infrastructure bottlenecks-whether it is clogged ports preventing resource exports or congested roads preventing efficient transportation of goods and services. The arteries of the national economy are clogging up and the economy is feeling some of the strain. On the other hand, we have all witnessed the economic vitality engendered by wellplanned infrastructure developments. The commitment of the Curtin and the Chifley governments to postwar reconstruction and infrastructure development was a significant factor in the postwar boom. Looking at overseas examples, in a more contemporary environment, massive infrastructure investment, most notably in knowledge infrastructure, helped the Republic of Ireland, for example, and Singapore to develop some of the most advanced economies now in the world. The historical and international examples demonstrate the economic benefits of coordinated infrastructure investment-something which the former Howard government did not believe in. The bills before us also provide funding for the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, in recognition that there is a great need in this country for a nationally coordinated approach to further infrastructure reform. I have been a long-time advocate for such an approach-and I believe it is critical if we are to enhance Australia’s economic performance and raise national productivity. Infrastructure Australia will help drive investment where it is needed most, enMAIN COMMITTEE suring that it fuels the nation’s productivity capacity and not inflation. It will also allow for infrastructure decisions to be made on the basis of need, not on the basis of pork-barrelling marginal seats. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with identifying and coordinating the provision of national infrastructure. It will also help develop a strategic approach to meet infrastructure demands, including a stocktake of the adequacy and capacity of infrastructure, effective management of the infrastructure and factors influencing user demand, a comprehensive planning framework which identifies further demands and challenges, a regulatory and pricing framework which encourages increasingly efficient use of infrastructure and timely investment in new and updated infrastructure where that is the best option. The members in my electorate clearly understand the need for a coordinated and sensible approach to infrastructure planning, and I am glad to be able to report to them that the government is working hard to implement such an approach. Another feature of the bills concerns the establishment of the Enterprise Connect program. I am very pleased about this commitment. This model, which draws on the best features of QMI Solutions and the manufacturing advisory service, will become an essential tool for innovative businesses. Businesses will be able to access Enterprise Connect centres to find and adapt the latest research and technology, get help in solving identified problems, work out how new processes can help their business and cut through red tape to identify sources of government support for their activity. Given my commitment to the manufacturing industry over a long period of time and the importance of that industry to the Hunter region, I am delighted that $100 million of the funding will be devoted to a manufacturing network. This will increase the productive performance of manufacturers, thereby increasing our global competitiveness. I am also very pleased about the $20 million commitment to the establishment of the Clean Energy Enterprise Connect Centre. The centre will help make Australia’s clean energy smalland medium-sized enterprises export ready, with benchmarking of services, practical assistance and access to prototyping and testing facilities. As most of the clean energy technologies will involve significant amounts for manufacturing-for example in photovoltaic cells, wind turbines et ceterathis is an extremely important initiative. While I might be a little biased, I can think of no better location for this centre than the Hunter Valley. It is an area that has led the country in understanding the challenges and has embraced clean energy technology. It is an area that is suffering from the downturn in traditional heavy industries. It is home to the CSIRO Energy Centre, which sets a new benchmark in ecologically sustainable design by showcasing energy generation initiatives. GP superclinics are also a feature of the appropriation bills, and I have already outlined a number of things about that elsewhere. This is an extremely important component of the appropriation bills from the standpoint of my electorate of Charlton. There is a real need in my electorate to improve the ratio of GPs to population, which currently runs at one to 2,000. It is extremely difficult for many people to get to see a doctor. Once completed, a GP superclinic in my region is expected to include an after-hours service, a chronic disease management service and a range of allied health services, including physiotherapy and podiatry. I am looking forward to working with other health agencies and representatives in the electorate to get the GP superclinic established in a location identified as soon as possible. MAIN COMMITTEE I wish to turn to some of the defence measures contained within the appropriation bills. The bills provide for stage 2 of the Enhanced Land Force initiative. The ELF initiative will see the establishment of two additional infantry battle groups, each comprising an infantry battalion and supporting command and control, combat support and combat service support capabilities. The funding allocated in these bills is for phase 2 of the Enhanced Land Force initiative, which raises the second battalion. This second battalion will be raised by reraising 8/9RAR as the second motorised infantry battalion in south-east Queensland with operational capability by 2010. In my time as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement, I have gained an appreciation of the increasing importance of our Army in the future strategic environment. SoI am very pleased to support this aspect of the bill. We also, in these bills, provide for two measures that will help our troops currently serving overseas. For our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan the government is providing nearly $70 million to enhance the protective capability of the Bushmaster infantry mobility vehicles that are used to support our operations there. We are also providing $12.4 million to enhance the surveillance capability of the ADF in support of our operations in Iraq. I am very pleased that these are contained in the appropriation bills and to indicate my support for them. I conclude by saying I am very pleased to see the wide range of initiatives contained within these bills. I am also very pleased about the number of different programs that will benefit the people of my electorate of Charlton. I commend the bills to the House. bills, which cover a number of areas. I wish to address my remarks to one of those areas in particular, and that is the additional funding for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts of $50.8 million for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park structural adjustment package. This package relates to the major global initiative for coral reef conservation during the past two years, which was passed by the Parliament of Australia in early 2004 with the declaration of ‘highly protected’ status for 33 per cent of the whole province of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area, referred to as ‘no take zones’. This was an increase on the approximately five per cent of the Great Barrier Reef that had been protected since the Great Barrier Reef was first zoned for protection back in 1981. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority took the view that there was increasing scientific evidence that the existing multiple-use zoning was inadequate to conserve the full range of biodiversity for the entire Barrier Reef. For example, dugong populations had declined by 97 per cent since the 1960s, nesting loggerhead turtles had declined by 50 to 80 percent over four decades, commercial and recreational fishing had doubled since 1990 and populations of major target species of fish were reduced and were composed of small individual fish. Furthermore, the annual flow of sediment and nutrients into the Great Barrier Reef had increased fourfold and the reefs had suffered from severe coral bleaching, a series of cyclones and outbreaks of the crown of thorns starfish. I well remember the debate that occurred at that time. I was shadow minister for the environment at the time. I urged the government to act on the science and, to its credit, the government did act on the science. The action taken was that no-take protection was extended to a minimum of 20 per cent of each of the 70 bioregions of the Great Barrier Reef such that the marine park now includes protection for 33 SHUFHQWLQWKHZRUOG¶s largest network of highly protected areas. The government is providing assistance, which may include licence buyouts MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
294,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.37 Am),"I am pleased to speak on the appropriationfor affected parties such as commercial fishers with reduced income earning potential as a result of the new zoning-and an increase in that assistance is, of course, the substance of this bill. The question that needs to be asked is: has the rezoning and the protection of one-third of the Great Barrier Reef from commercial and recreational fishing worked? This question has been examined by the School of Marine and Tropical Biology, by the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University at Townsville and by researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The title of their paper is ‘Rapid response to world’s largest marine reserve network’. They seek to inform the intense scientific and sociopolitical debate about the efficacy of no-fishing areas as tools for biodiversity, conservation and fisheries management. They conclude that a rapid, positive biological response over an unprecedented spatial scale-over 1,000 kilometres-has occurred in response to the recent implementation of the world’s largest network of no-take marine reserves. The abstract of their paper says that no-take marine reserves offer a means to counter the loss of marine biodiversity, that the world’s largest network of such reserves protecting over 100,000 square kilometres of coral reef was established on the Great Barrier Reef in 2004 and that closing such a large area to all fishing was socially and politically controversial-and, indeed, it was. I well remember the former member for Dawson, the former member for Leichhardt and Queensland coalition senators attacking the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority over this issue. Given that controversy, it is imperative that the effectiveness of the new reserve network be assessed. The researchers have found that there were significant increases in density of the major target species of the reefline fisheries in marine reserves in just two years and that the increases were consistent over an unprecedented scale exceeding 1,000 kilometres. The team from James Cook University used underwater visual census to survey reef life on coral reefs on three inshore island groups, both before and after-1½ to two years after-the implementation of the no-take marine reserves. At the same time, sites on 28 pairs of no-take and open offshore reefs were surveyed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science. All the offshore survey reefs were initially open to fishing, but one reef per pair became no-take in 2004. The findings were that, after 1½ to two years of protection, the density of the primary target of reefline fisheries, coral trout, increased significantly in the no-take areas at Palm Island and the Whitsunday Islands, by over 60 per cent. There were small and insignificant changes where reefs remained open to fishing. That is good news too because it suggests that the reserve areas are capable of replenishing stocks and of acting as nurseries for the fished areas. Coral trout density in no-take areas increased relative to the open reefs in all three inshore regions, significantly so in the Whitsunday Islands. Over time, increased adult fish density in the no-take areas, they say, may enhance recruitment both inside and outside the no-take areas. The spatial scale of this positive response is unprecedented, occurring simultaneously over 1,000 kilometres offshore and 700 kilometres inshore. They say: Although preliminary, our results provide an encouraging message that bold political steps to protect biodiversity can produce rapid positive results for exploited species at ecosystem scales. This is excellent news indeed, and I want to congratulate the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on their work in making this zoning system happen and function as well as it has. I MAIN COMMITTEE also want to congratulate James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Science for the work that they have done in examining these issues. We should be under no illusions about the threats facing both the Great Barrier Reef and coral reefs right around the world. I want to draw the attention of the House to the definitive work done by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network back in 2004, the report of which is titled The status of the coral reefs of the world: 2004. It is quite encyclopedic and it is not possible to cover it all but I do want to use the example of the Caribbean to give the parliament something of the flavour of what is occurring in coral reefs around the world. This definitive work concludes that: Evidence is emerging of a definite, consistent and long-term decline in the status of coral reefs of the Caribbean. These are the conclusions of a group of researchers at the University of East Anglia, England, who analysed monitoring data from 263 sites from 65 separate studies spanning 3 decades ... The regional pattern of decline is alarming; with coral cover decreasing from more than 50% on average in 1977 to approximately 10% in 2001, i.e. a loss of 80% in 25 years. … … … Virtually all sites showed a decline in coral cover over the study period. … … … Most of the absolute loss in coral cover occurred in the 1980s, particularly in Jamaica and northern and southern Central America. These losses resulted from 3 major impacts. White-band disease swept through the region and caused massive destruction of ... corals; the mass mortality of the sea urchin ... resulted in sudden and massive overgrowth of algae, and the first major coral bleaching events also reduced coral cover. There was also the Reefs at Risk project in the Caribbean in 2004, which assessed coastal development, watershed based sediment and pollution, marine based pollution and damage, and overfishing threats throughout the wider Caribbean. Their findings were: That 64% of Caribbean coral reefs are threatened by high levels of human activities, especially the Eastern and Southern Caribbean ... Florida Keys, Yucatan ... Coastal development threatens 33% of the region’s reefs. The threat is greatest in the Lesser and Greater Antilles, Bay Islands of Honduras, Florida Keys, Yucatan and Southern Caribbean. Land-based sources of pollution and sediments threaten 35% of Caribbean coral reefs, most notably Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico ... Pollution and damage from ships threatens 15% of coral reefs, especially around large ports and cruise tourism centres. Over-fishing threatens more than 60% of Caribbean coral reefs, particularly on narrow coastal shelves near human population centres. Diseases and rising sea surface temperatures threaten reefs across the Caribbean. The underlying theme of the 2004 report is that coral reefs are under threat around the world. There have been more recent estimates. According to a 2006 report, Coral reef conservation: ... approximately 20% of the world’s coral reefs have been destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery. Of those remaining, one-quarter are under imminent risk of collapse and another quarter face long-term threat of collapse. A survey of the Caribbean has established that, since 1977, live coral across this region has decreased by between 10 and 50 per cent, exceeding the rate of decline for tropical forests. Coral cover lost in the Indian Ocean as a result of the 1998 coral bleaching event has also shown little recovery in many of the sites affected. MAIN COMMITTEE Researchers from the University of North Carolina, in a report released in August 2007, have found that coral coverage in the Indo-Pacific, an area stretching from Indonesia’s Sumatra island to French Polynesia, dropped 20 per cent in the past two decades. The Indo-Pacific contains 75 per cent of the world’s coral reefs and has played an important economic and cultural role in the region for hundreds of years. Their continued decline could mean the loss of millions of dollars in fisheries and tourism. The study showed that those reefs that were better managed to prevent overfishing were doing better in terms of fish population, but in terms of coral cover there was little difference between protected and unprotected reefs. The obvious conclusion from this is that warming seas as a result of climate change are likely to be driving the rapid decline in coral cover. The implications of this are that local measures aimed at conservation may mean little unless there is a global commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. In an article in the magazine Science in May last year, Terence Hughes, who is director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, indicated that if carbon dioxide emissions are not curtailed ‘we will eventually see reefs dominated by sea anemones and algae’-in other words, the coral will be gone. The biggest danger for reefs is bleaching and, despite the merits of various conservation initiatives, unless climate change is addressed these gains from local measures and local initiatives will be erased. It is clear that the key causes of coral reef degradation originate from human activities. They include overfishing, pollution and sedimentation due to coastal development, run-off from deforested lands and the impact of global warming. With projections of future rises in sea temperatures, a concerted global effort is required to tackle this problem. The 2004 coral reefs report to which I previously referred went to the issue of identifying threats and stresses to coral reefs in some detail. Clearly, in order to deal with the problems we need to understand what they are. The report identified: global change rates-coral bleaching, caused by elevated sea surface temperatures due to global climate change; rising levels of carbon dioxide-increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in seawater decreasing the calcification rates in coral reef organisms; and diseases, plagues and invasives-increases in diseases and plagues of coral predators that are increasingly linked to human disturbances in the environment. Then there are direct human pressures from overfishing-the harvesting of fishes and invertebrates beyond sustainable yields, including the use of damaging practices such as bomb and cyanide fishing; sediments from poor land use, deforestation and dredging; nutrients and chemical pollution; and both organic and inorganic chemicals carried with sediments in untreated sewage, waste from agriculture, animal husbandry and industry. Then there is the development of coastal areas-modification of coral reefs for urban, industrial, transport and tourism developments, including reclamation and the mining of coral reef rock and sand beyond sustainable limits. The report pointed to the human dimension issues of governance, awareness and political will. It noted rising poverty and increasing populations. It said that increasing populations put increasing pressures on coral reef resources beyond sustainable limits. It observed poor capacity for management and lack of resources. Most coral reef countries lack trained personnel for coral reef management, raising awareness, enforcement and monitoring. There is also a lack of adequate funding and logistic resources to implement effective conservation. Then there is the lack of political will and oceans governance. Most problems facing coral reefs can be solved if there is political will and effective and non-corrupt governance of resources. But MAIN COMMITTEE interventions by, and inertia in, global and regional organisations can impede national action to conserve coral reefs. I think it is impossible to overemphasise the importance of the responsibility that we have, the duty that we have, to protect the Great Barrier Reef and to use our influence internationally to tackle the problems afflicting both the Great Barrier Reef and the other great reef marvels of the world. What is happening to the coral reefs around the world is nothing short of tragic. We simply cannot sit idly by and allow this to continue. I remember years ago being able to go snorkelling on a coral reef. I am not a great swimmer, but it was a fabulous experience. I thought to myself, ‘How long has this been going on for?’ They are wonderful places. The Great Barrier Reef is described as one of the natural wonders of the world, and with good reason. We have an obligation to protect the Great Barrier Reef. We have an obligation to do everything we can internationally to protect other reefs-the Caribbean and all the other great reefs of the world-which are suffering even greater declines than the Great Barrier Reef is, to do everything we can to tackle those problems and to ensure that we hand on to future generations the Great Barrier Reef and other coral reefs in the kind of condition that they were handed down to us. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.56 am)-Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, I would like to commence my contribution by congratulating you on your election as member for Page and for your elevation to the Speaker’s panel. I look forward to seeing you in that chair on a number of occasions, and I really look forward to working with you over the life of this parliament. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008 are about delivering on the Rudd government’s election commitments. This legislation signals a very different approach to government. Gone is the mean-spirited, divisive, narrow approach of the Howard government-an approach that lacked any sort of vision, an approach that led from behind. We have moved to a new approach, an inclusive approach, a visionary approach-an approach that was signalled at the very start of this parliament with an apology to the Indigenous people of Australia. Whilst the Rudd government will be a reformist government and a government of great leadership, it will also be a very fiscally responsible government. That is why the Prime Minister has signalled our fiscal responsibility with his 10-point plan. The 10-point plan includes investing in an education revolution to lift the skills and know-how of the Australian workforce. The previous government ignored the skills crisis that existed in Australia. It chose to bury its head in the sand. It chose to let Australia enter the state that we are in at the moment, simply because it would not acknowledge the fact that we had a skills crisis. It was more about doing the workers over. It was more about giving it really hard to the hard working men and women of Australia. The second part of the Prime Minister’s plan is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Australian economy through a high-speed national broadband network. Within the electorate I represent in this parliament, Shortland, which is a metropolitan electorate, there are many residents who in the time of the Howard government just could not access basic broadband. The Rudd Labor government is going to get around this and make sure that the people of Australia are delivered high-speed broadband. The third point of the Prime Minister’s plan is to reform regulatory arrangements to minimise the compliance burdens on individuals and businesses. Members on this side of the House have seen, on occasions, how businesses are absolutely stifled and strangled by the MAIN COMMITTEE regulatory compliances that were put upon them by the Howard government. Similarly, individuals-constituents who I represent in this House-find that these restrictions, these requirements for them to jump through hoops just to get the most basic services, work against them. They work against them being able to develop the skills that they need to and work against them being able to access the knowledge that they need. These restrictions even work against their being able to access work. The fourth point of the Prime Minister’s plan is to take decisive action on the long-term challenges of climate change and the water shortages which threaten the viability of many Australian regions and industry sectors. The previous government ignored, for 11 long years, the fact that climate change even existed. It refused to sign Kyoto. I have never been more pleased with the action of any Australian government than I was with the action of the Rudd government in signing the Kyoto protocol, which it did right at the beginning of its term. The other point of this plan is to widen Australia’s economic engagement with key economies in the Asia-Pacific region. You can see by the actions of the Rudd government already that it has acted to see that this happens. The future of Australia is in our interaction with that region. The future of Australia is not the Howard way but rather the Rudd way. One of the issues that I would like to raise is the way that the Howard government chose to allocate funds. Those of us on this side of the parliament were constantly faced with the rorts of the Howard government, where funds were directed not based on merit but rather based on which National Party seat or marginal government seat that particular project happened to be in. The Regional Partnerships program was one of the vehicles for that. In my own area on the Central Coast we saw the Tumbi Creek fiasco. We on this side of the House will be adopting a very different approach to those projects in regional Australia and throughout the whole of Australia. We will have a very transparent approach, an approach that delivers to people in an open way, so that people can understand why that money has been allocated. The parliamentary secretary has undertaken an audit of all those projects that were previously promised money under the Regional Partnerships program. One of those projects was a project in my electorate, the Fernleigh Track, which was allocated $750,000 as part of a commitment made by the Rudd government in the lead-up to the last election. I would like to say today that that commitment will be delivered on. The parliamentary secretary has assured me that that will be the case. AndI would like to assure the people of Shortland electorate that the money for the Fernleigh Track will be delivered. It is a wonderful initiative, and one that is of regional importance. It is not only of importance within Shortland electorate; it has the support of both Newcastle and Lake Macquarie councils. A working group has been working on it for many years. That $750,000 will be coming the way of the Fernleigh Track. But I have to express my extreme disappointment at the Lake Macquarie City Council. When they heard about the audit, Lake Macquarie City Council did not come and see me. Rather, they ran to the media, I understand. I was contacted by the media. I learnt about the media’s concerns in relation to the Fernleigh Track not through the media but through a third party. It is my understanding that their concerns were tabled at a council meeting on Monday last week. I was contacted by a journalist the next day, and then some time during the day there was a message for me that an employee of the council wished to talk to me. What causes me even more concern is that Councillor Coghlan of Lake Macquarie City Council, despite assurances and despite my communication with the council, has been running around part of MAIN COMMITTEE the Shortland electorate saying that the funding for the track is in doubt. His actions stand condemned, and I am sure that the community will judge him on his actions at the next local government election. Another Rudd government commitment to the people of the Shortland electorate was the reopening of the Belmont Medicare office, an office that was closed by the Howard government in 1998, despite the fact that it was a high-volume office, despite the fact that it serviced a very elderly community and despite the fact that its need was well and truly established. I would like to put on the record here today my appreciation of the Minister for Health and Ageing for her commitment to open that Medicare office and I know that the people of Belmont, Swansea and surrounding areas will be extremely happy about its reopening. It will be reopened because it is needed. Health has been a very big issue within the Shortland electorate. There is a chronic doctor shortage. I have been speaking to the Minister for Health and Ageing. With our different approach to health, I am sure that we will be delivering to the people of the Shortland electorate on health. There is also a crisis in dental care, with pensioners waiting very long times to access dental treatment. Once again, the Rudd government will deliver on its commitment to the people of Shortland and Australia to make sure that they do not have to live in pain and agony and have their whole physical well-being undermined by poor dental health. The Rudd government’s approach to health is very different from that of the Howard government. Gone is the blame game and we now have a new era of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. Under the Rudd government, many of the recommendations of The blame game report, which was brought down in the last parliament, will be implemented in contrast to the approach that was adopted by the previous government. I notice that in the appropriation bills mention is made of immigration and citizenship. I hate to return to the theme of Lake Macquarie City Council, but on Australia Day the Mayor of Lake Macquarie refused to allow the representative of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Greg Combet, the honourable member for Charlton, to deliver his message at the citizenship ceremony. In the time that I have been attending citizenship ceremonies I have never seen that done by a mayor or a general manager. I understand the general manager was in agreement. I attend citizenship ceremonies in the Wyong Shire Council and Lake Macquarie City Council areas. I have written to the minister asking him to give me a ruling on the breach of the code of practice for citizenship ceremonies by the Mayor of the Lake Macquarie City Council-Councillor Greg Piper, who is an Independent-in his refusal to allow the honourable member for Charlton to deliver the minister’s address. One of the first instructions the Prime Minister gave to his members was to visit schools in their electorate. I have a very strong relationship with schools in my electorate. The schools in my electorate gave me a pretty strong message about the types of things that they need. For a very long period of time they felt marginalised by the previous government’s approach to education. Even the Investing in Our Schools Program chose to communicate with the P&Cs as opposed to the schools themselves. They raised with me issues such as teachers having access to computers, wireless networks and software licences-all things that need to be looked at; a revelation in learning management; a professional approach; school security; environmental concerns; and how within their schools they had to combat quite adverse conditions when creating an atmosphere for their students to learn. MAIN COMMITTEE I give an undertaking to the schools in the Shortland electorate that, along with the government’s promise to deliver computers to students and to work with the schools, on a personal level I will work each and every day to ensure that their voices are heard down here and to ensure that the students in the Shortland electorate get a quality education-and that quality education means that they have access to the latest learning technologies. Given that I have been asked to finish a little earlier so that the minister can sum up the debate, I will finish my contribution here. I thank the minister for introducing this legislation and for the content of this legislation and I thank the Prime Minister for delivering on the commitments that he has made to the Australian people and to the people of the Shortland electorate. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12.12 pm)-I am pleased to speak on some of the first appropriation bills of the new government: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008. I look back to the night of the election when it was becoming clear that Labor would win the election and Kevin Rudd’s remark that we could all have an Iced Vo Vo and then go back to work. I thought at the time that he might be referring to the length of the break but I realise now, having watched the Prime Minister in government for a few months, that he was talking about the amount of sugar we would need to keep up the pace of legislation and action in rolling out the election commitments. In these bills today we have delivery of quite a few more election commitments: the beginning of the rebuilding of infrastructure and skills of the nation, reinstating fairness and restraining government spendingall themes through the long election campaign that are being delivered very early in the first term of this new government. In Australia. I think we have gotten used to assuming that promises made by politicians, particularly during election campaigns, are not to be believed, are not promises at all. During the campaign and shortly after it a number of people did say to me, ‘But how much of this are you really going to deliver?’ I repeated to them the words that Kevin Rudd had said both publicly and behind closed doors several times, ‘Everything we promise we will deliver.’ I do not think there would have been many people who expected action to come so quickly. These bills are another illustration of promises made over the last year and promises being met. These bills will make a real difference to the lives of people around the country and in my electorate of Parramatta. They demonstrate the government’s approach to growing the economy while keeping a rein on inflation and to reinstating fairness-both themes that have been there through the last year and are demonstrated on a daily basis by this government through the policies that it implements and the bills it introduces into this parliament. There is a very real commitment in these bills to restrain government expenditure through delivery of some of the promised cuts made in the election campaign and some identified since. There is a real commitment in these bills to investing in the productive capacity of the nation-in skills, in infrastructure and in innovation. And there is a real commitment in these bills to reinstating fairness-one of the most important values that underpin this nation-through immediate assistance to some of the most disadvantaged in our communities, those people living good lives under difficult circumstances while they care for the well-being of others. The government is hitting the ground running. It is delivering on commitments every day and getting on with the business of government. We can do this because the policies that we announced well before the election were real policies, developed through listening to many, MAIN COMMITTEE many people and underpinned by sound principles of economic management and fairness. Also underpinning the approach by this government is the fundamental fact that we do not stand here spending our own money. When a government has been in power for a long time, this is something that it risks forgetting. I hope that it is something that we do not ever forget. We do not spend our own money here. Not one dollar belongs to us. It is given to us by the taxpayers-individuals, families and businesses-and is spent on their behalf for their benefit. One of the ways that we show that respect today is by reining in government spending. With all the talk of boom times in recent years, it occurred to me late last year that one of the real beneficiaries of the boom was government itself, with more advertising, more staff, more legal advice and more consultancies-generally, more, more and more. It was a boom time for the re-election prospects of the government but not for the vulnerable or for those with the least bargaining power and certainly not for the many hard working Australians. In the last 16 months of office, the previous government spent $470 million of taxpayers’ money on advertising alone, promoting policies such as the flawed Work Choices. In the last few days, we have seen in this parliament the amount of propaganda material, which was stored for many months, now finally being destroyed. We have also seen many grant programs that were more about photo opportunities than for the benefit of the local communities. One of the real illustrations of the boom in government has been the boom in staff. This bill begins to roll that back by bringing in a 30 per cent reduction in ministerial and opposition staff numbers. There are some, I would suspect, who would think it odd that one of the first things a government does in office is reduce its staff numbers. But staff numbers had grown well and truly out of control in the last years of the Howard government. The promise made by Labor in the election campaign is delivered in these bills. While there were already real indications that inflation was beginning to move beyond the recommended band of the Reserve Bank, spending under the previous government had grown out of control, with growth rates as high as 4.5 per cent in real terms in the later years. These bills also begin to roll back some of the extraordinary growth in costs from the flawed Work Choices legislation. Administrative efficiencies arising from the transition from Australian workplace agreements to collective enterprise agreements and statutory individual contracts will reduce the funding required by the Workplace Authority by $30 million in 2007-08 alone. We would all remember during the last years of the Howard government how the administration of Work Choices grew so dramatically, with hundreds of additional members of the Public Service employed to implement the so-called fairness test. This is a reduction of $30 million in 2007-08 alone. The bills also deliver on a number of other promises made during the campaign but they also seek appropriation from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund to meet the requirements of a number of initiatives, most of which were promised during the election campaign. These appropriation bills, in delivering on those promises, will make real differences and deliver real things for a diverse range of stakeholders. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks a total appropriation of $2.4 billion, including a number of election commitments and changes in the estimates of existing program expenditure. It includes $242.1 million to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to tackle Australia’s skills deficit. We all know that the skills shortage in Australia is one of MAIN COMMITTEE the issues which impact so seriously on inflation in this nation. The bill delivers $100 million to establish the National Secondary School Computer Fund. This is part of a much bigger project, but this initial $100 million moves very quickly to provide schools that have the capacity with computers and computer access for years 9 to 12. I visited several schools in my electorate at the end of last year and early this year and talked to them about this issue. It is, of course, a much bigger issue that involves not just the computers themselves but the infrastructure that supports the use of those computers-power supply, cabling and skills of teachers. Improving the capacity of our schools to deliver the kind of education our children will need over the next decade and beyond is a major undertaking for this government-one not undertaken by the previous government. We can safely say that the deficit of equipment, infrastructure and skills at our schools at the moment is a result of neglect over the last decade. This $100 million is a significant first step which will give results where results can be delivered most quickly. Long-term solutions will, of course, require more time and much more consultation with our state counterparts. These bills also deliver $33.3 million for the government’s Skilling Australia for the Future program, funding which in 2007-08 alone will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce. Again, that is a very speedy delivery of 20,000 vocational education and training places, in stark contrast to the previous government, which was denying that we even had a skills shortage right up until the election. This program will commence at the beginning of April 2008. That is next month. And this is just the start. During the election campaign, we announced that our Skilling Australia for the Future policy will deliver 450,000 training places over four years, including 65,000 apprenticeships, and will cost $1.3 billion. This first instalment of $33.3 million is a rapid delivery of the first 20,000 of those vocational education and training places. This demonstrates once again the government’s absolute commitment to reining in inflation through developing the productive capacity of the economy through delivery of skills and infrastructure. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will be provided with $2.5 million to establish Infrastructure Australia. When in opposition, we on this side of the House talked about the need for infrastructure development for several years, again against silence from the then government. Infrastructure Australia will allow us as a nation to independently determine the needs of the country-no more rorts; no pork-barrelling. It will consider long-term needs to fuel the productive capacity of the nation and not just the short-term political needs of local members in marginal seats. The building of a nation’s infrastructure is incredibly important. It is something that we used to do very well but failed to do over the last decade. It is incredibly important because only governments can do this. Only governments can drive the major infrastructure that links the nation, that strengthens our ports and that provides transport for people and goods. The $2.5 million to establish Infrastructure Australia begins the setting up of a system for the independent planning of that process. The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research will be provided with $15.2 million to introduce the Enterprise Connect program, replacing the previous government’s Australian industry productivity centres. Innovation is a key driver of productivity and growth, again an area neglected over the last 10 years. In fact, it is very sad that so much of MAIN COMMITTEE the work done by the previous Hawke and Keating governments was left to degrade over the last decade. This government aims to foster a culture of innovation by strengthening investment in creativity and knowledge-something that this country has historically been very good at. As a nation, we punch well above our weight when it comes to new ideas. We are a nation which really only requires the incentive to do so and we go forth and create in the most profound way. The Enterprise Connect network will link businesses with new ideas and technology and provide incentives for business research and development to focus on lifting investment and competitiveness. There is also something for health-again, as promised during the election campaign. Additional funding is proposed for the Department of Health and Ageing, including $33.1 million to provide upfront capital grants and recurrent funding for the establishment of 31 GP superclinics around Australia and to provide incentive payments to GPs and allied health providers to relocate to these clinics. This was a policy announced during the election campaign which perhaps will not have an immediate impact in my electorate. We have a major hospital, Westmead Hospital, in the electorate and, perhaps because of that, there are extensive health services in the electorate and our bulk-billing rates are very high. But this is a policy which impacts generally on the capacity of our hospitals to serve communities, and that certainly does impact on my electorate in a real way. Over the past decade we have seen increasing blame-shifting between state and federal governments on health, with various aspects funded by the federal government and hospitals essentially funded by the state governments. It is certainly true that hospitals bear the brunt of any failure in the surrounding services. If we do not have enough aged-care beds, the hospitals bear the brunt. If we do not have enough community nurses, the hospitals bear the brunt. If we do not have enough GPs in the area, or enough GPs bulk-billing, then emergency departments bear the brunt. If we do not have 24-hour GP services, then emergency departments bear the brunt. And if we do not invest enough in keeping people healthy in the first place, in preventative health, then our hospitals bear the brunt. So any policy which begins to develop the services around hospitals that deal with the early stages of illness and provide real benefits to preventative health-anything that reduces the impact on our hospitals-must be applauded. For many communities around Australia, the introduction of these GP superclinics will provide real services in the local community and significantly lessen the demand in our emergency departments. We have also committed $31.6 billion for investing in hospitals and community health under the Better Outcomes for Hospitals and Community Health program. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will receive additional funding as well, with $50.8 million in additional funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park structural adjustment package and an additional $31.8 million to deliver on the election commitment to provide rebates to households for installing solar hot-water heaters to encourage improved energy efficiency in homes. The environment is also an area which was neglected over 10 years of the preceding government and an area, like so many others, in which the community was well ahead of the government in its thinking. I believe that even in 2004 the people in my electorate were already rating the environment as a major issue, but the level of debate on the environment in the government was so low at that point that they did not really have the language to express that view. But in the 2004 door-knocking experience of mine the issue of water in particular was MAIN COMMITTEE raised perhaps more often than any other-even, at that stage, ahead of health and education. In the election of November last year, of course, it was a major issue, with the community expressing quite sophisticated views and in many ways pulling the government along-not fast enough, unfortunately. But we on this side of the House, we in government now, do recognise that the environment is one of the most significant economic and social issues facing this country and needs immediate action. In our second week of government, here is the beginning of the delivery of those election commitments. We have also committed an additional $50.8 million for the National Solar Schools program to encourage improved energy and water efficiency in schools. Government cannot expect private householders and businesses to lead the way. It really needs to lead the way itself. All levels need to do it. We as individuals need to do it. Our businesses need to do it. But also our governments need to ensure that our government assets-our schools, our hospitals, our community centres, our local council buildings and our state government offices-lead the way in improving energy and water efficiency, and this $50.8 million begins the process of ensuring that our schools, our state assets, are leaders in this area. We have also committed an additional $15.2 million to take early action on the National Plan for Water Security, which will accelerate investment in water savings infrastructure and the purchase of water allocations by bringing forward spending from 2011-12. That is three years away, of course, and the environment is an urgent issue. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be provided with $189.8 million to assist people with disabilities, their families and carers. This includes an annual tax-free payment of $1,000 for each child under the age of 16 with a disability for whom the carer is receiving carer allowance. It also includes $9 million to increase the support available to people in disability business services. This is something that I am particularly pleased about. I know there are many, many people in my electorate of Parramatta who are struggling on a daily basis to provide care for people in their families who suffer from a disability or illness. This $1,000 for each child under the age of 16 will provide very real and immediate assistance. Of course, that is not the end of the story. We have much more work to do to provide support for these people who fill one of the most important roles in our community-that of caring for people who are unable to care for themselves and providing lives with dignity for them in their own homes. (Time expired) May I start, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, by congratulating you on your elevation to Deputy Speaker. That is a great honour for you and your constituents, and I wish you well. I also take the opportunity to congratulate my colleague and friend the member for Herbert on his re-election in a very difficult election for those members on the other side in Queensland. I also congratulate him on his parliamentary secretary position and wish him well too. In debating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20072008, it is difficult to ignore the former government’s mixed economic performance and its fundamental failure to address many matters of substance, including climate change-which the member for Parramatta has just been speaking about-the skills crisis, innovation and Australia’s crumbling infrastructure. I think it is fair to say that it was true that the government had run out of ideas for the future by 24 November last year. There can be no doubt that the policy lethargy of the past did contribute to the overwhelming support for a change in MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
295,Mr Murphy (Lowe,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (12.32 pm)government, a change in direction and a change in the heart of our country. That is why Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard have been elected with a mandate to implement this exciting agenda for change. The Rudd government has certainly hit the ground running. It has taken weeks, not years, for the Prime Minister to begin implementing good climate change policy. It has taken weeks, not years, for the Prime Minister to advance the cause of reconciliation. These are exciting reforms and do not begin and end with matters typically pigeonholed as relating to social justice-though ignoring these matters would ultimately come at a major cost to the economy. The Prime Minister, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, finance minister and minister for small business have all outlined practical reforms to strengthen Australia’s economy, particularly in relation to the war on inflation. With very few exceptions, it will become even more apparent that the former government’s legacy was one of reactive, not proactive, economic reform. The corollary of this is that, over the past 11 years, there has been a failure to anticipate and act on future challenges, a failure to act on rising levels of inflation, a failure to act on skilled labour and infrastructure shortages and a failure to act on the increasingly dysfunctional nature of federal-state relations-and I applaud the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for making it quite clear in December 2006, when he was Leader of the Opposition, that he would promote cooperative federalism, which is what is happening now. These were the challenges that the former government would not touch and these were the challenges to which it had no answer. While these challenges would appear at first sight to be a minor irritant for the government of any given day, their impacts are more widely felt by families. The rising cost of living faced by many families in my electorate of Lowe is one challenge the former government refused to face. As we now know, the Howard government regularly informed Australian families that they had ‘never been better off’. However, my office was and still is receiving calls regularly from constituents that are battling to pay increasing grocery bills and petrol prices. It is not enough to spruik one’s economic management by indefatigably pointing to budget surpluses delivered through a once in a generation commodities boom. Surely economic management should also be measured by whether families are able to balance their own budget over the kitchen table. It is aimless to advertise every cent of government debt that is paid off, while ignoring family credit card debts that are spiralling out of control. Australia’s national economic performance has come on the back of spiralling household debt-and this does not look like abating in light of the increasing cost of living pressures. The Household Expenditure Survey from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the cost of living outpaced inflation by eight per cent between 1999 and 2004. We have all seen the cost of petrol, bread, fruit and vegetables skyrocket in recent years. Plainly, a dollar does not have the purchasing strength today that it had years ago. That is why it is important to implement practical proposals that may relieve some of the pressure rather than arrogantly dismiss the problem by proclaiming that working families have ‘never been better off’. It is time for some focus to be placed on the economy at home, not just on the national economy. The Prime Minister has already shown a commitment to keeping prices and interest rates low by investing in education, skills and key economic infrastructure. Indeed, as I said earlier, it has taken weeks, not years, for the Rudd government to begin the process of auditing Australia’s infrastructure. MAIN COMMITTEE Another way we can keep sustained downward pressure on prices is by resuscitating the Trade Practices Act, protecting small businesses and encouraging competition. There is no better friend for families doing their weekly round of grocery shopping than healthy competition between retailers. With that in mind, it is illuminating that a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report suggests that Australia’s two biggest retailers, Coles and Woolworths, hold 79 per cent of the market despite mum and dad grocers making up 50 per cent of the sector’s workforce. While the ACCC has powers with respect to cartels, predatory pricing and misuse of market power, those powers could be strengthened for small business and for families saddled with increasing cost of living pressures. As the Assistant Treasurer has previously indicated, more can be done to protect small business and foster competition in Australian markets. More can be done to achieve the objectives of the Trade Practices Act to ‘enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition’. In a document published in 2004 titled ‘Committed to small business’, the former Prime Minister rightly extolled the virtues of small business and the important contribution small business makes to Australia’s economy. The former Prime Minister said: The Government’s commitment to small business is undiminished. That is why we remain attuned to their needs and why we continue to respond to their concerns with practical measures. Despite 11 years in power, those measures never really eventuated. There are many obvious failings with the Trade Practices Act for small businesses and consumers alike. However, the former Treasurer refused time and time again to tackle those challenges. Cost of living pressures and methods of keeping costs down just did not seem to raise a mention. With respect to competitive markets and consumer protection, the Howard government certainly promised plenty, delivered little and created a false impression that it was doing everything it could. But it was not. One area crying out for reform is the misuse of market power provisions within the Trade Practices Act. Since the High Court’s decision in Boral, big business will not have substantial market power unless they have the power to raise prices without losing any custom to their rivals. This notion of having absolute freedom of constraint to raise prices before one is considered to have a substantial degree of market power has rendered section 46 useless. I ask: how can section 46 purport to foster competition when one can only resort to the provision when the market is already a monopoly or close to it? The ACCC has found it close to impossible to launch a misuse of market power case since the Boral decision. Many examples of anticompetitive conduct have no doubt escaped scrutiny as a result, to the detriment of consumers. The paucity of section 46 cases is not necessarily a glowing endorsement of corporate conduct in Australia. As I have said previously, not having misuse of market power cases through the courts is analogous to having no penalties in a football match. While the teams may generally have been well behaved, surely the referee cannot be saying that both teams have been absolutely perfect for the duration of the match. Observations from the ACCC would suggest that the competition and consumer referee is saying anything but. This referee wants to act on behalf of consumers and small business but the rules will not allow it to. The Assistant Treasurer has rightly observed that there has already been enough debate about the ACCC’s desired changes to the misuse of market power protections. He has clearly stated his intention to put the teeth back into section 46-and I MAIN COMMITTEE note that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has just arrived in this place. I am sure he would support what I have been saying in relation to section 46. While the fruits of any misuse of market power may be attractive for consumers in the short term, the manipulation of the market in this manner will result in fewer competitors, fewer options and higher prices in the long term. Genuine competition is the best way of exerting downward pressure on prices for consumers burdened with cost of living pressures. It is true that the aim of competition is to beat competition. However, no business should be permitted to reduce their prices enough for a short period of time to drive competitors out, then charge whatever they wish for the same goods. Expecting vigorous competition is not inconsistent with the proposition that there must be firm laws against unfair, anticompetitive conduct. No government should hide behind the cloak of so-called healthy competition if conduct is in fact strategically engaged in to undermine the competitive process. Families in my electorate of Lowe, as well as the countless small business operators in my electorate, would be breathing a collective sigh of relief that there is now a government willing to confront the macroeconomic challenges ahead of it. Another such challenge is effectively outlawing serious cartel conduct in Australia. The former Treasurer would remember well that the Dawson review-which reported in 2003-into the Trade Practices Act recommended the imposition of prison terms for individuals found to have engaged in serious cartel behaviour. It has taken the Rudd government weeks to initiate an important reform that the Howard government did not achieve in four years. Wise heads, including the chairman of the ACCC and Professor Frank Zumbo, have on countless occasions identified the risk that mere financial penalties allow cartel operators to weigh up those penalties against the millions that can be earned from a cartel. Recent cases demonstrate that cartel operators are continuing to weigh up the small deterrent of financial penalties against the millions in ill-gotten gains from cartel behaviour. Again, it is consumers who suffer. The Rudd government is rightly making this cost-benefit analysis harder for cartel operators by introducing jail terms for serious cartel conduct. I applaud the government on this initiative. It is astonishing that Australia is one of the few countries in the OECD that does not have jail terms for serious cartel conduct. The Assistant Treasurer has released the exposure draft of the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008 for public comment. I encourage everyone to contribute to that. The exposure draft proposes five-year jail terms for those found guilty of serious cartel conduct. Again, I applaud this initiative. Finally, a very clear message is being sent to businesspeople that cartel behaviour is tantamount to stealing from consumers and will not be tolerated. There is no doubt that the threat of time behind bars will force dishonest businessmen and businesswomen to pause and take stock of the situation. Far from talking tough, looking tough and then running away from the real battles confronting Australian families, the Prime Minister is tackling these challenges head-on. The Prime Minister has already delivered on numerous commitments, including, most recently, the appointment of a petrol price commissioner to monitor and investigate price gouging by oil companies. We will be keeping a close eye on that in the Easter break. Rather than reacting to challenges when it is too late, the government is committed to proactive reform and to investment in the long-term drivers of growth, including infrastructure, education, skills, innovation and a high-speed broadband network. There can be no doubt that MAIN COMMITTEE another of the Howard government’s legacies is its failure to consolidate Australia’s financial position during this once in a generation commodities boom. Despite the commodities boom delivering record prices, Australia outrageously had a balance of trade deficit of $12 billion in the 2006-07 financial year. I am certainly looking forward to the opportunity as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade to do whatever I can to address the trade deficit that we encounter every month in Australia. Clearly we have to turn that around, and it is not easy in an environment where our dollar is relatively high and a lot of the goods and services that we export are value added overseas where the cost of labour is so much lower than in Australia. That is a big challenge for the government, the minister and me personally, but I will be doing everything I can to bring revenue into this country rather than continuing the sucking in of imports that has happened over the past five or six years particularly. In the face of ideal conditions for export success, sadly Australia’s export volumes are down. Growth in service exports, goods exports and manufacturing exports have slumped. A strong export base is vital for Australia’s long-term prosperity, but little has been done in the past 11 years to redress the dreadful trade imbalance. Rather than ignoring the challenges and being content with five consecutive years of trade deficit, as was the norm with the previous government, the Minister for Trade is acting swiftly to initiate a comprehensive review of Australia’s trade policies and programs. Acting quickly rather than reacting late is a premise that the Rudd government subscribes to. Australia can no longer afford a government that recklessly wastes large sums of money on advertising to get themselves re-elected and programs that, in most cases, delivered very few long-term benefits to my constituents specifically and the nation broadly. Finally, that is why many constituents in my electorate of Lowe sought and have received a government with fresh ideas for Australia’s future, which offers much hope. ply-I rise to bring the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008 to a close. I thank those members who have made a contribution, particularly the member for Lowe. The additional estimates bills seek appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget. The total additional appropriation being sought through the additional estimates bills Nos3 and 4 this year is nearly $3.3 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from changes in the estimates of program expenditure due to variations in the timing of payments, forecasted increases in program take-up, the reclassification of certain appropriations and policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget. The government has promised to apply sensible fiscal restraint to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and to boost investment in the productive capacity of the Australian economy. The additional estimates appropriation bills deliver a modest first instalment on these objectives. The appropriations proposed in these bills include the effect of part-year savings in estimates resulting from the government’s election promise to identify savings in budget outlays. The savings reflected in these bills include requiring further efficiencies in public sector administration through the application of an additional two per cent efficiency dividend; the transition to collective enterprise agreements and statutory individual contracts, producing a MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
296,Mr Tanner (Melbourne,"Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (12.48 pm)-in resaving of $30 million from simplified administration; abolishing the access card project to produce a saving this year of $250.6 million; not proceeding with measures announced by the previous government, such as contributing to the Rugby League Hall of Fame and the Australian rugby academy, producing a cash saving to the budget this year of $35 million; and a review of current programs, such as the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, which has identified a saving this year of $33 million. These modest savings, which are a harbinger of more substantial savings to come, have served to contain the additional appropriation sought in these bills. I now take the opportunity to outline the more significant measures contained in the bills. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be provided with additional funding, including $100 million to establish the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund, which will provide grants of up to $1 million for schools to assist them to provide for new or upgraded information and communications technology for secondary school students in years 9 to 12, and $33.3 million for the government’s Skilling Australia for the Future program, which will provide a total of 450,000 additional training places over four years at a cost of $1.3 billion. Funding in 2007-08 will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will be provided with $2.5 million to establish Infrastructure Australia to ensure genuine rigor and accountability in infrastructure spending. Additional funding is proposed for the Department of Health and Ageing for investing in hospitals and community health under the Better Outcomes for Hospitals and Community Health program. This includes funds for specific commitments announced during the election, such as $10 million for the Flinders Medical Centre clinical teaching facilities upgrade and $15 million for the Launceston integrated cancer care centre. The Department of Health and Ageing will also be provided with $33.1 million to provide upfront capital grants and recurrent funding for the establishment of 31 GP superclinics around Australia and to provide incentive payments to GPs and allied health providers to relocate to these clinics. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be provided with additional funds, including an amount of $189.8 million, from which will be provided annual tax-free payments of $1,000 for each child under the age of 16 with a disability for whom their carer is receiving childcare allowance and an increase of $30 million for the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement to allow grants to the states for people with disabilities and their carers. These bills are important pieces of legislation which underpin the government’s new direction in both spending priorities and fiscal restraint and deserve widespread support. I am not convinced, after listening to members of the opposition both in this place and in Senate estimates hearings yesterday, that they actually appreciate the importance of this new direction. Their questions both in the parliament and in estimates hearings suggest that opposition members not only have failed to grasp the seriousness of the inflation challenge-a headline inflation rate running at a level not seen in 16 years-but also are in denial about their own responsibility for delivering this risk to the Australia economy and the Australian people. This is after 10 interest rate increases and 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank about critical capacity constraints in our economy. MAIN COMMITTEE In government, the coalition had little regard for the budget process and no regard for the ERC and was about as familiar with budget savings processes as it was with fair AWAs. It showed no fiscal restraint during its 11 years in government, and during election campaigns this record blew out even further. There is no clearer picture of the coalition’s fiscal record than the former Prime Minister spending a record $9 billion in the campaign launch, literally within weeks of the Reserve Bank raising rates during an election campaign for the first time. There is no clearer record of the coalition’s fiscal record than its legacy of big government, with the cost of running government almost doubling over the 10 years to 2007-08. The supposed party of small government was responsible for delivering the most regulated and expensive industrial relations system this country has ever known; the biggest spending on government advertising the country has ever seen by a long way; the biggest spending on consultants over that period, even though Public Service employment had grown much faster than overall employment in the economy since 2000; an increase in the number of senior public servants, or SES-level public servants, of 44 percent; and an increase in the number of ministerial staff over the time of the government’s period in office by 30 per cent. The government must now confront the serious task of refocusing government fiscal policy. We cannot rely on monetary policy alone to protect the Australian economy and its households from the inflation challenge. The government will confront the inflation legacy of the previous government by delivering a budget surplus of at least 1½ per cent of GDP. To meet this task, spending will need to be cut substantially, in addition to savings announced during the election campaign by the then opposition, now the government. Fiscal restraint and tough decisions on spending are required to ensure that the government does all it can to combat inflation. Choices have to be made to ensure that downward pressure is placed on inflation. This means that lower order priorities or priorities of the previous government that are not shared by the incoming government will be subject to very close scrutiny. This task has already commenced in these additional estimates bills. We stand by the difficult decisions we have had to make to start delivering on our promise to rein in inflation. We do not falter in the face of questions from opposition senators, particularly those who were on the staff of the former Treasurer or those who were former sports ministers and accustomed to taking the easy options and living a ‘the cheque is in the mail’ culture. I commend the additional estimates bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 February, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Sitting suspended from 12.58 pm to 4.02 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Debate resumed from 19 February, on motion by Mr Rudd: ThatToday we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history. We reflect on their past mistreatment. We reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generations-this blemished chapter in our nation’s history. The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia’s history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future. We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians. We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country. For the pain, suffering and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry. To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry. And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry. We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation. For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written. We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians. A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again. A future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity. A future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed. A future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility. A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia. your elevation to the Speaker’s panel. I am sure you will do a very good job. In my nine years as a member of this parliament, this motion offering an apology to Australia’s Indigenous peoples is for me the most memorable and significant. In my first term as a member of this parliament, at the time of the National Sorry Day in October 2000 I addressed the issue of the stolen generations and the importance of an apology as an essential part of the reconciliation process. At the time. I predicted, ‘Very shortly there will be a Prime Minister who can say sorry for the wrongs of past governments.’ That prediction proved a little too optimistic, but as we have seen we now have a Prime Minister who can say sorry for the wrongs of past governments. MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Appropriation Bill No 4 2007 2008
297,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (4.02 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, I congratulate you onMy comments in October 2000 were made after I met with a wonderful woman named Valerie Linow. Valerie lives in the Fowler electorate. Her story is one of the many thousands that can be told by members of the stolen generation. Those stories of grief and abuse did not occur in some far-off land; they happened here in our country, Australia. These gross abuses of human rights were not carried out under the orders of murderous dictators but under the orders of what our official history regards as democratic and humane governments. The view that these acts were carried out by people who had the best interests of the children at heart fails to explain one important thing-why they were directed against members of one race. In the motion we refer to these abuses in fairly bland terms as ‘mistreatment’. While the motion does say that we apologise for inflicting ‘profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians’, it is impossible for those of us who were not subject to these human rights abuses to fully appreciate that suffering, grief and loss and to understand how in so many cases that suffering affected the whole of the lives of those of the stolen generations. How can we understand the anguish and grief of a mother whose child is wrenched from her arms, never to be seen again? How can we understand the trauma of an infant torn from her mother and then at later stages of life separated again from brothers and sisters? It is only when we each consider such a nightmare that we can begin to understand the consequences of this monstrous crime against Aboriginal people in Australia-a crime committed by Labor governments as well as conservative governments, at both the federal and state levels. And those governments were aided and abetted in those crimes by the Christian churches in Australia. We in the Labor Party are justly proud of our history but we accept this black mark on our record and offer an unqualified apology. Those Christian churches have accepted responsibility for their role in this dark past and offered their apologies as well. But from the successors of conservative governments we only get belated, half-hearted and qualified apologies. I can only ask those who have distanced themselves from this apology to think about what they would feel like if it had happened to them. I would ask them to sit down with Valerie Linow, to trace her past and put themselves in her place. When I first spoke to Valerie she showed me her most treasured possessions-old blackand-white photos of her childhood. One of those photos touched me very deeply. Taken in the early 1940s it shows a neatly dressed young woman wearing a sun hat. Next to her is a young man dressed in the uniform of the 2nd AIF, his slouch hat worn so very proudly. In his arms he holds his baby daughter. If you grew up in the 1950s-I was a young lass still in nappiesyou would have noticed similar photographs on mantelpieces in thousands of homes across Australia. That photograph is the only image that Valerie Linow has of her mother and father. The reason that Valerie did not enjoy the love and support of growing up in the family environment that we enjoyed was that she was black. At the age of two Valerie was removed from her home near Grafton in New South Wales and placed in the Bomaderry Children’s Home. She was later taken to the Cootamundra Girls Home, where her three elder sisters had been taken earlier. Her three brothers had been taken to the Kinchela Boys Home near Kempsey. Attempts from Valerie’s father to see her on two occasions led him to be taken away by police. Can any one of us imagine his heartbreak? His only crime was that he wanted to see his daughter-a daughter he wanted to hold, a daughter he wanted to kiss and a daughter to whom he wanted to say, ‘I love you,’ and, ‘This should never have happened.’ He was a man who served his country in a time of war only to see his MAIN COMMITTEE children taken away from the family home, separated and subjected to years of abuse and torment in institutions; a man who only saw his daughter again as he lay on his death bed, 16 years after she had been taken away. Can any one of us imagine the grief of Valerie’s mother, having her children torn from their home while her husband was away at war? She had no-one to turn to; there was no appeal, no justice-that was the white man’s law. And who would defend those laws today? What laws can justify tearing a loving family apart? When I think about what effect the kind of separation that Valerie Linow suffered would have had on my life I can understand the bitterness and sadness that flows from the stolen generations. Valerie has beautifully expressed her understanding of her mother’s sorrow: No wind or dust could dry my mother’s tears as we were torn apart ... Yes, I know today if she was here she would say: ‘My daughter we made the rivers you see today Our tear drops are proof of the flowing waters No wind and dust can dry my tears. All my life I have treasured the close relationship that I have had with my parents, Alan and Lois Welsh, my sister Helen, my two beautiful children, Rebecca and Blake, and my adored grandchildren, Liam and James. Along with my husband, they are the most precious things in the whole world to me. I cannot begin to understand the trauma of having those bonds shattered. And yet that trauma has been faced by thousands of Indigenous Australians, Australians who have at the same time suffered great disadvantage. From Cootamundra Girls Home, Valerie was placed in domestic service, which was the most common prospect for young women. But working life was even harsher than the girls home. Valerie was abused, beaten and raped by her employer and was forced to flee. In the years since, Valerie has tried to reconcile her removal from her home, the tragic consequences for her brothers and sisters, three of whom died while in state care, and her at times brutal upbringing in the institutions responsible for her care. Today, Valerie works with the Origins organisation at Bonnyrigg in my electorate of Fowler. She works with families who have been separated by adoption. Valerie was in Canberra last Wednesday to realise her dream of seeing the Prime Minister of Australia making this historic apology. Her comments were: This apology means everything to me and my family. It is an acknowledgement of the past and it’s very emotional. She added: I do not blame the Australian people of today for what happened to me in the past; all I ask and pray is that history will never repeat itself. The surest way to ensure Valerie’s hope is realised is through the adoption of this motion of apology. Saying sorry is the very least that we as a nation can do to right the wrongs of the past. If each and every Australian truly seeks to understand the trauma and suffering of the stolen generations then we will never repeat this sad chapter in our history. It must be an individual, as well as a collective, act of apology. We are all individually responsible for the well-being of our fellow Australians. I thank and praise Valerie Linow for allowing me to stand up in this chamber today and tell her story. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (4.12 pm)-I rise today to give my absolute support to the motion offering an apology to Australia’s Indigenous people. I am of an age that, had I been born MAIN COMMITTEE in a different place to different parents, I could have been one of the stolen generation. In fact, children were still being removed from their parents some 10 years after I was a toddler. I cannot really imagine what it would be like to have been removed from my parents. When I think of that possibility I imagine my mother, even though she is now 70 years old, still standing beside a road somewhere waiting for her four girls to come back. Sometimes I see her with my father as well, but generally, when I imagine this happening to our family, I see my mother alone, because I cannot even imagine my mother’s marriage surviving 50 years of such incredible grief. People say this happened in the past, but for people my age who experienced this and for people like my mother, still living, this is very much their present; this is the life they live. Between 1910 and 1970, around 50,000 children of Aboriginal background were taken from their parents, placed in institutions or missions or fostered and largely trained for domestic service. They are shocking figures, and the stories we hear are shocking also, briefly brought into the light in the Bringing them home report some 11 years ago and then buried and denied again for some 11 years. Finally, on Wednesday last week, we as a nation said sorry-sorry to the stolen generation ripped from their families, from their culture and from their lives and placed on a different path filled with grief, sadness and loss. Among those in my community that I have spoken to since, there is overwhelming support for the words spoken in parliament last week, but there are some who still have reservations. To them. I would like to speak just briefly. There are some who say that it is in the past and we should not apologise for actions taken in the past. To them. I say again: for those who were taken from their families, this is their lives. We apologise for their lives as they are now. For those who say, ‘I didn’t do it,’ I say that the apology last Wednesday was not from any of us individually, although many of us have said it individually; it was for the nation. We as a nation over 200 years have benefited from the choices we made earlier on when we decided that the welfare of one culture-of the first inhabitants of this country-could be put aside for the development of the nation as a whole. The nation actually made those decisions; governments made those decisions and the government apologised for them on Wednesday. I have also had some people who have also experienced pain in their lives say to me that, for example, their mother was taken from her mother when she was eight years old, that she was not an Indigenous person and therefore we should not be apologising to this group. With all respect to these people-and I understand their pain-this is not a competition for pain, this is not a race where only one group wins and where by recognising the pain of one person we somehow diminish the experiences of others. This is an act which acknowledges the experience of many Australians and recognises our responsibility in it. It does not in any way diminish actions we may have taken or the effect of our actions on other people-not at all. What happened last week was not a trivial event, although, again, there are a small number of people who think it was. This was not a trivial event. This was about the systematic removal of children from their families. It was a deliberate act taken by not just one government but many governments over 60 years that devastated the oldest continuous living culture in the world, left families ruined and left a generation living now who have not experienced family life and who are struggling to create solid families in their present as well. I cannot imagine what has been lost by the stolen generation. I cannot imagine what was lost, not just by them but by others of the Indigenous culture who were ripped from their land MAIN COMMITTEE or whose ancestors were ripped from their land and their culture and who are just finding their way back. I do know that, when I meet a member of my local Indigenous community, I feel grief at what we as a nation have lost. When we decided as a nation to put the development of the nation ahead of this particular culture, we lost an extraordinary cultural history-an extraordinary body of wisdom dating back tens of thousands of years. I know that I can never meet my local Barramatugal clan of the Darug nation in its full strength. I can never do that now. Just 200 years from when they lived free and strong on the land on which I now live, I cannot do that. There are some elders and some families who remain but the language is largely lost; the history is largely lost from my local clan. It is an extraordinary loss for the nation and for the world and I grieve for that. In fact, my grief is still at a stage where I grieve for the loss and I am not yet ready to look at what we still have, to look at the future, because grief sometimes moves in those ways. You deal with what you lose first. I cannot imagine what they must feel; I cannot imagine. My loss is tangential; I have lost what might have been, I have lost people I might have met. The Barramatugal clan of the Darug nation have lost their own history and, while I feel grief when I look at them, many of them must feel grief when they look at themselves in the mirror and that is a much deeper grief than mine. Again, it is not something I can ever fully comprehend and I cannot fully comprehend the pain of the stolen generation but what we did on Wednesday was an act of trust. We looked at a people; we brought them into the light and we accepted and acknowledged their experience even if we could not fully understand the depth of it. I believe that what they needed was for us to say sorry, to bring them into the light, see them and validate experiences that are theirs and theirs alone which we really cannot ever comprehend without going through that ordeal ourselves. They needed to be seen, they needed to be acknowledged and they told us that. That act of trust on Wednesday, I believe, has moved this nation down the path of healing. I would hope that in the near future we all can look at each other, look each other in the eyes, and see the strength of what we can have in our Indigenous population and feel less real, immediate grief for what we have lost. I am sure as a nation we will always feel that, but I hope in the very near future we will see each other for what we can be and not for what we have been. knowledge the traditional owners of this land, the Ngunawal people, and those of the land in my electorate of Deakin, the Wurundjeri. Many may think that Deakin is just an outer metropolitan seat with little Indigenous history to tell; however, they are mistaken. My electorate falls across the Mullum Mullum Valley, which is Wurundjeri for a place of big birds, a region with an ancient terrestrial link to the Wurundjeri people, and it is to this day a gathering place for Indigenous Australians. It is an honour and a privilege to take part in this debate today and to strongly support the Prime Minister’s motion for an apology, which has been offered in a real spirit of bipartisanship and reconciliation. It was, in the words of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, a ‘day of open hearts’ for Australians-a day when our country aspired to find one of its golden threads in our national character. It most certainly did that day, and I am extremely proud to have played a part and given my support then as I do now. Through this apology we have demonstrated that as a country we have matured enough to understand that saying sorry is a critical form of respect for the traditional owners of the land. MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
298,Mr Symon (Deakin) (4.20 Pm),"In responding to this motion I would firstly like to acApologising is important for healing and for taking reconciliation further. If that was ever in dispute, one simply had to hear the rapturous applause by all who were present here on that proud day. The Prime Minister’s apology last week was a defining moment, not just for a new government as its very first order of business but, without a shadow of a doubt, as a nationdefining moment that will be talked about, debated and reflected upon for generations to come. I am confident that those future generations will be able to look back with the knowledge that the Prime Minister’s apology last week was the first major step this nation took to turn a new page in our country’s history. I believe those future generations will want to know where and when exactly the healing began and who our leaders were that put us on the road to righting those past wrongs and taking care of the unfinished business. I am proud to say today that it was this government and this Prime Minister who brought our country together-Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, Labor and coalition likein an expression of sorrow never before seen. I also commend the opposition for offering such immediate bipartisan support for this motion. I think it was so important for many peoplepeople perhaps not previously engaged in the issue of reconciliation-to see that handshake over the dispatch box. And for those who perhaps still struggled with the notion of a formal apology, the Prime Minister made it simple: imagine if this had happened to you. In fact, one need not think much further than that simple thought. While as a parliament we expressed our sorrow on that day, it was not a sorrowful day as such-it was not a dark or mournful day-or one that was designed to make this generation of Australians feel guilty for the acts of previous ones; but it was a day to reflect on dark events in our history that must not and cannot ever be repeated. MightI say that the idea that saying sorry somehow ascribes guilt to this generation of Australians is completely misguided. However, it is something that we heard many times from the former Howard government. It is instead an extremely positive and healing process. I will never forget the emotion, the excitement and the anticipation that came with it, not only in the House but all around the building and out there in the nation. We can now build on the positive momentum created in this place last week and start building new partnerships with Indigenous Australians, based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility. I believe that education is one of the keys to that, not only for the current generation, who are still attending school, but more for people of my generation-people who did attend school and were taught history but were not taught that page of Australia’s history. Whilst we attended high schools, or technical schools, as they were called in my day, there was history but we were taught about English royalty or maybe even about Japanese hierarchy and royalty. We certainly were not taught about what had happened to Indigenous Australians in the near past of our own country’s history. I believe that the sooner a program like that is actually put across to people who may not understand the full implications of the stolen generations the sooner we will get an even greater understanding. When that happens I believe reconciliation will not be in the minds of many. As it should be, it will be in the minds of all. On this basis I strongly commend the motion to the House. tion before the House.

299,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (4.25 Pm),"It is with great pride that I rise to endorse this moone of the most significant and momentous periods in the history of this House. What occurred last week-both on Tuesday, 12 February, and on Wednesday, 13 February-were, I think, some of the most significant events in this parliament’s history. I begin with the events of Tuesday, 12 February. That day will always be remembered by me as my first day sitting in this parliament. On that day I recall, and will continue to recall vividly, the welcome to country delivered by Matilda House-Williams. This was a significant act; it was significant for many reasons. For me one of the most significant aspects of this welcome to country was this: not only was this the first time that such a welcome to country had been delivered in this place but it had taken so long for this to occur. I am someone who has been an elected representative, as a councillor of Penrith City Council, for almost nine years. In that time. I have been invited to many gatherings throughout my local community. As I have gone to those gatherings, increasingly over the years there has been a tendency to embrace the welcome to country as a means by which a gathering can be commenced. This is something that has been occurring gradually over that period, but I must say it has been commonplace throughout that eight to nine years that I have been in elected office. I think in years to come people will reflect upon what occurred on Tuesday, 12 February 2008, and they will wonder why it took so long for this great parliament of this nation, with our great democratic traditions, to embrace a welcome to country and to enmesh those democratic traditions with the heritage of our Indigenous people. I turn to the motion itself. I believe it is something for which our nation has been waiting for many years for the leadership of this country to do. We know that over the last 11 years there has been a reluctance on the part of the previous government, in particular on the part of the previous Prime Minister, to do what this House has now done with a real sense of bipartisanship. It is important that we note that bipartisanship because it goes to the significance of what has occurred here. The apology that was moved in the House last week, on Wednesday, 13 February 2008, was an apology from this parliament, from not just the government but the representatives of the people of this great country. As someone who brings a legal background to this place, I am all too aware of how the temptation for courts can sometimes be to intervene and to take this nation in a more progressive direction. In doing so, often they can lead out ahead of where the people are. They can lead out ahead of where community sentiment and community views have been able to reach. WhatI think is most significant about this apology is that it is not the courts that are leading from the front but the representative of the people-the parliament-that is. All of us who were present in the chamber and brought forward those many stories from our local communities helped to ensure that, as a nation, we were able to say sorry and to say sorry not just with a sense of reflecting upon what has occurred in our nation’s history but also with a real, deep and abiding commitment to what can be achieved in the future. I come here as the member for Lindsay, which is wholly situated within the boundaries of the Penrith City Council. Penrith City Council has the third highest proportion of Indigenous Australians of all councils in New South Wales-third only to Blacktown, which is first, and Lake Macquarie, which is second. Having such a significant proportion of Indigenous people living within my community is something that I relish. I relish the opportunity to continue to engage with them on a whole range of issues that impact upon their lives and the broader life of our local community. AndI take this opportunity today to acknowledge the Aboriginal and MAIN COMMITTEE Torres Strait Islander people as the traditional owners and custodians of the lands and waters of this country. On Wednesday, 13 February 2008, there were many people inside the House who were able to witness the apology. But there were also many people right throughout this country who were deeply moved by what occurred and who were actively engaged in the process of the making of that apology. I know in my local community there were many local gatherings. But one in particular that I wish to reflect upon was the gathering at the Penrith City Council, where there were over 200 people gathered for this significant event. One person who ordinarily would have been at the Penrith City Council but who was not there is a person I take great inspiration from-a person by the name of Maureen Silleri. Maureen is someone personally known to me and someone who was down here in Canberra on that day. She works for the Penrith City Council and is involved with specialist child care. She helps local Indigenous families access childcare services so that they may overcome some of the barriers that prevent them from entering the workforce. Maureen has put pen to paper and has given me the benefit of some of her reflections on some of the issues pertaining to the impact of the stolen generations. I wish to read into the record that short note from Maureen: My Story-Maureen SilleriMaureen’s family name was ClaytonAt the time my brothers and sisters [were] taken I was only two years old. We were a family of 9 children and they (the Welfare Board) came and removed 6 children. There were 4 sisters and 2 brothers. They (The Welfare Board) had said to my mum that she could not look after all these children; the Board never came near us for months. We had our extended family members to support my mum. Dad was a drover and away a lot and we did not go with out anything. The welfare believed that they were doing the right thing-however both my parents worked and as the children were getting ready for school they (the Board) came and just took the children, my two brothers and I were not taken as we were being minded by Nan and Pop because our parents were at work. I believe that my parents never recovered from our family being torn apart, people are under the assumption that only one child in one family were taken but I can tell you that we were a family of 9 children and the board took 6 children. I was in about sixth class ... and I came home from school and there was a young girl sitting on a chair and all I could remember thinking was how much she looked like my mum. Mum said to me to say Hi to your sister. SoI was thinking that I had to get to know them all over again. All6 of my brothers and sisters started to return home to us at different times, and in the end we all were reunited. Last week I was fortunate enough to be in Canberra at Parliament House and hear the apology from the PM-it was a monumental event which one of my sisters (that was taken) was in the House of Rep ... but it was more significant when my family all came together on the grass area to celebrate the day when an apology was made to my Aboriginal people-a day we thought would never happen. Maybe now those that were taken can now be at peace with this acknowledgment of the treatment of stolen generation, hopefully this can encourage them to move forward. Upon reading this statement, I could not help but reflect upon some of my own personal family experiences. I am one of five children, my father was one of five children, my mother was one of 10 children and her mother was one of 11 children. I know that it can be a handful for parents to look after families of this size. But I also know that many families have been able to do it-and to do it well. I also know that, in the case of Maureen Silleri, there was no sugMAIN COMMITTEE gestion that her parents were unable to do that job as well as my grandmother, my mother and my great-grandmother were able to do it. The sad reality of the stolen generations is that many people were taken away from their families for no other reason than that they were Aborigines. This is the harsh and uncomfortable reality that we need to confront and that we are confronting as part of this motion of apology that the parliament has moved for the nation. I should say that, whilst words are important-and I think it was significant that the Prime Minister referred to the unfinished business of reconciliation as being a ‘stain on the soul of the nation’; I think it is significant that we try to wash away that stain-I think it is also significant to note that, with all of the words in the world and all of the tears shed, irrespective of how significant those outpourings of emotion may be, all those things on their own will not be sufficient for us to achieve what I think we all have reached consensus on: closing the gap between the lack of opportunities that Indigenous Australians face and the opportunities that non-Indigenous Australians currently enjoy. The most often cited expression of that gap is the 17-year gap between life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Seventy-five per cent of males and 65 per cent of female Indigenous Australians die before the age of 65 compared to 26 and 16 per cent respectively in the non-Indigenous population. Ultimately, the success of each and every one of us as legislators and parliamentarians will be measured not merely in the small but significant step that we have taken in moving this motion of apology; the real judgement will be passed on whether we collectively can achieve inroads in these very important measures. That will be the real test for us all. But I say that while also understanding and knowing how significant the giving of an apology was. In giving an apology, we as a parliament, on behalf of this nation, have moved away one of the important stumbling blocks towards reconciliation. In doing so, we show the respect that Indigenous Australians deserve and that the past mistreatment they have been subjected to demands. When I saw all of the people throughout this building, throughout Canberra and throughout Australia shedding tears last week on Wednesday, 13 February, it struck me that, regardless of how significant any debate over the subtleties of language could possibly be, deep down beneath the semantics of saying sorry or just simply being regretful there was much suffering and much hurt that had extended to many people. It impacted on many families and Maureen Silleri’s family was but one affected by this great stain on our nation’s soul. It is not only significant; I think moving this motion of apology is going to prove to be one of the most significant things that this parliament has done. It is a great source of personal pride to me that I have been able to participate in this debate and to add my voice to the chorus of voices in this place that have said that it is time for us to move on. But, before doing so, we need to confront the realities of what has occurred. We need to say sorry and we need to move on with mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility. speak on this motion on the apology to Australia’s Indigenous peoples. I was fairly happy that most of the members were going to talk about the apology and the historic occasion which occurred last week, but I have picked up on a number of media reports and the various reactions and the understandings of the apology from the other side of the House.

300,Mr Raguse (Forde) (4.40 Pm),"It was of real interest to me to have the opportunity tofrom both sides have many perspectives on it. However, the seat of Forde is a Gold Coast hinterland seat and to the south and to the east are the conservative seats of Fadden, McPherson and Moncrieff. Those seats, like part of the seat of Forde, have media coverage by the Gold Coast Bulletin, a major publication. In fact, its Saturday paper has a circulation of about 76,000 copies. I was very concerned last Saturday about an article written by a young journalist called Robyn Wuth. I am sure that Robyn wrote the piece with good intentions, to raise the level of debate and to cover the reaction from all sides of politics and from the community about the apology. I hope that it was a piece designed to raise a contention and maybe produce more understanding of the debate or at least to articulate what I know a lot of people in the community were saying about the apology. Many members would have received many emails about the issue, but a chain email that has been circulated is becoming most concerning to me. The email, which I believe derived from an email that was circulated in Canada when they were looking at the indigenous issues of the Canadian Indians some years ago, carries a range of fleeting statements. People can have their say-Australia is a democracy-and this is certainly an opportunity to have a debate, but I was rather concerned when this journalist wrote a feature article in the Gold Coast Bulletin. I seek leave to present the article. Leave granted. tion. This is something that you would expect, dare I say, from some of the more conservative areas of western Queensland-and that is not to cast any aspersions on western Queensland, but they certainly do have a different view, for a range of reasons, to those of us in metropolitan seats. I will read a number of paragraphs from the article, and you will see where this is going. I am sure, as I said, that the young journalist was trying to raise the level of debate. It questions the level of freedom of the press in this country. I am quite happy that a story like this has been written. I ask that members on the other side of the House consider their responses, certainly those members from the Gold Coast seats that are covered by this publication. The journalist is asking what this is all about. The headline is ‘What a sorry lot of rot’, which in itself is a bit concerning. She says: As P.G. Woodhouse said: ‘It is a good rule in this life never to aplologise. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them.’ To be honest, I’m sick of all this namby-pamby boo-hoo-ing about bloody saying sorry. How much of this is hype and how much of it actually happened? That is concerning. There is plenty of evidence that a condition or situation occurred. have tried to deny other issues in history. I will not say that our Indigenous issues in this country are anywhere near as extreme as the holocaust but, in terms of people’s understanding and views, carrying this on into perpetuity is concerning. The fact is it was a young journalist writing about this particular stuff. She goes on to say: I’m much more of your ‘what’s in it for me’ kind of girl-and there’s nothing for me in saying sorry except a giant payout my taxes will fund.

303,Mr Raguse,"Yes, it is almost holocaust denial, a bit like many other historians whoButI have to say sorry. Sorry for giving you free medical care, for giving you money, for building you homes which you vandalised and destroyed and treated with contempt and we paid to fix. Sorry for developing large farms and properties, which today feed your people. Sorry for providing you with warm clothing made of fabric to replace the animal skins you used before. It goes on to talk more about the particular things that so-called white society has given. Further, she says: … let’s take it international. … … … Check under every rock, there’s something to apologise for everywhere you look. The tribal war in Rwanda, the atrocities in Cambodia, the Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan. The Middle East. Uh-oh. For all we know, Mohammed and Jesus played together as kids. But Jesus would have been the cool kid. Well, it’s true. This journo may not be aware of what occurred to Salman Rushdie some years ago and the extremes of views which we do not have in this country. I am concerned that this sort of journalism could bring this notion to a point. As I said, I am giving the benefit of the doubt to this journalist. In fact, any politician knows it is dangerous to bang the media, but in this case I would be interested to know whether this is the feeling of the general community, certainly in the region I represent. AndI would like to know the views of other members. Look at what happened in Queensland particularly. Only last night in my first speech I mentioned the era of the Bjelke-Petersen government. I was only seven years old when Indigenous people were finally recognised through the referendum in 1967. It was a time that all Australians celebrated through the ballot box and the referendum. There was overwhelming agreement that Indigenous people should be considered part of Australian society and have all the rights we have. Far more justified, people could stand here and talk about what that 1967 referendum meant for everybody. Certainly, it gave the country an understanding. It was probably the first point of reconciliation, and on the Labor side of politics we talk about the processes of reconciliation. Last night I said that the sorry in this case, the historic apology last week, were really carrying on from the last Labor government in terms of proceeding with the apology. Getting back to the years of the Bjelke-Petersen government: as I said in my first speech, what galvanised me politically in terms of conservatism was the many strange laws made during that Bjelke-Petersen period. We had no upper house in Queensland, so the rule of the day was made in that one chamber. Of course, it was considered a police state. My own personal experiences suggest it may have been, but again people would have different views on that. The outcome was that there were a number of state ministers who ended up in jail-about seven of them-through a range of bad dealings and convictions for fraud. I remember early in the 1970s a particular Indigenous affairs minister in Queensland talking about the need to work with and support Indigenous communities. His particular idea or initiative was that we should sterilise all 13-year-old Indigenous, or Aboriginal, girls because of unwanted pregnancies. My understanding, from my involvement with the Indigenous community, is that they do not have such things as unwanted pregnancies. That is very much a Western view. MAIN COMMITTEE That example shows, I guess, the strange and extreme views of the government at that stage, but I thought certainly by the 1980s and 1990s, even under the previous Howard government, there were sensitivities towards Indigenous people. But something went wrong. After the 1997 report and the notion of saying sorry, we somehow went off the track. Getting caught up in the dialogue, the taxonomy of the word, what ‘sorry’ meant, has stalled the process until now. The other side of politics probably consider that they should have dealt with this much sooner-but they did not. We did it because it was something that had to be done, so we can certainly get on with it. Getting back to the Gold Coast Bulletin and Robin Wuth’s story: I am hoping that her intention was to raise this sort of debate so that people could get this stuff out in the open. A lot of these degrading comments were made by chain emails. People were talking about it and I have had people show me messages they received on their phones. My intention today, of course, is to bring it into the open to get some debate about it. There have been a number of publications and letters from different groups. Reconciliation Australia wrote to all members of parliament. I have listened to a number of the discussions and arguments in the House and outside the House about what the apology was all about. I wonder why people keep going over the same old ground, saying that it is conditional and it should be somewhat reconsidered. It is very clear if you have any understanding of Indigenous communities-while I have had some involvement, I am certainly no expert-they are very, very productive, they get on with life and business and they have a very strong and growing community. They talk about sorry business and, interestingly enough, I was aware of sorry business many, many years ago. In our Western culture, if there is a bereavement, if someone dies, then we automatically say sorry. It is about empathy. This was always about empathy. It was not a strange issue or the taxonomy of words; it was about feeling empathy for another group. I refer to a particular publication that I read many, many years ago. I do not want to submit it, but I can hold it up. It is a book called Liberal Thinking. Many people in the Liberal Party would have read this. It is in fact their bible. Chris Puplick and Robert Southey, I think it was, wrote this particular publication and it is a philosophical journal if nothing else. This is why I cannot understand the arguments on the other side of the House about simply saying sorry. This book talks about liberalism and it says: Thus, while we discuss the centrality of the concept of freedom in liberalism, we must begin by establishing the ethical basis of freedom. Further, along with the question of how people should act, there is the question of how they should be treated; or, as it is commonly framed, ‘What rights do people have?’ Our starting point for examining these is the concept of human dignity. This is what I am here today to say. Irrespective of newspaper articles, irrespective of the arguments that are put up in terms of reconsideration, at the end of the day, this is about human dignity. I can give my own experiences in life. I said, again in my first speech last night, that I was an adoptee and there are a whole range of other issues there and a lot of pain involved in that. But, interestingly enough, while adoptions were a legal arrangement that governments well managed, there were still a lot of people hurt and there are still a lot of people hurt today from probably bad decisions that were made from the 1930s right through to the 1990s. It is interMAIN COMMITTEE esting that, in Queensland particularly, prior to those laws being changed there was an outpouring of grief and certainly then sorry business occurred within Western society in Queensland. Everyone had a view that this was a bad thing and everyone apologised to each other. Changes to the laws and legal requirements were made. That is what I cannot understand. Our Indigenous community have clearly had a number of things done to them under inappropriate laws, as we consider them to be now. This is simply and essentially recognising that the laws were inappropriate. It is a government saying sorry, that governments got it wrong-as has every other state when it came to the adoption legislation in their state. This was about saying: ‘The laws were wrong. We needed to change them. We’re sorry. Let’s get on with it.’ In my closing remarks I would like to consider that, if we look at the publication of that which the other side used as their philosophical tome, really we all should understand that it is about human dignity. I thank you for your indulgence. this House who in some way, large or small, has played some part in this apology to the Indigenous people of Australia. I want to also thank the member for Forde, a new member who has just made his contribution, for his thoughts and for his part in that apology. I want to thank every member of this House for their part because it is important that we do it on behalf of the Australian people and on behalf of the Australian parliament. This is not something that we do individually or personally-although that is important as well. It is very important that the Indigenous people of Australia understand that this is a bipartisan, parliamentary and government apology for things that have happened in the past. I also want to make a note that, without any doubt in my mind, this is one of the most significant events to have happened in this place for a very long time. I do not know that we truly understand today just how significant that is. Perhaps in 10, 20, 50 or more years time people will reflect and members of parliament will reflect on the words and speeches and on the apology itself and look back at what we did at that historic moment, that time when the Australian parliament officially made an apology to the Indigenous people of Australia. It is very significant and probably one of the most significant things that we will have done in this place. It seems on the surface so simple, so normal, so natural for it to happen. It certainly was an emotional time for not only members of parliament but the community at large, certainly for Indigenous people, people that were there on the day in the gallery, people that were watching from outside, people that were listening on radio, and people that rang my office, emailed, wrote, texted and in whatever form they could lent their support to what was taking place. It was an outpouring of a national sense of pride in what was happening. I would like to, for the record, read the words of the apology so they can be associated more directly with my speech. With the indulgence of the Main Committee: … today we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history. We reflect on their past mistreatment. We reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generations-this blemished chapter in our nation’s history. MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
304,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (4.55 Pm),"Firstly, I would like to congratulate every member ofThe time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia’s history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future. We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians. We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country. For the pain, suffering and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry. To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry. And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry. We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation. For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written. We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians. A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again. A future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity. A future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed. A future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility. A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia. I wanted to read that into the record because I actually believe in the words. I think they are most profound and most significant and will make a huge difference to this nation. For many people, arising out of the apology was the question: why apologise? There have been many explanations given as to why we should apologise and I will not give any of them, because I feel that, if you get to the point in a conversation or a debate where you need to explain to anybody why something needs to happen, you have already lost your argument. This needs no further explanation. The words contained in the apology in themselves are sufficient explanation, sufficient reason for this apology to have taken place. I also want to refer, on the record, to the very significant moment at the opening of the 42nd Parliament in 2008 where we did a welcome to country. Many Australians listening to my words or reading them later would understand that a welcome to country is quite a normal, well-accepted and well-used way of bringing people together at a particular event. I can think of no more natural, normal and significant way for the Australian parliament to begin its proceedings and open a new parliament than to have a welcome to country. The beauty about it was that, as I sat in the Great Hall, not too sure just how the welcome to country would take place, I felt a welling of emotion, a sense of pride. I just felt this was so much part of what an MAIN COMMITTEE Australian parliament should be. We are an Australian parliament and this was just a very natural thing to have taken place. By the time the hour had elapsed and we had done the welcome to country, I realised just how that welcome to country from Indigenous folk is meant to be. It really is about opening your arms up wide. It really is about saying, ‘The doors are open to all Australians.’ It really is about saying, ‘You’re all welcome.’ We heard many, many stories on that day-and not only from the Prime Minister but also in the speeches that followed-but one in particular that sticks in my mind is of an elderly Aboriginal gentleman in Canberra who came to the opening of parliament in the early seventies and was told to move on. He was basically told that he was not welcome. Reflecting on that, you would think that today that would be impossible-today, how dare we or anyone else take that attitude? We would all rally up with cries of shame. How could we possibly accept that today, in 2008, we would allow an Aboriginal person, an Indigenous person-or any other person, for that matter-who just wanted to witness proceedings and be a part of the opening of an Australian parliament to be turned away because of who they are? But that did happen and it happened not so long ago. It happened 30 years ago, which seems not long ago at all. The significance of this event-the welcome to country and the apology to Indigenous Australians-I think is the turning of a page, the writing of a new page in history. It is so many significant things. It is a commitment that has been made by this parliament and by this generation of Australians, on behalf of all of us, to Indigenous people. I said at the start and I will say it again: this is not a political matter. This is not an issue of partisan politics because, in the end, it is bigger than each of us individually and, I would say, bigger than all of us collectively. This is a significant event for all Australians, whoever we are and wherever we are from. Interestingly, from some polls taken since the apology, it seems that about 70 per cent of Australians are in support of the apology. There will always be some who do not support something, but they are very much a small voice. I think with the passage of time they will come to understand and to realise that this was a really good thing to do-just a really good and decent thing to do. Seventy per cent is a good figure, in fact, and I am quite proud that so many Australians are fully supportive of what took place. I also want to say that there is a great sense of pride in my local community-in Ipswich, in Inala and right throughout the western corridor. I know how much this means to a lot of people who are not asking for anything out of this. I think, deep down, they just wanted to have this sense of ‘we’re Australian as well’ and ‘we belong’. It is very, very important. While I have the opportunity, I also want to make mention of Ipswich City Council, who have spent the past two years working on an agreement with local Indigenous people on land use. It is significant because it is the first of its kind in Australia. It is significant because it demonstrated leadership; it showed the way forward. This document, which the Ipswich City Council spent two years negotiating in partnership with local Indigenous groups, will be used as a template for all other councils around Australia. I would recommend any council to look at it and see what took place. It was the first time that a local government authority sat down genuinely, in equal partnership, with its local Indigenous people and said: ‘We want to have a land use agreement with you. We want to do that because we respect your views and your appreciation of the land and we want to work with you.’ I think that is really important, so I MAIN COMMITTEE mention on the record the leadership that was shown by Ipswich City Council and its mayor. I mention the leadership of Mayor Paul Pisasale on this and the hard work of Deputy Mayor Victor Atwood to make it happen. It certainly was not easy, but it was worth doing-that was one of the key messages I got out of it. What is really important, what is maybe more important than a lot of the things that have been said about the apology, is that this really is an opportunity and a point in time where a lot of people, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, can move on, where the debate can move on and where there is some sort of finality to one chapter so we can write a new one. I think that is very, very important. Now it is about dealing with those other issues. Now it is about dealing with bridging the gap on life expectancy; we have heard details of just how atrocious that is. It is now about trying to deal with the real issue of health care and the gap in terms of healthcare provision for Indigenous Australians and other Australians. It is now about bridging the gap in educational standards, in opportunity, in careers, in quality of life, in all the other things that we just take for granted and in that sense of belonging and feeling that you are at home. I am sure that migrants to this country would understand exactly what I mean when I say ‘feeling you are at home’, because feeling at home is not so much a case of where you were born. It is like the old saying: home is where you hang your hat. For a lot of Australians-in fact, all Australians that are not originally Australian-the sense of feeling at home is about knowing that you belong; it is about where you hang your hat; it is about having pride in your country; it is about feeling that you are part of your country. To me, the sense of belonging, of empowering people, of giving them the opportunities to move beyond a certain point, is exceptionally significant. The act of apology that this parliament took is not the first-so we should not kid ourselves that somehow we were the very first-but I would say it is the most significant. While we follow in the footsteps of state governments that have already apologised, there was never going to be a true apology, I felt, until it came from the Commonwealth, from the national parliament, from us, so I am very proud that took place. I have got to congratulate the Prime Minister, because what he did was a courageous thing. It showed real leadership; it was about nation building and it was about decency. They are the key elements, to me, of what this was about. It was simple enough, yet it took so long to happen. What is truly amazing is that it has taken more than 100 years for us to finally decide to make the hardest decision of all, the decision that just seemed to be impossible. For many years we heard every possible excuse, but that is all they were: excuses from people that were too weak and lacked the courage to make what seemed like such a hard decision. In the end, if we reflect back now, it just seems so easy, so natural, such a part of something that we should all have done a long, long time ago. I would just like to finish with a couple of thoughts. One is that it took us more than a hundred years to get to this point of making an apology. Let it not take us another 100 years before we bridge the gap on health, education and opportunity. Let us do something significant about those issues as well. What this apology clearly does-and this is why I support it so strongly-is to right the wrongs of the past and to set a path to the future for true reconciliation, for the building of goodwill and for a new beginning for both Indigenous people and all other Australians. TodayI want to record my great pleasure in supporting the apology. As I MAIN COMMITTEE said before, sometimes what seem to be the hardest things in the world to do turn out to be the easiest. (Time expired) Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (5.10 pm)-Firstly, I would like to pay my respects to the Wurundjeri, the traditional owners of the land in my electorate of Chisholm, and their elders past and present. Last Wednesday was a profoundly significant day in the life of this parliament and of this nation, a day on which the parliament finally apologised to the stolen generations. I wish to add to the many expressions of sorrow from both sides of the chamber my own apology. As an Australian and as a member of parliament-the very institution that passed laws and policies that caused the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents and families-I am sorry. I am sorry for the unspeakable pain and the enormous grief, suffering and loss that these actions inflicted upon the many thousands of members of the stolen generations who continue to live with the impact of these unjust policies every day. The grief and injustice is ongoing and resonates today. I cannot begin to imagine the torment experienced by those who were wrenched from their parents and, in turn, those who had their children torn away from them-terrible acts that were the result of policies generated by the Australian parliament and based on nothing more than race. It is my fervent wish, and the wish of Australians, that the apology delivered by the parliament will, in the words of the Prime Minister, ‘remove a great stain from the nation’s soul’ and truly allow the nation, united in the spirit of reconciliation, to build a new future together. Many here in the House have mentioned the overwhelming reactions of those present here in the chamber and across the nation to the Prime Minister’s speech. I was deeply moved to be in the presence of those from the stolen generations who made their way here to hear an apology that many had thought would never take place-certainly not in their lifetime. The sense of joy and relief, felt by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people alike, that finallyfinally-the parliament, and hence the nation, had recognised and acknowledged the truth of the suffering of the stolen generation was palpable. It was truly a momentous and moving day, a historic day, and I am proud to be a member of the government that initiated the motion and of a parliament that provided bipartisan support. This mood in the nation for reconciliation was reflected in my electorate of Chisholm. I was inundated with hundreds of impassioned letters and emails from constituents expressing their wholehearted support for an apology. Many schools throughout my electorate thoughtfully commemorated the morning’s events with their students. Here are just a few I would like to mention: classes at Roberts McCubbin Primary School in Box Hill South and Kerrimuir Primary School in Box Hill North held related activities after watching the broadcast. Mount Scopus Memorial College in Burwood, a very large Jewish school, set up a booth with posters, information and a TV and a DVD replaying the morning’s broadcast. Avila College in Mount Waverley, which has a long relationship with the Indigenous community through Alice Springs, published information in their daily bulletin in the two weeks leading up to the day of the apology. On the day, they began with prayers and watched the broadcast in class, and erected a stand on which they, too, said they were sorry. Last year I actually conducted a reconciliation forum for school captains through to year 12 at Avila, and it was a truly moving occasion to hear our youth also expressing their sorriness. MAIN COMMITTEE As the House is aware, the nation was confronted with those shocking practices through the Bringing them home report, which outlined the devastating stories of thousands of Indigenous families being torn apart by forced removal up until as recently as 1970. Let no-one forget that these practices occurred not in the distant past but as recently as 1970; there are many Indigenous people, now in their late 20s and early 30s, who were removed from their families under these policies. In enacting these policies, different states had separate laws which governed their implementation. Children could be put into an institution or mission dormitory. Some were fostered or adopted, often after spending time in a children’s home. Many spent time in more than one institution or foster family. Many were sent out to work. Others were moved from institutions or foster families to detention centres or psychiatric hospitals. TodayI want to tell the story of Kutcha Edwards, a member of the stolen generation who grew up in children’s homes in my electorate of Chisholm and who is a member of the Whitehorse Friends for Reconciliation group. Kutcha is an acclaimed singer-songwriter, and I have Kutcha’s permission to tell his story. I am also happy to say that Kutcha was here at Parliament House to watch the apology last Wednesday, along with seven of his siblings. It was a very important day for Kutcha and his family. Kutcha was 18 months old when he was taken from his parents in Balranald, in south-west New South Wales, along with five of his brothers and sisters. Kutcha and his siblings were eventually reunited at the Orana Children’s Home, in Burwood in my electorate, where they remained for years. Kutcha also spent part of his early childhood at the Allambie children’s home in Elgar Road. We can only try to imagine the grief, pain and suffering Kutcha and his siblings went through growing up without their family in institutions-taken from their parents because of unjust government policies. I knew many children who lived in Allambie, Orana, the Burwood Boys Home and the Burwood children’s home as my family was involved in church camps where we took children from these institutions for outings. These were predominantly foster children from white Australian families. I did not meet any Indigenous children, but I knew of their suffering from having been separated from their families and living in these homes. These homes have now been shut down, which in one way is a very good thing. But I knew of the pain and suffering of the children I met. They had been removed from their families and placed within fairly similar cultures-I cannot begin to imagine how hard it would have been for Kutcha and his siblings to undergo this transition. Although he met his mother at the age of seven, Kutcha was not reunited with her until he was 14. Because of their separation, he says he found it hard to recognise a bond with his mother when they were together again. Kutcha says he was at parliament last Wednesday as part of a family collective to accept the apology on behalf of his mother and father, who he says tragically ‘went to their grave’ wondering what they had done wrong to have their children taken from them. Kutcha is passionate about his music because he sees it as a way of letting people know that the stolen generation was not a myth-‘it did really happen to real people’. Kutcha has also used his experiences to help others. For the last 19 years, he has worked in the community at various organisations in Melbourne such as the Aboriginal Community Elders Services, the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service, the Fitzroy Stars Youth Club Gymnasium and the Koorie Open Door Education school at Glenroy. He is particularly interested in working MAIN COMMITTEE with Koori youth to empower them with a strong sense of self-worth, self-expression, selfbelief and self-determination. Kutcha’s trip to Canberra was supported by the Whitehorse Friends for Reconciliation. I want to make mention of the great work that the Whitehorse group does in my electorate to further the progress of reconciliation, and to thank them for supporting Kutcha to make it to that very special day. I also want to pay tribute to the tireless work that the Wurundjeri elder Professor Joy Murphy does for her people in the name of reconciliation. Joy is a tremendous advocate for her people but more importantly for the broader community in bringing these two cultures together. I had the honour and pleasure of Joy conducting a welcome to country ceremony in my electorate office not long after I was elected in 1998. It was truly one of the most moving experiences I have had. A group of Aboriginal elders squashed into my tiny office in Box Hill. We decided that a smoking ceremony probably could not be conducted there; we would probably get in trouble. But passing the gum leaf around was a magnificent occasion and I would encourage others to enjoy that wonderful experience we all had the other day when parliament was opened. In his speech the Prime Minister left no doubt that it was the laws enacted by parliament that brought about the stolen generation, and that it was the deliberate policies of the state in the years 1910 to 1970 that led to between one in 10 and one in three young Aboriginal children being removed from their families. The Prime Minister provided the example-one of many on the historical record-of the Northern Territory Protector of Natives, whose words make clear that the practice of Indigenous child removal in this country was predicated solely on the basis of race. The shameful goal was that children of ‘mixed descent’, particularly those with fairer skin, would be absorbed into the wider community so that their unique cultural values and identities would disappear. The goal of assimilation was vigorously pursued. Children and their families were discouraged or prevented from keeping in contact; lies were told that parents did not want to speak to their children or were dead; children’s names were changed or children were raised to hate their Aboriginality and to not speak the language; mission schools that were misleadingly put forth as providing a sound education provided nothing more than preparation for a life of menial labour; sexual abuse in foster homes and institutions was prevalent. There is no question that against the odds some did find happiness in their new homes and were cared for by loving foster families or, less frequently, a conscientiously run institution. That is not in doubt, but this outcome is not the intention of the policy. As the Prime Minister and former Prime Minister Keating asked: imagine if this had happened to you. The effect upon Indigenous children and parents has proved devastating. As the Bringing them home report points out, every Indigenous family has been impacted by the forced removal of children. By saying sorry, we acknowledge the pain of the stolen generation and the truth of what has occurred-that it did take place-and we wish to make amends for the harm caused. It is by our facing up to the past that true reconciliation can take effect and the nation can, united, address the injustices that face Indigenous Australia today. As Sir William Deane, the former Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, stated: MAIN COMMITTEE It should, I think be apparent to all well-meaning people that true reconciliation between the Australian nation and its indigenous people is not achievable in the absence of acknowledgement by the nation of the wrongfulness of the past dispossession, oppression and degradation of the Aboriginal peoples. However, this necessary apology is only a start. As we commit in this apology to never again allow injustice to be inflicted upon Australia’s Indigenous people, we must do all we can to tackle the overwhelming disadvantage they face. The statistics are stark and shocking. Whether it is in educational achievement, employment or life expectancy, Indigenous people lag far behind the rest of the population. We must use the goodwill generated by the apology as a springboard to close the gap. The resolve is there. The Prime Minister has put up real targets that the government can be judged on and measured by. And it is in the spirit of a new beginning that the Leader of the Opposition has also grasped this challenge by agreeing to head, with the Prime Minister, a joint policy commission to develop and implement an effective housing strategy for remote communities over the next five years. With the goodwill generated by the apology, the nation can, in the spirit of reconciliation, put behind itself the failings of past parliaments and move forward together, making real inroads in fighting these inadequacies. It is now my wish, the wish of the parliament and the wish of this country that, through acknowledging these past injustices and asking forgiveness, and through the generosity of Indigenous Australia accepting that apology, a spirit of healing can take place in which we can confront present-day Indigenous disadvantage. I wholeheartedly support the motion put forward by the Prime Minister. I commend the motion to the House. Services) (5.22 pm)-I would like to acknowledge the Kulin Nation, the traditional owners of the land in the area which I represent, and pay my respects to the elders. According to David Horton’s encyclopedia, it was these people I have just referred to with whom John Batman dealt in 1835, when he believed that he had bought the site of Melbourne. Last week, in fact, we saw a momentous and long overdue event take place in the House when the Prime Minister apologised to the stolen generations. As the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, said: We acknowledged the past and laid claim to a new future of shared opportunity for all Australians. We did it to go some way towards righting past wrongs, to complete ... unfinished business. We did it to build a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians based on respect, cooperation and mutual responsibility. I add my wholehearted support to that apology. It was long overdue and a credit to our Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, that he made it a priority on the first sitting of the 42nd Parliament. In fact, it is just over 40 years since the referendum of 1967 that asked for a repeal of section 127 of the Constitution, which stated that Australian natives shall not be counted in the reckoning of the numbers of the Commonwealth. Before this there was a 10-year campaign by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Then the referendum was held in Australia. That referendum was overwhelmingly endorsed, by 90.8 per cent of the voting public. The 1967 referendum deleted section 127 of the Constitution. But, 41 years later, Indigenous people die 17 years earlier than other Australians. Fortyone years from our acknowledgement that no longer were Indigenous Australians to be numbered amongst the fauna, they are still disadvantaged. MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
305,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sCould there be a starker reminder of inequality in Australia than the massive gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians? They suffer more diabetes, heart disease, the ravages of Third World diseases like rheumatic fever and trachoma, more infantile deaths and hospitalisation, more violence, more accidents, more mental health problems, more substance abuse, more unsanitary living conditions and more years in jail. The Productivity Commission report Overcoming Indigenous disadvantage showed that there is still an overwhelming and unacceptable gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health, education and employment and income. Nearly 20 years after the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended prison as a last resort, between 2000 and 2006 there was a 32 per cent jump in the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders locked up. Indigenous students are only half as likely as other Australians to complete year 12 in education. The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is still three times higher than for other Australians, and the yawning income gap between us is a disgrace. I think it is a disgrace that we spent so much of the last 10 years clarifying policies to an electorate that does not understand some topics, yet we found it so hard to utter those two syllables: ‘sorry’. I believe that the issue of the apology has enlarged the hearts, the hopes and the pride of Aboriginal people beyond any measure that I as a non-Aboriginal Australian could have imagined. I believe we were all surprised at the outpouring of interest and the almost sense of relief that the deed had finally been conducted. I do not believe that saying sorry is window dressing; I believe it is a circuit-breaker. By acknowledging wrongs and assessing honestly and rigorously what needs to be done, we move forward. I believe it is the first mile post of a spiritual highway, the way back home for thousands of broken egos and brutalised childhoods, of people so long accustomed to being treated as second class. I believe that saying sorry begins the reconciliation, the building of trust, the mutual respect and the acceptance that can address the underlying discrimination which is a key impediment to the employment opportunities of Indigenous people. Until recently I was a union leader, so employment and workplaces were my business. At the end of last year I looked at what was happening work wise to Indigenous people 40 years on from the referendum. I know that people were happy to boast about Australia’s record low unemployment, but it is not low for everyone. Indigenous people are three times more likely to be unemployed than other Australians and their participation rate only ranks at three-quarters of the average. Of those in work, they are most likely to be employed in low-paid public sector jobs or in low-skilled jobs in the private sector, with Work for the Dole schemes accounting for an ever-increasing share of Indigenous employment. But, surely, if this is a lucky country Indigenous people would be earning the same as the rest of us. The answer should be yes, but in the year 2004-05 Indigenous people on average earned $278 a week less than the rest of us. I believe that the employment policies of the last 11 years have failed Indigenous Australians, especially if we judge them on what is a pretty fundamental indicator: how much you earn and how that flows on correspondingly to a reduction in poverty. When over half of the pay packets of Indigenous Australians in fact comes from government pensions and allowances we have a problem. The Productivity Commission revealed that in the 10 years to 2004 Indigenous workers had no measurable real increase in income. If you are an adult in AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lia aged 45 to 54 and you are not Indigenous, you are likely to earn nearly 2½ times what your Indigenous counterpart of the same age earns. How could this be happening in the golden years of prosperity? It defies belief. I believe we need to inquire into the pay inequities and the factors at work here. Surely this will be a role for the new government. Labor knows that a mark of a fair and just society is how it treats its most disadvantaged citizens. Kevin Rudd and Jenny Macklin have committed Labor to closing the 17-year life expectancy gap, starting with Indigenous children being born today. The Labor government’s initiatives are about making sure that every Indigenous mother and her child have access to comprehensive child and maternal health, home visits, early childhood development, universal preschool for four-year-olds, intensive literacy and numeracy intervention, health care, parenting support and education initiatives in cooperation with state governments and local communities. It is all vital but, to me, education is the key. It is certainly key to creating projects and employment opportunities and to laying the groundwork for a brighter future based on equality and partnership. There are many mistakes to rectify, but I believe that the apology was an enormous step. I believe the healing has already begun. I would like to mention a good friend of mine, Colleen Marion, who once said: Having been brought up in a large family in remote Queensland, living in a tin hut, I loved the fact that our family spoke our language, hunted our own food and lived traditionally. All aboriginal kids should experience that lifestyle. Colleen, who lives in my electorate, now runs a wonderful place called the Gathering Place in the suburb of Maribyrnong, just outside my electorate in my colleague the Hon. Nicola Roxon’s electorate of Gellibrand. Official estimates are that the Indigenous population in the western suburbs of Melbourne number around 3,000, although the Gathering Place thinks it is closer to 4,000. The Gathering Place provides a very good model of intervention which actively assists in practical ways the lives of Indigenous Australians. This place provides accessible services, including a family support unit; a GP clinic, home and community care programs; playgroups; justice and youth workers; and many more. The service has been growing rapidly. For instance, in the last 12 months there has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of clients accessing the Gathering Place services. A year ago, 70 to 80 clients were attending the clinic every month and now it is 140 to 150. Many of them have complex chronic diseases and social circumstances which require referral to services and also support to attend these services. An intake worker assesses every new client to ensure the issues are identified so that appropriate services can be offered. The demand has grown so much that they are expanding from their current premises and have set up a satellite service in Werribee in the Hon. Julia Gillard’s electorate. I was honoured to invite and host Colleen Marion here in Canberra for Sorry Day. She is a magnificent and caring woman who opens her heart for all. The joy and solemnity of Sorry Day touched us all and I think the repercussions are beginning to ripple across the waters of our community immediately. According to Colleen’s Gathering Place: Since the Australian Government’s apology to the stolen generations the gathering place has had an increased number of people from stolen generations approaching the service for support. The apology has been an important step for these people in acknowledging their history to improve their well being. MAIN COMMITTEE I heartily support the motion of the Prime Minister in making an apology to the stolen generations. I commit myself wholeheartedly to this new and more hopeful chapter in Australia in celebrating our ongoing story of reconciliation with Indigenous Australia. rupt him, but the member should refer to ministers either simply by their electorates or by their ministerial responsibilities and not by name. ogy to our Indigenous Australians, especially those who were forcibly removed from their mothers, their families, their communities and their land. Firstly, I offer my respects to the traditional owners of this land in Canberra, the Ngunawal people, and also the traditional owners of the land in my electorate of Hughes, the Dharawal of the coastal regions of Sutherland Shire and the Cabrogal people of the Liverpool area, who archaeologists suggest inhabited the land for over 40,000 years. I know there are many of my constituents who will heartily approve of my support for this motion but, as is to be expected in the healthy, robust democracy that is Australia today, there will be those who will not understand and so I seek to explain to them my reasons. To those who say that this generation, our current generation of Australians, have no share in the responsibility of the actions of generations past, I point out that the policy of removal was a government policy and it was carried out under the orders of Commonwealth and state parliaments over several decades. Parliaments, unlike human beings, command an inherent timeless sovereignty. For example, authorised agreements or contracts, treaties or memorandums of understanding of a parliament, as well as legislation, continue from one government to another and are honoured as existing formal instruments of the parliament. Indeed, parliaments could not be effective as the ultimate authority of our nation if it were otherwise. Therefore, it is right and fitting for this parliament, as the appropriate legal entity, to publicly and humbly express sorrow and contrition for this shameful blot on our national escutcheon. I am grateful that I am actually here as one of the federal members of this parliament to add my name to the names of those who support this motion. I agree with the comments of the member for Oxley, who said that he felt that this was perhaps one of the most significant events in this parliament. Whether the children were stolen or rescued, whether the cause was either fear of or actual abuse, neglect or outright danger of harm, the permanent separation of children from their mothers and communities is not the way to correct any perceived social concern. Whatever the good intentions our forefathers may have had to save these children-and we all know that the road to hell is indeed paved by good intentions-the forced removal of children on a permanent basis from their mothers is a gross act of inhumanity and emotional cruelty. The well-documented stories of the subsequent periods of many of the lives of these children reveal too many who were neglected, abused and violated by the separation. While, no doubt, there were many who were educated and who lived in caring environments, we now also know that far too many experienced a living hell on earth. There are many who have lived in constant fear of physical danger. However, because of their forced separation from their mothers and families, we now know that they all, even those who were properly cared for, suffered severe emotional and psychological scarring that continued for the rest of their lives and, for many, continues to this day.

307,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (5.33 Pm),"I welcome and strongly support this motion of an apolWhat of the mothers? How did they live any kind of life after their children were taken? How could they have found any kind of peace or respite from their distress and their anguish? I would have gone mad if any of my children were taken from me. The good intentions of the parliament, the government of the day and the welfare officers or other officials would have been utterly and totally irrelevant to a grieving and distraught mother. All she would know is that inexplicably and without just cause her babies were taken by strangers and she may never see them again. The very least this parliament can do is say a very public and humble sorry to these children, to these mothers and indeed to all of our nation’s first people. I am grateful to have been in this parliament when this was done. Hopefully, there will now be many Indigenous Australians who will know in their hearts that we here in this place have listened to their voices and have come to understand the terrible sufferings many have endured, although through seriously misguided intentions of good. Hopefully, with this powerful, symbolic expression of sorrow, expressed in the national parliament by the national parliament, the healing can now really begin. There are those who have said that this is simply a grand, symbolic gesture. But symbols have a real role to play in human relationships. They can represent a great promise of a new dawn in such relationships and this one carries with it great portents for our future together. This is a new beginning and this new dawn demands that we do not allow this sorry motion to be just all there is. We as a parliament must ensure that it is a symbol that carries with it great substance in delivering equality and equity for all Australians, and that means addressing the disadvantage we know is grossly suffered by many of our Indigenous Australians today. The Prime Minister is quite right when he says: It is not a sentiment that makes history; but it is our actions that make history. Now is the time to change the history of the relationship between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. I welcome the announcement from the Prime Minister that he will establish a joint policy commission to be led by him and the Leader of the Opposition to develop and implement, to begin with, an effective housing strategy for remote communities over the next five years. This is an excellent next step because, while housing is vital for the proper care of families, individual homeownership is a greater leverage for true equality and equity for Indigenous Australians. The community title system of landownership in remote communities where all land is actually owned by the community itself or by a land council is nothing other than a communist collective. Indeed, I am concerned about an article in today’s Australian by Patricia Karvelas which talks about the 99-year lease system instigated by the previous Prime Minister and the then Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough. In the article Karvelas says: The 99-year lease system was designed to give Aborigines the opportunity to buy and look after their own homes rather than return to the communal title-the system under which all land is jointly owned by the local community. This indeed is a communist style collective and it is something that we do not impose on other Australians. We should not bear inequality and inequity and impose it on our Indigenous Australians. There is something dignified about being able to own one’s home, and our Indigenous Australians have that right alongside non-Indigenous Australians. I strongly supported MAIN COMMITTEE the measures by the previous Prime Minister in this regard and I commend the value of individual homeownership to the current Prime Minister. The conditions and living standards of Australians in remote communities have challenged governments now for some decades. In more recent times we have heard the stories of horror and violence against women and children in many of those remote communities-stories that make us realise that many of them are at the point where they live their lives in constant fear and hunger. Back in 1998 I actually spoke on a report by Professor Boni Robertson from Griffith University in Queensland where she and a panel of Indigenous women elders went and investigated the violence in remote Indigenous communities in North Queensland. I was concerned that for about two years after that report was handed down it was met with silence. Nothing, however, is quite as powerful as an idea whose time has come and it is now clear that the concept that we have to address the violence and neglect in remote Indigenous communities is right before us. Many of the children and women who have been subjected to violence in these remote communities have experienced neglect induced by the unlimited alcohol, and have been debased by the pornographic material, available in those communities. In a way, this was a result of further misguided good intentions of the government of the day, but also the debilitating corrosive impact of welfare. I note many of the comments that have been articulated by leaders of Indigenous communities today regarding how welfare kills softly. I commend again the previous minister for Indigenous affairs, the Hon. Mal Brough, for his work in addressing this serious issue in many of our remote communities of Australia. But again I agree with the current Prime Minister when he said: The old approaches are not working. We need a new beginning ... a new beginning that draws intelligently on the experiences of new policy settings across the nation. I would like to make a contribution to this new beginning and it is appropriate that we make a start with housing and with the education of children, as he has indeed suggested; but this must be done in a culturally sensitive manner. At this point I make the observation that abused and neglected children are found not just in remote Indigenous communities but also in nonIndigenous Australia. Indeed, it is a regular and genuine cause for wondering whether or not we actually like children in our country anymore when we see the constant news reports of abuse and violence against Australian children. Last year most Australians were shocked and horrified to hear of a little girl who was starved to death, and only yesterday I was disturbed to hear news of two young children who died in mysterious circumstances in their home in a suburb close to Liverpool in my electorate. It is clear that the agencies that various Australian governments have put in place for the protection of Australian children are not working. It is impossible for a DoCS officer to live permanently in the homes of troubled families. If ever there was an urgent call for a new beginning it is certainly here in the protection of young Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Imagine if we could provide safe accommodation for these children that included a structured learning environment where meals and supervised play were provided with care and a genuine commitment to their progress. Imagine if these centres had world-class facilities, state-of-the-art classrooms and swimming pools, tennis courts, playing fields, fully equipped gyms, craft and music rooms. Why not? Why could the centres not boast the very best teachers and special educators that money could buy? Not only can I imagine such a place but I know of such a place. It is Boys Town in my electorate at Engadine. Boys Town provides such a structured learning environment for MAIN COMMITTEE boys who come from troubled families. The boys generally arrive on Sunday evenings and return to their homes on Friday evenings for the weekend. Such learning facilities as Boys Town could easily be provided across the nation by the federal government. We are wealthy enough to provide for our children. Teachers could ideally be on rotation from the mainstream educational system of each state, with specialist teachers and educators appointed as required. Such centres could offer first-class facilities and maintain the highest educational standards. They would provide a real circuit-breaker for a child existing in neglected or traumatic circumstances who is identified as needing interim protection from a troubled family or community. However, the children would not be permanently separated from their parents or families or those communities because they would be able to return home on weekends or on a basis that is practical and suitable to each individual child. The children would be able to maintain-indeed, would be encouraged to maintain-those vital links with culture, family and community. The provision of appropriate housing and education for children are only two areas of concern that require our immediate attention and action if we are to implement important actual indicators of our genuine expression of reconciliation. It will, indeed, be a new page in our shared history that will allow us to write a vision for a bright future together as fellow Australians, as one people. I wholeheartedly welcome and support this motion to say sorry and I commend the motion to the House. and did what was just. When we seek to reconcile ourselves with those to whom great wrongs have been done, we must first tell the truth. We must first acknowledge what was done, because if we fail to recognise the truth there can be no reconciliation. The parliament last week collectively did just that. We recognised that great wrongs had been done, wrong policies of past parliaments and past governments, some of which intended and all of which assumed the gradual disappearance of the Aboriginal people of Australia. They were said to be a dying race. It was said that the kindest thing, the only thing, that could be done was to smooth the pillow of their passing. The stories told in the Bringing them home report are horrible to recall, horrible to relate and have traumatised many people when they have read them. I first heard about the stolen generation long before that, some years before when I was working closely with Lowitja O’Donoghue. She told me her own story, which was new to me. I had never imagined that policies in the 20th century had been as racially based or that programs of removal of children for reasons that were racially based had been so widespread over such a long period of time. When we recognise the error of those ways, we should not be mealy-mouthed about stating them to be wrong. We did that. Wednesday last week was a very proud day to be a member of the Australian parliament. So much of what we say here is lost in the fury of partisan debate and political points scored, but last week this parliament spoke from the heart. I believe we spoke for the vast majority of Australians. We were right to say sorry and I was very proud to stand together with members of the House of Representatives from both sides in saying sorry on behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the people we represent. Some Australians have been concerned about taking on guilt. ‘Intergenerational guilt’ is the phrase that has been used. We cannot take on the guilt of wrongs that were done by other people. Nobody can take on the guilt of a wrong done by another person. If guilt is to be imputed MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
308,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (5.47 Pm),"Last week this parliament said what was trueto the actions of others, then that guilt stands with them. What we can do is open our hearts and recognise those wrongs and recognise the errors that were made and express our empathy and compassion from the bottom of our heart. When we do that we are engaged in what Pope John Paul II once described as the purification of memory. Memory has to be respected. It has to be true. We have to recognise what was done, then we have to recognise the facts and then we have to recognise the character of what was done and provide our own moral response to it. In doing that and in saying sorry, making that apology for wrongs that were done in previous times, we build a bridge towards true reconciliation. It enables us to move on. Just as the apology, the statement of ‘sorry’, was so meaningful, symbolic, so generous and so much from the heart, so too was the way in which it was accepted. I was as moved by the Aboriginal people in the parliament with the T-shirts carrying the word ‘Thanks’ as I was by any of the oratory from the members of parliament who spoke so eloquently on the day. That acceptance of the apology was an act of grace, and it provided the completion of that purification of memory of which the Pope spoke. When I left the chamber and walked out into the Great Hall and the surrounds I saw so many people, but I was looking for one. I was looking for Lowitja O’Donoghue. And there she was, the woman who had told me first about the stolen generation, told me her own personal story, told me about the hurt and the sense of betrayal and the yearning for reconciliation. And there she was, at the moment when ‘sorry’ was said, when the apology was given. I will never forget that moment. I do not think any of us who were here last week will ever forget it. In this parliament of course we represent all Australia. We represent our own constituents, but we represent all Australia. When we rise together we represent the nation that elected us. But we also come here as representatives of our own community, and I just want to record the commitment of so many people in my electorate of Wentworth, Indigenous Australians and many non-Indigenous Australians, who wrote to me and called me and urged me to support the motion. Of course, most of them knew that I did support the motion-I have been on the record about this for some time. They lent their support to the apology and told me that I had their support in saying sorry. I feel that day brought Australians together. I do not believe it carried guilt from one generation to another. I do not think that is possible. WhatI think it did do was carry an act of grace from our generation to the generations that were so cruelly wronged. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (5.55 pm)-I begin my contribution on the motion of apology to Australia’s Indigenous peoples by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which this parliament meets. I want to thank Matilda House and the Ngunawal elders for their welcome to country which was performed at the opening of parliament last Tuesday. I would also like to pay my respects to the Darumbal people, who are the traditional owners of Rockhampton and much of the land which is included within my electorate of Capricornia. For me the act of apologising to the members of the stolen generations and their families who have followed them, and who today carry the hurt that was done to their mums and dads and aunties and uncles, is easy. I have always believed that to follow our very fundamental human instincts when faced with the suffering and pain of another human being and to say sorry-to say sorry when we feel sorry-is the right thing to do. Last week’s apology by the parliament to the stolen generation of Indigenous children, to their descendants and to the MAIN COMMITTEE families they left behind felt right. It felt right for me standing in the chamber and it felt right for the countless Australians who stopped to watch and listen to the apology and who cried, cheered and embraced at the sound of that word ‘sorry’. It felt right because it was the right thing to do, and it should have been done many years ago. There has been a gap, a chasm, between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia for too long over this failure to be very honest with each other and to feel empathy for what has happened in the past. A lot of speakers-and the preceding speaker, the member for Wentworth, raised it in his comments-have talked about the notion of apologising for something that we individually did not do, that we do not have individual responsibility for and that has not been done by this parliament or by any of us within the parliament. I have had to give an explanation for that to my son. I have a son who is almost five and he put that very basic question to me in the week leading up to the apology in parliament, saying, ‘But why would you say sorry for something that you didn’t do?’ Children often put those things in pretty blunt terms. I explained to him that when you come across someone who is hurting, feels bad and needs comfort surely it is a natural reaction to say, ‘I’m sorry-not sorry that I did something to you, not sorry because it’s my fault that you feel that way, but sorry that you are feeling that way. I am sorry for the hurt that has been done to you and I am sorry for how it has left you feeling.’ My son had no difficulty understanding that when I explained to him how I felt about it-and that is certainly how I do feel about it. These people are hurting, and I am sorry for their hurt. So there is no question for me about the act of saying sorry and all that it symbolises. I guess what I have struggled with are the words to use. What do I say to those Indigenous people in Central Queensland who have been carrying the pain of separation from their mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, the injustice of discrimination and the indignity of their treatment, carried out in the name of past governments? What do I say to them? I have grappled with that task ever since it was announced that, living up to the commitment that we gave to all Australians at the election, there would be an apology given by the parliament to the members of the stolen generation as the first act of a Rudd Labor government in the new parliament. But, after being part of the apology in the parliament last Wednesday and seeing the reaction across the country, I am reassured that when it comes to starting the healing process for the stolen generation and our Indigenous peoples-and, indeed, for our nation as a whole-that one word is strong enough to carry the weight of our expectations, our expectations that that word can right past wrongs and our expectations that it can lead to a better future. SoI say ‘Sorry’. In the words of the motion moved in the parliament last week, I am sorry for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on my fellow Australians. I am sorry especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country. I am sorry for the pain, suffering and hurt of those stolen generations, their descendants and for their families left behind. I say sorry to the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities. AndI say sorry for the indignity and degradation that was thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture. I think all of us would hope that last week’s apology represents the turning of a new page in Australia’s history and all of us welcome that opportunity. It has been too long coming and we are pleased that it is now here. In turning that page, however, we should not forget the acMAIN COMMITTEE tions of the past that have done so much damage and that have caused Indigenous people so much pain. We must pay our Indigenous peoples the respect of honouring their history, even those parts that may be uncomfortable for non-Indigenous Australians to face. Turning the page on this chapter should not be read as sweeping this part of our history under the rug. Indigenous people and especially those members of the stolen generations and their families have had to live with the reality of the past for decades-the reality of the past and the legacy of the past that carries on through subsequent generations of those families and communities that were affected by these policies. The Bringing them home report of 1997 brought that history to life and meant that none of us could continue to shelter behind the excuse that we did not know what had happened. Page after page of that report tells us that it happened. It tells us in absolutely heart-rending detail that it happened. Page after page of that report tells us that children were taken away, that abuse happened, that mothers and fathers were left heartbroken and, indeed, many lives were completely broken. Many families, not surprisingly, never, ever recovered from what happened to them. Communities were destroyed and we see the results of these policies in Indigenous communities today. In that report so many brave people told their stories of loss, grief and pain. We owe it to them to face up to what happened, accept that its legacy lives on in present-day disadvantage and take the steps, both practical and symbolic, to make amends. Having said sorry-having said that powerful word ‘sorry’-I feel that I have said enough for now. Now it is time to listen to the Indigenous people in Central Queensland to learn how we can best work together to achieve our shared goal of reducing Indigenous disadvantage in all its forms. When it comes to listening I was given the chance to reflect on what that means in a poem that one of our local Indigenous leaders Margaret Holdagorn sent to me last week after hearing the apology. It is a piece written by a woman called Miriam Rose Ungunmerr. It is called Dadirri: listening to one another. I will be reflecting on this as I go back to my electorate with the aim of working closely with the Indigenous people of Central Queensland and listening to them. The piece says: Dadirri. A special quality, a unique gift of the Aboriginal people, is inner deep listening and quiet still awareness … It is something like what you call contemplation. Miriam Ungunmerr goes on to say: Our people are used to the struggle and the long waiting. We still wait for the white people to understand us better. We ourselves have spent many years learning about the white man’s ways; we have learnt to speak the white man’s language; we have listened to what he had to say. This learning and listening should go both ways. We would like people in Australia to take time and listen to us. We are hoping people will come closer. We keep on longing for the things that we have always hoped for, respect and understanding. We know that our white brothers and sisters carry their own particular burdens. We believe that if they let us come to them, if they open up their minds and hearts to us, we may lighten their burdens. There is a struggle for us, but we have not lost our spirit of Dadirri. I want to thank Margaret Hornagold for sending that to me, because it has given me a lot to think about as I go about working with her and other Indigenous people in my electorate on the very big task we have ahead of us in bridging the gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. As Miriam Rose Ungunmerr says in this piece, it has taken a long time, and I hope we are now at that point. I hope we have moved on as a country to a place MAIN COMMITTEE where we can put aside the unfinished business that has stood between us, that we can now listen to each other in an honest way, where we can truly work together to make this country as good for Indigenous people as it has been for the non-Indigenous people, and that we will have a truly shared future together. electorate in New South Wales, which also has a very large Aboriginal population, I am obviously aware of the issues surrounding the apology last week and also very aware of the issues surrounding my electorate of Calare and the issues surrounding the Aboriginal people who live in it. Let me tell you that they are a very, very welcome and very, very wanted part of that part of Australia. They play a very important role, as do all people in the electorate of Calare and in fact in western New South Wales. Nobody wants to help Aboriginal Australians move forward-or, more correctly, help them move themselves forward-more than I do, but an apology that does not have the resolve to act, to let the past go, means nothing at all. That really means that everybody on both sides, if there are sides in this debate, has to be able to move forward from the past, from the blame game-as is a popular thing to say these days-and get on with life. There are two sides to every equation or two sides to the game, and both sides have to be able to let go and move forward. I think almost all people in the past-I say ‘almost all’; not everyone, obviously-be they government or whoever, have acted or have thought they acted with the right intentions. But unfortunately there were some who acted under racist misconceptions. We are talking about children who were removed from their families. Obviously, the child’s welfare is much more important than the feelings of the parents involved. It does not matter what the background of the parents is-if a child is in danger then it has to be removed, whether it is 100 years ago or today. But where a child has been removed because of the culture of the parents then obviously there is no question that it was wrong and should not have happened, and let us hope it never happens again. The one thing that I am very disappointed about in the current debate and the talk that has certainly-and I am very pleased that it has-come to the surface since the events of last week is in the events surrounding what has been happening in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia. People are forgetting-I am not, and western New South Wales and New South Wales as a whole are not-that the issues that exist there also exist in New South Wales. In my electorate and in western New South Wales, these issues are also there. I very much urge the new government to work with the New South Wales government to get it to look at its own report, which I will mention in a moment. I take this opportunity to stray away from the straight issue of the apology to look at the issues which are so current around Australia, be they in the Northern Territory, be they in western New South Wales or wherever they might be. I think that in what the Prime Minister calls the new spirit of cooperation or getting rid of the blame game it is incumbent upon the current government to deal with New South Wales and to take action, or to get the New South Wales government, because we are not talking about the Northern Territory here, to take action to make life better for my constituents, particularly my Aboriginal constituents, in the electorate of Calare and western New South Wales-and what affects one really affects the lot, so we are talking about the whole population. MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
309,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (6.06 Pm),"As the member for a large electorate, the largestI have been very vocal about Indigenous issues in western New South Wales. What really pains me is that the New South Wales government has all but ignored a report first commissioned by the current federal Minister for Home Affairs when he was a minister in the New South Wales government. The report, which is called Breaking the silence: creating the future, addressed child sexual assault in Aboriginal communities in New South Wales, painting a horrific picture of abuse within Indigenous communities in our state, yet it has basically been ignored. In fact, take the report which provided the basis on which the previous government moved to intervene in the Northern Territory, Little children are sacred. Well, the New South Wales report Breaking the silence, which was commissioned a long time before that federal one, having been handed down almost two years before Little children are sacred was, pretty much says exactly what the report on Northern Territory matters, Little children are sacred, said-yet it is being ignored. For those of us who live in New South Wales that is a terrible thing. That is an indictment of the New South Wales government. Most importantly, that is a terrible thing for those little Aboriginal children in New South Wales who are still suffering what is addressed in that report. As a minister, I was very fortunate to have on my staff Peter ‘Chika’ Gibbs. Many of those from the last parliament who are still here, being those on both sides of the chamber who are members of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship Group, will remember Peter’s very powerful speeches, in the committee room and in the Great Hall last year, which left quite a few of you in tears. Peter is a product of the back country of New South Wales. He grew up Weilmoringle, a very small village which is actually in my electorate of Calare. It is north of Brewarrina. He is very proud to be an Aboriginal and of his Indigenous heritage, and it is fair to say that his life has not always been an easy one. He had a simple mantra that he wanted people, particularly Aboriginal people or those of that descent, to know: ‘No matter how difficult one’s life, there is only one person responsible for your own actions, and that is you. Without making changes in your own life then nothing will get better.’ I read with interest an article in the Australian newspaper by its editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, earlier in the week. I believe that it is worth quoting in this forum as it speaks eloquently of the dilemma facing all of us in this place. It does not matter what our political persuasion is as it faces all of us. As the member for Wentworth said earlier, we all represent all Australians. This is what Kelly says: The apology is demanded by our humanity and respect for fellow human beings in a shared community. But Rudd rejects the 1997 demand for compensation, rejects the report’s accusation of genocide and repudiates the false trail of intergenerational guilt. He then goes on to say: This amounts to a devastating critique of the current and past generation of Liberal and Labor governments. At this point Rudd confronts a new denialism. Just as John Howard was wrong to deny the confessional value of the apology, many Laborites are wrong to deny the abject failures of past generation policies. When it comes to Indigenous affairs, many Australians have firm, entrenched views on the subject. The verbal apology which was expressed in parliament last week and was endorsed by all parties is going to please many Aboriginals and many non-Aboriginals. While this might be a symbolic but sincere gesture, I hope it is not used by some people to fuel ongoing divisiveness. MAIN COMMITTEE It is now incumbent upon all of us to move forward with programs of support and inclusion for our Indigenous communities and to not allow the clock to wind back and raise further resentment and conflict. I think the whole point is that this is a wasted exercise if people cannot move forward from it. Actions always speak louder than words. It is imperative that the actions of this government support an ongoing collaboration between federal government and the Aboriginal communities and people of Australia and that the government shows no fear in taking action where action must be taken-as we did in the Northern Territory last year, backed up at that time by the current Territory government. I am not a Territorian but I have been up there a bit and I know a lot of people, such as Nigel Scullion, with vast experience up there. I think it will be a great pity if the current government brings back the permit system. We really must look upon this as helping the Northern Territory, because the one thing I do know is that, when Aboriginal women of the Northern Territory feel safe to talk about these things, they are themselves very supportive of the actions taken by the Commonwealth government up there last year. I strongly believe that action needs to be taken in western New South Wales too. I think that, while our issues are not as widespread, people in western New South Wales are probably more exposed to the general media. Already people in the Calare electorate are talking about a ‘lost generation’. We cannot move forward from this without leadership from the Aboriginal community. It is important that it continues to grow, as it has with people such as Noel Pearson and Warren Mundine-he comes from Dubbo and is someone I know quite well. And there is the person I mentioned a while ago, Peter Gibbs. They are all demanding reform by Aboriginal groups themselves. They are demanding reforms not just by us, the parliament and the people of Australia, but by the Aboriginal community itself. They know that their attitudes have to change to help themselves; we cannot do it if they are not part of it, quite obviously. While no-one can be proud of some aspects of our history, it is very telling that most of the events of the last 100 years were done in good faith; although not all, obviously. I am well aware that many in our community will not agree with the apology. However, given our understanding that this is not and cannot be about recompense, financial or otherwise, we all have to move on from here. Let us take this opportunity to do that. The acceptance of the Australian community that it is time to actively move forward and support all sectors of the community will go a long way to assisting our reconciliation process. All of us need to be a part of assisting the Aboriginal community to help themselves, just as with any other disadvantaged section of our community. the land we are gathered on and thanking them for their continuing stewardship. I am pleased to speak in support of the motion of apology to Australia’s Indigenous people. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, made the following comment in his famous Redfern speech on 10 December 1992-on the eve of the International Year of the World’s Indigenous People. Think of that it was 10 December 1992 and the Prime Minister had only recently taken office. It was not long after the Mabo decision of that year. He said: It will be a year of great significance for Australia. It comes at a time when we have committed ourselves to succeeding in the test which so far we have always failed. MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
310,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (6.20 Pm),"I start by acknowledging the traditional owners ofBecause, in truth, we cannot confidently say that we have succeeded as we would like to have succeeded if we have not managed to extend opportunity and care, dignity and hope to the indigenous people of Australia-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. Paul Keating made that famous speech at Redfern on 10 December 1992 only six months after Chief Justice Brennan of the High Court had handed down the Mabo decision. Cast your mind back to the atmosphere of that time, of 1992 after the Mabo decision. There were headlines saying that our backyards were going to be taken by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The farmers were up in arms saying that all their land was going to be taken. There was fear being cultivated by a lot of people out in the community about how Australia was going to change. Yet, six short months later, Paul Keating, the newly appointed Prime Minister, stood up and made that Redfern speech. He was a new Prime Minister and that is what he said. He wanted to move the Australian people to a greater understanding. How adventurous and brave was the Prime Minister to make that speech? What sort of vision was that for a new Prime Minister in the light of the atmosphere of fear and misunderstanding in the community? In that demonstration of true leadership Prime Minister Keating then commissioned the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families. This inquiry handed down the Bringing them home report to the Howard government in April 1997. Think of that flow of events and the significant players in those events-Paul Keating and then the new Prime Minister, John Howard. In 10 years of having that report, the coalition government did nothing. If you think back to the coalition governments before then, Malcolm Fraser brought in the Racial Discrimination Act. He was a great man of vision in reaching out to the Aboriginal people. Obviously, Malcolm Fraser’s experience in dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was quite different. Maybe it was because Malcolm Fraser had a different attitude. My understanding is that he had an Aboriginal nanny who helped raise and educate him about the significant beliefs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Flick back from Malcolm Fraser, that Liberal Prime Minister, to the next Liberal Prime Minister, his former Treasurer, and look at how he responded to the Bringing them home report handed to him in April 1997. Prime Minister Howard had all those years-10 years-to do something to respond to that report, to make a gesture, to make even a symbolic gesture, but he stands condemned as someone who did nothing. Last Wednesday, my first Wednesday in this House, there was quite a lot of emotion in the House. On the floor, I saw tears in the eyes of many people. Indigenous elders from the stolen generation were here; there were tears from Anglo-Saxons; there were tears from everyone in terms of the emotion that was in that House as the nation gathered to hear that historic apology. Not that we saw it in the chamber, obviously, but apparently some people turned their backs on the Leader of the Opposition. I can understand that kind of emotion because the coalition government had turned their backs on the stolen generations for more than 10 years. SoI can understand that people might act in a way that I would consider to be poor manners. The feelings that people had ran high and had festered for 10 years-festered for the 70 years, some might say, from when these policies were first carried out. Feelings festered to the extent that people felt compelled to turn their backs. As I said, my good manners would prevent me from so doing, but I can understand how people might feel compelled to do something. MAIN COMMITTEE In my dealings as a union organiser, I organised in independent schools. People might think that independent schools are only grammar schools and the like, but a lot of Aboriginal schools are independent. I had the pleasure of being a union organiser out at Wadja Wadja High School, west of Rockhampton. I was also fortunate enough to have a school with a high Aboriginal population in the middle of Moreton, at Sunnybank, and right on the border in OxleyI had the Murri School, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school. I think there is even an Aboriginal kindergarten in the Prime Minister’s electorate, just a couple of blocks down from my electorate. In my visits to those schools as a union organiser and in meetings in the lead-up to the elections over the last couple of years, so many times Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have said: ‘How come we can’t even get a sorry-one word? How come we can’t get a sorry out of the coalition government? How come Prime Minister Howard uses his weasel words to avoid saying a simple word like sorry? Shameful, shameful, shameful.’ I would like to return once more to Prime Minister Keating’s Redfern speech. It is significant that he chose Redfern to make one of his most significant speeches-a fine piece of oratory, a fine piece of poetry treasured by many people throughout Australia. He chose Redfern rather than an Aboriginal settlement in the Northern Territory or North Queensland, I guess, because it is symbolic of the urban reality for so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and because of the socioeconomic challenges that are often exhibited in this community. He also chose Redfern because it was a speech about hope. I will return to his speech and quote further. He said, and remember that this is on 10 December 1992: There is one thing today we cannot imagine. We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through 50 000 years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation. We cannot imagine that. We cannot imagine that we will fail. And with the spirit that is here today I am confident that we won’t. I am confident that we will succeed in this decade. Then, on 2 March 1996, that advancement towards reconciliation and a greater hope for Australia came to a screaming halt, when John Howard and the Howard government ensured that nothing else happened. We did not go forward as a nation in the late nineties. Instead, things stopped. I certainly commend all the representatives in the House of Representatives last Wednesday who took part in that apology and were heartfelt in their apology. But, unfortunately, obviously not everyone from the other side of the chamber was prepared to participate in that apology. From my recollection, there were at least seven or eight people who either walked out or were missing and were not prepared to stay committed to what I assume was a collective coalition decision to participate in the apology. Maybe people were absent for other reasons. Maybe they had meetings planned-I am not sure. But I think it is shameful that people did not stay united and speak from the chamber as one in saying sorry to the stolen generations and to the representatives who were there in the chamber. It is interesting. There was the sorry last Wednesday, a great day in this nation’s history, and then we move forward to Four Corners on Monday night, where the new coalition memMAIN COMMITTEE bers were trying to rewrite history. Apparently it was John Howard who called the shots on everything. No-one was able to speak up with such a voice to actually move him in any way. Any bad decision that was made was all John Howard’s. No voice at that cabinet table was able to pass comment on Work Choices and obviously no voice at that table was able to speak on behalf of the stolen generations or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people generally. It is almost as though the current opposition are trying to rewrite history. It is not really a ‘black armband’ view of history, which was John Howard’s favourite phrase for condemning the Labor Party for trying to present the facts; I guess you could call it a ‘slack armband’ version of history: ‘It wasn’t me-no, it was all John Howard. John Howard did everything bad.’ I was fortunate enough to grow up in a country town where about one-quarter of the population, or a bit more than that probably, were Murris, were Aborigines. I do not go out to St George all that often-I am going out at Easter for a school reunion-but it is amazing the number of Murri friends who have phoned me up to comment on the apology and what it meant to them. These are not children of the stolen generation at all; these are people who did not have that experience. But it is amazing the number of them who have phoned up to say how great that was, how much it meant to them. It has really changed their view of government and what it can do. By refusing to say sorry, by refusing to take the Bringing them home report recommendations and do something with them, the Howard government betrayed the real roots of Australia. It was almost like it was trying to erase the Mabo decision and say: ‘No, no-terra nullius really did exist. There were no people here before Captain Cook and the First Fleet came to Australia.’ That is what the Howard government was saying. So many of my friends in St George and other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made comment about how wonderful that gesture was from the Prime Minister and Jenny Macklin. That is why I am very proud, after my first speech, to be affirming the apology. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (6.33 pm)-CanI say, with the indulgence of the chamber, that I have very little voice left, but I am quite determined to use what I have left to put on the record of this place my support for the extension of the apology to the stolen generation that occurred last Wednesday on behalf of the parliament. I cannot help but feel that last Wednesday was a moment in my parliamentary career that will never be surpassed. It was certainly a wonderful feeling to win government and to be able to implement the programs that I know so many of my colleagues and the general public had been hoping would become the story of this nation. But, despite the level of pleasure I felt in that, it still did not come close to the feeling that was in the chamber on Wednesday when finally, more than 10 years after the tabling of the Bringing them home report, the parliament of this nation extended an apology to the stolen generation. I think what was so profound about it was the fact that there are very few things more powerful in life than to say sorry. Sometimes we do it glibly and sometimes we devalue the word ‘sorry’, but saying sorry is one of the most powerful things we can do as one individual to another or as a government to a people. By saying sorry, you do not ask yourself the question: how does this affect me? You ask yourself the question: how does doing this affect you? By saying sorry, you do not ask yourself: what does this cost me? You ask yourself: what will not doing this cost you? I think the MAIN COMMITTEE story of our Indigenous people has made it very, very clear to us that the power of extending that sorry to them cost us very little and meant a terribly great deal to them. The faces in the chamber and those that we saw on the evening news in tears or with smiles of joy demonstrated visibly how powerfully important the extension of that apology was. I speak mainly as a mother in this chamber. As the member for Cunningham, I am going to use my time to put forward the words of my own constituents on the extension of the apology. But I would just like to briefly talk about my feelings as a mother. I do this because I cannot understand people who extend a justification for the removal of Aboriginal children with an argument that says: but look what they achieved in their life, look at the improvements they made, look at the education or training they got. There is no doubt that many Aboriginal people who were removed from their families and placed into other forms of care may indeed have experienced an education or an opportunity that gave them new avenues in their life. But to say that the price of losing your family is worth that, I find incomprehensible-absolutely incomprehensible. I have a 23-year-old son who is in London and I am missing him terribly and I had the great privilege of 22 years of his life, having him there every day. I cannot begin to imagine how I would have felt if a truck had rolled into my town when he was four, five, six or seven to take him away and I was never to see him again. I cannot imagine the incomprehensible damage that would have done to my life and the grief and suffering that would have been inflicted on our family-and yet this is what happened to 10 to 30 per cent of Aboriginal young people and children, up to 50,000 of them. It is wrong to say that that was purely an intervention to provide protection. There is no way that number of children needed to be removed purely on those grounds. These were hard times; some of it was during the Depression. There were many working families who were out of work, who were having trouble maintaining their families and providing for their children. Indeed, in some cases they did have their children removed. But let us be clear: there was nowhere near the extent of removals that occurred in Aboriginal communities and there was no attempt to put the blame purely on their race. Clearly, these policies were about extinguishing the Aboriginal people. Because they were targeted at mixed blood children, that made the policies’ intentions very clear. My former husband discovered that he was a direct descendant of Bill Ferguson, one of the original Aboriginal activists in New South Wales. I did not know that until he was in his thirties. The other thing that was stolen from generations of people by these policies was their heritage, because what they did was force many people of mixed race, of both Aboriginal and white heritage, to hide their Aboriginal heritage, to deny it for generations for fear that because of that simple mixed blood they would lose their children. So there is so much that was stolen because of these policies and it is so important we reach out. We do it through the apology and we do it through an ongoing commitment to make sure that Aboriginal people’s opportunities in our country are improved. As I said, in the run-up to the extension of the apology in the parliament in the week since, I had at last count 122 emails from local constituents, one of which opposed the extension of the apology. The other 121 supported it. As their representative in this House, I want to place on the record some of the comments that I received from my local constituents. This is from James at North Wollongong: MAIN COMMITTEE Hi. I’m a Cunningham constituent and I’m writing to congratulate you on your re-election and to discuss the apology to the Stolen Generations that is in the news right now. I’m glad to see the new Rudd government getting to work so quickly, particularly on this divisive issue that has been festering for so long. However, I’m concerned that this apology will be purely symbolic. I agree that it is important to take the symbolic action of apologising to the Stolen Generations and reestablishing respectful relations. But I believe an authentic apology must be accompanied by good faith efforts at reparations. In short Ms Bird, I’m asking you to push your party to adopt all of the recommendations of the Bringing Them Home report, not just the symbolic ones. Thanks for your time. Carolyn at Figtree wrote: Just like to say thanks for yours and the Labor party’s support of the apology to the Stolen Generation of Indigenous Australians but as you are aware this is only the first step and we want full implementation of the Bringing Them Home Report. Chris at Thirroul wrote: I am just writing you a short note to express my support for the apology to the stolen generation and the indigenous people of Australia that the government is proposing to make. Indeed, I think, speaking as someone who migrated from England 10 years ago (and is now an Australian citizen) that we should apologise for the wider devastation caused to indigenous peoples for the whole colonial adventure. Certainly I hope that the apology represents the start of a more sustained attempt by the government to address the inequalities and suffering experienced by indigenous peoples expressed for example in the report ‘Bringing Them Home’. Joy from Corrimal wrote: I’m sure you support this bill as well as I do. I just believe you need to know how many of us are behind you. As an adopted non-aboriginal child I know the emotional issues of what it is like to grow up with more questions than answers. To have been removed forcibly and put into a different ethnic family, no matter how well-meaning an advantage, would not compensate for the wrench from one’s own roots. I urge you to urge other MPs to support this ground breaking apology. I also wonder if we are pressuring Britain to apologise for having treated Australian settlement and indigenous relations so differently from their treaties with the First Nation’s aboriginal people of Canada. Colin at Figtree wrote: I applaud the government’s decision to proceed with reconciliation with aboriginal people by agreeing to say ‘sorry’ for past atrocities and neglect. I look forward to seeing this process move on from ‘sorry’ and will be interested in your input and leadership at this time. Justin at Austinmer wrote: I heartily congratulate your party and leader for taking this important first step. I truly hope it’s the beginning of some momentous leadership on this cause and that you’ll be part of this. As we’ve all seen too recently, governments set the tone for leadership. Kevin Rudd is making a great start & I hope he rewards the faith shown in Labor’s fresh approach to government so well reflected at the last election. Lucas from North Wollongong wrote: I would just like to send a quick congratulations to your Government for ticking off my boxes so early in your term of Government.

Thanks again. Greer from Figtree wrote: It is with great relief that I realize that our government is taking the first steps to acknowledge the injustices done to Aboriginal people in the past.

We will be a greater place for making this journey. Sarah of Austinmer wrote: It’s really great the new government has finally taken on board the fundamental importance of an apology to members of the Stolen Generation.

Think how history will judge us in 100 years time, when all the current preoccupation about neo-conservative economics is just a peculiar footnote in a textbook. Think about how our simple acknowledgement of a simple moral tenet, to say we are sorry for the sins of an earlier generation, no matter how well intentioned that may have been, and that we acknowledge they were wrong. We will just be telling the truth, our nation’s leaders were wrong, and we are big enough and honest enough to say so. Please thank Mr Rudd for actually being a leader, and not just being a poll driven pollie. This really makes me proud, especially after the last 11 years. That is only a small sample of the 121 emails. I apologise to the rest of my constituents, who I was not able to put on the record, but I assure you the expressions were reflected in that sample. They all make the point, and I think it is profoundly important, that this is a bridge to a longer term commitment to closing the gap between Indigenous Australians and white Australians. There is no doubt that each of us in this place will be particularly keenly endorsing and supporting the current government’s commitments to closing that gap so that the apology issued last Wednesday will actually be the beginning of a whole new period for Indigenous Australians and an opportunity for them to take some of the many privileges that are their rights as citizens of this nation. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (6.48 pm)Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, congratulations on your appointment to this important position. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the apology that was executed in the chamber last week. I have always been in awe of the fact that I have even had a parliamentary career, and I am very fortunate to have been for the past four terms in this parliament. But I have to say that in all of those years I never quite imagined that an occasion within the parliament-and we have been through a few-would bring quite the level of emotion to everybody involved that last week’s apology did. I have to be honest and say that I, along with lot of my colleagues-on both sides of the House, to be fair-found it a bit overwhelming. I do not think any of us quite imagined the extent this groundswell of reaction within the community would reach. I am very fortunate, as the member for Canberra, to have had a very local connection in many different respects to the proceedings of last week. I want to first of all thank the community of Canberra at large for their obvious support of the occurrences of last week. That support came from not just getting in touch with offices like mine and thoroughly encouraging us to be part of this apology-and I have to say I did not need encouragement to do that, but I welcomed people’s input-but also the turnout of members of the local community who came out to be in or around this building. It was also reflected in those who in their workplaces-and some I know had the encouragement of their employers; even the ACT government allowed their employees to do this-watched the proceedings on television as a community at work and participated in that way. Many Canberrans opened their homes. There was a very widespread email connection and other connections made through this community to say people are coming from everywhere and some of them are going to need some accommodation. Many Canberrans opened their homes and billeted people from all sorts of places. Those stories of those experiences are now MAIN COMMITTEE just beginning to emerge. Some of them are wonderful in terms of the relationships that were formed and the friendships that I believe will, as a result, exist for a long time. The other connection of course is that this has all happened on the Ngunawal land, which is the land upon which we stand here today, which is my local community as well. I put on the record my absolute admiration for Matilda House and her family and the role that they took, particularly in the welcome to country on the Tuesday morning, which I thought was on par with the occurrence of the next day and its impact and emotional connection. Matilda, in fact, is a very dear friend of mine and I was so pleased to see her, her son Paul and the little ones from their family take part in that very moving service that was done in the Members Hall on the Tuesday morning. I am very proud to see that particular role from our local community. In saying that, I must congratulate and thank those participants, dancers and performers who came, I understand, from other parts of the country to be part of that ceremony as well. I am sure that all members of the House who were present would say that it was a pretty impressive event. The call went out to say that this should now be a part of the beginning of every new parliament-I have no doubt that is in fact what will happen in one form or another. I really want to endorse that and I look forward to seeing it in the future. The other comment that I would like to make is to pay my respects in this delivery today to a couple of very prominent Indigenous community services within my electorate who have carried out wonderful work over the years and continue to do so in a fairly nationally leading way. Down here at Narrabundah we have the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service. That is a service that used to exist in Ainslie which has moved to larger premises in Narrabundah in more recent years. When I was involved in the Health is life report, which was tabled in May 2000-to which I will refer in a moment-it was a pleasure for me to introduce members of the committee at the time to the work that was being undertaken by Winnunga, their connection to their community and the breadth of services that they offer. It is a health service, but they actually offer an enormously broad selection of services to their community. I want to pay respect to Julie Tongs, the director down there, and all of the people involved in the work that they have done and continue to do. I also want to make very brief mention, if I can, of Gugan Gulwan, which is a youth Aboriginal corporation down in the southern end of this town. It is a youth service specifically providing culturally appropriate services for young Indigenous people in my electorate, and the services include a drop-in centre, family support and support services for young Aboriginal people. Importantly, they also offer outreach services for young Indigenous people affected by drugs and alcohol. They take a very positive role in the way that they reflect their culture, promote their culture and the retention of it and run a service or a variety of services that help to ensure a future for their young people. To those in the parliament particularly-and to a lesser but equally important degree to those out in the community-who for some reason, private to them, do not quite understand or accept the significance, the relevance and the importance of this apology, I need to say that I respect their view. I disagree with it, but I respect the fact that they can hold that view. I noticed-and this is not a critical comment; it is an observation-that there were a small number of members who made a point of not being in the chamber on the Wednesday and I am sorry that that happened. While I respect their views, I am really hopeful that, through the future MAIN COMMITTEE months and years, they will begin to see and understand the ramifications of the apology and come along with us on this journey that I believe we are now all taking. In particular, I want to speak today about the Bringing them home report and about the report Health is life: report on the inquiry into Indigenous health. Both of these reports provided me as a member of this parliament with an opportunity that I really needed to grow and learn about the experiences of Indigenous Australians. As a member of the Australian Labor Party-you do not have to be to have this view-I always thought I understood a lot about Indigenous issues in this country. If anybody had said to me, ‘Do you know much about this?’ I would say, ‘Yes, I’m pretty much on top of it,’ but going through both of those experiences really helped me to understand the depth of the issues, the extent to which we need to look at these issues more seriously and the absolute requirement that we work hand in hand with Indigenous communities to attend to the issues of relevance to them. The Bringing them home report, which came out of the national inquiry into the stolen generation conducted by HREOC, was tabled in parliament in May 1997. What followed the tabling of the report was an extraordinary period of time when Labor members of parliamentand I was one of them-took the opportunity to read parts of the report into the Hansard during our daily adjournment debates. We did that because it was very important for us to have a debate of some kind in the parliament. My recollection is that the debate was not facilitated by the government at the time. So this was our way of putting on the record the importance we saw of the Bringing them home report. As I said, in May 2000 I was part of the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which completed and tabled the report Health is life after an inquiry requested by the Minister for Health and Aged Care at the time to look into the status of Indigenous health in our country. That report and the work involved in it took almost two years. It began in one parliament, the committee produced an interim discussion paper and then, after the election and the committee being reconstituted, we successfully sought a re-reference to continue the work. So there was almost two years of a lot of hard slog and hard work to complete the report. During that inquiry, I was privileged enough to visit an enormous number of places and communities around this country, some of them the most remote places you could ever wish to go. We went to Mutitjulu, Broome, Kimberley, Tennant Creek, Badu Island, the Torres Strait, Docker River, the Maralinga homelands-to all sorts of places-and all sorts of amazing experiences were gained by the committee. This was all happening about 10 years ago. The people we met were very gentle and very welcoming. They took the opportunity to say, ‘You know, we really have been inquired into quite a lot.’ There are libraries in this country stocked full of reports of one sort or another on the status of Indigenous people. It should be said that this particular inquiry was, I think, the first of its kind in about 20 years to be done by the federal parliament. As members of the committee, we felt we needed to explain ourselves when we entered Indigenous country, when they took us in and sat down and had frank discussions with us about their lot. The point was made, ‘How many times do we have to have this experience for people to understand where we are, who we are, what we are and what is required?’ One gentleman who was more or less seconded to our committee for most of that time was a person called Puggy Hunter. I do not know whether Mr Ruddock, who is at the table, knew MAIN COMMITTEE Puggy through his work. He was an Indigenous gentleman from Broome who accompanied us to an enormous number of those outback, middle-of-nowhere places. He was a conduit for us in approaching Indigenous communities. He passed away a few short years ago, much to our great sadness. He taught us a great deal about understanding health issues, about understanding diversity within Indigenous communities in Australia, and about how we needed to talk with those people to clearly understand the difference they experienced among their own community before we tried to write some prescriptions for them. I use that term very carefully because sadly, up until now, that has been the approach of many of us in trying to deal with some of these issues. At the end of the day, I really think that the best words that I could possibly use would be the words of Pat Dodson, who in a National Press Club address only last week encouraged us to use this apology as an opportunity to move forward and to work together in true partnership with one another. He said the following: I agree with the Prime Minister that we have turned a page on the book of our national journey. We have on the table before us a clean page on which great things may be written. I do not think there would be, in all honesty-and this includes even those who absented themselves from the House last week-a member who could not endorse that comment to some point. We really do now have an opportunity, given the leadership that Prime Minister Rudd has shown and the determination that we have had as a party to fulfil a very long standing commitment of policy that we have held very dear, to draw a line. We did see and we do see the relevance and the importance of that apology. It really gives not just this parliament but the whole country an opportunity to draw the line, as Pat Dodson has indicated, to start with that clean sheet, to put all of that other baggage and business behind us and to collectively work towards a far better future for the people of our Indigenous communities in Australia. When we started the Health is life report in 1997 or 1998-roughly, from memory-we had all of these horrendous statistics about infant mortality, about the age difference in death rates, about the terrible state of health. I think it is fair for me to say that the most distressing thing for me in the 10 years from the beginning of that inquiry until now has been the repeating of those statistics. Front-page stories in the newspapers and speeches in this House have continually given the same statistics. It is about time to now dream of and work towards seeing those statistics change. We can no longer have them repeated; we must see them change. We must have a short-, a mediumand a long-term view on this and realistically work with our Indigenous communities to see the difference that they deserve more than anyone. to. To signify their support, I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their placesThat further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to.

313,Mr Raguse (Forde) (7.03 Pm),"I move:Hon. Kim Edward Beazley AO Debate resumed from 12 February, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House records its deep regret at the death on 12 October 2007 of the Honourable Kim Edward Beazley (Snr) AO, a former Federal Minister and Member for Fremantle, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. tion because I am probably the only member of the House of Representatives who served with Kim Beazley Sr. It was a great privilege to do so and I intend to outline something of the circumstances of that service. I might say, before the member for Canberra departs, that I am sure Kim Beazley Sr would have supported a welcome to country, and her request that that have an ongoing place in our new parliaments I am sure would have met with his approval. Firstly, I extend my condolences to his wife, Betty, his son, Kim Jr, his daughter, Marilyn, and each of their children. It is not generally known that I was in fact born in Canberra. I claim to have a museum site as a birthplace. My father was here in Canberra and knew Kim Beazley Sr. I noted, in reading his first speech, that it was a speech about postwar reconstruction. My late father was firstly a chief investigations officer in prices and then a deputy commissioner in prices and was very much involved in the administration of the policies that I noted Kim Beazley Sr adverted to in his maiden speech. It was a speech about the importance of economics. It was a speech about the postwar reconstruction period. I noted that he commended the budget for a number of reasons. In the first place, it recognised a number of fundamental problems in the immediate postwar period, namely that there was an excess of purchasing power and capacity to invest. My father later became a Liberal member of parliament in New South Wales and a minister but, notwithstanding the fact that he administered price control, he was very much against those sorts of intrusions of the state. But, in the context of what he was doing at that time, he had a clear role that brought him in touch with many, and one of those was Kim Beazley Sr. In my own period in the parliament, he was father of the House. I now have that honour. His service was for 32 years, from 1945 until 1977. Being elected in 1973, I saw him as a fine Minister for Education. I did not always agree with all of the policies he implemented, but he was someone who people recognised was a ‘conviction politician’. Of course, he was in opposition in 1975. By that time. I had become, as the member for Canberra noted, actively involved in Indigenous affairs and I was chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Our first brief was to examine the alcohol problems that Aboriginal people were experiencing and it brought me into conflict with Kim-and, I might say, with Ralph Hunt, who was the Minister for Health at the time. They conspired, I think, to broaden the terms of reference of the House of Representatives committee to look at health generally rather than just at what they saw as being a limited problem. He was a person who was fundamentally interested in the plight of our Indigenous people. He was, I think, very close to the late Professor Fred Hollows, who talked to him about these health issues, and, as befits somebody who was senior in service in the parliament, he continued to play a constructive role. MAIN COMMITTEE",261,Apology To Australia S Indigenous Peoples
314,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (7.03 Pm),"I want to be associated with this condolence moI noted when I was reading the material prepared helpfully by our Parliamentary Librarythey always prepare helpful material-that it noted his very fine education. He was born in 1917. He succeeded John Curtin as the Labor member for Fremantle. He was the youngest member of the House of Representatives when he was elected, he was known as ‘the student prince’ and he held the seat until he retired. But what follows is something that is far more interesting. He was, it says ‘a committed Christian and member of Moral Rearmament’, and it was in that context that I have a great deal of personal admiration for what he was able to do and achieve. He was not the only member of this parliament engaged with Moral Rearmament. Members perhaps do not know that Moral Rearmament has had a change of name, but they are still active in the environs of this parliament. If you ever have the opportunity to go to Caux in Switzerland and participate in one of their forums, it is a great and unique experience-even better than Hayman Island. The fact is that Kim Beazley and the late Dr Malcolm Mackay, a Liberal member of parliament, played a significant role and engaged me very much in Moral Rearmament. But, reading the material, it is far more interesting than that, because he came with conviction. It says: ... Beazley was prominent on the right-wing of the Labor Party during the ideological battles of the 1950s and 1960s. During the leadership of Arthur Calwell (from 1960 to 1967) he was considered a possible future leader of the party, but his right-wing views, particularly his support for the US. Alliance, cost him support ... And Whitlam emerged as leader. Kim Beazley Sr was a person who had the courage of his views and conviction-even more so after the defeat of the Whitlam government, when he was elected to the Labor frontbench but resigned when it was revealed that the then ALP National Secretary David Combe had been seeking money from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Baath Party to pay off what were then party debts. As one who has, on a matter of principle, set myself aside from my colleagues, I have to say that it is not easy to do. In Kim Beazley Sr we saw a man who was not prepared to serve on the Labor frontbench because of the strong principles that he held. He was quirkish, he was adversarial, but he was a person I greatly admired. He had an impact on me in the parliament and I very much wanted to be associated with this condolence motion. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (7.11 pm)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the condolence motion for Kim Edward Beazley AO. As the new member for Fremantle I have noted more than once that I follow in the footsteps of Labor giants-and in the history of this place there have been few men or women of greater stature than Kim Edward Beazley. I find it heartening to reflect that Kim Beazley entered parliament in the shadow of greatness when in 1945 he followed Australia’s great nation-building and wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin, to become the Labor member for Fremantle. I do not know whether he felt the burden of his predecessor’s reputation, but it certainly did not show. From his earliest appearances in Hansard, Kim Beazley made his arguments with a steady and stylish forcefulness. It is no surprise that he ultimately came to be regarded as one of the best parliamentary performers of his era. To give an example, I will quote from an article that appeared in the Australian newspaper in May 1967. It states: ‘He is undoubtedly Labor’s-and probably parliament’s-best orator. He has always had intellectual force and clarity and has harnessed both to a deeply personal MAIN COMMITTEE style. Members on both sides listen carefully when he speaks on any subject-on New Guinea, for example, on which he speaks rather less than he might, or on Aboriginals, about whom he speaks more frequently and for whom he fervently prays for a “Yes” vote in the coming referendum.’ The contribution Kim Beazley made to Australian life and politics cannot be measured in numbers, but the numbers are nonetheless indicative of the range and quality of his political career, which spanned generations. He entered parliament in 1945 as the youngest member of the House of Representatives, at 27 years of age. He contested and won 14 elections for the seat of Fremantle. When he retired, undefeated, prior to the 1977 election, he did so as the longest-serving member of the 30th Parliament. Kim Beazley represented the people of Fremantle for 32 years-an incredible stint-and I am advised that, of the 1,059 men and women who have represented federal electorates in this place, only 17 have served longer. Kim Beazley’s longevity as the member for Fremantle may have had something to do with his creative approach to campaigning. My father’s cousin, who grew up in Bicton, in the electorate of Fremantle, in the 1950s, told me of how kids in those days were always playing on the road-whether it was riding their bikes or playing marbles or hopscotch. At election time my father’s cousin, who was then around nine years old, noticed that, on Harris Road near the Bicton Primary School and on Preston Point Road on the bus route, there would be election slogans from Kim Beazley in large, neat block letters at least two metres long and two metres wide, printed on the road in chalk. My father’s cousin said he never forgot those beautifully done drawings on the road, which would mysteriously appear and remain for many weeks while the election campaign was ongoing. The slogans were all signed neatly in chalk with the words: ‘Vote Labor. Kim Beazley.’ Kim Beazley honed his skills with chalk well before entering politics. He worked as a schoolteacher and a university tutor, and he was Vice President of the Teachers Union. It is fitting that he carried the experience and insights he gained in those roles through to the policy work he ultimately undertook in the Commonwealth parliament. In his first speech in this place, Kim Beazley heralded the Commonwealth’s commitment, in 1945, of £5 million to support the states in the provision of education services. As a testament to his political stamina and commitment, he waited 27 years-having entered parliament at the age of 27-for the opportunity to make his most profound policy contribution, as the Minister for Education in the Whitlam government. In that role, from 19 December 1972 until that infamous day of 11 November 1975, he was responsible for implementing the first, and still the most important, education revolution of the modern era. The Schools Commission legislation that he introduced had the effect of chiselling into stone the practice of distributing Commonwealth funding to schools, public or private, on the basis of need. And, of course, he threw open the doors of Australian universities to thousands and thousands of people-including many current parliamentarians-who otherwise might not have had that opportunity. In 1983 he came out of retirement to head an inquiry into the Western Australian state education system. His work and leadership during the course of the year-long review were central to the success of the measures that followed from it, and in Western Australia it is only fitting that the student with the best results in the tertiary entrance examinations each year is awarded the Beazley Medal. MAIN COMMITTEE Within the Australian Labor Party, Kim Beazley served on both state and federal executives, and he was the Senior Vice-President of the ALP from 1969-71. At the ALP conference in 1951, he wrote the preamble to the party’s platform and constitution. During his career, as many other speakers have noted, Kim Beazley also promoted the cause of justice for Indigenous Australians. He was a parliamentary representative on the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies from 1964 to 1972. He was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Voting Rights of Aborigines in 1961. He served on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines and Arnhem Land Reserve committee in 1963. He was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Rights in the Northern Territory in 1977. On taking office as Minister for Education, one of his first initiatives was to arrange for Aboriginal children to be taught in schools in their own language, with English as a second language. I am sure that he would have been very proud that a Labor government instituted the first welcome to country ever performed at the opening of the Commonwealth parliament last Tuesday and of the apology last Wednesday. I am also sure he would have supported the inclusion within the new national curriculum of the stories of the stolen generations, and Indigenous dispossession more broadly, as well as information highlighting the cultural diversity and richness of Australia’s Indigenous heritage. It is only right to mention here another of the most significant contributions by Kim Beazley to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people-the gift of his son, Kim Christian Beazley, who has carried his name, his reputation and his legacy forward with the same intellectual force and clarity, depth of policy contribution, skilful oration and personal dignity. Kim Christian Beazley, who retired at the last election, helped to lay the foundation of this new Labor government. On two occasions he led Labor through difficult circumstances, and history will record that he won the popular vote in 1998, after only one term of the Howard government. He launched my election campaign in Fremantle last October, and we remembered his father that day. Together, Kim Beazley Sr and Kim Beazley Jr gave more than half a century of service to representative politics in Australia. A very heartfelt expression of gratitude must go to the Beazley family, especially Betty and Marilyn, for the significant sacrifice that must inevitably have accompanied their love and support of these two great men during their long and meritorious careers. As someone who did not know Kim Beazley Sr personally, I would like to record the views of those who did and of those who engaged with him as a colleague and a comrade. The former Premier of Western Australia Geoff Gallop remembered Kim Beazley for his advocacy on behalf of Indigenous Australians. He said: The focus tended to be on his contribution to education, but I think in many ways he was the Labor politician from WA who put Aboriginal rights on the agenda. Former Western Australian state Labor education minister Bob Pearce wrote: Beazley was always on the side of the less fortunate and the underprivileged. He believed in public service, and the need for national leaders to act in a moral way. The influence of his brief three years in office lasts today in our schools and in tertiary institutions, but most of all in the acceptance by the community of his belief that inequality in education, as in all things, is not to be tolerated. MAIN COMMITTEE Current WA Labor Premier, Alan Carpenter, said that Kim Beazley Sr ‘was for many years the only bright light from WA in the federal arena’. Federal Labor MP Bob McMullan said: The lesson we took from him was that you could have a long career in politics and still maintain your respect and achieve outcomes. Former Prime Minister John Howard said of Kim Beazley Sr: … he was a man of very high principle who gave a lifetime of service to his country, the parliamentary system and the Australian Labor Party. His demeanour and behaviour both in the Parliament and in the general discharge of his responsibilities as a minister set a very high standard. Such a tribute from the other side of politics is a testament to the principled approach by Kim Beazley to political life. In his valedictory speech he said the following: Bernard Shaw once said that an election was a moral horror like a war, only without the bloodshed. I do not think it is necessary for an election to be fought that way. I think that we sometimes become quite childish in this parliament and think that everything marvellous originated on our side and everything disastrous originated on the other side. I do not think that is true. He reflected on all the parliamentarians that he had known in his 32 years, and he concluded: I think that the Australian community has got a very high quality of representation. If it has, of course, that is what it deserves. I think it can be said without qualification that the people of Fremantle and, indeed, Western Australia must have been doing something right to deserve a man like Kim Beazley. He was always a man of principle, and the bedrock of his values was his Christian faith. He was not prepared to bend his principles for the sake of political game-playing. Some have observed that this may have been to his personal loss, but I think it was to his eternal credit. He said it best himself when he observed: If you do not accept the importance of conscience, you accept only the importance of power. Kim Beazley served the people of Fremantle and the people of Australia with distinction. He was the embodiment and beacon of political conscience throughout his parliamentary career, his high standards of personal and professional conduct underlying a strong belief that the integrity of government is fundamental to democracy. Reading back over the articles and obituaries from October last year, I think some commentators were too quick to put Kim Beazley in that well-worn category of ‘the man who could have been king’. It is true that he could have led the Australian Labor Party, but it is not true that his political life was in any way unfulfilled. There are kings and then there are kings. Royalty is not a concept that we in the Australian Labor Party are necessarily all that fond of. But, as a way of acknowledging a person’s stature, I think I might be forgiven for repeating the fact that when Kim Beazley entered parliament he was known as the ‘student prince’and when he left it, and when he left us, he was a king. members to signify their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

317,Mr Raguse (Forde) (7.24 Pm),"I move:Question agreed to. Mr Peter James Andren Debate resumed from 12 February, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 3 November 2007, of Peter James Andren, former Independent Member for Calare, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. parliamentary career of Peter Andren and in so doing support the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. Peter Andren was a paradigm of an Independent member of parliament. He was the member for Calare from 1996 to 2007. In the 11 years we shared together in the parliament I had many opportunities to admire his independence of thought, his decisiveness and action. He had a strength of conviction that his parliamentary colleagues sometimes disputed, but ultimately they could not but admire who he was and the fact he was willing to stand up for what he felt was right. He opted to take the more difficult role of leading his constituency forward rather than just following behind. He displayed his courage on numerous occasions throughout his parliamentary career, perhaps no more notably than in the context of what happened in the parliament last week. He supported and advocated a formal parliamentary apology to Indigenous Australians. Back in 1999 when Peter first voiced his opinion on the apology, his position would not have had the majority support in his electorate of Calare. In 2000 Peter again acted bravely and introduced a private member’s bill to override the Northern Territory’s system of mandatory sentencing. The consequences of this, which were so positive for the Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, are recounted in his autobiography. Throughout his time in parliament Peter’s commitment to Indigenous rights was unwavering. He would no doubt have been extremely proud of what happened in the parliament last week. It is sad that he was not there himself to witness the occasion and to lend some of his own words to the discussion. I admired Peter greatly for the stance he took on issues such as Indigenous rights, gun laws, the environment and refugees. On many of these issues history will show that he was a man ahead of his time. Indeed, history has already shown that. Peter also gave a passionate voice to the issues of importance to the residents of Calare. He championed local industry, campaigned for better transport, banking and telecommunications services. He argued for greater government assistance for farming families. Peter Andren’s ability to truly represent his constituents was nowhere more fully demonstrated than in the polls-something that some of us on the other side of the House may have found a bit disconcerting at times. Since it was first proclaimed in 1906, the New South Wales Central Tablelands seat of Calare had swung from being held by Labor, to the Nationals, to the Liberal Party and back to the Labor Party. When Peter won the seat in 1996, following the retirement of the sitting Labor member, he did so with only 29 per cent of the primary vote. We can all sit here and admire. But during his time in office Peter turned Calare into one of the safest seats in Australia. In the 2004 election, Peter won his seat with over 50 per cent of the primary vote and over 70 per cent of the two-candidate preferred vote. You cannot tell it was once a National Party seat. In no small MAIN COMMITTEE",266,Condolences
318,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (7.24 Pm),"I rise tonight to pay tribute to the life and the way, this was a reflection on Peter himself and on his ability to connect with the people of Calare through his enthusiasm, his hard work and his love for the country and the people. In March 2007, Peter Andren announced that he would resign his position in the House of Representatives at the next election and, instead, run for a seat in the Senate. He would no doubt have made an outstanding contribution to the Senate, just as he did in this chamber. I extend my condolences to Peter’s family, especially his partner, Valerie, and his sons, Greg and Josh. His passing is a great loss to this parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr Raguse) adjourned.
