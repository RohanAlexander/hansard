I suggest for the consideration of the honourable member one of those difficulties, viz., whether it would not be well to consider the question in relation to all public servants. one is in favour of the general principle, and shall not lose sight of the matter. a question in reference to the now celebrated Colonel Cox case. The Minister promised that he would do his utmost to obtain for that officer the pay and privileges attaching to his rank from the time he was promoted to it, in other words, to remunerate him, like other officers, for fhe work he has been doing. that should be done, and I think that they have been complied with. be? question will be paid for his work at the rate belonging to his rank. I think the whole matter is now complete. MT. HUTCHISON I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has observed in to-dav's Argus atelegram from Sydney headedTHE MR. The paragraph statesThe Premier, Mr Wade, stated to-day that some time ago he made inquiries concern.ng the objects and methods of the Central Immigration Board in London, and the information he collected does not induce him to favourably regard Mr Deakin's action in giving ,£ioo of the funds of the Commonwealth, and incidentally . of the States, towards assisting the instilut on. As a matter of fact, Mr Wade thinks it probable that when the Prime Minister understands just what he has done he will be incline. 1 ask the Board to disgorge the £100 donation. Can the Prime Minister give the House any information in regard to this, matter ? marks of the Premier of New South Wales in the Argus to-day, and brought them with me expecting that they would form the subject of some comment. Let me say, in the first place, that it is an undesirable precedent that expenditure of Common-. wealth money for Commonwealth purposesshould be criticised'by State Premiers, particularly when the sums are trifling, because such action calls for a reciprocal course of criticism on the part of Commonwealth Ministers and members, which would not conduce to the proper transaction of the I think that every business of the two Legislatures concerned.. Minister referring to? from Sydney yesterday,. and published in fhe Argus of to-day, headed "" London Immigration Board,"" it should be "" Central Immigration Board"" "" The Commonwealth Donation."" Then the paragraph gives the Premier's criticism at length. . Mr Wade thinks ill of the Cen' tral Immigration Board. I do not challenge his right to his own opinion. But from the statement made, one would suppose that this Board sent, or sought to send, no immigrants from the Mother Country except city dwellers, and that we had given a donation for the purpose of assisting the Board to send city dwellers. That inference, which might be derived' from the perusal of this statement by Mr Wade, is quite unwarranted. The Central Immigration Board is largely composed of those who have been associated with the different Dominions of the Empire. Amongst its active members, when I was in. London, was Lord Jersey, an ex-Governor of New South Wales, Lord Ranfurly, an ex-Governor. of New Zealand, Lord Brassey, an ex-Governor of Victoria, and WADE'S CRITICISMS office in the Dominions. Sir Clement Kinloch Cooke, its chairman, has long been associated with Imperial questions, besides, 'the Board is. in close association with the different Agents-General of the Australian States and with the representatives of Canada. At the meeting held in London the other day, I noticed that there were present, and taking part in the proceedings,, the Agents-General of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, the High Commissionelr of Canada, Lord Strathcona, representatives of the South African Colonization Society, and other bodies. So' that the Central Immigration Board, what-, ever it is and does, includes a large number' of influential men associated with the oversea Dominions. At that meeting, the first resolution carried stated that it was theobject of the Board to provide "" desirable, suitable immigrants"" for the colonies.. The operations of the Board are not large,",14,Defence Ninth Victorian Light Horse Pensions Colone L Cox

Let me refer to other charges equally baseless and of exactly the same kind. I . find in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 7th of last month, a report of a speech made by the Premier of New South Wales. ' Mr Speaker? what the Prime Minister is going to say. Premier of New South Wales saidThe Federal authorities had purchased many thousand copies of a certain publication, and had requested the State to take over several thousands in order to have them distributed through its agents abroad the Prime Minister is dealing with another matter now. tising of the Commonwealth, and comments by the same Premier upon it. the question which has been asked, the honourable gentleman may proceed. does arise out of the particular statement to which my attention has already been called. It is a' similar statement on the same subject made by the same public man.

Two commercial agents had waited upon me in the course of their visits to Australia, and had explained the need of some handy compendium of Australian information in China, Japan, and the Straits Settlements, and in the various centres where they were operating. Our own Statistical Handbook was not readyindeed it is not yet ready-and I , therefore, selected the cheapest compendium of the kind known to me. It was published I s this in order, in New South Wales, and I obtained two thousand copies at a cost of ; £ i o o .

' As a matter of fact, the same publication had been previoutsly offered to the State Government I cannot say that it separately, and ha'd been rejected I am informed by the publisher that the same publication was never offered to the State Government. A different publication altogether, and a very much more expensive one was offered to that Government, and declined. The Premier of New South Wales proceeded to sayI t is not what I conbecause it contained nothing new anfl could only take the place of quite as complete and up-to-date information issued forth by the Government Printer. The information contained in the handbook could contain nothing new, since it I wish to ask the Prime comprised statistics of all the States, and of the Commonwealth, added together in a convenient form. Though probabiv it was not as complete and up-to-date as some information since issued by the' several States, in regard to statistics affecting those States, it was certainly the most up to-date publication dealing with all the I do not propose to States and with Australia as a whole.

The publication which was offered by the New South Wales Government instead of this, was no doubt an excellent publication, but it related only to New South Wales.

It was a purely Australian production, published in the interests of Australia. I have said that before we received any reply this is the comment offered upon Australian action in the interests of Australia as a whole. I merely wish to add that' I hope I shall not be asked any further questions with regard to comments of this kind by any other State Premiers, though, as a matter of fact, I do not know of any other Premier who has indulged in this kind of comment.

77,Mr Thomas Brown,"That is notreply to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I should like to draw his attention to an incident that occurred in connection with the General Post Office, Sydney, towards the close of last year. The"" number of postal parcels -and the quantity of postal matter passing through that office, as the result of the Christmas season, increased to such an extent that the staff was unable to cope with the rush. Temporary hands had to be taken on to meet the demand upon the Department, and those hands many of whom had wives and families to support-were compelled to do without their wages during the Christmas season, because the Deputy Postmaster-General had not at his disposal the money necessary to pay them. ' partment retired men just before the holidays so as to avoid paying them for a broken week. retired because the Department had not the money to pay them. the Department was more niggardly than any private firm, and was not prepared to pay them for a broken week. think that that is a fair charge to make against the Department. As a matter of fact, it has been starved by the Treasurer. Although the Estimates-in-Chief showed that the expenditure of the Department had been reduced by £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , we find that additional hands have had to be employed, and that we have now to vote a sum ot. £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to cover the cost of temporary assistance during the current financial year. I wish now to refer to the item of £ 1 , 0 0 0 for Sunday overtime. I am glad to learn from the Postmaster-General that the vicious system introduced in the Sydney General Post Office is being remedied. The authorities withdraw men from their regular staff duties-allowin g them time off at inconvenient periods-to place them upon Sunday work. the day staff whose members were required to make up, by means of overtime, the loss of time involved by the withdrawal of men from their regular duties to perform Sunday work. had to break in upon their regular staff duties iq order to perform Sunday work. In these Estimates it is proposed to appropriate £ 1 , 0 0 0 to cover the cost of Sunday overtime upon the basis laid down by the Postmaster-General. I trust that that sum does not represent merely temporary provision in that connection. I hope that permanent provision will be made to defray the cost of Sunday work, so that the dissatisfaction which has resulted from the system that has hitherto been followed, will be removed. [11.26] -Upon page 43 of these Estimates I notice an item "" repair and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines and instruments, including all services in connection therewith, chargeable to contingencies, except those provided for under item 2, £ 3 , 8 7 3 . "" I fear that the .Postmaster-General has not made adequate provision lines. In my own district the deplorable state of disrepair into which the telegraph and telephone lines have been allowed to f a l l , is responsible for the very frequent interruptions which take place in the service. Lines which have been erected for No ; the reason is that thirty years have had no maintenance gang employed upon them during the past ten years, so that when the wires become disconnected it is not safe for the linemen to climb the poles and reattach them. Consequently, interruptions are frequent, and these necessitate delay in the transaction of public business, as well as the employment of men for unduly long hours. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that a sufficient sum is made available for the maintenance of these lines, in order that the evils of which I complain may be obviated. In regard to allowances to officers stationed in outlying districts, it seems to me that' a better understanding is necessary. Asf a r as I know, the only officers who receive these allowances are those stationed in remote parts of the Commonwealth. But whilst these persons labour under a very serious disability I contend that very frequently officers located in isolated coastal districts are obliged to labour under similar disadvantages. Where an officer is compelled to obtain his supplies by coach his cost of living may be just as high as .that of an officer stationed at Bourke. It seems to me that these allowances ought not to be determined merely upon geographical lines. Local conditions, I contend, ought to be taken into consideration. In connection with non-official, post-offices I maintain that a very bad system has been allowed to grow up. It is practically nothing more nor less than",20,Department The Post Office And The Station Is Now

That reduces their allowance to less than £100 per annum. minimum wage is fixed. is in error. I have in my mind's eye a contract office in an important centre where there is a Morse instrument installed. Further, it is a repeating station. The postmaster receives £ 1 20 per annum, and the use of the postal premises, but out of this sum he is paying more than ios. a week to a messenger. begging us through half-a-dozen honourable members not to substitute official offices for contract offices, because they will be then deprived of what they are getting. is . that unless post-offices can show a revenue of £400 a year the Morse instruments are taken away from them, and they are run upon the contract system. The use of Morse instruments ought to be extended, because that is.the only system acceptable to the people as insuring secrecy. The allowances at offices where there is no telegraph, though, perhaps, a telephone, are very small. The Department, apparently, desire to run these offices on a purely mercantile basis, and, unless a considerable profit is shown on the working, the people in charge are sweated. It must not be forgotten, however, that in addition to the distribution of mails and telegrams the Det partment has the responsibility of assisting in the development of the country. the management of the Department by a Commission on commercial lines. does not apply to me, because I am opposed to placing the Department under a Commission, and, if the Government cannot administer the Department in a proper way, there is another remedy, apart from putting it under a Commission. One of the inducements to settlement is the establishment of telephone communication, and of mail services at reasonably frequent intervals. I find it most difficult to persuade the Department to provide telephone lines unless it can be shown that there will be a profit during the ensuing seven years; and the result is that our pioneers, in addition to other disabili; ties, are called upon to find guarantees, because the Department refuse to take any responsibility. I admit that, in parts of my electorate, where rapid development ha; taken place, some facilities have been afforded, but, in one of the most prosperous of districts, including Dorrigo and Bellingen, telephone communication is firmh refused on the ground that there are nc funds available. That is not the treatment which the people expect from the Common -wealth Government, which ought to' take' its share of the responsibility in the development of the country. The people in the district I have mentioned are thoroughlv disgusted, and extremely anxious to know whether they are ever to have a telephone, or mails more than once or twice a week, if the money allotted is not sufficient to carry out the works, the Postmaster-General should ask for more, and I have sufficient confidence in the Treasurer, and in honourable members, to know that it would be granted. -On e cannot help noticing the great difference there is between the expenditure proposed in South Australia and the expenditure proposed in other States; and it is a difference which may be observed through Estimates after Estimates. ask for more expenditure-that is the reason. pleading for expenditure in that State, ana I have been refused ! sponsible executive officers in South Australia. in South Australia can be conducted so much more cheaply than in any of the other States, it would be a good thing to transfer some of the executive officers from South Australia into the central office.

I hope that he will look into this suggestion and not dismiss it with the remark that the system is the cheapest in the world. If it is, we ought to be proud of it, and should endeavour to make it still cheaper and more effective. L if e in Australia is different altogether from, what it is in many other parts of the world.

161,Mr Palmer,"I come now to anotherthe case of Victoria, South Australia, Western' Australia, and Tasmania. this connection I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a large number of complaints which are being made concerning thedecrease of postal facilities in many country centres. Scarcely a week passes in which I do not receive some communication in reference to this matter. Only this morning I received a letter from the shire of Deakin complaining that the mail service to a certain place which for years had been a tri-weekly one, has been reduced to a bi-weekly one. In another locality which formerly enjoyed a mail service twice a week a reduction has been made to once a week. Seeing that it is proposed to appropriate £ 4 > °0 0 to provide increased mail facilities in New South Wales, I am warranted in concluding that an injustice is being done to Victoria. But I have made inquiries into the conditions prevailing elsewhere, and I have found that even in New South Wales the policy of the Department is to reduce mail facilities in country districts. That, I contend, is an unsound policy. If we wish to develop the resources of this country we ought to increase rather, than decrease those facilities. The settlement of the country depends largely upon the people being able to receive and despatch their mails expeditiously. Indeed, the granting of mail facilities ought almost to precede settlement. I am quite satisfied that the Postmaster-General, in common with every other.honourable member, desires to see Australia prosperous, but I venture to say that he is beings over-ruled by his departmental officers. If he were to have his own way he would not lend himself to a curtailment of mail facilities.

It may be presumption on my part, but I doubt the ability of the officials who advise the Public Service Commissioner, to say whether this is skilled or unskilled work; and, further, I am afraid I admit at once that that they are likely to be biased in favour of paying the lowest wages possible.

I may explain that a new tenderer cannot obtain a contract unless his price is, at any rate, 5 per cent, lower than that of the previous contractor, in the event of the latter tendering again; and the man I have in my mind made his figure lower than the amount which had been paid to Smith.

203,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [12.56],"I amthe practice of employing temporary hands. Of course it cannot be absolutely stopped, but its proportions ought to be very much less than they are. I have been told again and again by the Department that the number of temporary hands has reached its present huge proportions .because of some special strain put upon the Department, especially in New South Wales, by an undue rush-of work which is not likely to last. I was told that principally with regard to the telephone system, and I made it my business, to find out what the rush of work was like; and whether it was only temporary. I find that in 1906 the increase in the-number of telephones granted in New South Wales was 1,200, and in rooT, 3,6o°i whilst this year, if the increase credit of a trust account, and that a subgoes on at the rate shown in the first two or three months, it will be between 5,000 and 6,000. that if we could supply the instruments as quickly as .they are asked for. show such a consistent increase over a term of years it cannot be said that the rush is merely temporary, and that temporary assistance will meet the difficulty. There is no doubt, and I am glad the Minister re-cognises the fact, that too much 'has been done on the temporary assistance plan, and that many of the places which are being filled with temporary hands ought to be occupied by permanent officials. The increase in the Supplementary Estimates for temporary assistance for New South Wales alone is £20,500. That seems an enormous sum, but even then we do not seem to get the .work done with anything like expedition. I have in my mind the case of a man who wanted a telephone for a building that he was having erected. whether he should make his application at once or wait until the building was finished. It was found that the contractor might want to have the use of the telephone, and the application was made straight away. The house is now .finished, and although the application has been inforsix months, the telephone is hot yet installed. Sitting.suspended.from 1 to 2.15 p.m. ter that calls for the attention of the Postmaster-General. In country places where a telephone line to a private house is. desired, the subscriberis often called upon to pay in advance a subscription of two or three years in order to cover the cost of construction. I know of a case in which that course has been pursued in my own electorate. The'estimated cost of the line was £ 6 or £ 8 , and the intending subscriber paid the subscription for two years in advance. After waiting for three or four months to be connected, he inquired the reason for the delay, and then ascertained that the money paid by him had gone into the general revenue, and that nothingcould be done until these Additional Estimates had been passed, because the cost of constructing the line was covered by them. My contention is that money so received by the Department should be placed to the scriber should be speedily provided with the facilities for which he has paid. does not. cover anything like the cost of constructing such a line. amount paid.in the case to which I have referred would cover the cost of construction. Whilst dealing with the subject of telephones, I should like to ask the Postmaster-General what is being done in reference to the construction of a telephone line to Katoomba? The honourable member's predecessor in office called, I think, for a guarantee,' and was offered one of 10 per cent. Upon receiving a report from his officers,however, he said that he did not requireNthe guarantee, because he was satisfied that it would pay, and he promised that it would be erected in time for use during last season. I understood that provision was made on the Estimates-in-Chief, for the construction of the line, but nothing has yet been done. The new season is approaching, and even if the work is The auestion arose as to started at' once, I am afraid that it will not be completed in time for it. Incidents of this kind bring the Department into disrepute. They occur again and again, and when honourable members are unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation from the Department, they naturally feel that reorganization must be necessary. The position of postal officials who have to attend to Savings Bank work also calls for attention. So far as I have .been able to ascertain, officers of the Department called upon to discharge additional duties in connection with Savings Bank branches at post offices, receive no. additional payment, although the States make an allowance to the Commonwealth in respect of such' ser-",30,Department The Post Office And The Station Is Now

Minister) [2.30] -The explanation asked for by honourable members opposite is that a goodly proportion of the money referred to has already been spent out of sums received from the Treasurer's advance account. It has been used for carrying out such works as the undergrounding of wires, erecting fresh telephone lines, and other related works. If honourable members look at page 61 of the Additional Estimates they will find a sum of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 for New South Walesf or the construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduits for placing wires underground. this money has been spent, or will be spent, before the 30th June, .on necessary works, Or in purchasing material to carry on such works. I take that as a typical item, but if honourable members want information with regard to any other item I shall be able to give a satisfactory answer. With the exception of the special items mentioned at the end of the Estimates, £ 2 6 0 , 0 0 0 for harbour defence and cordite factory, nearly the whole of the money has been expended. -vernment have been anticipating an appropriation ? had to anticipate appropriations. For instance, a sum of money was voted for the construction of a launch in Queensland. -The tenders exceeded the amount provided in the Estimates-in-Chief. We could not very well delay the construction of the launch for the sake of £ 4 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 . Accordingly the Treasurer paid the extra amount out of h'is advance. In addition to COOK (Parramatta) that, work in connection with the Post Office, especially in New South Wales, has involved a heavy expenditure, and the Department is obliged to ask the Treasurer for an advance to prevent necessary works being absolutely stopped and men thrown out of employment.

The £29,000 is part of the total of £63,000 on these Additional Estimates. this money twice over? can the vote on the original Estimates form a part of the vote appearing on these Estimates,? 'which I referred is a part of the total mentioned by' the honourable member for Wentworth. £63,000 is on the Additional Estimates for telegraphs, telephones, and so on, and I point out that on the original' ""Estimates there was a vote of £29,000 for the Postmaster-General's Department. Ministers have to do is to bring down moderate votes in the Estimates-in-Chief which may appear to honourable members to be absolutely reasonable when those Estimates are being discussed, and immediately afterwards to bring down Additional Estimates, and no matter what the votes appearing on those Estimates may be, we are unable to discuss them, and have lost all effective control of the finances. Such consequences following upon the observance of a parliamentary rule must be regarded as most serious, as affecting the proper control of the finances. Estimates-in-Chief the honourable member will see an amount of £50,000 set down for the construction of lines in New South Wales. ing with that just now. member has made a statement which is not correct. matter what the particular figures may be, I am pointing out that the course adopted by the Ministry in submitting these Estimates removes from this House the possibility of effective control of thefinancesof the Commonwealth. Ministers need only adopt the simple expedient of bringing down Estimates-in-Chief, including moderate votes, and then bringing down vastly increased votes for the same purposes in Additional Estimates, and under our parliamentary procedure we may not further discuss the questions involved, having once dealt with them on the general Estimates. cussion on these Additional Estimates. did. I point out to the honourable member that if a vote of £50,000 is submitted in the Estimates-in-Chief for a particular purpose he may consider it reasonable and fair, and may have no adverse criticism to offer. Buti f immediately afterwards the responsible Minister brings down Additional Estimates covering another vote of £50,000 for the same purpose, does .the honourable member not see that a vote of £100,000 for that purpose may turn what was a reasonable proposal into, one of a monstrous character? That is the point I am making. We have here Additional Estimates for £571,000, the bulk of which money is to be expended by two DepartA ll that ments, and we are not permitted to discuss the effectiveness of the financial control because of the law of Parliament as laid down by the Chairman. membei to resume his seat. I have several times remiiided the honourable member that he had an opportunity' of discussing these matters in a general way when these Additional Estimates were introduced. At that stage a general discussion which occupied two nights took place upon them.

257,The Chairman,"The general disl -regards the Estimates proper, and it was agreed all through that these Additional Estimates should be treated separately.. I raise no objectionwith respect to the amounts for which we have already voted. The serious expenditure covered by these Additional Estimates is comprised in the abstract covering votes for new works and buildings, and' I repeat that the Ministry, by the simple manipulation to which I have referred, are placed in a position to control the finances without effective criticism by this House. I shall not pursue the matter further, but I have thought it my duty to point out the position into which we are getting as a result of the manipulation of the. Estimates by the Government. that it was impossible to foresee, in the compilation of the main Estimates, the expenditure which would become necessary as a result of the abnormal expansion of trade ? again to a shocking want of foresight on the part of Ministers responsible for the administration of these Departments? We voted £819.000 in the original Estimates for new works, and we have before us today Additional Estimates covering a further expenditure of £571,000. That is to say, that in one year we are doubling our expenditure for works and buildings in connection with the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. There could be no stronger condemnation of the want of foresight on the part of Ministers associated with these Departments than the facts I am now citing. Honourable members must realize that this year we are going to spend over £1,000,000 on works and buildings in connection with our Commonwealth services. The expenditure is going up like wild-fire. It is a very easy matter to inflate Estimates in this . way and to spend money ;but in a year or two, if the forecast of the Treasurer be correct, we shall have the reckoning, and .while it is one thing to send expenditure up, it is quite another thing to bring it down again to reasonable proportions. We .have plenty of money at our hands, because of the irresponsibility, of our position with regard to the finances,and the fact that we raise. four times as much as we require. We throw it about in this way without any effective control by Parliament, because Of the manipulation -to which I have referred ; but a day will surely come when we Buildings, &r: must begin to adopt a more reasonable course I have no doubt that the Committee will vote the money asked for in these Estimates, since honourable members appear to take very little notice of what is taking place. Ministers have only to put Estimates on the table and the amounts asked for will be voted with less than a .quorum of members present. I am aware that all I can do is once more to record my protest against this scandalous bungling of the Federal finances. The Minister and'those associated with him should have better foreseen what would be necessary. orable member what we foresaw presently. that the Postmaster-General will show us a great deal. He showed us something last night that quite surprised us, and if he is going to show us something similar in reference to the financial side of his Department, I do not want to see it. last night. master-General ought to be very grateful . to the leader of the Labour Party for helping him out of the awkward situation in which he found himself. It seems to -me: that the ultimate test of party government is ability to get out of an awkward situation. But I do not wish to labour this matter. The Committee have evidently' determined that the Government shall have all the money that they want. The Postmaster-General has declared that the bulk of the money provided on these Estimates has already been expended. foot the Bill and look as pleasant as possible in the process. That is a privilege enjoyed by the Opposition equally with the Government But I do protest against the manner in which these Estimates have been submitted to the Committee, against the want of control which is manifest in the' various Departments, and against their absolute unwillingness to forecast their piobable requirements for the year. Notwithstanding all the money that we are voting so readily, everybody knows that these Departments were, never in a worse state of chaos so far as the carrying out of new works and buildings are concerned. There is no money available with which to do anything, notwithstanding that' we are' shovelling it out by the million.

334,Mr Dugald Thomson,"We canappropriation before we know anything as to the method of expenditure proposed. Prime Minister can only urge the passing of this proposed vote on the plea of necessity, and he has shown that there is no necessity for it . He has said that even if we make this appropriation now, it will be necessary this session to pass a B i ll showing for what purpose the appropriation has been made, in order to prevent it from lapsing. In making that admission, he has given away the sole ground on which his plea could be based. We are asked to take the extraordinary course of voting a large sum of money for coastal and harbour defences of which we may approve, but without knowing what the Government proposition is. not we approve of the general policy in -, volved. posal. ment proposal before us long enough to know what it is. sure that the honourable member for South Sydney, like other honourable members, will be influenced in his decision by the details as to the particular form in which it was proposed to expend this money. ing a start towards coastal defence by any means. well ; but we shall not make a start by agreeing to this appropriation. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The Prime Minister himself has said that this vote-will lapse at the end of the financial year unless we pass a B ill , specially appropriating it. If a Bill must be introduced in order to secure this appropriation, there is no reason why we should now make the appropriation for which the Government have asked. Sir WILLIAM LYNE deal also with other matters. should the Prime Minister not wait until the Surplus Revenue Bill is ""introduced, and then state what direction the expenditure is to take? [REPRESENTATIVES.] Buildings, &c. than I have stated : that it is for naval defence purposes. . no right to vote these amounts blindfolded -befor e we have any detailed policy submitted to us. ' The Government proposal is an extraordinary one. The policy should be approved by Parliament before we are asked to provide the money necessary to give effect to that policy. J am not disposed to go quite so far as did the honourable member for North Sydney, in saying that the Prime Minister supplied us with the strongest of reasons for not voting this amount. The strongest reasons lie in the conditions which surround this proposal. The Prime Minister has given us an assurance which I think should satisfy all of us, if that were say whether or the only objection, that this money will not be spent until the whole question . of naval policy has been again submitted to Parliament. But he has also told us that the Government do not intend to expend it during the present financial year, and that the relationship of the Australian flotilla to the Imperial naval authorities is at present so undecided that hel cannot fcven formulate a scheme of naval construction. I would ask the Committee to look at this from a. very broad stand-point. The Constitution provides that the States are entitled to three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue; and I am in favour of makit may be that during the present financial year the Commonwealth will approach so closely to an expenditure of its proportion Very of the total revenue, .that the adoption of this proposal will carry us over that limit. We certainly shall. to get anvwhere near it this vear. this amount now as a capital sum, we shall really allocate money which is not going to be spent during the current financial year. We are, therefore, practically asked to take a step that will enable the Commonwealth to set aside £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 . which is really not to be expended, and in that way to reduce the amount that would be constitutionally returnable to the States the absence of any provision to the contrary by the FederalI think that the honourable member wilt admit that the Constitution anticipates that we should not make provision on our",40,Thomson The N I T Wil L Three Fourths Nearly £ 1 0 0 0 0 0 More Than
