Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) agreed toThat the proceedings in Committee on the Bounties Bill, which lapsed on Friday last, be resumed, and that the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Wholef o r the further consideration of the Bill. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 24th August, vide page 3383): Clause 2There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, the sum of F if t y thousand pounds per annum during the period of ten years commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and six, for the payment of bounties on the production of the goods'specified in the Schedule.

[2.40] I understood from the Minister who was in charge of the Bill last Friday that the amendment was to be withdrawn, and that it was intended to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney, and provide that a maximum sum of ^75,000 might be spent in any one year. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have a further amendment to propose. now before the Committee is only a part member that yarn?

I am astonished at the importance which Ministers appear to attach to this measure. The Prime Minister was recently airing his eloquence in the country, and endeavouring to persuade the electors that the B ill would have the effect of making all of them rich -that it would confer wonderful advantages upon the primary producers. He represented that it was intended for the benefit of settlers in the country, and that the residents of the towns would not derive any advantage from it . He stated that the Bill would save our primary industries from ruin, but I wish to know how the country is to be prevented from plunging headlong to destruction by the production of pea-nuts. The Prime Minister, when he visits country centres, is accustomed to make the most remarkable statements. His hearers frequently become entranced by his eloquence, .and are thus likely to pay some attention to his utterances. The Treasurer indulges in poetry, and the Prime Minister in music. When the latter talks to the farmers they evidently take in all that he says. I may tell them, however, that the Prime Minister is simply taking them in . Sir WILLIAM LYNE He is merely f o l lowing the example of the honourable member. tomed to say exactly what I mean. There is. no poetry about my utterances. I wish would explain how much of the £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ment of the growth of rubber trees? That is one of the industries which is to save the primary producer from ruin. From the printed document which has been placed in the hands of honourable members, I learn that the rubber tree would take from nine to fifteen years to reach maturity.

28,Mr Joseph Cook,"Upon Friday3548 of this money is concerned. It will readily be seen that an industry may earn nothing during one year, and that the following year it may require the payment of a double amount of bounty. That condition, however, can always be met by placing the necessary sum upon the Estimates, and Parliament may always be trusted to deal fairly with any industry in accordance with the terms of the contract which.will exist after the passing of this measure. Upon the other hand, I would infinitely prefer to see the amount ot elasticity which is proposed in the yearly allocation of the bounty to the granting of the original sum proposed by the Minister. If the honourable gentleman is prepared to make the alteration suggested, I am quite willing to allow it to pass unchallenged. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.57] -Before the honourable member for Echuca spoke, I was seized of what had occurred in Committee upon Friday last, and I have amendments to propose, which, if adopted, will make the clause read as follows : There shall be payable out of the consolidated revenue fund, which is hereby apropriated accordingly, the sum of £500,000, to be distributed during a period not exceeding ten years, operatives all over Australia. commencing on the ist July, 1906, for the payment of bounties o i the production of the goods specified in the schedule. Provided that not more is slipping. than the sum of £75,000 shall be paid by way of bounty in any one financial year. right. posal of the Minister, if adopted, would O practically vest him with power to distribute the sum of £500,000 as he chose, so long as he did not expend more than ,£75,000 in any one year. pended in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the schedule. opens up the consideration of the whole question of bounties. Only a few months ago, when the Manufactures Encouragement Bill was under consideration, the Minister proposed that this House should authorize the expenditure of the sum of £340,000 by way of bonus upon the production of iron. That sum was to be distributed over a term of seven years. Upon that occasion I opposed the Bill, although it related to an industry infinitely more substantial than any of those which are specified in the schedule of this measure. I am now asked to assist the Minister to Bounties Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bounties Bill. pass a Bill which provides for the payment of a bounty of £500,000 to encourage the production of such articles as cocoa, coffee,. chicory, cotton, various kinds of oils, rice, and rubber. No one will contend that these industries would provide anything like the employment which the iron industry would afford. If honourable members are prepared to support the application of the bounty system to the industries named in the Bill, then the proposal to grant a bounty for the encouragement of the iron industry should have been treated with greater respect. I and others opposed the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, believing that it was not right to expend the moneys of the people in the interests of any particular firm or industry. This, however, seems to be an age of mental re-adjustment, so far as fiscal questions are concerned, and if any mental re-adjustment is to take place in reference to this proposal, I shall be prepared to do that which I find other free traders are ready to do. Having regard to the spirit of the times, I should be prepared to favour a bounty for the encouragement of ship-building-a n industry that would give employment to thousands of the direction of a bounty for the shipbuilding industry than in the direction of encouraging by that means the salt or the condensed milk industry. If this is a device on the part of the Minister of Trade and Customs to establish a protective policy, let him at once say so. We have yet to learn whether the bounties proposed under this Bill would enable the industries concerned to carry on without other assistance. It seems to me that when the bounties ceased This clause the industries would have to be buttressed in some way or other, and that it might be urged that since we had devoted such a large sum to their encouragement, we ought togrant them protection through the Customs, rather than allow them to pass away. I see in this Bill a scheme for the protection of the industries to which it applies. Some say that the bounty system is preferable to protection by way of Customs duties, since one can tell exactly what the cost will be; others again favour the system on the ground that it does not mean that an increased cost of goods will be passed on to the consumer.

If I am to accept the proposals contained in this Bill, then my opposition to the iron bounty may well be regarded as having been unjustifiable. The Minister has not explained the source from which this sum of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 is to be obtained. The bounStates that these industries shall be enties are to extend over a period of ten years, but the Minister may exhaust, within six and a half years, the total sum that we are asked to vote. We are thus brought face to face agahn with the financial problem. ment, told us that certain services still remain to be taken over from the States, and that the proportion of Customs and Excise revenue which we are permitted under the Constitution to retain is almost exhausted in providing for existing Federal services. Despite that fact, we are asked to vote ,£500,000, which may be expended within six and a half years. The Government have not propounded a scheme for raising the necessary fund, and it seems to me that this expenditure will seriously disarrange the finances of the smaller States. According to this morning's newspapers, the Premier of Queensland stated yesterday that the Federal expenditure was putting a serious strain upon the Union. most of the industries dealt with by this Bill relate particularly to Queensland, we have the assurance of the Premier of that State that the losses it has sustained as the result of Federation more than counterbalance the advantages which it has derived from the sugar bounty. merely from the point of view of the Treasurer of Queensland. half of the people of that State, and, so far as this question is concerned. I am prepared to accept the assurance of a gentleman controlling the finances of Queensland in preference to that of the honourable member. Mr Kidston how can the representatives of Queensland claim 'any support for these proposals ? think that Mr Kidston bosses us? us the facts regarding the finances of Queensland. I entered this House as a stituents. the honourable member will have to face something more serious. I fail to see that there is sufficient justification for the expenditure proposed under this B ill . As soon as the bounties cease, we shall be asked to assist these industries either by continuing the system or by imposing protective duties. If it be the desire of the couraged, why do they not make special grants to their agricultural departments ? In the absence of anything in that direction, we ought to esfablish a Federal bureau of agriculture which would superintend experiThe Treasurer, in his Budget statements on the lines proposed in the Bill. I notice that a bounty is to be offered for the production of rice. Surely honourable members do not wish to see in Australia marsh fields such as those in which rice is raised in China. Surely they. do not wish to subsidize an industry which can give employment only to cheap labour. I shall avail myself later on of an opportunity to move the omission of some of the items in the schedule, with a view to substitute a proposal for the granting of a bounty to encourage ship-building. Such an industry would give employment to thousands of men, and we might, in that way, form the nucleus of dock yards in which the vessels of the proposed Australian navy could be Although constructed. production of wool ? dustry we might as well encourage all industries in this way. As one who voted against the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , I shall oppose this measure. Sir Joseph Abbott, when Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, was He was speaking on betaunted by the press with having changed from a free-trader to a protectionist, and he replied, "" Surelv this is an age of mental progression."" We must have mental progress in all matters. I have not failed to observe the appearance of a cloud on the In view of the statement made by political horizon, and I say candidly that if I find other free-trade members-fro m my leader downwards-stating , when they visit Queensland or other places, that, despite their free-trade principles, they are prepared to favour the granting of certain No ; but he presents to bounties, I shall no longer fight for my free-trade views on purely academic grounds.

That time, however, has not yet arrived. If we empower the Minister to expend £500,000 in this way, we shall have increased his power to control by regulation nearly every industry -in Australia. I do not wish to speak unkindly of the Minister, but he appears to desire to have a hand in every business. What do the anti-socialists in this House think of a measure which will enable the Minister to extend the principle of State interference with private enterprise? wedge. system of State-owned industries. I am not prepared to empower any Minister to interfere in this wav with every industry. I and others have been returned to resist State interference with private enterprise. The bountv system is the twin sister of protection, and when a free-trader is asked to support it, he is asked to do that which he ought not to do until the system has received the sanction of the electors. At '.he next general election I shall not be so foolish as to fight on ourelv academic grounds for a position which I know cannot be maintained in this House; and I shall ask the electors to give me an opportunitv to fight for their rights just as I find honourable members-whethe r they be protectionists or free-traders-ar e prepared to fight in respect of the rights of others. the honourable and learned member is coming back as a protectionist. port the principles which 'the electors return me to maintain. I wish to remove from the political situation the mask of humbug. If I am forced to vote for a bounty system, I shall vote for its application to an industry that is likely to prove substantial and benefit thousands of workers other parts of the Commonwealth. I can generally tell when honourable member for New England think about that? thinks, because yesterday he went back on his free-trade principles by insisting that whisky should be made from malt only, I do not wish to do so. and we know that barley is grown very-j largely in his electorate. I intend to resist the introduction of the bounty system, but if the Committee determines that £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 shall be set aside for the payment of bounties, I shall move the insertion of shipbuilding in the schedule, so that that industry may be put in the same position as the other industries which appear there, and which are of a tin-pot character in comparison with it . shall test the feeling of the Committee on this question, because I altogether disapprove of the bounty system. I opposed the proposal to grant a bounty for the production of iron, and I shall oppose the present This is the thin end of the proposal to spend not more than £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 It means the introduction of a per annum in bolstering up or fostering industries, because to do so would be to waste money. A t the present time the prices of our staple products are on the down grade. Except in Russia, where there were severe rain storms while the harvest was being gathgred, there has been an extraordinarily good yield of wheat all over the world, so that the production this year is likely to exceed that of any previous, year, and we know that when production is in excess prices f a l l . The prices of wool are also falling, the present prices, compared with those of May, showing a drop of 2^d. per lb., and, while it is estimated that our production this year will exceed that of last year by 200,000 bales, it is morally certain that we shall get less for it . That means that there will be much less money to distribute amongst the community, and consequently the _ public will have much less to spend. Owing to their reckless extravagance, the Government have practically reached the end of their tether,. and in a very short space of time will find I am coming back to supthat their share of the Customs and Excise",18,Bounties Bill

That being so, we are justified in urging economy, and, in the interests to bribe electors."" of the smaller States, which require every penny that can be returned to them, I shall resist this proposal to fritter away ^£500,000 in bounties. I understand that the Minister has agreed to accept an amendment providing that not more than £75,000 shall be spent on bounties in any one year, and that the total amount to be so expended shall not exceed ,£500,000. There is, however, an aspect of the matter to which I should like to allude, and which escaped my recollection when I spoke last. I am informed that it takes an olive tree ten years to come to maturity. granting of a bounty for the production of olive oil under the provisions of the Bill would not encourage persons who are not now growing olive trees to enter into the industry, because they would know that their trees would not be bearing until the end of the period for which the bounty is to be given. If any such bounty were given, the money would be paid to persons who are now growing olive trees and making a profit by expressing oil from the fruit. In my opinion, we should reserve the bounties for plantations established after the passing of the Bill. member do the same in regard to coffee plantations? to cotton plantations, too. The avowed object of bounties is to encourage new industries. According to a statement appearing in the Age of Saturday last, Dr. Thomatis has been offered i5d. per lb. for the cotton which he has grown. That is a splendid price, and why in addition should he or any other grower receive a bounty from the Government? Let us exercise some common sense in this matter. bounties are to be given as gifts to those engaged in profitable industries, why should they not be given to the dairymen and the potato-growers of mine and other districts""? If the measure is really intended to encourage new industries, we must reserve its benefits for those who enter upon such industries after the measure comes into law. If a provision to that effect be not agreed to it will be obvious that the 2 Bill has been introduced. merely to placate the electors, and that, instead of being engood effect in the direction of establishing titled "" An Act to provide for the payment of bounties,"" it should be called ""An Act should withdraw the word ""bribe."" so? There is no other term to use if it is intended to pay bounties to those engaged in profitable industries now in existence in Australia. If the measure be amended to prevent the payment of bounties in connection with existing industries, or if its operation be postponed, for some years, to give time for the establishment of new industries, I shall withdraw the word, because it may then be regarded as an honest attempt to foster new industries. Consequently the "" bribe "" is unparliamentary. be offensive, and if it is disorderly I shall withdraw the word ""bribe"" and use some other term to express my meaning.

For example, the condensed' milk industry has been in, existence in Victoria and New If South Wales for years F > >d yet it is ast ar proposed to offer a bounty for the production of condensed and powdered milk. What is the reason? The bounty cannot have the effect of bringing a new industry into existence.

I do not think that rubber trees can be grown at Mount Macedon. If they could, it would be easy to understand why the bounty was being offered. We are being asked to vote money, not for the purpose of promoting the establishment of new industries, but in order to confer advantages upon those who are already carrying on various undertakings with a fair measure of success. I am opposed to the Bill, and shall vote against it. I realize that it is only an election placard, and that money is being offered by way of bounties as a bribe member must withdraw that expression. the expression, and content myself by saying that the Bill is merely an election placard, and that it has been brought forward in order to please the electors, and bring the Government into favour with certain sections of them. Sometimes the honourable member for New England makes useful and valuable suggestions, but, unfortunately, the violence of his scientific advisers? I presume that the language sometimes prevents honourable members from giving to them that fair consideration to which they are tentitled. I the principle underlying the measure, and I do not think that there is any justification fofr the imputations of unworthy motives which the honourable member for New England has so freely hurled at Ministers and theii supporters. Whilst approving of the system of granting bounties in certain cases, I think that a measure such as this should hav# been preceded by careful inquiry and investigation as to the products in respect to which bounties are to be offered. Whilst it would appear from the memorandum submitted to the House that some Departmental inquiries have been made by able officers, their investigations do not appear to have not been sufficiently complete and comprehensive. I believe, further, that a Bill such as this should be associated with proper safeguards in the direction of supervision an'd administration. contains no provision of that kind. Two sessions ago this House unanimously passed a resolution in favour of the organization at an early date of a Department of National Agriculture. In submitting that resolution, I mentioned specifically that such a. Department would be useful in formulating schemes such as that contained in the Bill, and in conducting the necessary investigations, and supervising the granting of bounties. Yet we have placed before us a scheme involving the expenditure of £500,000 without any provision for safeguards such as might reasonably and naturallv be expected. Such a Department as I have indicated might very well have been established as a condition precedent to the introduction of the present scheme, or it might have been associated with the proposal in some form or other. I sincerely hope, therefore, that before the Minister brings this important measure into operation he will carefully consider the question of organizing the nucleus, however moderate, modest, and inexpensive it may be, of a Department of National Agriculture. How could such a measure as this, which deals with a large number of industrial and technical matters, be administered by the Minister or the Comptroller-General of Customs, without the assistance and guidance of experts in the shape of agriculturists, chemists, and other large amount of money which is to be devoted to the payment of bounties is not to be scattered here, there, and everywhere thoroughly approve of without observing ordinary precautions. T am not very familiar with many of the items in the schedule, but I know a little about one of the products referred to, namely, olive oil. As a matter of fact, the production of olive oil has been most successfully carried on for many years in one of the States, and a very fine industry has been established. Whilst the Tariff Commission were sitting in Adelaide we had evidence of this fact from a witness representing Sir Samuel Davenport, who is the pioneer of olive culture in Australia, and who has placed the'industry upon a sound and scientific basis. For this he deserves the greatest credit. I am not in a position to sav whether he obtained a bonus, but, bonus or no bonus, he has undoubtedly been most successful. in South Australia. to hear it.

I am informed, however, that the production of olive oil in Victoria has hitherto not been a payable industry, and that a large number of persons who went to the trouble and expense of planting olive trees have since uprooted them. doing that at Mildura when we were up there. Sir John QUICK -Some years ago I bought some olive truncheons from Sir Samuel Davenport, and succeeded in growing them at Bendigo. The trees fruited splendidly, and there was abundance of materialfrom which to manufacture oil, but no market was available, and I uprooted my trees. Other persons did the same, and possibly, in common with myself, made a mistake My point, however, is that we could naturally look to' a Department presided over by experts to give reliable advice as to whether it would be justifiable to spend money in growing olives, cotton, or sunflowers, or other such products. If an Agricultural Department, or bureau, were equipped with the proper means of obtaining information, and circulating it, and advising those who were disposed to enter upon such enterprises, we could support a scheme such as that now before us with some safety and confidence. What is required is not merely money, but systematized knowledge and information, and proper means of placing it at the disposal of the men on the soil. Department in Victoria, from which farmers could obtain the necessary information. Department is not offering bounties such as those now proposed. the Government should not rest content with offering bounties for ths production of the articles enumerated in the schedule, but that they should make it a condition precedent to the granting of those bounties that the industries must be initiated under circumstances which are likelv to result in success. In other words, people should not be lured on to plant trees merelv in the expectation that they will be able to participate in a bounty, and without any hope that they will be able to carry on operations when the bounty has been withdrawn. A Department such as I have mentioned would be able to afford valuable assistance in that direction, and would be in a position to warn people against the insensate folly of embarking upon an industry in which they could not continue after the bounty had ceased. Some years ago the Victorian Government offered large bonuses to encourage the establishment of vineyards. Their action imparted an artificial stimulus to the vineplanting industry. The result was that a large number of people planted valueless, nondescript vines for the purpose of earning the bounty, and when it ceased to operate the vines had to be uprooted. That bounty was a delusion and a snare to many who embarked in the industry, because it was not associated with the dissemination of the necessary knowledge for their guidance. The scheme proposed in this Bill will be equally futile unless it is associated with some method for imparting proper instruction to those who are likely to be induced to commence operations under it. I beg the Minister not to bring the Bill into force until he has proper experts at his command who are capable of affording that information. He himself cannot be expected to prevent people from committing mistakes. Whatever is done must be done in accordance with a well-considered scheme. There is certainly some force in the remarks of the honourable member for New England concerning the advisability or otherwise of allowing those who have already established plantations to participate in the bonus. The point which he has raised is worth considering. Something is to be said in favour of assisting those who have already established olive plantations, as well as of affording help to new adventurers and investors. But certainly the individuals who incur the trouble and expense of planting new trees, and who have to deal with the uncertainI hold that ties and difficulties incidental to a new enterprise should not be forgotten. Thev should be specially provided for, and it would be a mockery to them, if , in the hope that they would share in this bounty, they were induced to plant trees, which, according to the testimony of Sir Samuel Davenport, require to be seven, eight, or nine years old before they will yield a gallon of olive oil, and it was found at the end of that period that there was no bonus available for them, because it had been appropriated by those who had already established plantations.

I agree with the statement that this Bill shows signs of hasty preparation, and I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister who is in charge of it possesses very little information relating to.the conditions attaching to the industries the establishment of which he desires to encourage. I cannot understand why the Bill has been brought forward at the present' juncture. It affords another example of the hasty legislation in which this Parliament has indulged, and which has brought the country into such bad repute outside our shores. opinion. and that of thousands of persons outside of this House. ""stinking fish"" party again. ber sees what he conceives to be a wrong, surely it is his duty to point it out. I repeat that the Bill bears evidence of hasty preparation, and that it should not have been brought forward at this late stage of the session. I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and Customsi f he is aware of the time that is required to enable the gutta percha tree to attain maturity. I venture to say that if he were to plant one to-day he would not live long enough to see it reach maturity. In this connection I hold in my hand a very able report upon the Federated Malay States and Java, which has been prepared by Senator Staniforth Smith. Speaking of the gutta percha tree he saysThe yield per tree is not nearly so large as to emphasize them. in the case of rubber, and it is a particularly slow-growing tree, no gutta percha being obtained until it is twenty-live years old, and sometimes fifty. For private enterprise gutta percha growing is out of the question, but a Gowas a valuable contribution to the debate, vernment plantation is advisable. Evidently the Government have in their eye some particularly objectionable form of socialistic legislation. Later on Senator Staniforth Smith, in speaking of various fibres-and fibres are specified in the schedule of this Bill-says There is an immense number of fibrous plantsthat grow well in the tropics, many of them yielding most valuable fibres; but the amount of labour required to extract this and prepare it He has given utterance for the market makes the cultivation generally unprofitable. So that honourable members are asked to> grant a bounty upon the products of cheap labour; and if there is one thing more than another which we do not want, it is the introduction of labour of that description. In speaking of sisal hemp, Senator Staniforth Smith saysSisal hemp does not grow well near the equator, as it requires a dry climate. It grows, best 20 degrees from the equator, or just inside the tropics. This is an industry that might be cultivated with success in certain parts of Australia. At Rigo, in Papua, there is a small plantation of sisal hemp. While it may be hoped that this will result in success, the probabilities are against it, as, in the opinion of tbe most competent experts, the climate is altogether unsuitable. Dr. Treub, Director of Agriculture in Java; Mr Ridley, Director of the Singapore Botanical Gardens, and Mr Carruthers, Director of Agriculture for the Malay States, were all of opinion that the climate of Papua is unfitted for its culture. This is probably another illustration of the necessity of expert knowledge in starting new industries. I have quoted those passages with a view to showing how they bear out the contenI f an honourable memtion of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that if we are to embark upon legislation of this sort we should establish some kind of organization for the purpose of instructing growers in the methods of cultivating the products upon which we propose to pay a bounty. Ire the absence of such a Department we can0 not hope for success. Yet without any preparation of that kind, the Government ask us to sanction the expenditure of £500,000. Other matters into which a Department of the character suggested might inquire are the conditions of the soil, climate, and' rainfall. The report of Senator Staniforth Smith confirms the statements of the honourable and learned' member for Bendigo, and I merely desire many respects the speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for Bendigoespecially with regard to the need whichexists for establishing a Federal Department of Agriculture to deal with matters;",22,Bounties Bill

I also am strongly impressed with the necessity for establishing a Department of that description, quite apart from the question of the proposed payment of bounties. I believe that such a Department need not trench upon the very useful work which is being done by the States Agricultural Departments. On the contrary, I think that its existence would simplify their work, and prevent its duplication. and learned member for Bendigo that the -distribution of money by way of bounties should be undertaken only under the advice and supervision of expert authorities. We ought to be very careful not to spend any money by way of bounty in developing an industry which has no hope of success. Before any bounty is allotted to an industry, it should be demonstrated that it . possesses sufficient possibilities of success to make it worth our while to try the experiment. is a danger that the money will be wasted, and that a number of well-intentioned people will be induced to embark their money in industries in which they would have been prevented from doing so by the exercise of a little foresight. Therefore, I hope that the question of the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture will receive very serious attention. should be established as a prelude to the granting of bounties. that this Department may authorize the payment of bounties upon a number of commodities upon which the bounty could not be claimed until after the industries had been in existence for some years. But I do think that this important work should not be undertaken in the absence of supervision such as has been suggested by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I ask the Government to seriouslv consider the position which he has put before them. I do not take up the attitude of some of mv free-trade friends that we should regard the policy of encouraging the establishment of industries by means of bounties as an interference with private enterprise. I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that quite a number of very desirable industries may be assisted in that way. claimed for protective duties? distinction to be drawn between the two methods. completely under the control of this Parliament and the Government, whereas it is extremely difficult to determine exactly who benefits by Customs duties. The Government can definitely state what industries are to be encouraged by bounties, and the extent of the assistance to be given. They, can also take steps to insure that some benefit shall be derived from the system by those employed in the industries. NoI agree with the honourable such control can be exercised under a system of Customs taxation. I am not prepared on the score of resisting State interference with private enterprise to join an effort to prevent the Government from encouraging industries by a reasonable expenditure under the bounty system. On the motion for the second reading of this Bil l I pointed out that a mistake was being made in proposing a bounty of only Jd. per lb. on condensed milk, whilst a bounty of f d . per lb. was to be given for the proOtherwise there duction of powdered milk. I think that the higher bounty should be paid on the production of condensed milk, since that industry is the more important one. I have been informed by those engaged in it that some serious difficulties yet remain to be removed, and it .seems to me that if the dairying industry succeeded in placing on the market a condensed milk equal to that imported from Switzerland, substantial beneI do not mean to suggest that it fit would accrue to the Commonwealth. When the schedule is under consideration, I quite recognise I shall move in the direction I have indicated. I am prepared to deal with these proposals in a reasonable'way. I certainly think that we ought to seriously consider the desirableness of creating a Bureau of Agriculture to which experts capable of dealing with various questions relating to primary production should be attached, and I also agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that the success of these proposals will largely depend upon the way in which they are handled. many other honourable members, feel that we have not yet reached a stage at which we should be justified in sanctioning this heavy expenditure. We have not yet received any information as to the way in which these bounties are to be distributed, or as to whether it is intended that the producer of the raw material shall receive any benefit.

That being so, I fail to see why the cotton industry, any more than the dairying industry, should be assisted by means of a bounty.

We shall be perfectly justified in opposing the Bill until the Minister has placed before the Committee more satisfactory information in support of it. Two years ago, on the. motion of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, the House unanimously affirmed the expediency of establishing a Commonwealth agricultural bureau; but nothing has been done in the matter. this Bounties Bill upon us, without being able to give us the information necessary for an intelligent consideration of its provisions. It is proposed to grant a bounty for the encouragement of the olive oil industry, but, to my knowledge, that industry was in a most flourishing condition ten years ago. now, and at Mildura persons are digging up their olive trees. better to grow raisins. trv to use their soil to the best advantage. If olives pay better than raisins, growers will keep on planting olive trees. Ten vears ago the warehouse which I represented in Newcastle handled hundreds of gallons of South Australian olive oil which was eciual to the best Italian olive oil. and competed there in a free-trade market with all other oils. Why then should it be necessary to cive a. bountv for the encouragement of the olive oil industry? If the honourable member for Grev were able to move that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee, I should support the motion, because we certainlv want some more information about the state and prospects of the various industries to which it is proposed to give assistance. I have no desire to kill the Bill, because it contains proposals which I am readv to support : but we are entitled to receive from the Minister more information in regard to it. a bountv for the encouragement of industries which we have not here now, and for [29 AUGUST, 1906.] Bounties Bill. 3557 which we have a suitable climate, and soil. It would, however, be absurd to pay such bounties as would encourage persons to grow coffee in Tasmania, for example. believe in the bounty system ? ing of bounties to bring about the starting of new industries. their own bounty, since it is provided out of the Excise. I have no objection to the giving of assistance for the starting of industries for the production of fibre of various kinds, and shall support similar proposals which I consider justifiable; but I am altogether opposed to going further Now the Minister has sprung until we have obtained, either by means of a Select Committee, or through an agricultural bureau, the information which is absolutelv necessary to enable us to deal wisely with the whole question. I shall support the Bill, and I hope that before it reaches its final stage its provisions will have been so safeguarded that the evils which have resulted from the granting of bounties in some of the States will not follow the bringing of its provisions into effect. I take a broader view of the measure than do those who look upon it merely as one for the encouragement of production of certain, kinds. One of the big problems facing the Commonwealth is how best to people our territory,, and especially those lands which are most open to attack by the populous nations of Eastern Asia. It has been objected that the Bill is directed largely to the encouragement of tropical productions, but, while I admit that that is. so, I contend that it is to the advantage of the Commonwealth, because we cannot hope to be always secure from the aggression of nations which are continually seeking outlets for their surplus population, if we leave our waste lands at their mercy. It is, however, one thing to throw land open for settlement, and another to help those who try to settle upon it.

I interjected at the time that he was speaking merely as Treasurer. There is another point of view. Although the Queensland Treasury £2,000,000 by the establishment of Federation, the people of Queensland have largely benefited. For instance, so far as the sugar industry is concerned, not only have they benefited in the manner to which reference has already been made, but they have benefited also by having their market extended. that, had Queensland remained out of the Federation, her sugar would have been treated by it exactly as. the sugar of Fiji and of Java would have been treated. Had the remaining States federated, Queensland standing out, she would have been fiscally a foreign State, and her sugar and other products would have been admitted into the Federation only on the terms under which the products of other countries would have been admitted, whether dutiable or free. But, having joined the Federation, she has obtained free access to the markets of Australia, and is able td supply a population of nearlv 4,250,000, instead of a population of Treasurer's complaint might be answered' in many other ways ; but as we are not now discussing the financial position of the States, I shall not proceed further in this direction. The honourable member for Wilmot says that the prices of our primary products are on the down grade. If so, that is a reason for fostering new productions. If the markets of the world are being glutted with, our exports, we should try to diversify them, and not depend wholly on one or two lines. The honourable member for Cowper says that growers will always put their labour and capital into such crops as will return the greatest profits, and no doubt that is so; but even he will admit that the olive can be grown in many places where the vine cannot be profitably cultivated. grown extensively. growing, though I do not know much about the industry. I am, however, acquainted with some of the other industries menThe honourable member for Dalley tioned in the schedule. The Minister has put before us a statement showing what a large amount of money is annually expended to purchase commodities which might very well be produced locally, if their production* were encouraged by means of bounties. If that were brought about, we should reap the double advantage of keeping our money in circulation amongst our own people, and of settling our waste has lost something over lands, and providing protection in time of need. I may take credit for having already moved in the direction of securing encouragement for the cotton industry. That has been designated a Queensland industry; but cotton can be produced in every State of the Commonwealth except I have already pointed out Tasmania. I have seen samples grown in Echuca, and to-day I saw a very good sample which was grown at Coolamon, in New South Wales, while the plant is almost indigenous in the Northern Territory, and will grow in other parts of South Australia, and there is in Western Australia as large an area as in Queensland where it will grow to perfection.

The Queensland bounty be given for its production? the industries mentioned in the schedule will be established without the aid of a bounty, but before they can become of any importance they will, if not encouraged, fall into the hands of Japanese and Chinamen. One of the arguments in favour of the Bill is that, by encouraging tropical production, it will bring about the settlement of waste lands, which are now a source of danger to us, and, like expenditure for the encouragement of immigration, by settling people on them, will not only give us a larger population to bear the burdens of taxation and to repay our loans, ' but will increase the number of those who, in time of need, will be ready to defend their homes and the country. are already those persons in other States who start industries without assistance?",26,Fowler Ther E Is Already An Amend

I think that if any one deserves to be rewarded, it is the man who has been struggling along and making experiments with results profitable to those who follow him. from the benefits conferred by a Bill of this kind. Cairns, who has spent a great deal of money in cultivating and advertising his cotton, has placed his small plantation on a satisfactory footing, he should derive the benefit of the bounty to the same extent as the settler who for the first time embarKs in the industry. we shall ever have in Australia large cotton plantations such as used to be a special feature in-the Southern States of America. I should not like to see similar conditions brought about here, because the planters would have to employ a class of labour that we have no desire to encourage. succeed, it will have to be carried on by farmers with small families which can perform all the work on the plantation. If cotton is to be grown under the conditions that we desire, the small farmers will have to cultivate small areas, and rely upon their families for all the labour required in harvesting their crops. I hope that by multiplying the number of small farms we shall bring about an aggregate production -no t only in Queensland, but in all other States, with the single exception of Tasmania-whic h will add very considerably to the wealth of the Commonwealth. Reverting to the statement that this measure is intended mainlv to confer benefit upon Queensland, I should like to refer to the fact that flax can be produced in Tasmania to greater advantage than in any other ""State. duced there now. by reference to the import returns, that in 1904 the flax and hemp imported into the Commonwealth were valued at £ 1 4 5 , 0 0 0 , whilst last year the imports of those commodities were valued at £ 1 2 8 , 0 0 0 . sides this, in 1904, we imported linseed oil to the value of £ 1 0 8 , 0 0 0 , and in 1905, to Civil War was in progress when the cotton the value of £ 8 0 , 2 3 5 .

I agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that any bounty system should be surrounded by. proper safeguards, and that the bounties should be distributed under proper supervision in order that the grower, whom it is sought to benefit, shall receive the fullest possible advantage. In ' some cases where bounties have been granted, those who have been exploiting the industry'rather than the growers of the product, have derived the advantage. In Queensland, in the sixties, the Government offered a bounty for the growth of cotton, but instead of the money passing into the hands of the growers, it was appropriated by those who bought the cotton in the rough It is being prostate, and cleaned it for export.

I have made it a point to confine my remarks to matters with which I am acquainted. cotton growers continue their operations after the bountv period had expired? later years. As I have already explained, the conditions at the time of which I have spoken, were altogether unfavorable to the cotton growing industry. Similar conditions do not exist now. I have explained why the cotton industry failed, and why we may expect to achieve a greater degree of success under existing conditions. The total amount that is being asked for to encourage the growth of cotton is £22,500. Not more than £4,500 is to be distributed in any one year. When we consider the immense possibilities of the industry in a country like ours, I think that the amount pioposed to be spent is trifling. I have here a copy .of a letter from Mr John E. New-ton, the Chairman of the Council of the British Cotton Growers' Association, containing his report upon various samples submitted to him.

I have explained before that no care was exercised by the planters in selecting their seed. The seed was taken from the heap as it was thrown out from the gins, and beyond that which was used for sowing purposes, it was not turned to any account. Thousands of tons were swept away down the rivers by the flood waters. The variety and the length of the staple, its variability as to fineness or coarseness, and curl, and in every other respect, rendered the cotton almost unmarketable. It brought the lowest possible prices, because it was suitable for the manufacture of only the most inferior goods> If we were to send our wool home under similar conditions, we shoukl receive very poor prices for it. member has quoted is an argument against the payment of bounties. posed to pay the bounties at the rate of 10 per cent, upon the market value. That will encourage the production of high quality cotton. As a matter of fact, an endeavour is now being made in Queensland to grow special classes of cotton in the localities best adapted to their cultivation. The experts of the Agricultural Department are advising the farmers as to the particular! kind of seed which they should sow upon their plantations, and the result is that a very much better class of cotton is being sent to the old country. Some of our cotton has realized as much as is. 2d', to is. 3d. per lb.

132,Mr Wilkinson,"No. It is promember for Franklin, namely, why did the industry f a i l in days gone Sy. They do not take all the surrounding circumstances into consideration, and are thus deterred from embarking upon the enterprise. Besides the drawbacks to which I have referred, the cost of transit and the insurance in heavier charges than at present. The cotton had to be sent home by sailing vessels, which used to occupy from 80 to 120 days on the voyage, whereas the product can now be forwarded to the home market within six or seven weeks. Then, again, the insurance rates were very much higher than at present, because of the danger of spontaneous combustion, and of the fact that burnt through carrying damp cotton. The facilities for land carriage have also been greatly improved. There are other pertinent reasons which might be advanced as to why the industry did not succeed there. But of course persons who are unaware of the conditions which operated in those days naturally feel reluctant to embark upon the industry. I believe, however, that under the conditions which are embodied in this B ill many would be induced to enter upon it. Everybody will admit that it is an industry which is capable of very great expansion. By virtue of our geographical position we possess advantages for the disposal of cotton which are possessed by no other countries in the world For instance, 1 find that during the first half-year of 1904 the importations of cotton into Japan alone amounted to 151.693,259 lbs. 76,000.000 lbs. was imported from India, nearly 16,000,000 lbs. from the United States of America, 51,000,000 lbs. from China, 3,000,000 lbs. from Egypt, and about 3,500,000 lbs. from other countries. The Japanese product itself totalled only 226,000 lbs. In that one country, which is populated by a cotton-wearing race, we have a large market for the Australian commodity. We could find an additional market in India, and we have the 400.000,000 people of China, as well as those, of the Malay Peninsula and ithe Eastern Archipelago at our door. In moving the second reading of this Bill, the Minister quoted the quantity of raw cotton imported into the Commonwealth, but neglected to state the vast sum which we send out of the country for the purpose of paying for cotton manufactured goods. In addition to providing a bonus for the cultivation of cotton, I should like the Government to offer a small bounty to encourage the manufacture of that commodity into articles of wearing apparel. We might thus secure the establishment of the primarv and secondary industry side by the old days involved much side. However, I have no desire to labour that aspect of the question. I have collected much information upon this subject, apart from my own personal knowledge of it-and I claim to possess some little knowledge, having been engaged .in the industry during my youth. have been asked by some honourable memmore than one ship was bers whether, if the industry were encouraged, it would be likely to prove remunerative. In replv, I can only quote returns which have been supplied to me since the recent revival in the growth of this staple in Queensland-that is, within the past two or three years. Mr Daniel Jones, of the Agricultural' Department of that State, who was asked what it would cost to grow cotton at Charleville, which is some 500 miles west of Brisbane, estimated the total outlay required at £ 3 16s. 2d. per acre. This estimate included two ploughings, two borrowings, drilling, and sowing, three scufflings, thinning and hoeing, carriage to Brisbane, seed, and the cost of picking .1,000 lbs. of cotton. When he made that estimate the price of cotton was from $\A. to 7^d. per lb., but his calculations were based upon a cost of 5 Jd. per lb.. at which figure the commoditv Of that quantity would vield a gross return of £ 7 5s. i o d . per 1,000 lbs., or a net profit of £ 3 9s. 8d. per acre. In my own district, not far from Ioswicft, some farmers have realized as much as from £ 1 1 to £ 1 3 per acre for the cultivation of cotton. Of course, it was grown in small plots, and every possible care was exercised. quire the aid of a bounty if it will yield that return. be induced to enter upon the industry it would succeed, but the proposed bounty is to be granted for the purpose of encouraging them to embark upon it . Australia is not the only country in the world which offers bounties for the establishment of its industries. Every other nation which has developed its industries has granted bounties not only upon its primary-productions,",29,Fowler Ther E Is Already An Amend

If the Minister had followed this particular staple from the field to the factory, and had offered a small bounty for its manufacture, he would not have departed from the spirit of this measure. In the case of fish, we are asked to follow them from the markets to the canning factories. In the same way, we intend to follow olives from the fields into the crushing mills and refineries. would not have been at all inconsistent with the objects of the Bill if the Minister had acted in the way that I suggest. I have already stated that, in my opinion, the China oil industry would not succeed in any part of Australia with the labour that we have at our command, seeing that the oil is produced in the New Hebrides, where there is an abundance of Kanaka labour available, and in India, where coolies are employed in its production. It has been said that the employment of machinery would overcome the difficulty, but I would point out that a machine which would gather the nut, from which the oil is extracted, would also harvest little lumps of earth, which are instinctively rejected by the human hand. We do not wish to degrade the labour conditions of Australia to the level of those which obtain in India and the New Hebrides. In the case of castor oil, however, the position is a very different one. The castor oil plant grows as a weed in every part of Queensland, and in numerous portions of New South Wales. I have seen it flourishing even in rubbish heaps. It will grow in almost any part of the Commonwealth. easily harvested, and there is not very much hard labour involved in the operation. In the past the difficulty experienced has been the lack of a crusher. But an enterprising firm in Victoria-I refer to Messrs. Kitchen and Sons-in anticipation of the expansion of the cotton industry in Queensland, have not only sent their cotton gin there, but have arranged for the installation of a plant to crush the seed into oil, and to make oil cake as well. This machine will not only make use of the by-products of the cotton plant, but of other crops. years ago an attempt was made by coolies in Queensland to grow the castor oil plant, and in this they were very successful. They could produce almost any quantity of seed of first-class quality, but their difficulty was to get it pressed into oil. At a later stage, another individual commenced Mr Wilkinson. the production of castor oil in a very small way. The article which he produced was very superior to the castor oil of commerce, inasmuch as it was almost entirely free of the nauseous smell which is usually associated with it. It was sold by chemists astasteless castor oil. sured its popularity. Therefore, it for castor oil for medicinal purposes is verylimited. To become of any great commercial value it would require to be used as a lubricating oil. There is no better lubricant obtainable-and I speak as an enginedriver. I am anxious that this Bill shall pass, and I do not think that the charge that it has been introduced for electioneering purposes has been substantiated. To my mind, it simply represents another step in the policy which the Government have professed for years past. I refer to the encouragement, not only of secondary, but of primary, industries/ the settlement of the people on the land, and the encouragement of immigration. I believe that Australia has great potentialities, and that any crop grown elsewhere can be raised in some part of the Commonwealth. All that we need to do is to encourage these industries in their infancy. I believe that all those mentioned in the schedule will, if given reasonable assistance, become, great national assets, and that one of them, at all events, will be more valuable even than is the wool industry of Australia. It is a crop which is surprised at the sudden change of front on the part of some honourable members. During the second-reading debate no opposition was raised to the Bill. consequence was raised to the Bill. We now have a proposition on the part of those who pose as the friends of the primary producer that it shall be shelved. Their attitude is certainly inconsistent. It is said that a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into these proposals. I Some fail to see that such a body could obtain any more information than is already in the possession of the Minister, who will, I am sure, be prepared, when the schedule is under consideration, to give full details as to the present position of the industries proposed to be encouraged.

141,Mr Spence,"No opposition of anyBureau of Agriculture should be antecedent to the passing of this B ill . I do not believe, however, that he would desire to retard its passing. I am heartily in favour of the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, but I do not know why we should delay the passing of ttiis Bill until such a department has been created. we to say, as was urged, in effect, by the honourable member for Cowper, that those who propose to earn these bounties shall not be permitted to make a start unless a Department of Agriculture approves of the locality, or localities, in which they propose to commence operations? The suggestion made by the honourable member is only one remove from a proposal that the Commonwealth should itself undertake the production of some of these articles. We have in New South Wales a splendid Agricultural College, with 5,000 acres of land under its control, whilst there are scattered over the State fourteen experimental farms, capable of thoroughly testing the producing qualities of the soil. Victoria has also several experimental farms, and a very large Agricultural College, with 4,000 or 5,000 acres of ground surrounding it. Western Australia has, I think, six experimental farms, as well as an Agricultural College, and sixty-five agricultural halls, which are subsidized by the Government, and in which lectures are given from time to time by experts appointed to assist the farmers in acquiring a thorough knowledge of their industry. In Queensland there is an Agricultural College, and something like ten experimental farms and fourteen sub-stations, whilst South Australia has an Agricultural Bureau, with over 100 branches. All these institutions publish from time to time official reports. The New South Wales Agricultural Gazettea very valuable publication-give s information relating to various primary industries, and similar publications are issued in most of the States. The States Departments of Agriculture also go so far as to select good seed and plants for the farmers. Is it the desire of honourable members that the work of these institutions shall be duplicated? hand over to those Departments the supervision of the industries named in the B ill . Sir Committee later on what I propose to do in that direction. those who appeared at the outset to favour the Bill are now raising obstacles to its passing. I understand that the work of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture would be altogether different from that carried out by the States Departments of Agriculture. Its province would be, amongst other things, to collect from the States DepartAre ments information which it would distribute from one central office. It is certainly unnecessary that such a Department should be established before these bounties are granted. The States have made very creditable provision for the needs of the farmers. As a matter of fact, no one entering any other industry is so fully supplied with information to assist him as is the man who* is about to settle on the land. Any one proposing to embark upon one of these new industries could readily obtain from the States, Departments all the information necessary for his guidance. The States Departments of Agriculture can supplv details as to analyses of soils, and the districts best fitted for the raising of certain products. The honourable member for New England insinuated that this B i ll was only a political placard. We might with equal reason say that electioneering tactics are at the bottom of the opposition to the Bill, and that it is the desire of the Opposition to reduce the volume of good work done by the present Government. I could understand straight-out opposition to the B ill, but I cannot understand a proposal to shelve it . member believe in the granting of bounties to existing industries? one does. No such proposal is contained in the B ill . mentioned in the schedule are already established. # ally glances at the agricultural statistics of the Commonwealth knows that some of the industries mentioned in the schedule are not yet established in Australia.

We are told that it has already been demonstrated that all the products mentioned in the schedule can be grown in Australia. It would be foolish to offer bounties for the raising of crops if we did not know that they could be grown here. I believe that Australia can produce almost anything that is grown elsewhere. As to the administration of the Bill, we know that expert assistance is already obtainable, and that the experts in the States Departments of Agriculture could make all the tests necessary under it. Experts attached after the statement of the Prime Minister to the agricultural colleges of the States are always ready to afford information. They are enthusiasts, and would be quite willing, if allowed by the States' authorities, as I think they would be, to cooperate with the Federal Government, and thus save the money of the taxpayers. Because, we must, of course, avoid duplication. One of the objects of bounties is to prevent too big a burden from falling on any one State. There are some productions which could best be undertaken in some States, and others in other States, and the proposed distribution would, no doubt, establish industries in those places where the conditions are best suited for their establishment. I do not think that the bounties will be sufficiently large to induce persons to enter upon production merely for the sake of obtaining money from the Government. Persons seeking to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill will be wise enough to look ahead and see what the future prospects of an industry will be. By encouraging production, the Bill will lead to closer settlement than we have now, and to the more thorough use of land which is now not being employed to the best advantage. I hope, therefore, that the opposition which has been shown to the measure will be withdrawn. I have no fault to find with honourable members for asking for information, because it is not desirable to give bounties to industries which are al, ready prosperous concerns; but I do not think that anything of the kind is intended, and I hope that, having obtained the information they think desirable in regard to the details of the measure, honourable memI f it were shown that the cotton bers will allow it to pass. first place, I should like to congratulate the Committee on having the Minister of Trade and Customs present to-day.

Now that the Minister is here, I hope that he will give us the information to which we are entitled in regard to its proposals. If I had had any hesitation about opposing this infamous scheme of bounties, it Would have vanished at Maryborough on Saturday last. He has confirmed me in my opposition by declaring that this bounty scheme is part and parcel of the protectionist proposals of the Ministry. When, on a previous occasion, I declared it to be so, some of the Ministerial supporters attempted to persuade me that it was not; but the Prime Minister, in the speech of which I allude, saidWe have before Parliament a BountiesB ill , which sets aside £500,000 to be spent over tenyears, at the rate of /.'50,ooo a year, to encourage farmers, cultivators, producers, and fishermen.

We are backing: it up with a Bill and half-a-million of money, and that by way of a beginning. This is outside the scope of Customs duties. It supplements them, but when we do these things we are flying the flag of protection all the time. member is not frightened by mere words !

154,Mr Johnson,"I take it that the Bill was affirmed when the second reading was carried, and the honourable member must now confine himself to giving reasons why the sum asked for should or should not be voted, without going into the fiscal question. for the appropriation of money for the payment of bounties, which involves a principle with which I am not in agreement. I do not wish to discuss the relative merits of free-trade and protection; I merely wish to point out that I am justified, by the statement of the Prime Minister that the Bill is part of the protectionist policy of the Ministry, in voting against the proposed appropriation. By doing so, I shall correctlv express the views of those who returned me as a free-trader, while I should be false to my principles if I did otherwise. does not require to be told by the Prime Minister that the bounties system and protection are twin sisters. cation for my opposition is further fortified by the statement to which I have referred. Ever, if I thought the granting of bounties justifiable, T should decline, on the eve of a general election, to place in the hands of the Minister a power for corruption and bribery which would enable the Government to say to the electors, "" We have at our disposal the sum of £500,000 , which we can disburse practicallv at our discretion during the next .ten years."" That would allow them to improperly influence the electors. If this were the beginning of the first session of a Parliament, instead of the end of the last session, the position would be altogether different; but, under the circumstances, the suspicion that the Bill has,been brought forward in order to win for the Government by undue influence the favour of a certain section of voters is not without ample justification. Another reason for Dostooning the consideration of the measure is that its policy is one upon which the electors have a right to be afforded an opportunity to express an opinion, and an opportunity for doing so will be provided within a very short space of time. In my opinion, the money asked for would be better expended in establishing a Department of Agriculture, for the purpose of widening the sphere and scope of technical agricultural education, than in the manner proposed. I congratulate the honourable member for Moreton upon the very informative speech which he has made. He, however, failed to prove that there is need for granting bounties for the encouragement of the production of the articles to which he referred, because, according to his own showing, they can now be profitably produced without State aid. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo pointed out a short time ago that olives have for some time past been grown successfully in South Australia, and that the olive oil industry is a very flourishing one; while the honourable member for Grey has informed us that no bounty has been paid by the South Australian State Government to foster it. The remarks of the honourable member for Darling, although intended to bolster up the B ill , also showed that there is no need for bounties The honourable member for the encouragement of this and the other industries to which he referred. Where industries are now in existence, and Hkely to continue without the aid of bounties, it is altogether absurd to vote bounties -iox their assistance. I am in favour of the proposal of the honourable member for Grey to refer the Bill to a Select Committee to inquire into the whole subject, and, if he does not press it , I shall be prepared, if I can do so under the Standing Orders, to move in that direction mvself. I shall not be deterred by threats from the Minister as to the probable fate of the measure should such a step be taken. If the Government were to abandon the .Bill, the result would be that the country would save a very large amount of money which would otherwise be boodled away. In view of the grave financial problems which we shall have to solve in the near future, we have no-right to expend money in the manner proposed.

Sir member for Wentworth wanted me to say the amount which I should annually require to disburse by way of bounty upon each product specified in the schedule to the Bill. that, even at the risk of incurring the Minister's anger, I must make a few observations. Sir delay the passing of the Bill. Minister made some most unwarrantable charges last week when he declared to a press representative that Opposition members had been wasting time the whole of Friday morning. that the Prime Minister should talk so recklessly, and make statements which are so absolutely devoid of foundation. He is becoming even more reckless in his statements than is the Minister who is in charge of this Bill, and I think that it is about time he took himself in hand. He is evidently losing his senses, ot he would not make wild charges against honourable members who are seeking to establish some reasonable basis for the disposition of the money proposed to be granted under this Bill, and for its allocation when it shall become due. I find that the Minister of Trade and Customs knows absolutely nothing about this matter. This bounty system is to be administered by al Minister who tells us that he knows nothing whatever about tropical industries. Yet he should have concentrated in his Department the whole of the technical I do nothing of the Knowledge required for a proper and wise distribution of this money. So far from the free-traders upon this side of the Chamber having originated this demand for knowledge, I would remind the Prime Minister that it emanated from two protectionists who, from long experience of the bounty system, foresaw that the money might as well be thrown into the sea unless its expenditure were wisely supervised. member for Bendigo said the same thing. more particularly of the honourable member Gippsland. .

190,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am speakingwhat return was likely to result from it? In other words, in any private business undertaking the expenditure of £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 annually would necessitate the expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 , 0 0 0 in the same period for expert advice and supervision. deal with' public money it seems that its expenditure is to be controlled only by a Department which is confessedly in total ignorance. I am now making no accusation against the officers of the Customs Department. They cannot be expected to possess the necessary expert knowledge upon all these matters, and, therefore, I say that, prior to the voting of this money, we should inaugurate a branch of tropical industry, no matter how modest its dimensions may be. be some system of supervision organized before the money is even allocated, much less expended. As I pointed out on Friday last, the industries, the establishment of which it is proposed to encourage, will have to come into competition with similar industries outside of Australia. In Java, for instance-as Senator Staniforth Smith has pointed out-ther e exists a most highly organised bureau of tropical industries, and the best experts in the world are engaged in teaching the people how to grow and develop the products of those industries. Our own people must come into competition with these coloured people who have not attained the degree of civilization and comfort which we have set up in Australia. We are asked to embark upon an industry without the special knowledge which they possess, and which is provided for them by a Government whose very existence depends upon the encouragement of these tropical enterprises. That being the case, ought we not to do something to insure the 'success of this experiment ? What have we to show for the money which has been expended in the form of bonuses throughout Australia up to the present time? What has Victoria to show for the expenditure which she has incurred in that direction? There is not a Victorian representative in this Parliament who will not acknowledge that, outside of the butter bonus, that expenditure has been absolutely fruitless. If we turn to Queensland, what do we find ? The cotton industry has gone down. For the! past forty years-of f and on-bonuse s have been granted with a view to encourage its establishment, but these have failed in their object because they 6 were allocated in .the same haphazard way that the Minister proposes the money made available under this B ill shall be allocated. In other, words, they have been doled out with a political object, and not for the purpose of benefiting business enterprises But when we come to which have been bond fide entered upon by those engaged in them. That is the outstanding feature in the history of tonuses all over ' Australia. Under this B ill , we are apparently going to repeat the same process, only upon a much more extensive scale. We are told that the Minister and his officers will exercise supervision over the amount of bounty to be distributed from time to time. If we are going to sanction the payment of money for this purpose by all means let us start under the There should most favorable conditions. Let us see, for example, that the kind of cotton grown is the best, and that it is cultivated in the places most suited to its production. And so with the proposals in regard to the production of coffee and milk. Let us see that the environment of those industries is such as will commend itself to those who have had long experience and . possess the most expert knowledge concerning them. That experience and knowledge is available to us; but apparently we are going to make no effort to avail ourselves of it. Of the sum proposed to be appropriated under this B ill , £ 3 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 , 0 0 0 per annum ought to be expended in obtaining the most expert knowledge that can be secured with regard to these industrial enterprises. The speech made the other day by the honourable member for Echuca appeals strongly to me. The honourable member pointed out that in America -that go-ahead, successful countrya man who has the slightest difficulty in any of these enterprises receives the assistance of an expert who teaches him how to overcome it. The expert teaches him what is the best kind of seed to sow, and how to tend it , and bring it to maturity in the most successful way. Here, nothing of the sort seems to have been thought of. All that we know is that we are on the eve of a general election, and that the Government find it convenient to throw out halfa-million of money 'to the far-back farmers of Australia. So far from helping the farmers of the Commonwealth, if we induce them to enter upon these enterprises, and they f a i l when the bounties terminate, we shall strike a. blow at the best interests . of the country, and do no good to the people we have allured into these industries. Are we going to see that some success shall result from these efforts? I presume that in granting bonuses the intention is that they shall not be a constantlythat the payment of bounties for the esaggregating quantity, extending in perpetuity, but that at some time or other those to whom they are given must be left to make their way in competition with the industrial enterprises of the world. If these industries are to be kept alive by the bounty system, and if , owing to defeca bureau of agriculture on Federal lines tive cultivation or want of the latest and best knowledge concerning them, they are to collapse the moment the bounties cease -and that is the history of the bonus system in Australia-w e shall do a great wrong to the people who will be induced to enter them, and shall do no good to the Commonwealth. All that I ask is that business methods shall be applied to the allocation of these moneys, and the inspection of the industries to which they are devoted. If we are going to pay away this large sum every year, let us see that it is expended under the direction of the best available expert talent. If we expend a proportion of it in acquiring that expert assistance, we shall make a wise beginning, and insure a wise termination to the whole series of experiments about to be made. This is the plea I put to the Minister. mittee whether he or his officers have in mind a plan with this end in view. We might as well throw this large sum into the depths of the sea as distribute it without any guarantee that the best expert knowledge will be available to see that it is well expended. have heard a good deal as to the undesirableness of the Government proceeding with this Bill. We are told by one honourable member that we shall seriously affect the financial position of the Statesi f we expend anything like this sum of £500,000 within the next ten years, and that the proper course is to establish a Federal Bureau of Agriculture. that statement. ber for Dalley did. for Bendigo supported it. the statement made'by the honourable member as to the effect which this expenditure will probably have on the States. Agriculture is provided for under the Constitution. tablishment of industries is not within the province of the Commonwealth. Some of the States had such a system in operation when the Constitution was passed; but the power is now vested in the Commonwealth. I venture to say that the cost of conducting would far exceed the sum proposed to be expended under this Bill. Some honourable members appear to think that this money is to be thrown away in a haphazard fashion. We have been told that it is necessary to educate the farmers before we induce them to embark upon these new enterprises. Having regard to their peculiar conditions, and the state of their finances, the States have done much in the direction of agricultural education. Victoria alone is spending something like .£100,000 per annum on this work. New South Wales is spending even more than that. expenditure is justifiable. I would remind the representatives of New South WalesI ask him to tell the Comwho oppose the bountv system that that State is already granting to those engaged in primary industries bounties in the shape of a large annual expenditure on agricultural education, and also in the form of special rates for the carriage of their produce-rate s below the actual cost. : ber would describe a prospecting vote as a bounty to encourage mining? ber may call it what he pleases, but such a vote is certainly of assistance to the mining industry. The steps taken by the States to so educate the miners as to make them better fitted to prosecute their work, is also of assistance to them. We know as a matter of fact that the Reid-McLean Government sent representatives to the Hobart Conference of Premiers with a proposal, so to speak, "" up their sleeves""-it was a plank in their platform-that a Federal Department of Agriculture should be established. As the result of that Conference, however, the proposal was dropped. State jealousy of the exercise of Federal functions.",37,William Lyne D O Anything To Location Of The Money And To Ascertain All

But, in my. judgment, if there were one reason more than another for which we should seek to establish new industries, it would be provided by the existence of the facts he mentioned, assuming them to be true. The Commonwealth has not yet made provision for the establishment of an educational agricultural Department, and it is not within the bounds of probability that such a Department will be established in the near future. No one appreciates more than I do the advantages which are to be derived from giving to those engaged in primary production the latest scientific information, but, at the present time, the Agricultural Departments of the States are doing all that can be done in that direction, and I think that the Commonwealth, instead of duplicating their work, should take advantage of it, if necessary assisting it by annual grants.

If he has an explanation ready, 1 wonder that he has allowed the afternoon to be wasted. After the discussion which took place on Friday, I expected him to give honourable members information directly the Bill got into Committee in regard to the various questions which were then raised. I have no sympathy with the direct opposition to the measure, which I shall support, and try to make as perfect as possible, although it is not quite as I should like to have it. The Minister asks us to place at his absolute disposal, without any check at all, the sum of £500,000. That is virtually the meaning of the clause, read in conjunction with clause 7. But, as trustees for the public, we have a right to see that expenditure is properly safeguarded, and we should not be fulfilling our obligations to those whom we represent if we did not ask how it is proposed to distribute the bounties. The honourable members for Darling and Moira say that it is reasonable to assume that such and, such things will be done, to which the Minister assented, but why does he not tell us what is to be done. ask him a few questions in regard to this matter. In the first place, what is to be his system of administration? Has he any scheme in his mind ? Who is to supervise the proposed expenditure? Is it to be done by the Customs officials or by the officials of the States Departments? If it is to be done by the latter. I should like to know whether they have been consulted as to the lines to be followed? AndI desire information as to the probable division of duties between Commonwealth and States officials ? To-day the Minister resented very strongly an allusion to a promise made by him to consult the Victorian Minister of Agriculture on a certain matter, saying that he would not consult any State Minister. ister showed resentment when the matter was mentioned. Have the authorities, of the States been consulted in regard to these proposals, and, if so, have they promised to work in harmony with the Commonwealth Government? should know, what are the conditions under which tlie bounties will be paid. It is all very well to say that these are things to be arranged hereafter; but we should have some infoimation before voting the money. Judging from their attitude towards the measure, the Government do not care whether it passes or not. On Friday last the Minister of Trade and Customs left it in charge of a colleague who, although ready to meet the Committee, knew little about the details concerned, and had not the necessary authority to commit the Government in any direction. I was a member of the Victorian Legislature when £-250,000 was voted for the encouragement of agriculture in various ways, and as the greater part of that sum was absolutely wasted, only the bounties for the encouragement of dairying being a success, the experience makes me cautious on this occasion. I deprecate the action of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and others in referring to those who have asked for information in regard to the Bill as being actuated by the desire to waste time and to postpone the passing of the measure. Tf the Government had given honourable members a fair statement of their intentions in regard fo the measure it would have been passed without trouble. Nine out of every ten honourable members are in favour of the Bill, and yet we have been discussing I should like to it for several days, because of the crude, unprepared manner in which its proposals have been submitted to us.

Honourable members should be informed as to the conditions under which the bonuses will be paid, what precautions will be taken against fraud, and so on. that in South Australia a large sum was paid by way of butter bonus in respect of butter made from cream brought over from Victoria. Something of the same kind will happen under the B ill unless reasonable precautions are taken.

To my mind, that is a good reason why we should do something to assist those engaged in it to make it remunerative, so that they will not destroy the plantations which are already in existence. In the case of olives, if new plantations were laid out some time must necessarily elapse before the trees would come into f u l l bearing. I am inclined to think that we should be acting wisely if we offered a larger inducement to those persons who lay out new plantations than we offer to those who have alreadv established plantations.

I should like to prevent H o w long will it take to that sort of thing.

We are here to help them to push on with business, but they do not promote that object when they begin hurling across the Chamber accusations in reference to criticism that has been offered. I am not yet quite satisfied with the Minister'sexplanation. It is clear that he has in mind the idea of almost solely employing the various States Departments of Agriculture in connection with this B ill . The question arises whether they have the requisite expert knowledge of these matters. I do .not suggest that a Central Bureau of Agriculture should be established at this stage, or in connection with this B ill . That does not appear to be necessary; but the Minister should satisfy himself that we have the requisite expert knowledge to wisely direct the operations of tural experts in Queensland. those who embark upon these industries. orable member think that the authorities of ties, and probably another £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 will the Wagga experimental farm could give be spent by those who enter upon the inus some useful information? know all about the production of olives. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And perhaps they could give us information with regard to other matters. several instances where the requisite knowledge was not available, with the result that serious consequences accrued. I remember that when we started a tobacco plantation in New South Wales we obtained from America an expert, to whom we paid a high (Parramatta) salary, and that eventually, when the tobacco leafwas produced, we had some of it made up. When Minister of Agriculture I had a box of this tobacco in my room, and handed specimen plugs to members and others who called on me; but I never of it. That was the result of our experiments in tobacco-growing in New South Wales. If we are going to do something similar in connection with the industries to be encouraged under the B ill , this monev will be thrown away. We need to have expert advice available before these operations are commenced. Similarly, if a bounty is to be given for the production of rubber, we must have an expert to direct operations who will know the best kinds of trees to plant, how lo cultivate them, how to tap them, and all I did not intend to the other details of the industry. Not only is it necessary that the individuals who engage in these enterprises shall be furnished with information as to the best way in which to conduct them, because if they f a i l it will mean ruin, but the Government will also be interested in insuring success, because failure will mean a blow to the whole bounty system. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will see that the best expert knowledge is available, and that opportunities are given whereby it may be made use of It seems to me likely that the Queensland Agricultural Department has specialized in regard to a number of the productions mentioned in the schedule. The Queensland Government, for example, pays an expert £ 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year to advise in connection with the cultivation of sugar-cane. dustries which are to be encouraged.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.1] I think that the course that will be adopted under this clause, and which will be in accordance with the law, is that we shall require those engaged in any industry in respect of which a bounty is paid to receive the standard rate of wages prevailing in the district or place in which the goods are grown or produced. It may be that in Tasmania the standard wage is. lower than that paid in Queensland, but the clause does not provide for an average wage to be paid all over Australia. The grower or producer claiming bounty will have to pay the standard rates of wages in the district in which the goods are grown or produced. seems to me that under this clause producers residing in districts where high wages naturally obtain, will not be able to obtain such a profit as will be secured by those .. . ... ... 32 carrying on operations in districts where ... ... ... 7 low wages are paid..

There is thus a large vacuum which requires to be filled up. In 1.904 the importations of rubber manufactures, including crude rubber, were valued at £100,389, and in 1905 at £102,983, whereas the importations of rubber manufactures, n.e.i., in those years were valued at £100,275 and £1.29.482 respectively. I should like some definite information regarding the intended destination of the bounty upon olive oil. I hope that it is not intended that it shall pass into the pockets of the rich growers and manufacturers who are alreadv established and in the enjoyment of the proceeds of a lucrative industrv. to urge against the payment of the bountv, so long as it is limited to the I do not think there is any production of new olive trees. But it is distinctly objectionable to put a bonus into the pockets of persons who have never asked for it, and who do not want it.

We found that it was well established, and that it produced a splendid article.

Thos. Hardy and Sons Ltd., the Waverley Vinegar Company, the Stoneyfell Olive Company Ltd., and Messrs. W. P. Auld and Sons. We were informed that the Stoneyfell Company have 100 acres under olive cultivation, and that Sir Samuel Davenport had about fifty or sixty acres; also, that there were a great number of small gardens, of five or six acres. We were further told that the capital invested in the industrv in South Australia was between ,£50,000 and ,£60,000, and that I find that during 1905 the the total output of olive oil from the existing plantations was from 20,000 to 25,000 gallons per annum. The wholesale price realized for that product is from 8s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. per gallon, the imported article commanding only 6s. 6d. per gallon. According to the present output, therefore, I estimate the value pf the total production of olive oil in South Australia at about .£10,000 annually. The gentlemen who are engaged in this industry, I think, would merely laugh up their sleeves if this bounty were forced upon them. Whilst strong arguments may be urged in favour of extending the industry and of encouraging the planting of fresh plantations, it is not necessary to offer a bonus to Sir Samuel Davenport and the other gentlemen who are engaged in this trade, who are well established, and who really enjoy a monopoly of I have no obiection the olive oil production of the Commonwealth.

424,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [8.47],"representations which I have .made, and I would urge that in the regulations which he frames he should limit the payment of the bounty to olive oil which is the product of new plantations. very great pleasure in supporting the contention put forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. He has come to this Committee fresh from Tariff investigation, and is well supplied with information derived from those who are engaged in the olive oil industry. He tells us that the value of their output is about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Yet we are asked to sanction the annual payment of a bounty of £ 6 , 5 0 0 to persons who do not require it. Earlier in the debate we were informed that the olive plantations which formerly existed at Mildura had been allowed to pass out of cultivation, and that fhe trade in olive oil had drifted to South Australia. I have often heard the expression in reference lo greasing the fat pig, but it seems to me that under the proposal of the Minister we are realling oiling the fat pig. Personally, I am opposed to the system of bounties, because I recognise the evils which are inherent in it. Every honourable member who supports the proposals contained in this Bill has to urge some excuse for his attitude. The honourable and learned member for Bendigp has emphasized the need for limiting the bounty to the product of new plantations. As a consumer of olive oil, I know that my medical advisers assured me that the best oil was that which is produced in South Australia. Sir article. do not recommend the use of Italian oils because they are largely adulterated with cotton seed oil. It is the purity of the South Australian article that causes it to command such a ready sale. I trust that the Minister will agree to the elimination of this item, and' thus save to the Commonwealth £ 6 , 5 0 0 annually. ment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that the bounty should not be paid to a large corporation does not weigh with me in the slightest degree. The only point upon which I have to be satisfied is whether the industry requires the assistance proposed to be extended to it . I cannot differentiate between a large companv and a small company, or between a large company and a private individual. rise to champion the payment of a bounty upon the production of olive oil, but I wish the Committee to be very careful in what they are doing. If we strike out the item under consideration, it will be necessary to strike out the proposals of the Government in regard to other oils. For example, I amassured that linseed oil is used for the adulteration of olive oil. This is. a question which ought not be to hurriedlydecided merely upon the ground that the olive oil industry is paying in South Australia, because it is proposed to subsidize another industry which will detrimentally affect the olive oil industry, and which is already established. I suggest that the Minister should obtain further information before agreeing to strike out this item. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I will not agree to strike it out. I agree with the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that it is not necessary to offer a bounty for the manufacture of olive oil. A t the same time, it is necessary that more olives should be produced than are at present grown in the Commonwealth. I would point out ""to the honourable member for Grey that the other oils which are enumerated in the schedule do not compete with olive oil. As has al ready been stated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, the olive oil which is imported is sold at a much cheaper rate than is the South Australian article, because the former is largely adulterated with cotton seed o i l. We are legislating in this Parliament against adulteration, and the JOHN QUICK -It is a first-rate States Parliaments are taking similar action. A Bill is soon to be brought 'before the South Australian Parliament which will prevent the importation of oil of the characterreferred to by the honourable member. Thepoint is that ""the public believe that they are buying pure olive oil, when in reality, they are buying cotton-seed oil. The difficulty is one that may readily be overcome..

Clause7 gives the Minister a discretionary power to vary the amounts in the fourth column of the schedule, and it will enable him to deal with cases of the kind to which reference has been made. Whilst there is much force in the views put forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I feel that the question is one upon which we should not arrive at a hasty decision. It may be that the Minister may see fit to grant the bounty to those who have already been growing olives, but who plant anew. There are many parts of the Commonwealth other than South Australia, where it may be desirable to encourage the industry, and, since the Minister has the discretionary power to which I have referred, I think that we should allow this item to remain in the schedule. move That the item "" Cocoa left out. The Minister has given the Committee certain information in regard to the importations of cocoa, and the conditions under which it can be produced, but, to my mind, it is not sufficient to justify us in voting for the proposed bounty, and, as I find that I am debarred by the Standing Orders from moving to refer the schedule to a Select Committee, I propose that the item be struck out.

It is difficult to diffierentiate between the merits of the proposals for bounties in connection with cocoa, coffee, chicory, and many other items, and for that reason I voted against the omission of cocoa. Eventually, I hope that an opportunity will be given to deal with the schedule as a whole, so that we may apply the same policy to all the items, and either accept or reject them. [JO.27] I understood that the proposal was to give bounties to encourage the establishment of new industries; but it is clear that the coffee industry is already established in Australia, and, therefore, I am not going to allow the general public to be robbed for the benefit of coffee growers. taken from a person without a fair return being made to him, that is robbery.

I am here to fight in the interests of the public, and to prevent their money from being given to coffee growers and others who are profitably engaged. The Prime Minister, when on the public platform, talks about trying to help the primary industries, but he makes no effort [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bounties Bill. to do so when in this Chamber. I think that it is an outrage that we should be asked 'to take money out of the pockets of °t the people of Australia and give it to the coffee-growers of Queensland.

My object has always been to make the conditions of life as comfortable as possible, and I do not believe in employing white children in tropical industries. Let those who talk about their love of humanity give practical expression to their principles, instead of making it harder for the poor by imposing taxes upon them, in order to foster black labour industries in Queensland. I could understand the proposals in the Bill being supported by those who believe in injuring the great bulk of the community for the benefit of the few, but I cannot conceive of free-traders giving any countenance fo the scheme now under consideration. There is already a duty of 5d. per lb. upon roasted coffee, and or 3d. per .lb. upon raw coffee.

Although, the honourable member has cast some reflections upon Queensland, I would point out that the representatives of that State have not asked for the measure now before us, and do not desire to derive any benefits, other than those which may be conferred in an equal degree upon other States. No reflection should be cast upon Queensland because she is successfully developing tropical industries by means of white labour. whole Commonwealth. gramme of the honourable member, as an exponent of free-trade principles, to slander the white people of Australia who earn their living by producing tropical commodities? The honourable member should be careful not to make statements without authority or knowledge, and he certainly should not make wild charges against men who will not receive more than a fair share of the benefits proposed to be conferred by the Bill. I do not intend to say one word against those men who have gone into the tropics to make their homes there. They have my utmost sympathy, and I would do everything I reasonably could to assist them. The position which I wish to put is that there is already a duty of 3d. per lb. upon raw coffee, which is equivalent to 60 per cent. I have always been prepared to give our local industries a fair chance, but I think honourable members will recognise that a 60 per cent, duty upon an article of food which enters into general consumption is a fairly stiff protective impost. the duty of £ 1 4 per ton upon jam ? jam does not nearly represent a duty of 60 per cent. jam? member will assist me to reduce the duty upon sugar by one half, I am quite prepared to vote for the abolition of the impost upon jam. For all practical purposes we are asked to grant this bounty to men who have never asked for it. Herbert says that the industry in Queensland is in a languishing condition. case, it is clear that a 60 per cent, duty will not enable coffee to be grown successfully in Australia, and if that be so, it is time that this Parliament refused to recognise the industry. It is not suggested that every grower of coffee throughout the Commonwealth hopes to derive assistance from the proposed bounty. How many individuals will be benefited by it? I repeat that if the industrv cannot compete successfully with the aid of a 60 per cent, duty, any bounty which we may extend to it will be simply thrown away. It seems to me that the men who are already engaged in coffee cultivation are the only individuals who will be benefited by the payment of this bounty. The whole object of the Bill appears to be either to make a free gift to men who have already established an industry, and who have made a success of it, or to bolster up an enterprise which is languishing, notwithstanding the operation of a high duty. I shall vote in favour of excising the item.

WhatI said was that coffee was evidently a tropical product, which could not be successfully grown by means of white labour-in other words, that the industry could not afford to pay white men's wages. If it is to be carried on by means of white labour, the cost involved will inevitably f a l l upon the Commonwealth, as was the case in connection with the sugar industry. I object to the establishment of black labour industries at the expense of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Wide Bay implied that I did not know anything about this question. I may inform him that when I visited a coffee plantation in Queensland I had a long conversation with the manager, who informed me that it was impossible to pay white men's wages to the persons employed in picking the coffee beans. When this statement was made. I inferred that it would be necessary to employ women and children to pick the berries. I do not wish to see women and children enter upon such work, but it is only in that way that the industry could be established. Industries which cannot stand, as it were, on their own feet must be assisted by means of cheap labour. I am opposed to any proposal which will increase the burdens of the Commonwealth for the encouragement of industries that cannot live except by the employment of cheap labour. Some of the representatives of Queensland will, of course, vote for this item', although they cannot believe that j t will be of any value. Their sole desire, apparently, is to get a dip into the Commonwealth purse. honourable member for New England said under this B ill , the risk is one that we may that coffee could not be profitably grown well incur. in Queensland except by black labour.

His plantation will thoroughly test the question whether cotton can be profitably produced in Australia, and the efforts he is making in this direction are very creditable to him. Some time ago an article appeared in one of the periodicals on the production of cotton in various parts of the world, and was copied in several of the newspapers. According to the writer, the great manufacturers of Manchester and other large manufacturing centres in England having been scared, first by threatened complications between the United States and England in connection with the Canadian fisheries, and, later, by an attempt to increase prices by creating a corner, subscribed an enormous capital for the establishment of cotton plantations in EgvDt, West Africa, and parts of India. Some of the cotton grown in India is of excellent quality, while that grown in Egypt is said to be superfine. English manufacturers are now wisely endeavouring to protect their own interests by preventing a cotton famine arising should war break out with the United States, or a corner be made to unduly force up prices. In the countries I have mentioned, there is the very.cheapest labour in the world; and we must agree that if the consumption of cotton were confined to the requirements of the Australian market, the quantity would be so small as to make it scarcely worthwhile our attempting to establish the industry. of time large factories were established, and we were enabled to turn our own raw material into the finished article, and compete with the greatest factories in the world, the production here would still be limited. We must grow largely for the markets of the world, and, considering the labour conditions in Australia to-day, and the wages which we hope will be paid, and which must be paid under this Bill, it would be impossible to compete with the cheap labour of India, West Africa. Egypt, and that of the cotton-growing districts of the southern States of America. A fair effort is beinar made to start the industry without a bonus, aind, believing, as I do, that no matter what bonus we give, the industry in AusVarious attempts tralia can never compete with the industrv in the countries of cheap labour, I contend that, in voting this money, we shall only be throwing it away. To vote half a million of money for the purposes contemplated in the Bill may seem a trifle to some honourable members, but I am sure the taxpayers of the country will regard the matter in a very different light. £11.15] -Her e is another proposal to grant a bonus .to an established industry. We know that < cotton ca,n be grown successfully in Queensland, because Dr. Thbmatis has informed us that he was offered isd. per lb. for his cotton, while prices for American cotton were 7d. and 8|d.. In the face of this fact, it would be absurd to vote a bounty; we should hesitate to dispose of the people's money in this unjustifiable way. To me it appears an absolute wrong to vote a bounty for industries which have already been established without assistance, and particularly for the cotton industrv, when such a price as I have mentioned can be obtained for our product. I do not know why these proposals are being forced through at the present moment; but the great bulk of the industries affected appear to be tropical industries. We know that the production of sugar by white labour has already cost the Commonwealth a large sum of money; and I do not see why we should endeavour to establish these tropical industries at such a cost to the community as a whole. I can understand Queensland representatives doing their best to promote these bounties; but I do not think that the policy is right or Even if in course fair. I have already expressed my opinion as to what is the real object of the B ill ; and I protest as strongly as I can against this expenditure. I am quite certain that honourable members would not devote their own money to such purposes; and, as a matter of fact, they ought to be more careful' about public money. In this instance they are deliberately doing a wrong. I shall take care that my electors, and the country generally, know that I have strongly protested against this deliberate waste of money; some of these bounties are really a pure gift to those engaged in industries alreadv established.

He will see himself that, although we could never for a moment doubt his wisdom in administering a measure of this kind, it is more than probable that he will not be here to administer it next session. I do not wish to touch upon a matter which must be painful' to him, but will content myself with asking him whether, in view of the representations that have been made, he will assure the Committee that he will allocate the £6,000 amongst the various fibres in such! a way that the growers of no particular kind of fibre will obtain the benefit of the whole amount.

517,Mr Kelly,"If there is going to betation of a trawler before we consent to the item of a fish bounty. thankful to the honourable member for Wentworth for drawing the attention of the Committee to the fact that in an early part of this sitting the Minister of Trade and Customs said that a trawler would have to be imported. About ten days ago, we voted on the Works Estimates a sum of £ 8 , 0 0 0 for the purchase of a trawler,' which the Minister said was required for carrying out a scheme in connection with the deep-s&a fishing industry of Australia. I , a free-trader, asked the Minister of Home Affairs, who was in charge of the Estimates at the time, whether it was intended to have the trawler built in Australia, and the Prime Minister interjected, "" O h , yes; this boat will be built in Australia."" of the machinery necessary to carry out the search for the fish in .respect of which we are asked to vote a bounty. Surely it will be built here? a special justification for offering opposition to this item in a statement which the Minister of Trade and Customs made here this evening. thing for this country that a large number of what purported to be French tinned sardines, which were sold to the public, were young mullet or other fish obtained in Australian waters, thereby proving not only that the tinned fish industry was thoroughly established, but that it was really ousting imported sardines from tlie country. According to the Minister's statement, a deliberate deception is being practised upon the public, and he applauds this trade deception. a. bounty for the purpose of enabling Australian pirates to foist Australian mullet upon the confiding public as French sardines. If there were any sardines in Australian waters, this proposal might be justifiable from the point of view of those who believe in taking public money for the purpose of encouraging private ventures. But in this case it is proposed to appropriate public money for the purpose of enabling a set of pirates to foist their wares upon an unsuspecting commtmity as imported sardines. talk in which the Minister of Trade and Customs and his colleagues have indulged regarding the necessity for protecting the public from imposition, it is astonishing that we should find him advocating a gross fraud of this character. I wish to move That the item "" Fish"" be left out. [11.52] I cannot see how the tinned-fisb industry is to be benefited by the payment of the proposed bountv. The annual production per head of those employed in some of these industries is very small. The product of the fishing industry in Italy is valued at £7,000,000 , but 1,000,000 persons are engaged in it. It is, therefore, worth about £ 7 per head. Under the circumstances, I claim that the proposed' bounty to such an industry will be of no assistance whatever, and, consequently, I shall vote against the item. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [11.53]I recognise that very great difficulty will I understand that it will be part be experienced in thfallocation of these bounties. Therefore, I should like to know from the Minister whether the tinning industry is to get the whole of the bounty payable upon the production of tinned fish, in it. Personally I should like to see the latter obtain the lion's share. There is no other industry in which the individual who is called upon to perform all the hard He-said it was a very good work receives such a poor reward as does the fisherman. Therefore, I should like the Minister to explain whether he is to obtain a share of this bounty ? caught only one fish, how could he share in the bounty? ning industry to absorb the whole of it? Sir WILLIAM LYNE No . The fisherman will receive a reasonable share of the bountv, but not in the stupid way in which, We are now asked to vote the honourable member has endeavoured i o put the position. the Minister has uttered is stupid.

In the southern parts of the Commonwealth the chief fish caught are barracouta, trumpeter, and jew fish. We have not a class of fish which is .suitable for canning for export. At the present time there is a duty of a id. per lb. upon canned fish. Under the operation of that duty canned-fish industries were established at Port Fairy and Warrnambool, but owing to the fact that the fish procurable were not of a suitable character, and because the demand for them was insufficient, those industries have perished. The same thing occurred in Tasmania. At Jd. per lb. the bounty proposed would cover an annual production of 5,280,000 lbs. of fish. I think that is too much. If a bounty is to be paid, the amount should be reduced, and, if necessary, an increase may be made later on. I think that the item should be. reduced by £6,000. reSuce it by ,£2,000.

Private companies are malking a success of the condensed milk industry in New Zealand, and it should be possible to carry on the industry here without assistance. As a matter of fact, it is already being carried on by private companies who are satisfied with their prospects apart from the proposed bounty. That is shown by the action of a private company in buying out a co-operative factory in the Western District. It is a public scandal that we should be asked to take action which will bring into existence iniquities similar to those perpetrated some years ago when the Victorian Parliament voted bounties to encourage the dairying industry, and the money which was intended to aid the farmers and primary producers went into the hands of the export agents. This scandal was exposed, and honourable members must be familiar with the facts. But similar evils will arise if we give a bounty for the production of sweetened condensed and powdered milk. The money will go, not to the farmers, but to the manufacturers and the agents. ber know what the machinery for making powdered milk costs? is not very much; but no farmer in the honourable member's district, or in any other district, is likely to manufacture powdered milk. This-is a commodity which will not be made even by co-operative companies. tories in my district which could make sweetened condensed and powdered milk while they have such a good thing in the making of butter and cheese. argument. The making of butter pays better than anything else. Some years ago the Rosebrodk factory commenced to make concentrated milk, and has since been It is not being made there bought out by a private company, which is quite satisfied with its prospects. I strongly urge honourable members not to accept the amendment. They have from time to time spoken against the scandals to which I have referred; but if the proposals of the Ministry are agreed to; similar scandals will arise in the future. [12.20] I desire to point out that this is no longer a question of fiscal principle. In this milk industry, a great factor is sugar, which is already heavily taxed, and therefore tlie industry is labouring under a very great hardship. The question thus becomes one of justice and equity, rather than of fiscal principle. If we tax the' raw material, we must have a countervailing duty to be just, and for that reason alone I feel disposed to vote for this item. I know that already some of these factories are in existence, but I believe most of them are struggling to obtain a footing in the face of the great handicap caused by the imposition on sugar. to meet the combine, so far as I know, is to provide the raw material at as cheap a rate as possible. 'Eut since the raw material of sugar is taxed so very heavily under the Tariff, it is a question whether there should not be some countervailing conditions. Under the circumstances, I feel disposed to vote for the item, if it be taken to a division. There is a good deal to be said for the argument advanced by the honourable member for Parramatta.

558,Mr Brown (Canobolas) [12.23],"a large factor in the preservation of milk, particularly of sweetened condensed milk; and, by reason of the taxation already imposed, the industry is to some extent handicapped. reasons to be advanced in favour of the bonus. In consequence of a visit to a large condensing factory some time ago, I was led to make some investigation, and I was informed by the late proprietor of that factory that he found great difficulty in suitably condensing the milk, and therefore he was not able to place the article oni the market in a condition similar to that of the Swiss production. After considerable experiment, he decided to make a visit to the old country, to ascertain wherein his process was lacking, and he went not only to England, but to Switzerland, at considerable cost. As a result, he came to the conclusion that there is what is known as a trade secret in connection with the preparation of condensed milk on the Continent, and, though he made every endeavour, he found that that secret was not purchasable. He thereupon entered upon a very extensive system of chemical analysis and treatment, with a view to remedying the defects in his production. In this he has succeeded to some extent, and he is now placing a very usable commodity on the market, though he admits that he is still unable to produce a condensed milk in all respects equal to that imported from Switzerland. Some encouragement should, I think, be given to a man who is so public-spirited as to establish here an industry of this importance, so nearly related, as it is, to the large and important interest of dairying. According to the figures presented by fhe Minister for Trade and Customs, there has been imported to Australia during the last two years £391,000 worth of condensed milk, which, as honourable members know, is the only milk available in the mining settlements and many farming centres in the hot country out back. this condensed mil'k industry could -be made financially successful, it would prove a valuable addition to our already fairly extensive dairying industry. Only recently a large consignment of sweetened condensed milk, manufactured in Australia, was prepared for Queensland, and, although every precaution was taken to see that it was properly treated, it was found necessary, owing to some defect not determined, to withdraw the whole from the market, at a considerable loss to the manufacturer. If Mr Brown. means of perfecting the manufacture could be found, it would be worth something to us to have the industry established within our borders; .and I am glad to see that But there are still stronger the Minister is prepared to increase the amount of the bonus. I cannot understand, however, why the Minister seeks to make a difference between the bonus for the production of condensed sweetened milk and fhe bonus for powdered milk. contents. there is a large difference in the milk contents. I am not familiar with the treatment of powdered milk; but, as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, sugar is a very important factor in the treatment of the sweetened variety. I am assured now by another honourable member that sugar does not enter to the same extent into the preparation of powdered milk. According to the information supplied by the Minister, from £1,000 to £5,000 is required to equip a factory for the production of sweetened condensed milk. The machinery necessary for the production of powdered milk can be provided for about ,£200. Therefore, there is a very wide difference between the capital outlay involved in one case as compared with the other, and I do not see that there is any warrant for the proposed increase in the bonus to be offered for powdered milk. Any differentiation between the two commodities should . be in favour of thi? sweetened condensed milk. advantage of the best expert advice in the matter. vernment desire to encourage the production of sweetened condensed milk, but I should like to obtain more definite information with regard to the production of powdered milk before the extra bounty proIf posed is approved of.

581,Mr Wilks,"I voted against every itemsent price the gross income would be £12,900, or over 220 per cent, on the outlay. That is conclusive proof that this industry does not require the aid of a bounty. The countries with which we should have to compete if the industry were established in Australia are-Brazil, West Africa, Central America, Mexico, East Africa, Ceylon, and the Malay States. The world's output of rubber for 1905 was, approximately, 61,000 tons, and Senator Smith states that this yield was apportioned as follows :-From Brazil (including Peru and Caucho), 34,420 tons; from West Africa (including the Congo), 17,500 tons; from Central America and Mexico, 3,200 tons; and from East Africa, Ceylon, Malaya, and all other sources, 6,000 tons. That output, it will be noted, was obtained from countries in which the trees are tapped by black labour. In other words, it is a blacklabour industry. Earlieri n the debate the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that he had seen forests of native rubber trees in Northern Queensland. The point naturally arises as to whether the rubber which is obtained from the native trees is better than that which is produced by trees which have been cultivated. Upon that aspect of the subject, the honourable member for Corangamite delivered a very able address. He stated that the best rubber was obtained from trees which had been cultivated, but I find that Senator Smith entertains the contrary opinion. According to the Minister's own statement, there is no necessity for experiments to be conducted in connection with the rubber industrv. I do not know, therefore, why he should not agree to the omission of the word ""rubber"" from this item, with a view to insert in lieu (thereof ithe word "" shipbuilding."" taken that the annual expenditure shall not exceed £75.000, and if the allocation of these moneys be made on a f r o rata basis, we shall probably have a sum of £ 1 0 , 5 0 0 to devote to this item. be given by way of bounty to an industry that has not yet been established in Australia, and which receives no protection in the shape of Customs duties. All the other items in this schedule are dealt with ih the Tariff. Ship-building is practically a new industry in Australia. Balmain? there. Manly ferry steamers-whic h are iron vessels-were built there. firmly established. When the Tariff was under consideration, I and the honourable member for Parramatta voted for absolute free-trade. I now openly say that I fail to understand why honourable members should be prepared to grant bounties for the encouragement of small industries, having regard to the fact that they refused to grant a bounty for the encouragement of the iron industry. I do not believe in the bounty system, but if there are national industries which we need to assist, they are the iron industry, the ship-building industry, and deep sea fisheries. Ship-building is not governed by climatic conditions. It may be carried on in any port of Australia, and if I succeed in inducing the Committee to decide that the sum ofi £ 1 0 , 5 0 0 shall be devoted to its encouragement, instead of to the encouragement of the rubber industry. I shall certainly have done good work for the Commonwealth. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not think that the amendment is within the scope of the Bill. that point. If honourable members wish to assist the artisans of Australia by granting bounties for the encouragement of industries, they ought certainly to support mv proposal. I do not ask that the industry shall be assisted through the medium of the Tariff. When I find a free-trade member of the Labour Party slipping away from his principles, in order to vote for a bounty on the production of condensed milk, I think that I should be prepared to The Minister has undermake a slip for the sake of the substantial industry of ship-building on in the honourable member's electorate. I ask that that sum shall electorate; but I would remind the Minister that he has been fighting for bounties to encourage industries which, for the most part, must necessarily be confined to one part of Australia. honourable members will sympathize with the view of the honourable member that Australian industry.

A number of the smailer-sized iron vessels have also been built in New South Wales with excellent results so far as workmanship is concerned, although the cost of construction was greater than it would have been had they been constructed in the old country. the ship-builders of Balmain are likely to enthuse over a proposal that £ 7 , 0 0 0 or even £ 1 0 , 5 0 0 shall be distributed by way of bounty"" amongst them. The principal ship-b'uilding company in that suburb of Sydney has a capital of several hundred thousands of pounds, and lately built a steamer for the Manly Ferry Company at a cost of about £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. In these circumstances, the suggestion that they shall participate in this bounty-no t that they shall procure the whole amount-seem s to be so supremely ridiculous that it is not likely to be seriously considered. The best way to encourage shipbuilding would be to .adopt after the elections such a Tariff as would insure to our shipwrights a fair chance of success. But I hope that the sympathies of honourable members with shipbuilders will not cause them to oppose the granting of a bounty for the production of rubber. During the trip which a number of honourable members made to Northern Queensland, we had an opportunity, particularly in the Cairns district, to learn something about the possibilities of the rubber industry, and I came away convinced that, if that industrv were once established, great results would follow.

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [2.1.5]. -The honourable member for Bland defended the proposal to pay a bounty upon the production of rubber upon the ground that those who engaged in the industry would be compelled to wait ten years before they obtained any return.

The honourable member addressed the Committee at considerable length in defence of an industry which is worked by black labour all the world over. in Australia. MrM c WILLIAMS member argued that because those who emhark upon the rubber industry will be obliged to wait a number of years before they can secure any return, this Parliament should authorize the payment of a bounty to them. . In other words, as soon as they begin to obtain a return upon the capital invested they should be granted State assistance. Throughout honourable member would stop "" stonewalling."" MrM c WILLIAMS The impertinent interjection of the Minister will not have the effect of curtailing my remarks. The argument advanced b^ the honourable member for Bland applies with equal force to the frui t industry of Australia. There are men in the Bass electorate who are spending their money in laying out orchards and who will not obtain any material return from their expenditure for seven or eight years. But because the industrv in which they are engaged employs only white labour, they are to receive no assistance from the State.

In America they have faced this problem with great success. The American Continent is something like our own. It has an area of 3,000,000 square miles, of which a great portion is arid country, extending from, the 97th meridian of west longitude westwards for a distance of 500 miles, and from Canada to Mexico, a distance of about 1,100 miles. The demand for land in the United States is as (keen as it is in Victoria, the population of. the country increasing at the rate of over 1,000,000 a year.

' In this way they obtained the Durum wheat, which is .so called because of its hardness, and oats from Algiers, which will also do well in dry country. As the result wheat-growing has been successful under ordinary farming methods at a distance 200 miles further west than the districts in which it has hitherto been attempted. Experts have also searched the world for drought-resisting seeds, and only lately Secretary Wilson, the very able chief of the Agricultural Bureau, is reported in a United States newspaper to have saidWe will not admit we have a bad acre of land in the United States, because for every acre we have got there must be some useful product in some part of the world which will grow there, . and we mean to search and search until we find that product, and have the whole of that country under cultivation.

Sir member is thinking of himself, and of no one else. is a proper remark for the Minister to make. I have stayed all night to help the Government to pass the Bill, and have not hitherto had an opportunity to deal with this matter. The Treasurer has made an unworthy reflection upon one who is actuated only by patriotic motives in his present action. ing speech? nothing but an electioneering appeal. to do with electioneering. Not only have there been experiments with these new varieties of seeds, but experts have been employed to test the quality of the soils and the amount of moisture they contain, to ascertain the rainfall and how far a scant fall is capable of producing a crop. The result is that, by an improved system of cultivation, the invention and tlie introduction of new implements and methods, and the conservation of the moisture, good crops have been produced with a rainfall of 11 and 12 inches. That is a wonderful achievement, and an object lesson from which Australia, more than any other country, may benefit. Professor Campbell has devoted his whole time to this work for the last fourteen years, and the results of his experiments, which I propose to lay before honourable members, are most extraordinary. When I was in DenverI heard a great deal about this dry farming, and for the first time, because in the eastern portions of America:, where there is a rainfall of 30 or 40 inches, that method is not necessary. I ascertained that the nearest experimental farm was at Cheyenne, in Wyoming. I took the opportunity to visit the farm, and found that it was just ready for seeding, under the charge of Mr J. H . Gordon, a very experienced farmer, who had done well himself under irrigation. Mr Gordon is cousin to the late Rev. Mr Gordon, of Brighton, and he took a great deal of trouble to show me the method of operation. , The ground was. being -got ready with good tilth, and was being seeded with all varieties of crops; and by the last American mail, I received a letter from Mr Gordon informing me that, although he had been growing cereals under irrigation for thirty years, and had taken, a gold medal for wheat at the St. Louis JOHN FORREST -The honourable Exhibition, he had never seen a finer crop than that produced under a normal rainfall of 13 inches. The Cheyenne newspaper of 26th July contains a leading article setting forth what has been done, and advising everv one interested in the welfare of the district to visit the farm.

' is going on in Nebraska, where Professor Campbell has been working, and also in the State of Utah, which is one of the dry States of the Union, where, when the whole of the rainfall has been conserved, only about one-tenth of the territory can be irrigated. In 1903, those in charge of the experimental farm in Utah sent a letter . to Governor Heber, suggesting that five experimental dry farms should be formed in that State. The Governor sent the letter oh to the Legislature, which received the suggestion in favour. A Bill was introduced and passed in a very few daysi, and the committee, consisting of ' Dr. Widstoe, Chief of Xogan Experimental Farm, Professor Merrill, .Agronomist. and were appointed to select the sites. These gentlemen acted with expedition, and in less than two months had selected not five, but six sites, which, according to agreement, were fenced by the countyauthorities. The sites were selected in, the driest parts, and embraced every variety of soil, from gravel and sandy dry to fair loam. The soil had had no previous fallowing, but it was placed under a certain system of cultivation, with the result that it produced from twenty down to five bushels of wheat per acre. The report of the experimental station of the Utah Agricultural College states: Soon after the farms had been secured .1 most elaborate soil survey of each farm was made. This was thought ""advisable in view of the important relations which soils sustained to plants, both as regards plant food and capacity for water storage. The detailed report of the soil surveys, which will emphasize many important arid farm principles, will appear in a later bulletin. The following table shows the amounts of gravel, sand, silt, and clay found in the most characteristic soil variety occuring in each farm. Then the percentages of sand, silt, gravel, and clay in the soil of each farm are given. The report goes on to sayThis wide range in the composition of the soils of the farms is very desirable, for it admits of a comparative study of different soils for the purposes of arid farming. It was explained in bulletin No. 75, that as far as could be learned from a study of arid farming in Cache and Boxelder counties, the physical composition of the soil made little or no difference in its power lo yield crops without irrigation. Undoubtedly, however, the plant foods found in a soil, determine, in a measure, the ease with which plants having at 'their disposal a limited amount of water, can accomplish their life cycles. The report also deals with the soil treatment. It is statedIn each instance the county fenced the forty acres selected by the Committee and cleared the ground from sage brush. As soon as the sage brush was removed the ground was ploughed, the instructions being to plough to a depth of ten inches. Some difficulty was experienced in ploughing the ground to the required depth, and on one farm (Washington County) the ploughing was not over five or six inches, but on the remaining farms the ploughing was done quite uniformly to the depth of eight inches. The harrow followed the plough, the ground being harrowed over until the surface soil was loose and fine. In some instances it was found necessary to disk the ground before it could be brought into, the proper state of tilth, but the smoothing harrow always followed the disk. About one half of the plats were summer fallowed during the season of 1904, these plats being kept free of weeds and under constant Senator Whitmore, cultivation, in order to conserve the moisture for use during the season of 1905. Most of these plats were seeded during this f a l l (1904), and the remainder will be seeded early next spring. The results already secured are the products of but one vear's precipitation, and the station workers have never maintained that, with present culture methods, large yields could be secured with but one year's precipitation, but that the rainfall of two or even three years may be necessary for the production of profitable crops. With this condition in mind, it is not surprising that better yields were not secured on the less successful farms, and the marvel is that such satisfactory yields were secured under the existing conditions, even with the best farms. Some of the results obtained with regard to wheat are given as follows :Variety test of fall wheat, Juab and Tooele counties. Juab. Tooele. Variety. _ Bushels. Bushels.

Numerous inquiries have reached us concerning a fal l variety of oats, but we have been unable -to secure such a variety. The"" sixty day "" oats is a Russian variety imported by the United States Department of Agriculture several years ago, especially for the arid region. It is a vigorous but not a rank grower.

Motion negatived. any difficulty about proceeding with my speech at this stage, but for the fact that on last FridayI was informed that the Government would accept tbe amendment. Sir member never heard me say so. then in charge of the Bill. With regard to barley the report statesYields of barley were quite satisfactory for the first year, especially when we take into consideration the fact that we were compelled to use seed from irrigated farms, as we found it impossible to secure varieties from the ""dry"" farms. The yields given then, represent the first year removed from irrigation, and on land recently ploughed, and in which there had-been no opportunity to conserve moisture to an-' appreciable extent. Yield of barley on arid farms :Juab County-California , 34.9 bushels; California prolific, 32.3 bushels; Success, 26.8 bushels. Iron County-California , 10.00 bushels; Manshury, 6.15 bushels. Washington CountyCalifornia, 5.13 bushels. No attempt was made to grow barley on the other three farms this year, but the success of this crop on these farms will warrant us in encouraging its growth on arid lands. The results obtained from drought-resisting rye are given .as follows :Yield of County 14.04 bushels per acre. County-11.5 5 bushels pet acre. At Washington 12 bushels per acre, but as the birds destroyed the yields on the plats, no absolute results can of the best drought resisting cereals, and in localities of limited rainfall one of the crops Emmer, sometimes known as "" Spelz,"" or "" Spiltz,"" is a species of wheat, and has special drought resisting qualities. There is both a f a l l and Spring variety, but the variety grown on these farms was the Spring variety. It is said of Emmer that "" It will produce a fair crop under almost any conditions of soil and climate, but thrives best in a dry prairie region, .with hot summers, where it gives excellent yields."" Emmer is used as a stock feed, and compares well with oats and barley for this purpose. It is eaten readily by allkinds of stock, but it has shown'itself to be especially well adapted to milk cows. The hulls remain attached to the grain after threshing, and this fact renders Emmer less dangerous as a stock feed than wheat. It weighs 38 to 40 lbs. per bushel. It is mentioned, with regard to lucerneLucerne was planted on all of the arid farms, part of the plats being planted in the fall and a part in the Spring; the f a l l planting was a failure whenever tried. The Spring planted plants were all successful; that is, a stand of lucerne was obtained without a single failure on any of the farms. . . . We are assured of a good crop of lucerne next year, and much late in a few years. On many arid farms throughout the State, a good crop of lucerne is secured for hay; the second crop gives a heavy and profitable yield of seed. Lucerne growing, especially lucerne seed production, is a reasonable possibility of the Utah desert. With regard to the experiments conducted with maize, the report statesThe growing of corn on arid lands has been practised for many years in the arid farm districts of the State, and has been regarded feasible even where'other crops were failures. Corn, which permits of intertillage, has come into quite general favour as an arid farm crop, but the fact that a very small amount in corn, either on irrigated or arid farms, is grown in the State, would seem to indicate that this crop is not regarded in the light of a money making crop. Yet, corn can be successfully and profitably grown in this State, either on irrigated or arid lands, but more especially on arid lands. The corn used for seed on these farms had been grown on dry land under the supervision of the station, for three vears, and was in consequence adapted for this test. The yield in Iron County (25.93 bushels of ear corn per acre) was the best yield obtained, but it is thought rye on arid farms :-Juab that with less seed and with more experience in Iron growing the crop, this yield can be materially increased, especially on summer fallowed land.",84,Paiks

I wish to quote the following passage about that fairI t was thought that an exhibit of the actual products of the first year's work on the dry farms at the State Fair would reach a large number of people, and stimulate an interest in the industry, and an exhibit was therefore made. Each of the stations was represented at the fair by samples of the grains, grasses, and miscellaneous crops grown thereon, affording object lessons of the greatest worth to every intelligent farmer who took time to studv the exhibit. The Salt Lake daily papers commented on the exhibit, and of the thousands who visited this section during the week, not one was heard to make an adverse criticism. Many encouraging and helpful suggestions were made, and the sentiment that the State was expending money wisely in this desert reclamation work, was, seemingly, universal. The Deseret Evening News, discussing the exhibit, has this to say :"" One year ago the farms were turned over to the Experiment Station, fenced and ready for the plow. They were covered with sagebush, and iooked as uninviting from the stand-point of as could be imagined.

Mr .SPENCE (Darling) [3.9] -Whilst the idea of the honourable member for Echuca is good in intention, sufficient, in my opinion, is Being done in Australia at present in the direction of experimental farming. The honourable member seemed to be unaware that anything of that nature is ,now being done with cereals and other plants adaptable to Australian conditions. It does not follow because certain crops have succeeded in Utah, that the same plants would grow in Australia. Another consideration is that the rainfall in a particular district is no indication of whether particular crops will grow there. I believe that Australia has a larger area of good soil than has any other country in the world. good soil than has America, where the area is limited, and science has to be applied to poor lands. In the arid -portion of New South Wales we have a magnificent soil to a great depth, and it only needs rain to become productive. WhatI suggest to the Government is that a reward should be offered for the discovery of an invention which would bring down the rain. better to adopt that suggestion than to carrythe Government who can afford to continueout the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca The New South Wales Astronomer told a Commission of which I 1 was a member that the moisture travelled about 400 or 500 miles, generally eastward, every twenty-four hours. He said that there is a sufficient quantity of moisture passing over the continent every day to give an ample rainfall, and that it only remains for science to find a way to bring it down. It is more important to Australia than to any other country that this moisture should be brought down. The Government might very well consider the question of offering a reward, not only for 0 that purpose, but to encourage the invention of a machine for the cutting of. sugar cane and for the eradication of the fruit pest, as'well as the tick. In Australia, we have, within the rainfall limit, a large area of country now unused but suitable for agricultural purposes, to which our attention should be directed before we seriously consider'a proposal of' the kind just submitted. .It would .be absolutely-cruel to ask Bounties Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bounties Bill. a poor man to go into our arid districts and attempt to grow sorghum and other' foddercrops. In New South Wales scores of men. have been ruined through being tempted to go west. In the rainfall districts there are millions of acres of land which are locked 1 up. When we have unlocked these lands near to the coast-and that will take some years-the n it will be time enough to touch the arid districts in the west. Take, for , instance, my electorate. What chance would a farmer have to grow wheat at a distanceof 500 miles from the coast, to pay freight to the seaport, and to compete in the world's market? It would be a hopelessundertaking on his part. Indeed, it would be absolute cruelty to encourage any one to make the experiment. In New South Wales we have carried on many experiments, although, unfortunately, the fact does not seem to be generally known. The honourable member for Echuca/who recently had a most inCertainly, it has far more teresting trip, acquired much information inother countries. Apparently he did not . know of what was being done in Australia in some directions. For some years in New South Wales, the late Mr Farrar experimented in producing a grain which would grow in the drier districts. Suchmen are almost invaluable to a country. In New South Wales, too, we have had somegreat enthusiasts in connection with StateIn my opinion, it would be far experimental farms. Of course, it is only . these experiments, and it is their duty to do so. When it has been proved that in different districts a certain thing can be done, then it will be time enough to encourage settlers to try their hand in that direction. A man might be ruined in experimenting on the lines which have been suggested by the honorable member for Echuca, because,., although the experiment might have succeeded elsewhere, climatic conditions in Australia might militate against it. In thewestern district of New South Wales, for instance, there is an average rainfall of 8 inches. If the rain came in -two falls the district would never be short of grass, but when it comes in a fall of half-an-inch now and again it is of no use for any purpose. In the great wheat-growing districts of California the rainfall is small, comparatively speaking, but it falls at the right time, whereas Australia is specially noted' for the irregularity of its rainfall. In my electorate, for instance, there was an occasion when there was not a drop of rain for seven years. But within eight weeks of itsfall the grass was seven feet high. I do not believe that there is any other district in the world which could produce a similar result. The native grasses grew luxuriantly, and, of course, made magnificent fodder. That shows the quality of the soil. If the rain would only fall in a sufficient quantity once or twice a year anything could be grown in that country. I believe that a means will yet be discovered to make the rain fall when it is wanted, and when that discovery is made there will be no country in the world like Australia. We have richness of soil, though not, of course, to an unlimited depth. It has all the necessary chemical properties, and only wants moisture. If we have been able to bring water from below, surely we shall eventually be able to bring moisture from above. I do not think that, at the present time, we are called upon to expend public money in the way proposed by the honourable member for Echuca. The States are now carrying on experimental farms. New South Wales, for instance, established an experimental farm at Coolibah. on the border of the western district, and Mr Peacock, who is now in charge of the Bathurst experimental farm, did much good work there. Unfortunately, he went there in a ""drought, but he grew a great variety of salt bush, which, I regret to say, is not used for fodder as extensively as it should be. -T n the dry areas of New South Wales to 20 inches. we have had various experiments made, and some of them have been very successcaution f u l Whether they have been carried out the Observatory: The officer in' charge to the same extent as the American experiwritesments I am not prepared to say; but I know that by cultivation Mr Valder, who fiveTheyears quantity of rain recorded during the past, had charge of the experimental farm at forwarded in response to your request received Wagga Wagga, and who is now in South to-day by telephone.

The honourable member for Echuca will agree with me that the bulk of the wheat produced in Victoria is grown within an area which might be defined by a line drawn forty miles north and west of the Dividing Ranee to the Murrav and the South Australian border. Through that area the average rainfall during the past five years has not exceeded 14 inch.es. to obtain the .official figures from at each of the following stations is At Echuca",86,William Lyne Th E Honourable Valuable Data On The Crop Will Doubtless Accumu

Anything which can be done in the direction of imparting to our farmers a higher scientific education than they possess ought to be undertaken, and the honourable member for Echuca is justified in directing attention to the necessity for adopting better methods of cultivation with a view to conserving any moisture which may fall. But I would point out that what is known as "" dry farming "" has been practised in all the older settled northern districts of Victoria for many years, There the system of "" bare fallowing "" has been adopted. I fail to see how the payment of a bounty upon the production of cereals, sorghums, and grasses in our arid areas can be of the slightest possible benefit to our primary producers. proved that they can be produced here. porting the Bill, my desire is to assist in making a commercial success of certain industries in connection with which experiments have been made in Australia. That remark will apply to the production of rice, coffee, and certain other products included in the schedule. A good deal is being done by the States to promote new industries. We have experimental plots scattered all over Victoria,-eve n in the Mallee, where the average annual rainfall is about 8 inches-and experiments are being made to determine whether cereals and grasses can be successfully grown in arid districts. supplies the farmer' with seed wheat. him with manures. The best expert advice is also provided by the State, and the same course is being followed by the Agricultural Department of New S'outh Wales. A Federal Bureau of Agriculture is necessary to collate the information obtained by the States Department. It is true, as has been said by the honourable member for Echuca, that a Victorian farmer cannot be enlightened by the local Department as to what is being done by the agriculturists of other States. Let me relate an experience which befel me some years back. I live within,two hours' drive of one of the best agricultural colleges in the Commonwealth. It is fairly well equipped, and is well controlled by a most enthusiastic body of capable men. In the early days, when I first settled in the northern districts of Victoria, I conceived the idea that it was possible to grow lucerne there. I spent a good deal of money that I could not very well afford to lose in conducting experiments, and ultimatelyproved that lucerne could be successfully grown in the district. On visiting the Dookie Agricultural College, I found that the experts there, like myself and other farmers in the district, had been groping in the dark. It was only by going to the college that I was able to ascertain that fact. Unfortunately, at that time, full de. tails were not published of the work car.ried out by the Council of Agricultural Education of Victoria, an institution which is quite distinct from the Department of Agriculture. We have now got beyond that stage; but if we had a Federal Department which would collect and disseminate the information obtained as the result of experiments by the States Departments, great good would accrue to the farmers. We live too much to ourselves; the farmers have not time to investigate all these matters for themselves, and if the results of the experiments conducted by the States Departments were collected by a Federal bureau, and disseminated amongst the people, inestimable good would accrue to the community. -Ove r twenty years ago, I travelled through Utah, which was visited recently by the honourable member for Echuca, and at that time, the leading men in the country despaired of ever accomplishing in connection with the agricultural industrv, that which has been achieved of recent years. The honourable member has put before the Committee a practical proposal which he has supported by facts that can be readily verified. Shortly after Nevada became a State, its mines worked out, and its population was reduced to such an extent that had it not joined the Union during the great mining boom, it would not have been declared a State; but, as the result of dry farming, its population has increased three-fold during the last seven or eight years. In South Utah, rain sometimes does not fall during a period of five years, and yet, under the dry farming system, wheat can be produced there. These are facts that are worth knowing. There is no doubt that the great drawback to the progress of Australia is that some of her people-lik e other small communitiesthink that they know everything that is worth learning.",88,William Lyne Th E Honourable Valuable Data On The Crop Will Doubtless Accumu

The Minister has been asking the Committee to agree to the payment of bounties to encourage industries which may never be successful, but the proposal of the honourable member for ' Echuca is undoubtedly one that can be carried to a successful issue. Why should the Minister object to the amendment? I have not made more than three speeches during the session, and yet this morning, when I am advocating a system which I know to be an accomplished fact in America, honourable members are impatient. Australia is a mightv continent, almost as large as the United States of America, including Alaska, and dry farming will enable our arid lands to be profitably cultivated. cultivated yet.
