The unsustainable over the course of the next 10 states were of course keen to sign up, years is a lie. If we can dispel that myth and because they saw a seller in distress. They put to bed this argument that somehow the saw a Prime Minister who was desperate to 30 per cent rebate will go into unsustainable get an agreement under her belt, so they took territory over the next 20 or 30 or 40 yearsher for a ride. The states got the extra money, figures projected by Treasury but that which is what they wanted, but they signed frankly cannot be relied upon as they are up essentially to business as usual. So, as presented by the government-then I think happened at a state level when Labor was in the member for Denison will re-examine the control in New South Wales and as is claims made by the government and he will happening in Queensland at the momentreassess his position in this debate. I want to although that is very quickly about to thank all those members who have change-the Labor Party at the federal level contributed, both publicly and in the is seeking to spend more health dollars, not chamber, to this debate, because it is a very on private health and not even on the public important debate. It is about the future of the system but on health bureaucrats. health system in this country. When Kevin So the one crowning achievement of Rudd promised that he was going to fix Labor in health over the course of the last public hospitals-his words, not mine-by four years has been that it has been able to mid 2009, that a revolution was going to take dramatically increase the number of public place and that the federal government would servants in the health department but has not seek a mandate at the 2010 election to take been able to improve health outcomes for control of public hospitals if they were not mums, dads, children, pensioners and older fixed by mid 2009, people actually believed Australians across the country. And that is him. People within his own caucus and the threshold question. People need to ask: people within the Australian public believed 'Is it easier to get into a public hospital? DoI that Labor was serious when it came to have a shorter time to wait with my sick health. child at three or four o'clock in the morning The reason Labor is currently behind in all if I turn up to an emergency department?

She put pen was four years ago?' And the answer to each to paper on an agreement with the states of those questions is no. because she wanted to be able to say to the Australian public: 'I've at least achieved This government has promised so muchprivate health insurance or are not going to not just in the area of health but across all the downgrade their cover, where do the savings public policies it is responsible for-yet it come from?

We do not know what figures to leverage off their own investment into the believe for the purposes of this debate. public sector, where the taxpayer will be Yesterday the minister was out saying that picking up every dollar of expenditure 100,000 people might drop out, or 85,000, or regardless of that individual's income? the figure of 37,000 that they used before.

It they would not do what they are seeking to tries to make us believe, and has said to the do today. Look at the fact that then Minister crossbenchers in this parliament-I think Roxon said to this parliament and looked the quite mischievously-that somehow we as a Australian people in the eye and said that the country cannot afford our expenditure on the Labor Party would not introduce these 30 per cent rebate and that therefore the changes, yet today it seeks to do so.

They promised to am, with no other option but to vote this bill cut waiting lists, and they have failed down. This government has betrayed the dismally.

Over aluminium jobs, what was the Prime the four years of Labor, headline inflation Minister's response? 'Well, we've got a $3½ has averaged 2.9 per cent. Under the billion fund.' The bottom line is that the only coalition it averaged 2.4 per cent. More way to create jobs is to have prosperity.

February 2012 being as follows: Thursday, 9 February 2012 Paid Parental Leave sitting day back after the Christmas break, there was an item scheduled for debate to deal with administrative changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme. The opposition signalled that what we aimed to do is not only support those amendments that the government has brought forward, which take account of circumstances and experience that has arisen since the introduction of the scheme, but also move some additional amendments that give employers big and small the option of not being an unpaid pay clerk for the Commonwealth. As it currently stands the Commonwealth insists upon all employers, big and small-whether or not they have the capacity or the willingness and whether or not they are even able to make the changes within their systems-handling the money on behalf of the Commonwealth as a go-between between the taxpayer funding and the eligible recipient. This is just needless, unnecessary and unwanted red tape. Small businesses are time poor. They do not need to carry the additional administrative burden for no good reason. There is no public policy justification whatsoever for imposing this additional regulatory and compliance cost on small business. So it was a very simple, practical and, I think, extraordinarily well supported measure, if I can go by the statements from small businesses around Australia and the small business community. But what happened? This legislative amendment has gone into the Bermuda Triangle! It has just disappeared. It has just gone. People are looking there thinking, 'Where's it gone? It was on the Notice Paper.' It has not been seen since. It has escaped. It is like the Ronald Biggs of parliamentary reform! It has just gone and no-one knows where it has gone. My concern is that I suspect it has been withdrawn from the business agenda for the House of Representatives because the government knows its position is indefensible. It knows any fair-minded person can see there is no upside and no public policy justification for an additional red-tape burden, particularly on small business. Our amendment basically says that, if the government wants to outsource that pay clerk function, it should have the consent of the employer and the eligible recipient. I accept there are some companies who do not care. I know Sony came out last time we raised this measure, saying they were perfectly happy with it. They have probably got more staff in their pay office than most small businesses in a country town have in total. That is fine for them. They are in a position to handle that payment. In fact, they already had an employer funded payment that they were just going to top up with the Commonwealth's money. But small businesses are not in that situation. They do not have that expensive infrastructure just sitting there ready to do one extra task. I call on the government to bring this legislation forward and give small business some comfort that the government understands the pressure they are under.

(Time expired) Holt Electorate: 2011 Community Spirit and Leadership Awards year I had the honour to acknowledge 46 outstanding young students at the 2011 Holt Community Spirit and Leadership Awards Ceremony. The Holt Community Spirit and Leadership Awards have been held for 10 years. I created them because I wanted to bring our community together to tell the great stories of our young people and to celebrate the fact that our community is a great place to live, to work and to raise a family. Award winners are nominated by their school and receive a framed certificate and gift voucher. On the evening of 5 DecemberI was able to acknowledge the students for their contribution and the hard work and dedication they have shown in their schools and our local community. The testimonials from the schools are absolutely outstanding. I want to read their names into the parliamentary record. There are 46 of them: Jessica Bowler, Cameron Hawkins, Samantha Chapman, Duygu Ozturk, Zoja Kovacs, Amber O'Donnell, Melissa Vorster, Mitchell Caddaye, Jason Henshall, Javiera Lizana-Rivas, Jacinta Watts, Adam Keating, Tiara Fernandez, Andrew Leime, Slone Sudiro, Skye Thompson, Shani Jones, Puoch Puoch, Ben Hill, Natasha Rallis, Damon Weeks, Charlotte Capper, Dalina Nath, Mitchell Hunt, Ashleigh McDonnell, Kelly Lenehan, James Cole-Sinclair, Shaylah Portelli-Moore, Jasmine Sadler, Abbey Smith, Lauren Alley, Katie Hopcraft, Sarah Castricum, Dilushi Premathlaka, Brandon Knowles, Tiger Chatzis, Lydia Paull, Eid Yusofi, Shohana Akbar, James Toskov, Tony Yalda, Damien Ruttun, Kyle Fernandes, Brittany Hay, Cayne Tagliaferro, Helani Jayawardhana and Caitlin Bibby. That is a long list of names. One of the incredible things when, as a member of parliament, you are presenting awards of this type is listening to the stories of our young people. One of the young people who was mentioned in these awards raised $3,000 and shaved his head in order to raise money to provide treatment for women with leukaemia. There are so many incidents and so many stories of young people making an active contribution to their community. Down our way, if something bad happens in our community it appears on the front page of the papers, be it speeding or other sorts of things that occur. But when great stories about people, such as the 46 people whose names I have read out, and their contribution to the community are put forward they are very rarely reported in the national or broader local media. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, good news that enhances a community is hard to get up, but I will continue to do so until people understand what a great bunch of kids we have in our area.

Emeritus Professor Brian Fletcher, from Eastwood, was awarded an OAM for his services to education in the field of Australian history. As an academic, researcher and author, Professor Fletcher served as the Bicentennial Chair of Australian History at the University of Sydney from 1987 to 1999. He has authored 10 books and, in 2007, was awarded the annual History Citation by the History Council of New South Wales. Professor Fletcher is also an active member of St Alban‘s Church in Epping, just down the road from my electorate office. Mr Bruce Walton, from Carlingford, was awarded the Australian Fire Service Medal. Mr Walton has served the North Rocks Brigade of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service for nearly 40 years in a variety of positions. He is currently the Deputy Group Captain of the Hills District. He has worked extensively in the Rural Fire Service Critical Response Incident Support Group and, in 2005, he represented the Rural Fire Service at the World Congress on Trauma and Coping in the United States. Mrs Suzanne Ward, a previous recipient of an OAM, was awarded the title of 2012 City of Ryde Citizen of the Year, following decades of dedication to and tireless efforts for her family and local community, carrying the respect and admiration of all who know her. Many years ago Mrs Ward and her husband, Terry, adopted five babies with various physical and intellectual disabilities, including epilepsy, spina bifida and Asperger‘s syndrome. They raised those children, who are now all aged in their 40s, to become self-supporting, independent and productive members of our community, including gaining success in gymnastics at the Special Olympics and state representation in basketball, as well as in swimming, sailing and water polo. Their children‘s achievements are a real credit to the commitment, hard work and love that Mr and Mrs Ward have given. Mrs Ward has been an active fundraiser for a range of local charities and has given many hours to local special schools and youth clubs.

And it is in this spirit of solidarity that I rise today on behalf of my constituents to express support for the people out in western Queensland, in places like Roma and Mitchell, who have been hit by floods in the last week. Earlier this week the mayor of the Maranoa Regional Council, Robert Loughnan, contacted me. He knew that I had a bit of an idea of what he was going through with his community. He outlined to me the destruction that has just occurred in Mitchell. Seventy-five per cent of the town's structures were inundated by water.

179,Mr Rudd (Griffith,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (09:39): It is well known that myputs it, the departure of one or two small businesses in a small town is a serious matter; however, the loss of 10 or 15 businesses in a town like Mitchell will alter the social fabric of an entire region. We talked about the destruction, we talked about the clean-up and most importantly we talked about how you make sure all this does not happen again and how you make sure that the infrastructure stands up to the test at times when we are seeing record-breaking floods. A levee around the evacuation centre has been discussed and is worthy of investigation; in fact, it is worthy of action. Having spoken to the member for Maranoa about this, it is important that all levels of government combine to make sure that proper protections are put in place for the future in communities like Mitchell which, I am advised, have not been so affected to such an order of magnitude before. But something big is happening out in that part of Australia in terms of unprecedented flood levels. The mayor also informed me that there was a need for approximately $130 million of work on the regional road network as a result of previous floods, coupled with unprecedented usage of our rural road network by ever-expanding gas corporations. I started by saying that I am here to express solidarity with the people of my electorate, with the people experiencing devastating events right now. I acknowledge the work of all local, state and federal members dealing with the current flood challenge in western Queensland-in particular, my colleague the member for Maranoa, in working with his local community-and if there were to be any one of us going through this I would hope that other members would express their support for constituents going through this at this time as well. Water electorate have banded together and will descend upon Canberra this month to champion their fight for a sensible outcome in the water debate. It is now more than halfway through the consultation period for the Murray-Darling Basin draft. People in regional communities are desperately worried about whether they have a future, and whether the government even cares. Helen Dalton from Binya is organising a group called Women for a Living Basin, the members of which are all passionate that a triple-bottom-line approach is adopted in any decisions made about the Murray-Darling system and the people whose lives depend upon it. Women for a Living Basin will be in Parliament House on Wednesday, 29 February, and meetings have been arranged with people who can make a real difference to the water issue. I am pleased that the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has agreed to see the group. I hope he listens to and takes on board what they will tell him. He was in Griffith, as was the opposition leader, for the community rally on 15 December last year when 12,000 proud locals turned out to air their deep, warranted and united concerns about the latest draft. It was people power at its best, and I was so proud that so many attended in support of their communities, their livelihoods and their children's futures. Women for a Living Basin also includes Brigitte Bode from Merungle Hill; Debbie Buller from Griffith, who is also the president of the Murrumbidgee Valley Food and Fibre Association Inc.; Shona Hando from Coleambally and Virginia Tropeano from Hanwood, as well as many others.

The offer is open to all members of parliament and senators to meet with and, more importantly, listen to the Women for a Living Basin and hear their concerns. Invitations have been sent. These women feel that it is now or never and that they need to be in there fighting before decisions are made which will permanently affect their communities. Isaacs Electorate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:45): I rise to speak about the Victorian Liberal government's intention to increase public housing rent for pensioners and also about recent Australia Day and Vietnamese New Year celebrations in my electorate. In 2009, the federal Labor government implemented historic reforms to the pension system to help Australian pensioners with cost-of-living pressures. For the 23,900 pensioners living in my electorate, this was fantastic news. Since September 2009, the government's reforms have delivered increases to the maximum pension rate of about $148 per fortnight for singles and $146 per fortnight for couples, combined. At the time of these important Labor reforms, all states and territories rightly agreed to quarantine this pension increase from rent calculations to assist pensioners to make ends meet. This protection for pensioners has been ripped away by the Baillieu government, which has revoked the Victorian government commitment and is trying to extract an extra $10 per week from the most vulnerable in our community. This came as a great shock to my constituent Anton Bennett, who could not understand why the Baillieu government would deliver this hit to pensioners. While I share Anton's dismay, pensioners in my electorate should not be surprised by the Baillieu government's contempt for Victorians. This is a Liberal government that has already cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the state education budget, slashed VCAL funding and cut the Take a Break program, and it now has vulnerable pensioners in its sights. While state Liberal MPs Lorraine Wreford, Donna Bauer and Inga Peulich have been silent on the damaging cuts to education, this recent blow to pensioners serves as a perfect opportunity for them to stand up for their constituents and demand that Mr Baillieu reinstate the agreement to quarantine the federal Labor government's 2009 pension increases from public housing rent calculations.

The celebrations honoured the citizens of the year and welcomed our newest Australian citizens. I congratulate Kingston's Citizen of the Year, Thelma Mansfield; Outstanding Citizen of the year, Brian Lowe; and Young Citizen of the Year, Jack Styles, on their awards. I also congratulate Frankston's Citizen of the Year, Gwen Dearsley, and Young Citizen of the Year, Kimberley Pellosis. Former mayor of Kingston Ron Brownlees and former mayor of Moorabbin Neil Hamilton were awarded the Order of Australia Medal for their many years of service to local government and the community. I thank Ron and Neil for their long and excellent service. Last Sunday, I joined thousands of people to celebrate the Year of the Dragon at the Vietnamese Tet festival at Sandown Park. The crowds were treated to traditional ceremonies, breathtaking lion dancers, fireworks and family fun activities. This year's festival also commemorated 50 years since the initial involvement of Australian forces in Vietnam. I thank Bon Nguyen, President of the Victorian Chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia and Phong Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, who was recently appointed by our government as a People of Australia Ambassador for organising such a great community event. Digital Television from Mr Don Denman of Nowra. Mr Denman is 72 and his wife is 75. Both are pensioners living in a department of housing house. I would like to read a portion of his letter because it encapsulates an unsatisfactory dilemma confronting many pensioners living in public housing in Gilmore as they face the day when analogue television will forever be turned off to them. He writes, and what he has written makes me just a little bit sad: I rang the government phone line about the change over and as I have a digital TV sort of working on an indoor antenna not very well, they cannot help us unless we owned our own house and that we will have to talk to housing commission. All we need is an outdoor digital antenna. We went to see the housing commission and was told that they cannot help us as we are in a house and not units and that we will have to pay for it ourselves. We live just on the old age pension and pay 25 per cent of that to housing. We have a car to run as we can't hop in and out of bussesBecause there are no busesa monthly telephone, electricity and thanks to the government, this keeps going up. It seems to us that the governments of today are treating us worse than they would treat a leper. It will cost about $300 to $350 to supply and install a digital TV antenna. This is more than I get a week. As well as bills and rent, we have to buy food. On food, I spend $50 a week and a little more when we can afford it. I cannot buy one and put in myself as I have arthritis in both knees, both hips and right shoulder.

He has written more, but as can be well imagined it is laced with comments that reflect a sense of betrayal over this and other injustices faced by aged pensioners. If that is not enough, four weeks after he loses his TV signal he will have to face up to the impact of the carbon tax. He adds: I don't usually complain about things but enough is enough! Yes, he will be given his set-top box and it will be installed, but it will be as much use to him as an ashtray on a motorcycle. Surely the government cannot continue its pattern of incompetence. Didn't anyone think this through? I am sure it is not an isolated case, and it is incumbent on the government to deliver a product that will actually work. Mr Denman and his wife deserve better than being treated with insolent contempt like this. Perhaps he was right in his observation when he said: It's a big joke, isn't it? I just want to add that Mr Denman served for seven years in the Royal Australian Navy and spent eight years with the department of main roads as a foreman on bridge works as well as managing other jobs. He says: I'm a proud Australian and I'm worried about what is happening to my country. National Aged Care Alliance Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (09:51): Today at a breakfast here in Parliament House the National Aged Care Alliance launched their paper 'Australians deserve to age well-preparing for our future now'. This paper looks into developing the Productivity Commission's report and it provides positive suggestions for the future. The breakfast was cofunded by the Parliamentary Friends of Seniors and Ageing and two other parliamentary friends groups. This parliament has been very active in the area of ageing and has been looking at the needs of an ageing population into the future, given that Australia's population is ageing at a very fast rate. Events such as the breakfast this morning, which is looking to the future and developing plans and blueprints for where Australia goes, are very important. It is to the credit of the alliance that they have looked at the Productivity Commission's report, which was released last year, and ways in which that report can be implemented. It identifies the issues that are very important to older Australians and their carers, to those working within the aged care industry and to those who are supplying aged care services for people. It acknowledges the importance of being able to supply aged care both within the home and within residential care packages and of the need for more aged care to be provided within the home. The report identifies the fact that aged-care facilities are often some distance from the home of the person who needs to reside in residential aged care. I would like to congratulate the National Aged Care Alliance on the positive report that they have launched today and I would like to encourage members to visit the expo that is going to be taking place here until about three o'clock. There is a lot of useful information, and I would like members to take that information back to their electorates because we should never underestimate the importance of providing for people as they become frail and aged. This is a very important role that we as members of parliament need to play. MAIN COMMITTEE Cancer February, was World Cancer Day. I have the pleasure today of speaking about the efforts of one of my constituents in a national fundraising project for the Australian Cancer Research Foundation. The effects of cancer are known to all of us. They are devastating to families and to the community. In the last couple of days we have had a condolence motion for Peter Veness, whose life was taken by cancer at a very young age. This brings home to us the effects cancer has on all of us. It weighs heavily also on our health system and it certainly does not discriminate. One in two Australians are now diagnosed with some form of cancer by the age of 85. My constituent Dee Handyside, who lives in Ormeau, is a proud breast cancer survivor. She emigrated from England to Australia in 2000 and was working as a ranger on Fraser Island when she was diagnosed in 2007. The disease had already claimed the life of her mother, and very quickly her sister and her cousin-both living in England-were also diagnosed. With family living so far away, Dee came to realise the importance of that most iconic trait that Australians cherish: mateship. During her time being treated for cancer, Dee composed and recorded an album, Genetic, in her spare room at home and in the hospital ward. She turned to genres ranging from motown, jazz, country and R&B. She wrote about the low points, the high points and the cancer journey for other patients and sufferers. The final product is now being distributed for sale in ABC stores around the country. Ten per cent of the proceeds from sales will go to world-class cancer research through the ACRF as part of Dee's commitment to defeating this terrible disease for future generations. The album's release has already been featured on Good Evening America and on ABC Radio. One of the songs on the album is called Thank You Friends. It is a song filled with joy and warmth and it is dedicated to the many friends who helped Dee through her surgeries, treatments and other complications. In the song, Dee refers specifically to a group of breast cancer sufferers and survivors based in Australia and New Zealand who were brought together by an online support forum. I would like to thank my colleagues who are wearing this lapel badge today to proudly support the Australian Cancer Research Foundation and all the work that Dee and many others are doing. Lindsay Electorate: Housing Developments express my disgust with plans announced recently by the New South Wales Liberals to dump 100,000 new people into the outer suburbs of Sydney in my electorate. They have announced a plan to call upon developers to come forward and show them the land that they want to develop in parts of outer urban fringes in my electorate in Western Sydney. In particular, they have identified a number of locations in the Penrith area, and this would amount to the establishment of 34,000 new homes in my local community. To put that into some perspective and context, it would amount to somewhere in the order of an extra 100,000 people being housed in my local community.

184,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:57): I rise topeople. That would be, in effect, a 50 per cent increase in our local population at a time when so many families and individuals in my community are angry with the lack of infrastructure that they currently see in their community. The plan involves 34,000 new homes in suburbs such as Luddenham, Orchard Hills, Wallacia, Kemps Creek and Mount Vernon. This would be 2½ times the number of houses that we currently have in one of our biggest suburbs in the electorate, Glenmore Park. The incoming population that the development of these housing lots would achieve would be in the order of three times the population of the town of Bathurst. I note that the town of Bathurst has its own hospital. I am very interested to know what additional infrastructure is going to be provided to ensure that we have the infrastructure to meet not only our existing demands but also the demands of this incoming population. I note that some of the land that is mooted for development is amongst the richest agricultural lands in the Sydney basin-it is our food bowl-and we want to unleash new housing lots in there. The worse aspect of this plan is that the New South Wales Liberals have said that they will achieve these developments at no cost to the state government. That means one of two things: developers will have to pay the costs and they will pass them onto landowners, increasing the cost of housing; or local ratepayers will have to pay with increased rates. We should not expect anything other than this. The last time the Liberals came to power in New South Wales they had a proposal called 'the South Creek valley', which was on the same scale, that they wanted to dump in our community. After a concerted community campaign they abandoned their plans, but it was not until the Labor government came into power that we finally shelved that proposal. I am calling upon everyone in my local community to join me in this campaign against this terrible proposal. (Time expired) 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 2011. The coalition supports the purpose of this bill which is to implement the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The fact that we need to have this bill is a symbol of the age in which we live where terrorism remains an ever-present threat. That threat occurs from outside the country and, sadly, the threat of homegrown terrorism also exists, and we have seen that in spectacular ways. We have also seen the successes of our security agencies in tackling those threats in recent times. We should never forget that over the last decade many Australians have already lost their lives to terrorist atrocities. The previous coalition government recognised this and we presided over an unprecedented expansion of Australia's capabilities to combat terrorism. It is very clear to me that, when the Labor Party came to power, they saw this unprecedented expansion of resources and capacity as an over-allocation to the security agencies. They have systematically undermined those agencies and they have systematically MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Rasaid Whose Efforts I Have Praised In This Place Several Times Before
185,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Vamvakinou,Order! In accordance with standing order,150,Bills
186,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (10:01,"I rise today to talk on the Nuclear Terrorism Legislationdecreased the resourcing that is available to them whilst, at the same time, increased their levels of responsibility in a way that will ultimately jeopardise our national security. What these deliberate cuts mean is that our security agencies are being asked to do more with less. The pressures on the security agencies manifest themselves in various ways. In the most recent budget Labor deliberately again weakened our national security by cutting away $12 million from the National Counter-Terrorism Committee. They also cut $1.4 million from the Australian Federal Police counterterrorism operations. As we know, the most important single weapon in the fight against terrorism is information. Unfortunately through these budget cuts the Gillard Labor government undermined the effectiveness of the Australian counterterrorism effort by thwarting the ability to collect information. We are gravely concerned about the cutbacks to the AFP's counterterrorism program. If this Labor government were serious about preventing terrorism, they would need to commit to appropriately fund the Australian Federal Police's counterterrorism and intelligence programs. In contrast, the former coalition government provided over $10.4 billion of funding from September 2001 up to the 2010-11 budget to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism programs by increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies. The former Howard government gave ASIO and the AFP significantly more resources and legislative teeth to stay ahead of terrorists and stop them before they acted. The coalition strongly supports our national security and law enforcement agencies and believes they should be resourced appropriately in order to fight this terrible crime. I want to turn to some of the broader cuts beyond the cuts to the intelligence agencies that have occurred to our national security agencies under this Labor government. It really is a litany of shame, and I believe that it is clearly an indicator of Labor's intention when they came to office to stop what they saw as the overallocation of resources to our security apparatus. They have deliberately set out to do this since 2007. Here are just some examples of where they have done this. They have cut $17 million from the air marshals program, which effectively ends the air marshals program. They have cut Australian Federal Police numbers at Darwin and Canberra. They have cut aerial surveillance, unbelievably, as they have presided over the collapse of our orderly border protection system. They have savaged Customs at every budget, including cutting an enormous sum out of the ability of Customs to screen people as they come over the border as well as to screen cargo as it comes over the border. In the 2009-10 budget, for instance, Labor cut $58.1 million from the ability of Customs to screen cargo when it comes into Australia. What this means, of course, is that the ability for criminals to bring in contraband, and the ability of terrorists to bring in things as well, is enhanced by the fact that Customs is so dramatically underresourced under this government. The rate at which cargo is screened has dropped dramatically-25 per cent in the case of sea cargo inspections. Astonishingly, there has been a 75 per cent cut in the ability of Customs to inspect baggage as it comes in through our airports. That is an astonishingly large opportunity and opening for criminals, and in the same vein it is an astonishingly large opening for people who might want to bring in weapons or even more diabolical things through our airports, because Customs just do not have the resources they need to do their job properly. Labor have also savaged Customs staffing numbers. Ninety staff were cut from Customs, on top of the cut of 250 that we saw in the 2010-11 budget. They have cut $9.3 million from Customs, apparently in a plan to reduce MAIN COMMITTEE capital spending. Passenger facilitation, as I mentioned earlier, has had $34 million cut out of it. That means that passengers waiting at Australia's eight international airports wait for longer, and it also reduces Customs' ability to spot threats as they come into the country. Finally, this year's MYEFO estimated that $35 million will be cut from Customs over the forward estimates. That is just Customs and Border Protection, but all of our national security agencies have been similarly hammered by this government. ASIO had $8.8 million cut from training and liaison. The government also cut almost $7 million worth of ASIO security checks for visa applicants. A sum of $12.1 million was cut over four years for 'operational efficiencies'which of course is just a euphemism for cutting money-from AUSTRAC, which of course is an agency that is vital in fighting crime, and fighting terrorism in particular, because it tracks the flow of money, which is vitally important to stop these sorts of activities. I think it is very clear that these cuts represent a very deliberate policy from the Gillard and Rudd Labor governments to stop what they saw as the overallocation of resources to national security. We are very concerned about it. The fact that the budget is in such a perilous situation means that it is going to be difficult for us to reverse that, but we have committed to funding all of those agencies properly. In my own portfolio in particular, we have made specific commitments to reverse some of the cuts that the Labor Party have made to Customs and Border Protection, and that will be vital if we are to go back to a situation where our borders are properly secured in terms of both who comes into this country and what comes into this country. I turn to the substance of the bill that we are debating. I appreciate that I have been given broad latitude to talk about terrorism in general, whereas this bill really deals with something that is relatively simple in the fight against international terrorism-that is, the ratification by Australia of an international treaty that deals with nuclear terrorist threats. When we think of terrorism, the prospect of nuclear terrorism is possibly one of the most disturbing scenarios that could be imagined by people who are envisaging threats to the Western world and to Australia in particular. Clearly, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the ability of terrorists to access nuclear materials was enhanced, and the international community admirably responded with this international treaty that we are discussing in the Australian parliament today. The United Nations Ad Hoc Committee commenced work on the draft International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in 1998. This was born against the backdrop of the postwar discussions I mentioned and the international community being aware of the alarming scenario of nuclear material or nuclear weapons being able to fall into the hands of terrorists. The only existing international convention at the time on nuclear matters was limited to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes and did not deal with nuclear material for military purposes. The United Nations Convention on Nuclear Terrorism was adopted by the general assembly in April 2005 and was opened for signature in September that year. The convention is a multilateral treaty open to ratification by all nations and is designed to criminalise acts of nuclear terrorism and promote judicial and police cooperation in order to prevent, investigate and penalise those acts. The convention includes a wide range of acts and potential targets, which include nuclear power plants and nuclear reactors. It covers threats and attempts to commit such crimes or to participate in them and instructs that offenders will either be extradited or prosecuted. The convention also MAIN COMMITTEE encourages states to assist each other with criminal investigations and extradition proceedings and by sharing information to prevent terrorist attacks. This bill seeks to implement Australia's obligations under that convention. As outlined in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the amendments create new criminal offences for possessing or making radioactive material, nuclear explosive devices or a device to emit material with radiological properties which may cause death, serious bodily injury or substantial damage to property or the environment; using or damaging a convention prescribed device or a nuclear device or threatening to do so; threatening to use radioactive material; or demanding another person create radioactive material, a convention prescribed device or a nuclear facility. Finally, it creates an offence for demanding another person to allow a third person to access or control radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility. Notably-and I think very importantly-members of the Australian Defence Force will not be liable for prosecution when acting in connection with the defence or security of Australia. The convention does not govern the actions of armed forces during an armed conflict. The exemption does not apply to serving personnel whose actions are not connected with the defence or security of Australia or who have otherwise been acting unlawfully. It should be noted that the bill does not criminalise the unlawful possession and use of radioactive material-for example, material with a medical application. There must also be an intention to use or make available this material for a prohibited purpose such as death or property damage. Whether or not the intended outcome occurs is not relevant to the prosecution. It also stipulates that a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment applies to the offences created under the bill. We obviously support, as a coalition and as an opposition, the objective of this bill to implement the United Nations convention. The convention is an important instrument in the international efforts to combat terrorism and the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction. We agree that ratifying the convention will send a very strong message to the international community that Australia remains committed to addressing the threat of terrorism. I think there would be very few members of parliament who would object to us ratifying this treaty. In many ways I think that this is the easy end of combating terrorism. The harder end is when it comes to the allocation of scarce resources and when there is a lot of competing pressures on those resources. Clearly, when it comes to those sorts of judgments, this Labor government have been left wanting by the cuts they have made to our national security apparatus, specifically by the cuts they have made against our counterterrorism abilities. I will call on them, in voicing the opposition's support for this particular measure, to look at reversing those cuts. It is something we will certainly do when we are in government. Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The member for Stirling, who spoke prior to me, raised a number of specific cases with respect to funding allocations for national security and safety. I am certainly not in a position to respond to those comments individually, but I am sure that most of those allegations will be rejected by the minister. In the time that I have been in this place, this government has been absolutely committed to national security and national safety. The government has introduced a number of measures that reflect its commitment in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Bills
187,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10:14,"I rise to speak in support of the Nuclear TerrorismThe member for Stirling spent most of his time attacking the government's funding of national security. Again, I have no doubt that the minister will respond to those allegations. I make the observation, however, that good government is about reflecting the needs of the time. When circumstances change it is not unusual and not irresponsible for the government to change direction in how it manages its affairs. The reality is that if you look at the record of activities that the security organisations of this country have been engaged in, at the record of arrests that have been made and at the general level of safety throughout the country in recent years, you see that those organisations have performed exceptionally well. This government has now been in office for four years. We do not see the security breaches that we might have seen if the system and the various organisations were not working well. So, quite frankly, whilst the member for Stirling came in and attacked the government's record, I think it is a very proud record, which speaks for itself in terms of this government's commitment and its runs on the board in relation to security around Australia. As other speakers have said, the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill implements the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Minister O'Connor, in introducing the bill in November last year, stated: The bill creates new offences for specific conduct that is prohibited by the convention. This includes:  possessing radioactive material or a device  using or damaging a radioactive material or device or nuclear facility  demanding the use of radioactive material or device or nuclear facility  threatening or attempting to use or damage a device, radioactive material or nuclear facility, and  using radioactive material, or a device, or using or damaging a nuclear facility. The offences will not be limited to conduct by Australians and in Australia, but will apply in a broad range of situations where the convention requires states parties to assert jurisdiction. It seems to me that this bill in fact completes part of the process of adhering to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. That convention was concluded in New York on 14 April 2005. The process, however, began nearly a decade earlier, when the United Nations General Assembly established an ad hoc committee through resolution 51/210 on 17 December 1996. It certainly was a lengthy process. Ultimately I can understand the difficulties that might have been encountered by the United Nations in trying to get the convention agreed to by as many countries as possible. It was ultimately signed off on 14 April 2005. The convention establishes an international framework for criminalising specific conduct relating to nuclear material and other radioactive substances or devices. Australia signed the convention on 14 September 2005, as I understand did several other countries. The convention entered into force generally on 7 July 2007. Of the 115 signatories to the convention, to date 54 have ratified the convention and a further 23 countries have subsequently acceded to it. Australia's ratification of the convention will contribute to international efforts aimed at countering terrorism involving the use of radioactive material. It will ensure that persons who commit such acts can be brought to justice irrespective of the territory in which they are found and whether or not extradition agreements are in place. MAIN COMMITTEE The convention provides a framework for international cooperation in the prevention, investigation, prosecution and extradition of persons who commit relevant offences with nuclear material and other radioactive substances or devices. The convention is an important tool in the international fight against terrorism and the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, the threat of terrorism has become a fact of life around the world. It is not a new phenomenon. Terrorist acts date back many centuries. The word was originally derived from the French equivalent, which dates back to the reign of terror that followed the French Revolution. In recent decades, however, we have seen widespread acts of terrorism around the world. Most notably for Australians we all remember September 11, 2001, and particularly the Bali bombings of 12 October 2002 when 88 Australians lost their lives along with almost another 120 people-and many others were badly injured. It has changed the way we live, how we do business and even where we may choose to live or visit. The changes we have seen in the operations at airports is a prime example of this. Most importantly, it has added immense financial costs and time to the way we live. The costs associated with counterterrorist strategies will continue to escalate as new technology creates opportunity not only for good purposes but also for evil purposes. Whilst this bill seeks to strengthen our efforts to counter terrorism, the reality is that countering terrorism will be an ongoing challenge for governments around the world. Again, as this bill very much reflects, it is an international problem and it does require international cooperation if we are going to have any reasonable degree of success in countering the terrorist activities of those who want to engage in them. Terrorism is not only a product of conflict between two parties, as we quite often imagine, or between two different organisational structures. It is also often a product of a single, crazed person driven by an obsession or by fanaticism. We saw that only last July when 77 young people were killed in Norway as a result of the actions of a person who was clearly deranged and probably still is based on the latest reports I have read about his appearance in the Norwegian courts only recently. So terrorism comes in many forms. That is what makes it so difficult and costly to counter. But every action we take closes another opportunity for terrorism. The observation I would make about this legislation is that it relates to nuclear terrorism. The word 'nuclear' is synonymous with 'fear' because of the magnitude of the destruction it can cause. It is a valid fear from what we have seen of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and, more recently, Fukushima. So it is understandable that when you mention the word 'nuclear' or 'uranium' people have some real concerns. The ongoing debates about the ability of countries to enrich uranium, who we sell it to, what it can be used for and how it is to be stored highlights just how sensitive an issue it is. The other observation I would make with respect to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which this bill seeks to ratify, is that it is an international convention. As I said a moment ago, if we are going to fight terrorism on an international scale we are going to need international cooperation. The convention, as I have pointed out, has been signed by only 115 countries, which means that there are more countries in the world who have not signed it and are not party to the convention than are. That, in my mind, is of real concern because, as we all know, terrorism crosses borders and international MAIN COMMITTEE boundaries. If a country does not sign the convention you have to immediately ask the question: why not? Why would you not sign something which to 115 countries appears quite reasonable? It is something which took nearly a decade to negotiate in order to ensure it was reasonable, and yet some countries still refuse to sign it. That is of real concern, because our best strategy in fighting terrorism is to have everyone around the world in unison in terms of the way we approach the challenge. The last thing I want to say is that this bill does in fact strengthen Australia's case when we are endeavouring to encourage other countries in our region to ratify various other counterterrorism instruments. An upcoming opportunity to encourage our neighbours will be the Nuclear Security Summit, which I understand will take place in the Republic of Korea in March this year. Again this is case where, if we are going to encourage others to do the right thing, we have to lead by example. I know we have done that by signing the convention. Particular aspects of this legislation conclude some parts of the convention that we have not yet put into place, and this will certainly enable us as a country and as a government to say to others: 'We are playing our part. We are prepared to be cooperative in an international framework. You should do the same.' I commend the bill to the House. Amendment Bill 2011. Last year, the British Home Secretary, Theresa May, told the Washington Council on Foreign Relations that in the fight against extremism: Success will depend on balancing the near and long term objectives. Repeated tactical success will not of itself assure us of strategic victory. We must extend the rule of law; address the ideological challenge; harness and not be harmed by technology; and preserve our borders in what will surely remain a period of instability. The Home Secretary's prescription is a very good one. It is one we should share, and I believe we do. Despite the benefits of technology, there are those who would seek to manipulate science and use it against their fellow human beings for their own nefarious and evil purposes. Radical extremists have vowed to go to any lengths in the name of their cause. That includes unleashing biological or nuclear weapons. Amongst them, al-Qaeda and the North Caucasus terror groups have made no secret of the fact that they desire nuclear weapons and have attempted to acquire them. There is evidence that prior to September 11 al-Qaeda operatives cased American nuclear reactor facilities but ruled out sabotage because of the tight security and reinforced fences at those sites. A decade on, security experts warn that nuclear terrorism remains a real and urgent threat. As more countries embark on their own nuclear programs, this issue must be managed with a watchful eye both at home and abroad. Nuclear material that could be used for weaponry is not inaccessible. Nearly 2,000 metric tonnes of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium separated from spent fuel is stockpiled across the world. It exists in hundreds of buildings and bunkers across more than 30 countries. A quarter of those nations are plagued by corruption and political and financial instability, posing grave concerns over the security of their nuclear reserves. Twenty cases of theft or loss of this material have been recorded by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Other cases have gone unreported. Additional supplies that could be used to make a dirty bomb, like radiological materials used in medicine, can be found at countless other sites. MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Bills
188,Mr Morrison (Cook) (10:26,"I rise to support the Nuclear Terrorism LegislationWe do not live our lives in fear, nor do we close our eyes to the world around us. It is critical to be aware of the threats and challenges that face this nation and our allies on the global stage. This bill goes to the heart of the rationale that aims to prevent us from being surprised by the unanticipated and the unimaginable. Last year, researchers from Russia and the United States, two of the world's major nuclear powers, issued a joint assessment warning of the persistent dangers of nuclear terrorism. The joint threat assessment on nuclear terrorism was the product of a year-long partnership between leading authorities on nuclear security from Harvard's Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs and the Moscow Institute for US and Canadian studies. The report concludes: If current approaches toward eliminating the threat are not replaced with a sense of urgency and resolve, the question will become not if but when, and on what scale, the first act of nuclear terrorism occurs. It named complacency as the primary obstacle to nuclear security. A nuclear attack could take a range of forms. Nuclear weapons could be stolen or acquired on the black market. Perhaps more easily, a crude improvised device or a dirty bomb could be made from stolen materials like uranium or plutonium from spent fuel reserves for civilian research reactors. These scenarios, this study warns, are distressingly plausible. Sabotaging a nuclear facility is another possibility. I say this as the member for Cook, where the ANSTO facility is in very close proximity to my own residence and those of the neighbouring electorate of Hughes. Thirty countries run reactors that could be potential targets. The report made the point that, whilst Fukushima and Chernobyl were terrible accidents, that same devastation could be triggered by premeditated action. This report is very grim reading but in order to pre-empt disaster we must consider the worse-case scenarios. To have to contemplate these things is horrific but we do so with the hope that they may never eventuate any further than the dark realms of evil imagination. The assessment argues that, given the potential catastrophic consequences, even a small probability of terrorists getting and detonating a nuclear bomb is enough to justify urgent action to reduce risk. This can be done through tightening the security surrounding nuclear weapons, materials and facilities and expanding intelligence and police operations to foil smuggling and terror plots. The bill before us today is a vital amendment that moves towards these ends, strengthening the deterrent measures and scope for prosecuting these offences. The convention was a global initiative started by Russia and the United States in 2006. Our Commonwealth legislation already incorporates many of the obligations of the convention. But this bill is important in ensuring that all criminal offences are covered. This amendment will make it a criminal offence to possess, make or use radioactive material or a nuclear emitting or explosive device that can cause death, serious bodily harm or substantial damage to property or the environment; or to threaten to use radioactive material or demand another person create or use such a device or facility. This bill does not criminalise the lawful use or possession of radioactive material in fields like medicine, but it does allow stronger prosecution when there is intent to use or make that material available for a prohibited purpose. Whether or not the intended outcome is carried out is irrelevant to the prosecution. These new offences carry a maximum penalty of 20 years jail. MAIN COMMITTEE Experts say the nuclear material required for an improvised bomb is small and hard to detect, making it difficult to recover once stolen. For that reason the US-Russia joint threat assessment ruled that the primary focus in reducing risk must be to keep nuclear material and nuclear weapons from being stolen by continually improving our security measures. This stronger legislation is a critical part of that process. The nuclear terrorism convention does not govern the actions of armed forces during conflicts, so members of the Australian Defence Force could not be prosecuted when acting in connection with national defence or security, as is appropriate. The sobering reality is that it would be plausible for a terror group with technical expertise to make and detonate a crude nuclear bomb if it could acquire the right materials. We need to ensure that that does not happen. These laws today help to serve that purpose. While we take the measures proposed in this bill and are supportive it is important to remind ourselves of the other dimensions of our task. Last year we commemorated the 10th anniversary of September 11, a cataclysm that shook our world to its very foundations. We have recovered but we will never forget. We have supported our allies in their time of great need and joined the fight and have been the direct victims of terrorist activities ourselves, most notably in Bali. We have drawn strength from the resilience of those who we have stood by-their determination and above all their further commitment to the defence of the democratic values we share. That practical support continues to this day at the cost of Australian lives. Home-grown terrorism is one of the principal threats facing the United States and the United Kingdom today. In Australia we have been well served by an immigration program that has mitigated these threats more so than most nations, but we must remain vigilant. Australia's immigration program was designed with stringent security tests and character provisions in a bid to safeguard our people and our values. We have sought to consolidate and uphold these provisions as time has passed and contexts have changed. But there is an everpresent need to be watchful. To maintain the integrity of our immigration system we need to adopt a risk based approach to our borders and ensure that our scarce resources are well focused on targeting the threat. The Gillard government's failed border protection policies have compromised these resources and undermined the ability of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to undertake this core task, which is to maintain the integrity of our immigration program. We must also remember that the friend of home-grown terrorism is cultural exclusion and disengagement. We must have an expectation of participation and engagement with respect to all who live in our society, and society must encourage that participation. In fact, we should insist upon it. We cannot allow a segregationist agenda to take hold under the banner of cultural tolerance. Cultural diversity is an asset for any nation that chooses to embrace it within the framework of shared values, strong borders, the rule of the law and robust institutions. By contrast, cultural division is a curse on any society and is the recruiting ground for extremism and home-grown terrorism. The US-Russia report reminds us that nuclear terrorism should also be considered within a policy framework of the broader phenomenon of terrorism and extremism. The authors note that Al-Qaeda and other groups draw motivation for the pursuit of weapons of mass MAIN COMMITTEE destruction from the belief that escalating the conflict by inflicting mass casualties is necessary to win a perceived clash of civilisations between Islam and the West. We must be very wary of allowing state sponsors of radicalism and extremism to develop nuclear weapons capabilities. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has been significantly undermined by North Korea, the first nation to withdraw from the treaty and test nuclear weapons. The UN Security Council has passed five legally binding resolutions, demanding that Iran halt its uranium enrichment program, to no effect. The 2010 report to congress, by the Director of National Intelligence, made the assessment: Iran probably has the capability to produce some biological warfare agents … for offensive purposes, if it made the decision to do so. The Middle East and North Africa continue to experience a time of great upheaval. It is an opportunity for renewal, but there is a lurking danger in their present vulnerability. This is a volatile time-the fall of the Tunisian regime, in January; the fall of Mubarak in Egypt, in February; the death of Gaddafi in Libya; and months of rebel uprisings, airstrikes, bloodshed, protests and violence which gripped Bahrain, Morocco and Algeria. Syria has been suspended from the Arab League, caught in a cycle of violence, as it hurtles down the road to civil war. In the chaos, evil can prosper and our enemies can prevail. We must be ever watchful. The joint threat assessment noted that, whilst al-Qaeda has been drastically disrupted since 2001, there remain very few operatives who would have the skills to organise or orchestrate a nuclear attack. Collaboration with other extremist groups or networks is not out of the question. There is a chance for these nations to cement fundamental human rights in the societies they rebuild. We cling to the hope that, when the dust settles, a new era can emerge where religious expression and difference is celebrated, not condemned, and the voices of all are heard and valued. However, the experience of the Copts in today's Egypt is not a good omen. Religious extremism, intolerance and hate must not be allowed to fill the vacuum under the guise of superficial democracy where it will consume, destroy and surely spread. We should be careful not to embrace these new regimes and be too eager to appease, as the language of some world leaders could be interpreted, particularly towards the Muslim brotherhood. These regimes could prove to be even more dangerous than the ones they replace, both to their own citizens, to the way of life we in this nation value, to our own nation and its security and those of our allies. We must remain eternally vigilant. The light in our watchtower must never go out. Amendment Bill 2011. This bill will make essential amendments to the Nuclear NonProliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 in order to implement Australia's obligations under the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism of 2005. The convention aims at establishing an international framework for cooperation for the prevention, investigation, prosecution, and extradition of persons in breach, of offences relating to radioactive or nuclear weapons. While the convention has an international element to it, it requires signatory countries to that convention to address their domestic laws to ensure that they are complementary to those provided within the convention itself. That is essentially what we are doing through this bill. MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Bills
189,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (10:39,"I also seek to speak on the Nuclear Terrorism LegislationAustralia, as we have heard from previous speakers, has already enacted substantial elements of law set out in the convention within the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987. This bill will fill the gaps to ensure that our legal requirements under the convention and its framework are fully met and, as part of the international organisation of various nations who are signatories to the convention, ensure that our laws are contemporary in that respect. It is also important, given the role of Australia in terms of our region, that we show leadership on this matter. Complying with the obligations set out in the nuclear terrorism convention will allow us to lead by example within our region, ensuring that other regional neighbours witness our commitment to take steps to comply with the convention and, in doing so, ensure that we have a very strong legal regime set to combat issues of terrorism generally. New offences will emerge as a consequence of the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill. It will create new offences with respect to possessing, making, using, damaging; threatening a nuclear facility; or a person being forced to use or develop radioactive material for the purposes of weaponry. To put this in context, this is not something where you need an abundance of nuclear physicists and a 20-year lead-up time to develop a nuclear device-as we would generally know it, an atomic bomb. We have the are also fast approaching a debate in this chamber concerning a nuclear waste facility, at a location yet to be determined. There is also our reliance on nuclear medicines for our health. All have a capability of having products used to develop such weapons, for use in terrorism. As to these new offences, the penalty imposed is up to a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. The application of these laws will apply where an offence is committed within Australia by an Australian citizen or against an Australian citizen, our property or indeed a facility itself. The offence will therefore potentially involve foreigners acting against an Australian citizen or within Australia. As a result, the Extradition Act 1988 will also be amended to prevent a suspect offender from avoiding extradition from Australia by arguing that the offence was of a political nature. As I indicated, in terms of choice of words, in terms of weaponry, it is not the wholesale production of a nuclear instrument that this legislation is aimed at. Indeed, it would cover that, but that is not its principal target. In the modern age, the prospect of having a dirty nuclear device, which is primarily associated with the disbursement of radioactive material, is something that, whilst very frightening, is very real. It is those devices that are in the forefront of the minds of our security agencies. In supporting this raft of amendments, we need only look back to September 11. The common view is that it changed the face of the world, and indeed it did. In this place itself, whilst we were not a target in respect of that dreadful attack in the United States, we saw the potential of what it would mean to a country like ours. We enacted various pieces of legislation which some of the critics of this government and of the former government would deride by referring to it as draconian legislation. We took every step possible to ensure that Australia is fully protected against the advent of a terrorism attack. This is another step to ensure that we not only are vigilant but also have in place the tools necessary for those people that we put on the front line, who are out there to protect our community, to ensure that they MAIN COMMITTEE can properly investigate, prosecute and bring to justice people who would otherwise be free to do what they will in terms of some terrorist ideal in our community. ClearlyI support the provisions outlined in this amendment but, in doing so, I also have regard for all those officers who are working in our law enforcement and security services to protect this nation against the advent of terrorism. It is a long bow to suggest that we have not been a target simply because we have been lucky. I think the reality is that it is because this nation has been vigilant and has not taken things for granted. We will withstand the criticism about deploying draconian legislation, but I think I speak in respect of the parliament generally that all sides will do whatever is necessary to protect our citizenry from terrorist acts. I commend this piece of legislation to the House. I know it will not be the last in terms of fighting terrorism. Terrorism is something that will push the envelope of our understanding. Simply being able to block it in one aspect does not mean that it will not re-emerge elsewhere. As I say, I have nothing but praise for our people in our respective law enforcement organisations and our security organisations who commit their lives to the protection of this country, and I feel quite humble whenever I am in their presence. I commend the legislation. Amendment Bill 2011. The bill seeks to add new offences to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 by implementing our obligations under the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. I want to record my occasional criticisms of the United Nations conventions and other elements that do not function so well. This of course is a worthwhile initiative of the United Nations, the United States and Russia in supporting nuclear non-proliferation and ensuring that we deal with the very modern challenges of terrorism, particularly in the nuclear domain. It affords me the opportunity to make some remarks on my ongoing interest in matters nuclear: nuclear energy, nuclear waste and how we deal with that and, of course, nuclear terrorism. It is important for us to reflect that in an era when much of our culture deals with matters of nuclear terrorism, whether it be in literature-the latest book I am reading by Tom Clancy, Dead or Alive, deals with a group of terrorists undertaking a nuclear plot in the United States-or whether it be on television shows such as 24 or other programs dealing with the prospect of nuclear terrorism, this cultural reflection is really a snapshot of what people are thinking about and concerned about in today's world. Following 9/11 something that was previously completely unimaginable became imaginable. And we now know that there are people in our world today who are seeking to do these evil things, including to turn what is a fantastic development in human achievement, science and progress-the splitting of the atom-into something that is negative for humanity. It is important that we create these categories of offence in Australian law so that we can help to prevent these sorts of acts. Law is one tool, and law enforcement agencies do need these laws to deal with these sorts of crimes. However, if we ever get to the point where these offences are enacted we will have failed. Our law enforcement, terrorism, intelligence and other agencies are at the forefront of fighting people seeking to do these very evil things, and it is very important that we ensure the adequacy of the law in prevention and in enabling these MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Bills
190,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (10:48,"I rise today to support the Nuclear Terrorism Legislationagencies to seek out and prevent these acts before we ever get to the point where we may have to deal with something under the provisions of the bill before us today. However, it would be remiss of me to talk up the doom and gloom about nuclear problems-considering that we do have a facility in Sydney at Lucas Heights, which is a fantastic achievement in nuclear medicine, and that we are proposing to put a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory-without dealing with some of the pertinent comments from around the world about nuclear energy and its benefits. Looking at what has happened at Fukushima and the scepticism that has come forward about nuclear power generation, it is pertinent to quote just a few things that deal with some of the matters in this bill and, indeed, the general debate about nuclear power today. I had a quick look at some top environmentalists and other people who are concerned about nuclear power. Even very senior levels of people who have had a view about the nuclear technology suite, whether it be in power generation or other mechanisms, have come to the view that they formed the view wrongly and prematurely. For example, I want to quote Stephen Tindale, who ran Greenpeace for five years until 2005: My position was necessarily that nuclear power was wrong, partly for the pollution and nuclear waste reasons but primarily because of the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. My change of mind wasn‘t sudden, but gradual over the past four years. But the key moment when I thought that we needed to be extremely serious was when it was reported that the permafrost in Siberia was melting massively, giving up methane, which is a very serious problem for the world. It was kind of like a religious conversion. Being anti-nuclear was an essential part of being an environmentalist for a long time but now that I‘m talking to a number of environmentalists about this, it‘s actually quite widespread this view that nuclear power is not ideal but it‘s better than climate change. Given that is the view of very senior environmentalists and other people in the world todaypatience with relevance to the bill before me. I have allowed a wide ranging debate, but this is going too far. pleasantly surprised. Given that it ispower-particularly in Australia. When countries in Europe, such as France or England, are allowing many mainstream facilities within suburban areas, the prospects and the potential for terrorism will increase. They have increased in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom. I feel that in Australia today, whether you look at the views of any prominent scientist or environmentalist, the argument for nuclear power and facilities is increasing. The momentum is increasing, and we will see more facilities in Australia in urban areas and in other appropriate areas. I do think that is only a matter of time. Of course, that means that the prospect for these sorts of illegitimate acts will increase. It is definitely there today in a country like France, where there are dozens and dozens of nuclear power plants. We know that 70 per cent of the UK's power is generated from nuclear sources-allowing for more of this activity to be focused around key targets, and seductive targets, like nuclear facilities. Even in Sydney, this sort of thing has been an issue over the past five years that I have been observing this.

This is an important debate, considering that, as a society, we will increasingly be looking at nuclear as a solution to our energy generation and medical problems. The provisions in this bill are legitimate in the sense that they exempt the Australian defence forces from activities on the battlefield and do not involve any legitimate use of the defence forces in areas where they may have responsibility for nuclear materials. The conventions and the criminal offences are substantial and useful in terms of us making a case about the United Nations convention being a valuable mechanism, and the penalty of 20 years is a legitimate penalty. It is also important to note that there are countries pursuing nuclear technology for the purposes of employing nuclear weapons, including countries such as Iran, most notably in recent times. The member for Cook spoke about the recent United Nations Security Council resolution that was not supported by China and Russia. One of the disappointing features of that was that Syria was seeking to supply Iran with low-grade nuclear spent fuel and other mechanisms to help them develop nuclear weapons-which of course is the other side of the nuclear terrorism debate. There are also nation states, particularly totalitarian regimes, that seek to develop nuclear weapons for the purposes of nuclear terrorism employed by the state and not by an isolated group seeking to cause terrorism in our country. This is appropriate legislation. This bill will be helpful to law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies. It is a reactive mechanism but it is important to note in law that it is an offence to do these things. I do not see many instances of people being charged with the lawful possession of radioactive materials or other things. If we ever get a situation where someone is prosecuted for this, we have a much broader problem. I continue to support the government's efforts to proactively give intelligence and law enforcement agencies powers to find people who seek to do evil things and to prevent them from doing so. This is a worthwhile United Nations convention. The United States and Russia are to be commended for developing it, and it is a worthwhile bill for this parliament to adopt. have had a chance to congratulate you on your ascension back to that role. Anyhow, congratulations. I rise to support these amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and the Extradition Act 1988. They are designed to correct a peculiarity in the current Australian law where certain illegal acts relating to acts by Australians against Australians within Australia involving nuclear terrorism are at this moment not covered by the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism to which Australia is a signatory. The current amendments have my full support. I have remembered that just a couple of years ago, nearby to Australia, some totally irresponsible person was arrested with several kilograms of caesium 137 in Bangkok. So the danger marches closer to us. I cannot believe that a person, for commercial purposes or for greed for money, would enter into such a prospect. But, apparently, there are such people in this world and that is why this kind of legislation is necessary. Nuclear terrorism, the prospect of which I have spoken about in this House, is potentially the gravest threat at the moment in the Middle East and, by inevitable extension, to the world, whether it is the development of nuclear weapons or, God forbid, a nuclear exchange or, as many people in this House have MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
195,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10:58,"Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, I am not sure Ispoken about, the smuggling of dirty bombs and the use of them by terrorists within Australia. I refer to the most recent findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its report of November 2011, Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran, wherein the agency, in the exquisite language of international diplomacy, states that: This report focuses on those areas where Iran has not fully implemented its binding obligations, as the full implementation of these obligations is needed to establish international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran‘s nuclear programme. In this most recent report, in summary, the IAEA says that Iran has not suspended its nuclear enrichment related activities in, amongst others, the Natanz fuel enrichment plant and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, located near the city of Qom, or suspended work in heavy water related projects. Iran has declared to the agency 15 nuclear facilities in nine locations outside nuclear facilities where nuclear material is customarily used and the United Nations agency responsible for monitoring these kinds of things still awaits a substantive response in relation to announcements made by Iran concerning the construction of a further 10 new uranium enrichment facilities. Most disturbingly, the agency reports it has become concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organisations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, about which the agency has regularly received new information. Information that also serves as a basis for the agency's analysis and concerns comes from a variety of independent sources, including IAEA member states, the agency's own efforts and information provided by Iran itself. The information indicates Iran has carried out activities that are relevant to the development of nuclear weapons. This is not a peaceful nuclear program. The official international UN agency is looking at issues beyond what would otherwise be a legitimate Bushehr nuclear reactor provided by the Russians to the Iranians apparently for nuclear power. The IAEA has identified the following military related activities of Iran on nuclear power: efforts to procure nuclear related and dual-use equipment and materials by related individuals and entities-and I am very proud that the Australian government has on four occasions intercepted, as then Minister for Defence Faulkner revealed, dual-use items sought by Tehran for its program; efforts to develop undeclared pathways for the production of nuclear material; acquisition of nuclear weapons development information and documentation from a clandestine nuclear supply network; and work on the development of an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon, including the testing of components. While some of these activities identified by the agency have civil as well as military applications, others, most disturbingly and threateningly, are specific to nuclear weapons. The President of the United States' adviser Matthew Kroenig senior in last weekend's Financial Review said that the IAEA has identified that Iran was testing nuclear triggering devices and redesigning its missiles to carry nuclear payloads. That is very ominous advice from Matthew Kroenig, who has just retired as an adviser to the President of United States. He was the President's adviser from July 2010 to July 2011 and so he has the latest information. I commend his very alarming article in the centre pages of the Financial Review to members of the House. In summary, the International Atomic Energy Agency now reports that it will not be in a position to provide credible assurances about the absence of undeclared MAIN COMMITTEE nuclear material and activities in Iran, specifically to nuclear weapons, unless and until Iran provides the necessary cooperation with the agency. RecentlyI had the opportunity to sit down for an extensive period of time with Russia's very cosmopolitan foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Sydney. While I do not agree with many of his country's policy prescriptions on Syria and Iran, he did make the very sound point that the international community must at all costs keep the IAEA inspectors in Iran. The moment they are forced to leave is the moment for the international community to go to DEFCON 1, as the Iranians will be able to take their 20 per cent enriched uranium to 90 per cent within a very short period of time. I commend Mr Putin's and Russia's responsible posture in refusing to supply advanced missile defence to the Iranians. One of the key things in understanding the possibility of nuclear proliferation and the possible provision of dirty bombs, even if not in the form of a nuclear weapon or a nuclear missile, is the nature of the Iranian regime. We all know that Persia was a great civilisation and that the Persian culture is a great civilisation. We all know that that regime stole an election from its own people more than just a year ago. The Iranian regime has a defence minister who has an indictment against him by the Argentinean Attorney-General for blowing up a civilian centre in Buenos Aires in the 1980s where more than 70 people were killed. It has recently been accused by the government of the United States of trying to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington. I want to draw attention today to the latest of its grave behaviour, given the heightened tensions in that part of the world. It shows you the kind of people we are dealing with and the outlaw nature of this regime that would, in my view, provide dirty bombs to terrorists if it thought it could get away with it, even into a place like Australia. The conservative Alef site, just yesterday, in Tehran published a doctrine detailing why the destruction of a nation and the slaughter of all of its people would be legally and morally justified. The site gave jurisprudential justification for Iran's Islamic government to take the helm on these kinds of issues and to prosecute such a policy. The article was written by Khamenei's strategy specialist, Alireza Forghani, and is now being run, as we speak, on most state owned websites in Iran indicating the regime's support. My goodness me; what kind of a country is it where the government officially says that on its own websites? It indicates the nature of the people whom we are dealing with. Of course, this demeans and humiliates the great civilisation of Persia, which all of us are familiar with. When we meet Persians overseas they shake their heads with embarrassment at the kind of regime that is running things there at the moment. It informs me-and I think it should inform all members of the House-about the nature of regimes. It does not disturb me at all that Australia provides uranium to India, China-with whom I certainly disagree on its foreign policy-or Japan, because these countries are essentially peaceful. They do not threaten anyone. We realise, of course, that there are grave issues with nuclear safety, which arose out of Fukushima. But it is the nature of regimes that we should look at-regimes that have these materials and have the possibility of providing dirty bombs to people with nuclear material. They are a threat to our citizens as well. I also draw the attention of this House to the article, which I think all members should read, in the December issue of the Atlantic, which points out that, in order to prevent American surveillance of where its nuclear weapons are, the government of Pakistan is now driving these weapons around in delivery trucks through the crowded streets of Lahore, Rawalpindi MAIN COMMITTEE and other cities in Pakistan. However crazy that policy sounds, it is a danger to citizens of the world. Surely one of the bad guys in Waziristan could drive one of their pickup trucks down to Rawalpindi, Dhaka or some place like that and intercept one of these government delivery trucks that are not safeguarded by the Pakistani military or supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency. They could just pick one of them up. What a danger that would be to the people of the world. The provision of dirty bombs to terrorists is a real issue. It is brought very closely to mind by the incident that I cited at the beginning of my speech, in which a man was arrested in Bangkok several years ago carrying several kilograms of polonium. This is timely legislation. Both sides of parliament are showing their responsibility to the Australian people by supporting it. Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. There is no doubt that, as the member for Melbourne Ports said, this bill has bipartisan support. The coalition certainly backs this and we see the reason why. Out in the world, there has been recognition of the need to deal with these sorts of issues. With this bill, we see the implementation of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We in this country have always been very clear on this and have been very supportive of keeping these sorts of problems away from our own shores and working as part of the world community to make sure that the world is as safe a place as absolutely possible. So, yes, we certainly welcome this bill. The world is a risky place. There is instability out there. There are countries and nations, there are organisations and there are political groups in this world that are not very positive and which pose a risk, whether that risk is through an intention or threats to commit harm or whether it is through corruption or at any point poor security. Where nuclear weapons and nuclear capacities are involved security and a lack of corruption is required. We must acknowledge that threat, so it is right and proper that this country adopts this bill and works as part of the world community to do as much as it can about nuclear terrorism. We support the measures contained in this amendment, because we do live in a dangerous world. There are threats posed by states and non-state actors. The threats are posed not solely by ideologies or Islamists but also by even older concepts such as the sheer pursuit of power. The member for Melbourne Ports spoke quite extensively about Iran. I think that when we talk about nuclear threats to the world Iran figures prominently. It would be wrong to speak on this matter and not raise the issue of nuclear proliferation, because it remains a relevant point. In particular, with regard to the impending nuclear power Iran, much has been said about the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, it is right that we acknowledge the threat that the leaders of that power present. We know that Iran is a Shiah majority nation. Iranians are not, however, Arabs. As a result, Iran does struggle for wider credibility in the Arab Middle East. Its task is made more difficult because it has few natural Shiah friends. Currently, it has Syria, although perhaps that friend will not last much longer. We should keep in mind that the quick fall of the Syrian government and President Assad are highly desirable, but what is also desirable and required is that, unlike the concept of the Arab spring, which has proved to be an illusion with regard to democracy, in any fall of the Syrian regime liberal democracy needs to be promoted and that there has to be very hard work to promote it. This is unlike Egypt, where we saw a flicker of liberal democracy-but that was snuffed out fairly quickly by the highly organised Islamists represented by the Muslim Brotherhood. MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
196,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11:10,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on theThe threat in Syria, as in many places in the Middle East, is that one regime can be easily replaced by an Islamist regime and that is certainly not a step forward, and provides no benefit and no security for those in the region. With regard to the relationship between Iran and Syria, there is no doubt that the fall of Syria would be a massive defeat for Iran. I think we should desire that as a good outcome. The Iranians do have some friends in the Middle East. They have the support of Syria and supply from Syria. They also have friends in Lebanon, the Hezbollah, whom they help to supply with weapons, and that other well-known terrorist organisation, Hamas, in the Gaza Strip. Apart from those limited friends, the other nations in the Middle East are predominantly the Sunni Muslims and they are Arabs. It is well-known that Iran desires to lead the Muslim world. Iran pursues that leadership and pursues concepts such as the world caliphate, uniting all the world under Shiah Islam and the return of the Mahdi to exact justice on the world at the end of time. These are concepts that they talk about. To achieve that leadership, they are pursuing an anti-Israel agenda to get publicity and credibility with Arab nations in the Middle East, and they seek a nuclear warhead to match the delivery systems they already possess. They seek leadership in the Muslim world through power and the threat of a nuclear missile that will, they believe, allow them to control the sea lanes of the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz. It is certainly my view that Iran is likely in the next 12 months to develop nuclear weapons and be able to deploy them. It is wise to be aware of this, particularly in the case of the United States and Israel. Consideration should be given to what action should be taken to address this threat. It is also my view that a nuclear armed Iran is unlikely to be able to be negotiated with and the stability of the gulf and its shipping would most definitely be threatened. Furthermore, an emboldened nuclear Iran may well feel that proliferation of nuclear capacity to its friends may also further its leadership in the wider Islamic world. Certainly in the near future, barring action from the US or Israel, the threat of nuclear terrorism will become increasingly likely. From an international perspective, the pursuit by the current regime in Iran of hegemony in the Middle East, their pursuit of leadership of other countries, is most definitely their agenda and through nuclear weapons we can see that agenda being progressed. They are not a reliable member of the international community. They are not a safe or even, in my view, mentally stable organisation. If they seek to negotiate, we can only acknowledge that as a means to delay. If they want to talk it is a means to delay and take advantage of the turn-the-othercheek mentality of the Western world, giving them more time before they are called to account. Israel certainly understands that threat and they understand the time frame. I think the United States is a little too optimistic and is prepared to let these time frames slip out to 18 months or even a couple of years, during which action may be required. In my view and from the information that I have received, the crunch time for this issue is going to be within the next 12 months. That is a difficult issue, obviously, for the world. I believe the steps that are required will need to be taken within 12 months. That is scary. That will be a little bit difficult, but we should stand by our friends and realise that what will need to be done will need to be done and that we should be on the right side. In the end, what will happen in the Middle East if Iran gets this sort of leadership position or this sort of power position is not the sort of thing we want to contemplate. I believe that action will be required in the future. MAIN COMMITTEE We also know there are some radical views out there. Already Iran has been more than happy to support and back the worse sort of people-as I mentioned before, Hamas and Hezbollah from southern Lebanon. We can easily see that that sort of attitude towards the terrorists in the Middle East can be expanded to other parts of the world. You might well see the regime in Iran, if they do achieve that success in the Middle East and in the gulf, reach out to the radical Islamists in Indonesia. That is very much on our doorstep. It is something that we need to think about and realise that action is going to be required on. I have talked mainly in a broader global sense with regardtalking about a bill, occasionally referring to the bill does help the chair. constructive on the bill from here. I said that the influence of an emboldened Iran may come into South-East Asia. We know that already in Australia there are those who have travelled overseas to undertake terrorist training through Yemen. Last year I referred to some 55 people who are unaccounted for, having gone through Yemen, and who are suspected of being involved with terrorist training. An Australian citizen who is going to travel overseas for that sort of training, might well think involvement with the regime in Iran or its agents would be in their best interests and would further the pursuit of their objectives. When we look at the home-grown terrorist concerns within this country, we need to be mindful that the geopolitical influences of emerging nuclear powers might well be able to influence to some degree inside Australia as well. As the member for Cook said earlier in his contribution on this bill-and I certainly agree with this-we need to be very careful about the way parallel societies could exist in Australia under the guise of cultural identity. I know that maintenance of a person's culture from their homeland is an important thing and it gives strength to people as they come to adjust and integrate into Australia. When we have places, countries, states and non-state players out there in the world seeking to take advantage of those who might feel disaffected or detached from Western liberal societies then we do need to think about that and we do need to think about making sure those ethnic or religious groups in Australiathe legislation. About now would be a really good time to do it. and the ability to reach out to disaffected groups within Australia by those people who have access to devices and nuclear materials is exactly the sort of link we need to consider-the fact that there might be those out there in the world who offer the capacity to those inside the country who want that capacity and are prepared to utilise that capacity. That is the point I was trying to make. We should be very careful. Those groups that might want to maintain their language and culture to the exclusion of English and the positive traditions of the last two centuries might seek to lock in their isolation from the mainstream and from the opportunities our nation offers. That would be a disservice to Australians of ethnic origins and to our country. Without a doubt the coalition supports this bill. Obviously we need to be vigilant here in Australia and we need to give due consideration to what is happening around the world.

200,Mr Simpkins,"I think that the bill is about access to radioactive materials or devices,Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I would like to support the words of the member for Melbourne Ports, the member for Cowan and the other speakers who have contributed on this bill. This bill implements the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism by adding new offences to Australia's Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism details offences relating to unlawful and intentional possession and use of radioactive materials or a radioactive device, or the use or damage of nuclear facilities. It is designed to promote cooperation amongst nations through the sharing of information and the providing of assistance for investigations and extraditions. The convention entered into force in July 2007 and requires all party states to make every effort to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the protection of radioactive material, taking into account relevant recommendations and functions of the agency. Originally proposed by Russia, the convention was first adopted on 13 April 2005 with the ultimate intention of protecting against attacks on a range of targets, including nuclear power plants and reactors. The bill creates new criminal offences, including possessing radioactive material or a convention device; making a convention device using radioactive material; using or damaging a convention device or a nuclear facility; threatening to use radioactive material; threatening to use or damage a convention device or a nuclear facility; demanding another person create radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility; and demanding another person allow a third person to access or control radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility. It would be nice to live in a world where such legislation was not necessary, but Edmund Burke's words from 1790 remind us 'There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men.' Just before Christmas we had an important reminder of Edmund Burke's words and that the threat of terrorism in Australia is ever present when three Muslim extremists were convicted by the Supreme Court of Victoria for conspiring to plan a terrorist attack in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent. Each were sentenced to 18 years jail. The aim of these home-grown terrorists, members of an Islamic terrorist cell who had all met in a Preston mosque, was to enter the Holsworthy Barracks armed with military weapons and shoot 500 personnel or as many people as they possibly could before they were killed themselves or ran out of ammunition. The Holsworthy Barracks is more than just a military establishment. It has a history going back almost 100 years and it is the place where the families and friends of our defence personnel often gather to attend parades and ceremonies. Holsworthy railway station, a station used by several thousand commuters every day, sits on the boundary of the Holsworthy Barracks. Thankfully this planned terrorist attack in Sydney's south-west was thwarted when police arrested four suspected plotters before they had a chance to enact their plans. To those anonymous heroes involved in what was known as Operation Neath-the joint investigation by the AFP, the Victorian Police, the New South Wales Police, the New South Wales Crime Commission and ASIO, who were supported by other agencies including the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions-whose work was responsible for foiling this terrorist plot in Sydney's south-west, we cannot thank you enough for your professionalism, for your dedication to duty and for getting the job done. In handing down the 18-year jail sentences, Justice King told the court that she had a duty to protect the community, given that MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
201,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (11:25,"I rise to speak in support of the Nuclearnone of the accused had shown any remorse for a terror plot she described as an evil. Her Honour further said: Your intentions and your plans were deadly serious. It was to kill as many personnel that could be found on the army base at Holsworthy in the time prior to yourselves being killed as martyrs … She also noted: … despite being given the opportunity, none of the trio had recanted their extremist views. At the trial the court also heard that the three had expressed hatred of Australian people, whom they repeatedly referred to as 'infidels'. One of the convicted was even recorded as celebrating the death toll of the Black Saturday bushfires, saying it brought retribution to Australia. Of the three convicted terrorists, one was born in Somalia and one in Lebanon. How such individuals are accepted into Australia as migrants remains a mystery and demonstrates that we must give our migration authorities all the resources that they require to undertake vigorous background checks of prospective migrants to ensure that they share our beliefs in human rights, liberty, inclusion, diversity and equal rights for women and, above all, that they are prepared to have a commitment and loyalty to the Australian nation above any other belief. The third convicted terrorist was, amazingly, an Australian-born citizen of Lebanese refugee parents. Rightfully, Justice King said their disloyalty towards their adopted country was shameful. She said: The fact that Australia nurtured you and your families is something that should cause you all to hang your heads in shame, that this was the way you planned to show your thanks for that support. Your views about Australia and Australians, and your attitude towards the country's armed forces, its civilians and its government were clear. Your plans were evil. But, unfortunately, this was not a one-off event. As the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, David Irvine, recently pointed out: ... Of the 38 people recently prosecuted for terrorism-related offences in Australia, 37 were Australian citizens and 34 were either born here or lived here since childhood. Clearly, home-grown terrorism is a threat in Australia. Although we rightfully celebrate our multicultural society as one of our nation's greater strengths, it is also a warning sign that not all is well. We cannot bury our heads in the sand to this growing problem. If we are to avoid creating a divided and dysfunctional society, multiculturalism must be a policy for the whole of society to adopt and it must not be a policy which encourages the growth of a series of various monocultures developing in certain suburbs in a major city. The threat or the use of nuclear weapons has been of paramount concern for governments for more than 60 years. While the threats of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union have all but diminished there still remains the threat from rogue states such as North Korea and Iran. In addition, the threat of nuclear terrorism is real. It is well known that alQaeda has attempted to acquire nuclear materials, either plutonium or highly enriched uranium. The possibility of future terrorist activities using nuclear devices must be a concern for all governments, including the Australian government, and it must be one we are prepared to confront. MAIN COMMITTEE Preventing these terrorist acts and deterring those who might seek to commit them requires full international cooperation. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is one way of fostering this international cooperation. This bill demonstrates Australia's commitment to ratifying this international counterterrorism instrument as an integral part of strengthening its legal framework to fight terrorism. I commend the bill to the House. Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which will give effect to our obligations under the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. This will create new criminal offences for (1) possessing or making radioactive material, nuclear explosive devices or a device to emit material with radiological properties which may cause death, serious bodily injury or substantial damage to property or the environment; (2) using or damaging a convention prescribed device or nuclear facility or threatening to do so; (3) threatening to use radioactive material; (4) demanding another person create radioactive material, a convention prescribed device or a nuclear facility; and (5) demanding another person allow a third person to access or control radioactive material, a convention prescribed device or a nuclear facility. Importantly, offences under this bill include serious penalties, up to 20 years imprisonment. Members of our Australian Defence Force will not be liable for prosecution under this convention, when acting in connection with the defence and security of Australia, nor does this convention cover actions of the armed forces during armed conflict. Like my colleague and friend who spoke before me, the member for Hughes, I subscribe to the view that nuclear terrorism is our greatest security threat. One of the foremost authorities on this topic is Professor Graham Allison, a former US Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He is now Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard University, Kennedy School of Government, where I was a student and where I got to know Professor Allison well. Professor Allison sees the nuclear threat as being entirely possible and points to the findings of a bipartisan United States Congressional Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation and Terrorism, which found: … it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013 … Professor Allison and this bipartisan congressional commission are not the only ones to point to the seriousness of this threat. President Obama has said that nuclear terrorism is the single most important national security threat that we face and, in his first speech as President to the United Nation's Security Council, he said: Just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city-be it New York or Moscow, Tokyo or Beijing, London or Paris-could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And it would badly destabilize our security, our economies, and our very way of life. Former United States CIA Director, George Tenet, said, 'The main threat is a nuclear one. I am convinced that this is where Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda and his operatives desperately want to go.' Former US Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, said that, 'It's the thought of a terrorist ending up with weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear' that MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
202,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (11:34,"I rise to support the Nuclear Terrorismkeeps him up at night. Indeed, we were given a glimpse into the causes for this deep concern expressed by the leaders of the United States's military and security establishment through the WikiLeaks revelations, which referred to some of the files of those captured in Guantanamo. The United Kingdom's Telegraph newspaper, in its reporting of these WikiLeaks reports, said: A senior Al-Qaeda commander claimed that the terrorist group has hidden a nuclear bomb in Europe which will be detonated if Bin-Laden is ever caught or assassinated. The US authorities uncovered numerous attempts by Al-Qaeda to obtain nuclear materials and fear that terrorists have already bought uranium. Sheikh Mohammed told interrogators that Al-Qaeda would unleash a ""nuclear hellstorm"". It went on to say: Terrorists also plotted major chemical and biological attacks against this country. Professor Graham Allison believes that, despite the reality and pervasiveness of this threat, Americans are 'paralyzed by a combination of denial and fatalism'-that if it has not happened, it will not, or, if it does happen, we can do nothing to stop it. The truth is: we can. We can do something to mitigate this threat, to stop such an atrocity ever happening. We can strengthen our intelligence agencies, as the Howard government did-and I was proud to be involved in that process, supporting ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, when I was in the office of Prime Minister John Howard. We can strengthen our legislative processes, which is part of the bill before us. We can attract the best people. We can share information with our friends and our allies in order to get the best result. There is a way forward. But there is a reality that we all have to face, and that is: in Australia the terrorist threat is ever so real. In a very important speech to the Sydney Institute, David Irvine, who is the head of ASIO, revealed exactly the depths of today's threat. He pointed out that over 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas since 9-11, and he said that he did not share the view that the terrorist threat is either over exaggerated or that it just happens in another country. In fact, David Irvine, who is one of our finest diplomats-he had been our ambassador in China and heavily involved in security issues-has said that, in Australia, 23 individuals in recent years have been handed very heavy penalties for terrorist attacks, and he said in his speech: It is worth reading the sentencing statements of the Australian judges to get an idea of the seriousness with which they viewed the offences-and the likely consequences had they been successful. David Irvine went on to say: ASIO continues to conduct several hundred counter-terrorism investigations and inquiries ranging from Australians in contact with terrorists off-shore, including al-Qa‘ida, to possible threats to Australian interests or Australian lives from extremist activity, either on or off-shore. He went on to say: Within the Australian environment, we are seeing a worrying trend of ―home grown terrorism‖. This is not an abstract or an offshore threat; it is real and it is amongst usworryingly, toowe are continuing to see a number of Australians seeking to travel overseas for participation in-or facilitation of-terrorism-related activities. My concern is that such people may target innocent people overseas, assist those who would do harm to our nation, or might return to Australia with a greater knowledge, training and intent to carry out an act of terrorism back home. MAIN COMMITTEE These are very profound, disturbing and important words. We can do something to stop the terrorist threat. We can do something to stop the nuclear threat. The first thing we can do is stop countries with existing nuclear capacity, like Pakistan and North Korea, proliferating their technology and their capacity to other countries. The second thing we can do is stop countries that currently do not have a nuclear device, like Iran, Syria and Burma, from ever getting one. The third is that we can tackle terrorism with a robust security framework and our deep alliances with our neighbours and friends, and the fourth is that we can introduce tough legislation that actually makes it an offence to do the types of activities that I have outlined today. The Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 is an important part of our arsenal. It is an important part of Australia's defence. I support it unequivocally, and so do my many colleagues on the coalition side. Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. As my colleagues have already stated, the coalition does support this bill. According to the Bills Digest the purpose of the bill is to: ... implement the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism 2005 (the Convention) by creating new offences for criminal conduct relating to nuclear material and other radioactive substances or devices prohibited by the Convention. The Bill also amends the Extradition Act 1988 to ensure the new offences will not be regarded as political offences for the purposes of extradition. As set out in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the amendments proposed by the bill create new offences for possessing radioactive material for a nuclear explosive device or a device to emit material with radiological properties which may cause death, serious bodily injury or substantial damage to property or the environment; making a convention device; using a damaging convention device or a nuclear facility or threatening to do so; demanding another person create radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility; and demanding another person allow a third person to access or control radioactive material, a convention device or nuclear facility. Under these amendments, Australian Defence Force members will not be prosecuted when acting in connection with the defence or security of Australia. The convention does not govern the actions of armed forces during an armed conflict. However, this exemption does not apply if any serving member's actions are not connected with the defence or security of Australia or if they are otherwise acting unlawfully. Also of note is that the bill does not criminalise the lawful possession and use of radioactive materials if, for example, it is being used for medical applications. There must, however, be an intention to use or make available the material for a prohibited purpose, such as death or property damage. In terms of prosecution, whether or not the intended outcome occurs is not relevant to a prosecution and there is a maximum penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment for the new offences created by this bill. In terms of committee considerations of the bill, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties expressed its support for the convention and, ultimately, recommended that the binding treaty action be taken. The committee stated that ratification would: MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
203,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (11:45,"I also rise to speak on the Nuclear Terrorism... contribute to international efforts aimed at countering terrorism involving the use of radioactive material. It will ensure that persons who commit such acts can be brought to justice irrespective of the territory in which they are found and whether or not extradition agreements are in place. Those were just two of the compelling reasons why the committee supported Australia undertaking the proposed binding treaty action. The committee further commented that implementing legislation would 'further strengthen Australia's strong counter-terrorism legislative framework', that the ratification would 'send a message to the international community demonstrating Australia's continued commitment to addressing the threat of terrorism' and that it would 'strengthen Australia's case in encouraging regional countries to ratify the 16 international counterterrorism instruments'. The committee also made comment on the inordinate length of time between the signing of the treaty in September 2005 and the tabling of it in parliament. I also consider it quite extraordinary that it has taken six years to table this treaty in parliament given the importance of antiterrorism measures and, in particular, the concerns about nuclear terrorism activities. The background to the United Nations convention dates back to when the UN Ad Hoc Committee commenced work on the draft International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in 1998. History shows that, at the time, the only existing international convention on nuclear matters was limited to nuclear material which was being used for peaceful purposes. In April 2005 the general assembly adopted the UN's Convention on Nuclear Terrorism. Some five months later, in September of that year, it was open for signing. As stated by the member for Stirling and others, the convention is a multilateral treaty open to ratification by all nations and is designed to criminalise acts of nuclear terrorism and to promote judicial and police cooperation in order to prevent, investigate and penalise those acts. It includes a wide range of acts and potential targets, which include nuclear power plants and nuclear reactors. I am sure everyone agrees that the convention is an important instrument in the international effort to combat terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The convention includes threats and attempts to commit crimes or to participate in them and instructs that offenders will be either extradited or prosecuted. The convention also encourages assistance between each other with criminal investigations and extradition proceedings by sharing information so as to prevent terrorist attacks. On terrorism, others have already stated that the coalition genuinely supports counterterrorism measures which include nuclear terrorism measures in Australia and abroad. I am not sure why the Gillard Labor government does not place the same emphasis on national security as we do. I would have thought that if it did it would ensure that our national security agencies are resourced appropriately to enable them to focus on international and home-grown terrorism. If the Gillard Labor government were serious about ensuring that our national security agencies were appropriately resourced, why did it cut $12 million from the National Counter Terrorism Committee in the 2011-12 budget? And why did it cut $1.4 million from the AFP's counterterrorism operations? At a time when people do not feel our borders are safe and are worried about terrorism, at a time when people do not think they can trust the Gillard Labor government, why does the government cut national security agency funding? MAIN COMMITTEE As already stated by the member for Stirling, we all know that the most important weapon in the fight against terrorism is information, and unfortunately the Gillard Labor government just cannot be trusted to ensure that our national security agencies and the AFP have the intelligence-gathering powers they need to identify preparation and planning for terrorist acts so as to stop them before they are carried out. Like other members of the coalition, I am deeply concerned by Labor's cutbacks to the AFP's counterterrorism program. To prevent terrorism you do not cut back funding; you ensure that the programs are appropriately funded. And that is what Labor has to do. Labor needs to commit appropriate funds to the AFP's counterterrorism and intelligence programs. When the coalition was in government the contrast was clear, as it provided over $10.4 billion of funding from September 2001. This was to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism programs by increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies. As we heard from the member for Kooyong, the former Howard government provided ASIO and the AFP with more resources and legislative support, which ensured that they had the resources that enabled them to stay ahead of the game and to stop terrorist activity before it occurred. History shows us that the coalition strongly supported our national security and law enforcement agencies. This support is strong today. It is essential that these agencies be resourced appropriately so they can do their job-that is, to fight crime effectively. In conclusion, as I said at the beginning, the coalition supports the intention of this bill to implement provisions of the UN convention. As already stated by my colleague and friend the member for Stirling, the coalition agrees that ratifying this convention will send a strong message to the international community that Australia is committed to addressing the threat of terrorism. Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I precede my remarks by saying that the coalition intends to support the bill. There are a number of worthy aspects to it. It seeks to add new offences to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. This will be accomplished by implementing the new provisions outlined in the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, otherwise known as the nuclear terrorism convention. It is a multilateral treaty, which of course makes it open for each nation to ratify. It is designed to promote judicial and constabulary cooperation in order to prevent, investigate and penalise criminal acts in relation to the convention's intended purpose. As some in the chamber would be aware, Commonwealth legislation already implements most of our obligations under the nuclear terrorism convention. This bill seeks to ensure that all criminal offences specified in article 2 of the convention are appropriately covered by the application of Commonwealth legislation. The amendments contained in the bill create new offences for possessing radioactive material or a device considered under the convention to be a nuclear explosive device that would emit radiological material that may cause death or serious bodily harm or damage to property or the environment; making such a device as prescribed under the convention; using or damaging such a device, including threatening to do so; demanding another person create radioactive materials, devices or nuclear facilities; and demanding a person allow a third party to access or control such facilities, devices or materials. MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
204,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11:54,"I rise to lend some comment to the Nuclear TerrorismThe bill stipulates with regard to these offences that there must be an intention to use or make available the material for prohibited purposes. There is a suitable penalty-20 years imprisonment-that applies to offences created by this bill. However the bill does not criminalise the lawful possession and use of radioactive material. The importance of the use of radioactive material in the form of isotopes is known by all those involved in medicine and by those who have been the recipients of some of the great advances in medicine. It is also apparently contained in household smoke alarms, which gives me a whole new perspective on accessing smoke alarms, I can tell you. It is important to note that there are also provisions that protect Australian Defence Force, ADF, personnel from prosecution when they act in accordance with the duties normally required of them and in the defence of the nation's interests. This is in line with the nuclear terrorism convention, which itself does not govern the actions of armed forces during armed conflict. Naturally, the exemption does not apply to Australia's military forces if their activities are not related to their duties and to their work in securing Australia's national interests. Quite simply, if you are a soldier, sailor or airman or airwoman and you are acting unlawfully, then you will be liable for persecution under the terms of the bill, as you should be for any unlawful activity. It is a sensible measure, and I personally support it as the shadow minister for defence personnel, science and technology. It is important to reiterate that this bill specifically precludes ADF members from being liable for prosecution when undertaking what can broadly be termed as their normal working duties. It is sensible and it ensures our defence personnel are provided with the legal protection they need when carrying out lawful general orders in the prosecution of armed combat. We support the bill. It makes measurable sense. The protections provided for military personnel are sound. If we cast our eye to the possible use of nuclear material within terrorism in general, we start to get a feel for why measures such as this are needed. According to the Worldwide Incidents Tracking System, a database run by the National Counterterrorism Center in the United States, as at the end of October 2010 there had been 17,833 separate terrorist attacks across the world perpetrated by Islamic extremists. This is an inordinate number of terrorist attacks since September 11-something like 1,300 per year or four per day. Furthermore, in their report for 2009 the National Counterterrorism Center stated that there had been 299 suicide bombing attacks in 2009 in 13 countries. We should probably more rightly call them 'homicide' attacks, because suicide bombers are not seeking to kill themselves; they are seeking to use maximum bloody force to destroy as many people as possible in the closest possible circumstances. There were 299 suicide bombing attacks in 2009 alone in 13 countries. There appear to be more Mumbai-style attacks as terrorist organisations continually adapt. We see that in the prosecution of combat operations in Afghanistan, where a resilient enemy learns, adapts and grows, and we see that with the improvised explosive device threat. Fifty thousand people were killed or wounded in terrorist attacks during 2009, with over 50 per cent of victims being Muslim. There have been almost 18,000 terrorist attacks in the last 11 or 12 years. There were 300 suicide bombings in 2009 and tens of thousands killed in 2009. The vast majority of attacks were perpetuated by Islamic extremists, the majority of the victims being those who practise the Islamic faith. The world sometimes truly is a screwed-up place. MAIN COMMITTEE Perhaps most importantly, we need to recall that since September 11 over 110 Australians have been killed by terrorist attacks. In the September 11 terrorist attack in the US, 15 Australians were killed. On 12 October 2002, at Kuta, Bali, 88 Australians were killed-202 people were killed and 209 injured in total. On9 September 2004, at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, nine Indonesians were killed and 150-plus injured. On7 July 2005, in the London train and bus bombings, one Australian was killed and 11 were injured-in total 56 people died and 700-plus were injured. On1 October 2005, at Jimbaran Beach in Kuta, Bali, four Australians were killed and 19 injured out of a total of 26 deaths and 100 injuries. Of course, on 17 July 2009, at the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, three Australians were killed-seven people were killed and 53 injured in total. International terrorism represents a significant, clear and very, very present danger to the world as a whole, including Australians. We are not isolated on our wonderful island continent in the southern part of the world, as 110 deaths in terrorist related incidents since September 11 unfortunately bear testimony to. One need only look to the Middle East and to the lunacy of President Ahmadinejad and his thirst for power in terms of progressing the advent of nuclear weapons, which is where Iran wants to go. This simply bears testimony to the lunacy of some of the regimes that we face across the world. North Korea, of course, has detonated a number of nuclear devices. Reports in the media indicate that the military junta in Burma is seeking similar advances down that path. The stopping of the proliferation of nuclear weapons needs to be a key activity of the governments of all freedom-loving nations of the world. The governments of North Korea, Burma, Iran and other similar nations that purposefully pursue a nuclear program with the intent of the destruction of human life need to be made aware by the rest of the international community that their actions will not be condoned or tolerated. Walls are built brick by brick in defence against terrorism and Islamic extremism. One of those bricks is this bill, which seeks to enshrine some of the prosecutorial elements of the convention. Australia as a sovereign nation and as a member of the wider international community will act to limit the potential damage caused by terrorists. We will act abroad in concern for our interests; we will act in concert with our allies, as we do in Afghanistan and other parts of the world; and we will act on a legislative basis to ensure that citizens, residents or visitors to our country do not involve themselves in these activities. We support the government on the bill and we wish it well in its implementation. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand-Attorney-General) (12:04): I would like to thank all of the members of the chamber who have spoken on this bill. It has been supported by both sides of the House. In fact, all of the speakers have indicated their support: the members for Stirling, Makin, Cook, Fowler, Mitchell, Melbourne Ports, Cowan, Hughes, Kooyong, Solomon and Fadden. I think this is an indication that across both sides of parliament people understand that the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 will make an important contribution to Australia's fight against terrorism and misuse of weapons of mass destruction. It will also demonstrate to the international community that Australia is serious about cooperating with other nations to defeat threats to international peace and security. Nuclear terrorism, of course, is a horrifying thought, as many of the speakers have reflected. A nuclear terrorist attack can kill millions, lay waste to cities and the environment and cause grave social and economic dislocation. We hope that the world never sees the day, but in today's security environment we should never discount the possibility of a nuclear MAIN COMMITTEE terrorist attack occurring. The bill will put in place offences that will allow Australia to prosecute nuclear terrorists. It will also facilitate cooperation with other nations in the fight against nuclear terrorism and the bill forms part of a broad effort by the international community to fight nuclear terrorism, including the fact that it will allow Australia to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. This is a significant piece of legislation which sends a strong message to the international community and would be nuclear terrorists. Of course, it is important for us always to remember to distinguish between this bill and debates which are inevitable in the community about uranium exports and nuclear power. Whatever your views might be on those issues, we can all unite-as has been evidenced by speakers in this chamber-around the proposition that we should be part of an effective international legal regime to fight nuclear terrorism. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Rearrangement Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12:07): by leave-I move: That business intervening before order of the day No. 4, committee and delegation reports, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12:07): As deputy chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I rise to speak in support of the committee's report 427, Inquiry into international funding agreements. I would like to acknowledge the contribution already made by the member for Lyne and chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit when tabling this report. This report arises from the first major inquiry of the committee under this term of government. On9 February 2011 the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the national funding agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The committee's terms of reference required the committee specifically to consider: (1) the changing dynamics of grants to states and territories, the types of grants that are made and the principles, agreements and legislation governing these grants; (2) the extent to which the current system's funding agreements satisfy the requirements of all levels of government, and any suggestions for changes to the process; (3) the need to balance the flexibility to allow states and territories to determine their own priorities, with mechanisms for monitoring and accountability, and ensuring that the objective of funding agreements are being achieved, MAIN COMMITTEE noting the role of the COAG Reform Council; and (4) the adequacy of parliamentary scrutiny of funding agreements, noting that such agreements are typically negotiated at executive-toexecutive level. As stated in the committee's report foreword, the Commonwealth dedicated a significant proportion of its funding for 2011-12 to the states and territories, with $45.5 billion of payments supporting national agreements and national partnerships. This committee has an ongoing interest in achieving value for money for the Australian taxpayer and believes that the arrangements to distribute this amount deserve parliamentary scrutiny. With the introduction of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations in 2009, the committee thought it timely to investigate the implementation of the national funding agreements under this new approach. The states and territories are responsible for delivering services and infrastructure in key areas of our economy through federal funds. There is a community expectation that the Commonwealth will account for those funds and ensure that we are not only achieving value for money but importantly achieving the outcomes sought under the national funding agreements. The committee found that there was overall support for the new framework and its underlying principles and intent, the key changes being the shift from an inputs based to an outcomes based framework. However, the evidence of the witnesses identified shortcomings and complexities in the performance reporting requirements. The committee found that enhancements need to be made in the area of key performance indicators, better quality data collection and meaningful interpretation of that data. In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that, despite high-level mechanisms for parliament and the public to scrutinise the national funding agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, these mechanisms do not provide an adequate picture of national funding agreements. The committee has made a number of recommendations to enhance both the performance reporting and the scrutiny of the overall process. The committee made 15 recommendations, which go to the framework, implementation, performance reporting and scrutiny of national funding agreements. In relation to the framework, the committee recommended that the Department of Finance and Deregulation examine the interaction between the new grants framework and grant payments delivered under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. The report should propose options to remove inconsistencies and improve governance arrangements for all grants provided to states and territories. On implementation and performance reporting, the committee made a number of recommendations that will ensure more clarity around assurance requirements and performance indicators. Although witnesses outlined the importance of states and territories having flexibility in the method of achieving outcomes under the new framework, the outcomes themselves require clarity. The committee has recommended that processes be established to ensure there is clarity on the outcomes to be achieved and that these outcomes are clearly reflected in the national funding agreements. On enhancing the scrutiny of the national funding agreements, the committee has recommended that key reviews and reports of the COAG Reform Council and the Productivity Commission be tabled in parliament. The committee recognises that COAG and the COAG Reform Council are continuing to enhance the delivery of the Intergovernmental MAIN COMMITTEE Agreement on Federal Financial Relations and that a range of review activity is underway. It is hoped that the recommendations of this committee will complement those ongoing reforms. I take this opportunity to thank the chair, the member for Lyne, and all committee members for their work on this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat for their tireless work on what is a committee with a wide breadth of responsibilities and a complex workload. I also thank the Australian National Audit Office for their ongoing assistance with regard to this report and the other work of the committee. I commend the report to the House. Debate adjourned. Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12:13): I do not intend to speak at length about report 428 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 16 to 46 (2010-11). As the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne has already spoken to this report when tabling it in the last sitting of parliament last year. In this report the committee examined the following audit reports: Audits of financial statements of Australian Government entities; The Digital Education Revolution-National Secondary Schools Computer Fund, Maintenance of the defence estate; and Management of student visas. Overall, the review of the audit of financial statements showed positive results. The committee does believe there is further opportunity for improvement in transparency and has asked the Department of Finance and Deregulation to look into improving cross-agency and cross-jurisdictional financial reporting as part of the Commonwealth financial accountability review. In relation to the Digital Education Revolution, the Australian National Audit Office found that educational authorities had reported solid progress on the installation of computers, with the overall program achieving positive results and the fund set to meet its target of providing all students in years 9 to 12 with access to a computer by the start of the 2012 academic year. With questions to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the committee was also able to clarify some of the media reporting about charges being made to parents under this fund for the use of those computers. The department was able to explain how such circumstances have arisen where a school has chosen to introduce, or had already operating, a fee structure for the use of laptops or PCs in the schools. The department's explanation confirmed that the charges were not as a result of the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund and were decisions of the individual schools in relation to access of computers to other students outside of years 9 to 12 or were for other equipment that were superior to what was provided for under the fund because of the interests of the schools and where they wanted to progress in relation to their technology. So it was the individual choice of the schools but certainly not necessary for the accessing and provision of those computers. In relation to the maintenance of the Defence estate, the committee heard that improvements are being made and, to ensure these improvements continue, the committee has asked that the Department of Defence provide a status report to the committee within six months on their progress. Similarly, changes are being made to the collection and reporting of MAIN COMMITTEE student visas, and we have seen some improvements in the management of student visas. However, the committee wishes to ensure that improved outcomes are being achieved through these changes. That is why the committee has asked for a progress report on the student Visa program from both the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations within six months. The progress report will assist the committee in assessing progress in light of the government's response to two major reviews impacting the program. As stated for the member for Lyne in tabling this report, overall the inquiry has demonstrated that Australian government departments and agencies are well positioned to continue meeting their financial management obligations and that departments are making progress in addressing outstanding issues highlighted in the Australia National Audit Office reports. In closing, I once again thank the chair and the committee members for their ongoing work on the committee. I thank the Australian National Audit Office for their ongoing support and assistance to the committee, and I especially thank the secretariat for all their hard work. I will finish by making personal mention of the committee secretary, Mr David Brunoro. David is eagerly awaiting the overdue birth of his first child. The committee wishes David and his wife well with the imminent arrival of their new baby and thanks him for his work with the committee. I understand David will be taking leave in order to spend time with his new son or daughter and his wife, and we look forward to welcoming him back to the committee in the near future. Debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Macquarie Electorate: Blue Mountains Healthcare situation concerning a lack of access to primary health care for residents in the Blue Mountains within the seat of Macquarie. The Blue Mountains, previously classified as a district of workforce shortage for general practitioners, has had its classification stripped from it by this short-sighted, incompetent Labor government. According to this government's own definition of 'district of workforce shortage', it is a geographical area of Australia in which the population's need for health care has not yet been met. This government has taken it upon itself to decide that the Blue Mountains population's need for health care has been met. Reality begs to differ. The national benchmark for GPs to population as at 2010 is one general practitioner per 1,113 people. In the Blue Mountains, the doctor-population ratio is one for 1,284 people. The disparity between the national benchmark and the ratio experienced in the Blue Mountains has real effects felt by general practitioners and residents, many of whom have contacted me to express their concern over the growing need for more doctors in our region. Statistics will speak the truth, even if this government will not. By not reaching the national benchmark the Blue Mountains population's need for primary health care is not being met. What is the government doing about it? This government is making it even tougher for general practices to attract doctors by taking away any incentive for metropolitan or international GPs to move to rural and regional areas to ease the burden and support the MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Ansto Facility At Lucas Heights Which Is In My Neighbouring Electorate Of Hughes And We
205,Mr Husic (Chifley,Government Whip) (12:18): I move:,181,Adjournment
206,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (12:18,"I rise today to draw attention to an alarmingpopulation's health care. What does this mean? Hospitals are being burdened, yet it is for this reason that the government set up its miracle cure for GP superclinics, designed to medicate the nation's woes by providing access to health care in rural areas. The Springwood GP superclinic is set to open officially any day now, approximately 18 months behind schedule. In 2008 the Rudd government allocated up to $5 million to set up the clinic-an expensive exercise that promised greater access for Blue Mountain residents to primary health care. True to form the promise of the Labor government of the day was not delivered. Yes, the clinic was built; yes, the clinic is operational; and yes, $5 million of infrastructure is sitting at Springwood virtually empty as it struggles to attract GPs to the rural practice because of the incentives stripped from it when the government no longer considered the Blue Mountains as a district of workforce shortage. This government has built a clinic that is hardly super, with about half of the GPs it anticipated. The Rudd-Gillard government's fairytale of access to primary health care for all Australians hit a snag, created by itself, with the very idea of the superclinic policy contradicted by more bad policy. The coalition strongly supports general practice as the cornerstone of primary health care. Stripping general practice of any means for it to provide primary health care acts in direct contravention of the reason it exists-to provide healthcare services to the community. This government has dictated to the people of the Blue Mountains that its healthcare needs are being met with no recognition for reality. Now, under the GP superclinics' sidekick, the Medicare Local program, the government is dictating to the population which GPs it can and cannot access through restrictions on rebates to general practice based on geographical limitations. This government has made many areas of life for everyday Australians tough. This area of concern is no exception. The population suffers, general practices suffer, burdened hospitals suffer and $5 million worth of infrastructure sits professionally under-resourced. This is a classic example of the talent this government has for bungling policy. It makes no sense and it is severely disadvantaging Australia's primary healthcare system. We have a community both in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury where the professional expertise is ageing. We have a number of GPs who have recently retired or who are about to retire. We have many practices that have closed their books. It is a challenge for individuals and for the population in general and, indeed, for the general practices to actually respond to the needs of their community. I bring this to the attention of the House and I call on the government to resolve the matter urgently. Wilson, Mr Michael parliament I have spoken about the work of our police in protecting the community. Indeed, on Police Remembrance DayI specifically spoke about those police officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in serving our community. TodayI speak about another amazing and dedicated group of people who make invaluable contributions in respect to the safety and well-being of our society. Ambulance officers play a vital role in modern society, but it is not without a high degree of personal risk and sacrifice. While most of us were at home enjoying Christmas Eve with our families, Michael Wilson, a paramedic with the New South Wales ambulance service was part of a special casualty MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Adjournment
207,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (12:23,"The House will appreciate that on many occasions in thisaccess team and was engaged in a helicopter rescue mission involving two people at the base of Carrington Falls, south of Sydney. SCAT had received advice from the Australian search and rescue service that a distress beacon had been activated and SCAT was requested to respond. This 41-year-old father of three was an extraordinary man; clearly, a man of great courage and part of a highly trained team of men and women committed to serving our community. With over 15 years experience in the New South Wales ambulance service, he was dedicated to saving lives. Michael Wilson received many awards and commendations for his acts of bravery. He was not only a highly respected paramedic but an exemplar to his profession. During the rescue on Christmas Eve, Michael was being lowered from a helicopter when, inexplicably, he appears to have fallen and become wedged between two boulders. When he slammed into the rocks Michael sustained critical injuries. Unable to free himself the helicopter line had to be cut. Given the hour and the emerging darkness, this meant that Michael could not receive assistance until a fellow paramedic, Tim Thisleton, was able to abseil down a rock face. Tragically, Michael died in his friend's arms. Michael Wilson's death was the first time in more than three decades that a New South Wales ambulance officer was killed on duty. I had the honour of attending his funeral, along with hundreds of friends from the ambulance service, police force, fire and emergency service personnel and a veritable sea of blue flying suits, worn by the men and women of the helicopter rescue service. Sydney's St James church was literally swamped by those wanting to pay their respect to an heroic and extraordinary man who did extraordinary things for our community. For many years my brother, Gerard, was also a paramedic in the New South Wales ambulance service, which gives for me a more poignant perspective to this dreadful accident. Not only was there a deep and profound sense of loss by Michael's family, and the great sadness borne by his friends and work colleagues, this tragic death causes us to reflect on Michael's role and that of all members of the New South Wales ambulance service. Clearly, Michael Wilson epitomised the very qualities that the community is rightly proud of. I speak of the honour, the dedication and the commitment to his profession. For our ambulance officers this often goes unrecognised or, worse, taken for granted until we need their assistance. Notwithstanding the inherent risks and challenges, these men and women accept their duty and do what is necessary to save lives. It takes a special type of person to undertake this role, and on behalf of a very grateful community I thank them. Michael Wilson made a difference for the better in our community, and his family is right to be immensely proud of his contribution. I offer my most sincere condolences to Michael's wife, Kellie, his daughters, Eliza and Grace, and his son, Hugo. On behalf of this parliament I assure them that he will not be forgotten. The incredible courage, commitment and dedication to service that Michael showed will serve as an inspiration to us all. May Michael Wilson rest in peace. Cystic Fibrosis breathing through a straw 24 hours a day. I have tried it for 10 minutes, and it is not easy. That is one of the reasons why I will attend the Macarthur annual swimathon for cystic fibrosis in my electorate this weekend. MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Adjournment
208,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (12:27,"They say that living with cystic fibrosis is likeCystic fibrosis is the most common life-threatening recessive genetic condition affecting Australian children and young adults today. There are 3,000 people in Australia living with the condition, which clogs internal organs, including the lungs and the pancreas, with thick, sticky mucus. This seriously affects breathing and congestion. People with CF require daily intensive chest physiotherapy to help break up the mucus in their lungs so that they can breathe. They also take up to 40 enzyme tablets each day to help with digestion, just to survive. Sadly, one in every 2,500 babies is born with CF. There are 1 million genetic carriers of CF in Australia. Unfortunately there is no cure, and many children who have the condition do not reach adulthood. In my electorate tonight a launch party will be held at Camden Valley Inn, and on Saturday the swimathon for cystic fibrosis will be held at the Wollondilly Community Leisure Centre. Over the past four years Macarthur has raised more than $140,000 for Cystic Fibrosis New South Wales, a great achievement by everyone involved. In recent weeks I have felt very proud to see my community come together again to donate auction items and sponsorship to raise funds for this important cause. The event is run entirely by local people who have formed a committee led by the local Fairfax community newspapers for Camden, Narellan, Wollondilly and Macarthur advertisers. I would particularly like to mention the platinum and gold sponsors of this year's event: Hennings Jewellers, Peter Jermyn, DA Global, Plus Fitness, Camden Valley Inn, Byrons Chartered Accountants, Xstrata Coal, the Advertiser newspapers , Macarthur BEC, Illawarra Coal, FDC Construction, the TRN Group, Lifehouse Church Camden, Wollondilly Community Leisure Centre, Sharon's Photography, Macarthur Castles, Tahmoor Lions Club and Framing Beautiful. Without these sponsors the event would not be as successful as it is. On SaturdayI will take part in the swimathon as a member of Team Lozza. This team swims to support Lauren Rowe from Raby who lives with CF. Doctors gave Lauren 12 months to live when she was 19 years old unless she received a double lung transplant. Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, I am sure you would agree that being told you are going to die is not something any teenager should have to hear. But Lauren never gave up hope. Her story is one of great courage and determination. Before her transplant Lauren was confined to the lounge, attached to an oxygen tank and suffering terribly with lung bleeds. She dreamt of a brighter future where she would be able to take in a deep breath, go for a walk or simply spend time with her friends and family. Considering her circumstances, staying so positive would not have been easy, but Lauren showed great courage in the face of adversity and she never gave up hope. On 31 March 2010 Lauren received the news that she had been waiting for-a match had been found . She received her life-saving surgery. After many painful and difficult complications with her new lungs Lauren pulled through ready for her new life. I am very pleased to say that two years later Lauren is now living her life to the fullest. She is making the most out of every day, a promise she made whilst waiting for her transplant. Sadly, Lauren's story is not one of a kind. In fact, she is one of 80 people in Macarthur and 3,000 people in Australia living with this life-threatening condition. I would like to take this opportunity to mention some of the courageous kids from my electorate who fight this battle every day: Julia Free; Corey Harvey; Tonia Dempsey; Jaylee Booshand; Lauren Rowe; Alden and Euan Keogh; Jessica Clements; Nicholas McNeill; Mitch Riley; Sue Briscoe; and MAIN COMMITTEE Mitchell, Ashleigh and Jordan Bradney. Their courage, despite the terrible hand they have been dealt, is truly inspiring, especially in such young children. While most kids their age wished for iPads and iPods this Christmas, these guys make the same wish every year: that someone will find a cure for cystic fibrosis. This is why the Macarthur community continues to come together to help raise money and support some of our bravest young residents. Today, I would like to congratulate everyone who has helped organise this fantastic event and all those who are taking part. I would also like to thank those who have sponsored me for my swim on Saturday. Luckily no-one sponsored me per lap, but some have donated on the proviso that I wear the Team Lozza uniform, which includes fluro pink tights. I think this will cost them a lot more money! I feel very proud to be part of a community of people who care so much about each other that they come together to organise such a positive event each year. Cystic fibrosis can be a very isolating condition, with sufferers not allowed to spend time with each other due to the dangers of cross-infection. That is why it is important for those people living with CF in my electorate to have the entire community standing behind them, a community that shares the same wish: that someday soon CF will stand for one thing-'cure found'. Economy centre for any government and any country. Good economic management is one of them. There is now absolutely no doubt that this Gillard Labor government are very good economic managers and have done an excellent job in managing the Australian economy. Anyone who is interested-and that should be everybody; every Australian should be interested-should take a little bit of time to look at the evidence, the hard data, the facts that are on the table. Australia now leads the world in every economic indicator of good economic management and of good government, be it debt to GDP, our national debt, home ownership, employment or unemployment, skills and education, the way healthcare is managed or our business conditions and the viability of business in Australia. You only have to look to the OECD. But do not stop there. I would encourage people to go much further than the OECD and look at every other economic indicator that is out in the market from every credible organisation. Have a look for yourself at just what is happening in this country. We are the lucky country. In fact, we have never been a luckier country. You have to go back to the golden era of the 1950s to find comparable economic conditions, economic management, prosperity and potential, and all the other indicators that show that this is a great country. It is managed well and there is much evidence of that. Unemployment is at record to near record lows in tough economic times. Do not forget that you need to juxtapose how well Australia is running with what is happening not only in our own backyard, our region of the Asia-Pacific, but in every other country in the world. It would be hard-I would say impossible-to find any other country or economy that is doing as well as ours, on so many indicators. You could always find one indicator that might say that some other country is in front of us. But on so many indicators you would find none. In fact, it has been said many times by other economies, other governments and other treasurers that they would hack off an arm and a leg to have an economy as strong as the Australian economy. MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Adjournment
209,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12:32,"There are a number of key issues which are front andSome people out in the community have been misled, though. If you listened to the opposition, you would think it was all doom and gloom and that you may as well close the shop, close the doors and sit at home waiting for doom and gloom. The opposition talk about only one thing-that is, potentially how bad everything could be, in the face of all the evidence that is quite clear. Recently Australia, with its well-managed and disciplined fiscal strategy, was for the first time ever in its history, in tough conditions, awarded a AAA rating from all three global rating agencies. I think that says something not only about the Australian economy but about the Labor Gillard government and the way in which we manage the economy. I want to make a comparison between the way the federal government is operating and the contribution from the Queensland government and the good work they have both been doing in not only very tough times but good economic conditions in Queensland. But there is a risk to that because on 24 March there will be an election in Queensland. The risk is that people will change government and potentially end that economic growth and development. I want to talk briefly about Mr Campbell Newman, who is running to be the premier, if he is elected in the state seat that he is running for. We know his record: a tunnel that went broke, with every single investor-ordinary mums and dads-losing every single dollar that they put in. That was an enormous cost to individuals, as well as to the Brisbane city taxpayers. There is also a bike scheme which, as much as I am in support of that, is unfortunately being mismanaged. This failed scheme is actually costing ratepayers $38,000 a week. And, after seven weeks of the biggest floods in Queensland's history, we see a city council mayor get up and leave, pack his bags and say, 'I'm not interested in Brisbane anymore; I'm going to go and do something else.' But he has a record, particularly in the private sector. He also says he is in touch with the regions, because he had his time at Grainco. Let us have a quick look at Grainco. What has Mr Newman done for the shareholders of Grainco? He has done a lot for them-mostly lose their money! His record of failure, from the time when he started at Grainco in 1997, has been that of a rapid decline. Shares went from 5c to zero, his claimed profits were just not substantiated, certainly not in company records, while crops were at their best in 10 years, and he made record losses. I am saying to the people of Queensland: on 24 March, when you consider how important your vote is, look at his track record and history(Time expired) Victorian Bushfires President Abraham Lincoln spoke of the 'mystic chords of memory' that bind communities together. Those magic strands of reminiscence were interwoven this past weekend in my electorate of Casey as hundreds of people assembled to mark one of Australia's worse natural disasters in living memory. Last weekend a group of Yarra Valley residents organised a Black Saturday remembrance cruise to mark the third anniversary of the inferno that claimed 173 Victorian lives. Two of my constituents, Stacey and Troy Kinsmore, run a classic car restoration business in Lilydale. On that horrible day in 2009 they lost two very close friends, Kate Ansett and Steve Fisher. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Adjournment
210,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (12:38,"In his first inaugural address, former United StatesStacey and Troy came up with an idea that would express both their passion and their grief. The plan was simple: on the closest Saturday to the anniversary of Black Saturday, a convoy of cars and motorcycles would make its way through the Yarra Valley communities which were ravaged by the fires. This past weekend I joined the convoy of over 400 vehicles that set out from Lilydale, along the Maroondah Highway. With our headlights switched on as a mark of respect, we travelled onto the Melba Highway, through Yarra Glen, Dixons Creek and Steels Creek and then turned right through Toolangi and Chum Creek to Healesville, following the scorched earth path that burned through our communities and our hearts 1,092 days earlier. All along the way, local residents assembled by the roadside. Of course, more than a few tears were shed. By six o'clock the remembrance cruise had assembled in Healesville, where participating cars and bikes were on display. Stacey's sister Wendy Bennett recited a lovely poem. Yarra Ranges Councillor Jeanette McRae then called for a moment's silence and read the names of each of the 12 locals who perished that horrible day. The events of Black Saturday will be forever etched in all of our minds. I remember watching from my balcony at Chirnside Park that afternoon as the massive mushroom of smoke gathered over Kinglake to the north-west as gale-force winds swept the flames into the Yarra Valley, with embers landing like meteors and then consuming homes and destroying lives. It was both frightening and sobering. The scope of this catastrophe served as a reminder of the powerful wrath of nature. But the fires and their aftermath of course also showcased the triumph of courage and spirit, as we know-the triumph of basic human decency that has been so abundant throughout the Yarra Valley. It was on display as the inferno raged when firefighters, police and ordinary citizens put life and limb at risk to save not only their neighbours and their friends but also to rescue those they had never met. It was on display in the aftermath as well, as entire communities came together to relieve, rebuild and remember. Perhaps this was best exemplified by the relief centre at Yarra Glen that was organised spontaneously by local residents and served as a vital hub for the community. I had the opportunity to engage in a bit of quiet reflection on the drive and, as the soft summer afternoon light slowly faded to dusk, I was reminded of Catholic philosopher Dorothy Day, who said, 'We can throw a pebble in a pond and be confident that its everwidening circle will reach all around the world.' Through the Black Saturday remembrance cruise, Stacey Kinsmore threw a pebble into a pond hoping for a ripple-but she generated a wave. Last weekend's cruise did not limit itself solely to repairing the soul and the spirit; it had a tangible aspect as well. Participants raised close to $10,000 for the Healesville Country Fire Authority. Stacey Kinsmore was overwhelmed by the success of the cruise, and rightly so. The response to her appeal for this event was indeed overwhelming, with hundreds of people answering the call to reflect, remember and rededicate. I want to extend my congratulations to her; to Troy, her husband; to her friend Jodie, who I met; to her sister Wendy who participated and to her other friends who helped so much. Congratulations also to the Rivendell group who conducted a ceremonial tree-planting and reflective walk around the new Healesville labyrinth; the Rocky Road Choir, the famous, fantastic fixture of Healesville, who sang as participants walked; to Bill and his crew from the CFA who did so much on the MAIN COMMITTEE day to provide parking, order and, of course, the sausage sizzle; and to my other council representatives, Tim Heenan and Len Cox. (Time expired) National Emergency Medal congratulations to those people involved in that, because it is an important thing, and we who stood there and watched the fire come to our doorsteps know just how terrible that was. On that note, it was a pleasure to be with the Prime Minister in Flowerdale in my electorate for the presentation of the inaugural National Emergency Medal, part of the Australia Day honours. The medal is an operational service medal which recognises significant and sustained service to others in a nationally significant emergency. The award acknowledges that there is more than one way to support a community during a crisis. AndI would like to pay tribute to two outstanding recipients of the award from my community: Helen Kenney and Dr Anne Leadbeater. In 2009 Anne was a community facilitator for the Murrindindi Shire before that fateful day, and she had just finished her master's thesis on disaster relief. How timely was that? During Black Saturday and the following weeks and months, Anne was a linchpin for the community and various agencies. She was a one-stop shop, organising and initiating comfort and communication. She brought structure and process to the chaotic situation. She managed to organise regular community meetings where people could access down-to-earth, credible information, and where the emergency services could pass on their consistent message to the community and coordinate their work. There is also Helen Kenney, who until last year was the captain of the St Andrews CFA. For 12 years, Helen as captain of the local CFA was a community leader defending her area in times of crisis. I know that she leaves behind an extremely proud legacy. Helen is an amazing person. She is short in stature but big in heart. You probably would not find a bigger heart in a person anywhere. I know that Helen has always been there and always been available for her community in helping them to get on with the rebuilding process. Her commitment to the CFA and to the local community are reasons why she is held in such high regard by many in our region, and her significant achievements have never gone unnoticed. On behalf of the people of McEwenI would like to thank both Anne and Helen for their goodwill to others and for their strength following what was a traumatic time for all of us. Australia Day in McEwen, as always, was a very highly rewarding experience. It is a day when all Australians can take stock of what a great country we live in. I started the day at the Wallan Neighbourhood House breakfast, and I want to thank two great contributors to the Wallan community in Dot Evans and Pauline Cornish. Their dedication and spirit symbolises everything that is great about Australia Day: bringing the community together for a mandatory barbecue breakfast, some flag-waving, some song-singing and the recognition of great people. I then went off to the citizenship ceremony at the town hall in Kyneton, in the Macedon Ranges. The Macedon Ranges are a great feature of the McEwen electorate. They also suffered fires on Ash Wednesday, back in 1983. I was honoured to be there to present a Community Achievement Award to McEwen residents Jean Dixon, Eane Whitton, Felicity Morley and Vanessa Meredith.

He continued to go to university and continued to raise the family and keep the family unit together. It is an absolutely amazing story and he was very well deserving of the award. The Citizen of the Year Award went to Janet Hawkins, who is also an amazing person with her time and commitments and what she does for everyone. The Community Event of the Year went to the Gisborne Olde Time Market. It is a great fixture to come and see in the Gisborne community. There are lots of laughs, lots of fun and lots of things that you take your wife to where she empties out your pockets as she fills up with stuff and brings it home. It is a fantastic place. I also attended another citizenship ceremony in South Morang. South Morang is a growing community that is diverse in multiculturalism. I am continually amazed that, despite the growth and new people moving in, it has retained its character and charm. Australia Day is a day on which we can all be proud of who we are. We spend it with friends and family, preparing for the year ahead. As always, Australia Day in McEwen emulates that spirit. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as I always do, and the many community events in my area that I get the pleasure to attend. Gippsland Electorate: Fishing Licence Fees and Regulations increase in licence fees charged by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to commercial fishing operators in my electorate. It has come to my attention that AFMA fees have increased to such an extent that they are threatening the future viability of fishermen in the region. At least one person has indicated that the increase in fees has been so exorbitant that it will be uneconomical for them to continue in their small business. By way of explanation, in the past three years the licence fee for that particular business has increased from $5,287 to $7,138, and this year it is to increase further to $14,183. I am struggling to think of any other business that has had to bear such exorbitant fee increases in such a short period of time. As a small operator they have decided that it is simply not worth going to sea just to pay a licence fee to the government. Another account has been provided to me by a larger operator who has had an increase in fees from $35,000 to $45,000 in one calendar year. This particular operator wrote to me and said: The only explanation I can get for the increase is that management costs have risen. In recent years the Lakes co-opThat is, the Lakes Entrance co-ophas participated in a three year co management trial with AFMA in a bid to reduce the costs of management. This effort and the results seem to have been largely ignored and brushed aside. If these increases were to continue at this rate it would make it extremely hard to run a profitable business as we are unable to pass the costs on. The increase also impacts the income of our crew as their wages are based on a percentage of the catch. It seems as if AFMA are unable to run to their allocated budgets and the industry is being forced to cover the shortfall. It is impossible for fishermen to budget with any certainty whatsoever when they are hit with such exorbitant fee increases. The fishermen simply cannot pass on these costs to consumers because they operate in a market based system, and I fear the local economy will suffer considerably if the individual operators have less disposable income. MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Adjournment
212,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (12:47,"I rise to raise concerns about the extraordinaryBy way of background, Lakes Entrance is home to one of Australia's largest and most diverse fishing fleets, with an average of about 6,000 tonnes per year landed at the port by Commonwealth operators. As I said, every dollar the government takes in AFMA licence fees is another dollar that is not available to be spent in our town. I have written to the federal minister and urged him to intervene and help secure the future viability of the Lakes Entrance fishing industry. Keep in mind that the regional economy is already under pressure, and stripping wealth out of Lakes Entrance to prop up a bureaucracy that cannot live within its means will be a significant blow to my community. Over the years, the commercial fishing industry has been hit with a constant barrage of new challenges, ranging from cuts in their quotas to increases in fuel prices, competition from cheap overseas imports and reduced access to fishing grounds due to oil and gas activities in Bass Strait and the government imposed reserves. As one industry source said to me, 'If we continue on this path, there will be nothing left to manage.' On a separate but related topic to fishery resources, I want to take the opportunity to remind Gippslanders and visitors to my region of the need to be well informed when it comes to state government rules and regulations. As someone who has occasionally dived recreationally for abalone in the past, I have become aware of regulation changes which may not be widely known throughout the community. There are now regulations that prevent the taking of abalone from an area that is described as the intertidal zone, but for all intents and purposes the intertidal zone means water less than two metres deep. As I found out, to considerable personal expense, fisheries officers are patrolling the Gippsland coast and will issue on-the-spot infringement notices for any breaches. Of course, ignorance of these regulations is no defence for any recreational diver and I have paid my on-the-spot fines, but it is timely to remind all recreational fishermen to keep abreast of these changes. I thought I was quite well informed of these regulations about the need to hold a current recreational fishing licence, the revised bag limits and the catch sizes, but I was totally unaware of the two-metre ruling and the need to carry a flat-headed device for removing abalone from the rocks. As someone who reads local papers and tries to keep up with the latest in regulations it concerns me that I was not aware of these changes, which were made several years ago, so I thought I would take the time to check with other locals I knew had taken abalone in the past. From the conversations I have had in recent weeks with several of friends and colleagues, some of them parliamentarians in fact, and other recreational fishermen, anecdotally it appears that there is quite a gap in knowledge in the community and that it is quite significant. I have heard of other people who have been fined recently through lack of understanding of these and other fisheries regulations, and I believe we need to do more to make sure that everyone who plans to take marine life is better informed. Managing our fisheries is a serious issue, which I think members on both sides of the House take seriously, and the enforcement officers have a very important job to do. But there is also a need to make sure we improve the education and awareness about regulations, particularly when those regulations change. It does not help, of course, when signage which has been erected for that purpose at popular recreational areas such as Cape Conran, where I was visiting, has been vandalised to the extent that it is actually unreadable. But there are other sources of information and I refer people to websites and to the recreational fishing MAIN COMMITTEE licence handbook, which is updated regularly. I would urge all recreational fishermen to get a copy and familiarise themselves with it for the species they are targeting. (Time expired) Economy not had an idea that John Howard did not think of first. When it comes to the economy, it is pretty clear that Tony Abbott is committed to relying upon a very faulty memory of what they perceive to be the golden years of the Howard government when reality seems to suggest otherwise. They were called out on this big-time by Malcolm Farr in recent times when he basically matched up the claims we are hearing from the other side of politics versus the reality. I think it is important to look back on those years when the Howard government was in place and see how they actually performed as so-called economic managers. Remember that we have had Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah sayrefer to members by their seat and their title. you for using my time! I want to go back and pick up, for example, the claim by the member for Warringah in his National Press Club speech when he said, 'We've done it before and we'll do it again; after all, 16 members of the current shadow cabinet were ministers in the Howard government.' A ringing endorsement, that! So let us go through some of the claims. Let us look at the inflation rate. In late 2007, inflation was just under four per cent and late last year it was under three per cent. The tax take took up 24 per cent of national output in the peaks under the coalition and is headed for 21 per cent under this government. Official interest rates, for only six months of the 11 years of the Howard government, were as low as the current 4.5 per cent, perhaps dropping to four in due course. Again, Mr Farr quotes the member for Warringah: At the heart of our plan for a stronger economy is getting government spending down … When you look at the figures you will see that, in 11 years of coalition government, there was not one year in which government spending was reduced. It grew by an average of 3.7 per cent in the final five years of the coalition government. Mr Farr goes on: Current projections for spending growth have an average of 1.5 per cent. It is worth bearing in mind fiscal consolidation, the amount of money cut out of the budget$22 billion in one year alone, the highest in 40 years under the coalition government. As for fond memories, Mr Farr says: … you don‘t put into the economic equation a global recession which took more than $140 billion from the tax revenueof this government. In fact, the coalition will, for example, point to the deficits and completely airbrush out of history the fact that there was an economic catastrophe that people had not before witnessed, the worse in 75 years, in the shape of the global financial crisis. Yet they are quick to say to us that we need to remember the Asian economic crisis. Importantly, one cannot get away from the fact that the GFC had such an impact. I am also quite puzzled as to how the coalition, which is fond of turning up to the opening of schools which have benefited from Building the Education Revolution funding, hasten to then criticise it the minute they step off the grounds of those schools. Again, it is worth noting MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Adjournment

214,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,I would remind the member for Chifley to,191,Adjournment
215,Mr Husic,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I had already corrected myself-and thankthat, under the coalition, the Regional Partnerships program ran for eight years and, as Mr Farr says: 'It made the BER scheme look like a well-oiled economic mechanism of integrity and efficiency.' For example: The BER never funded a Queensland coastal hotel which boasted gaming and strippers, but a 2005 Senate inquiry was toldthat that was exactly what the Howard government's Regional Partnerships program did. Again, it is important to note that this Labor government took action to move quickly to respond to the GFC. As a result there was higher growth, lower unemployment, lower inflation and economic credentials that were the envy of most advanced economies. Imagine if we had listened to those opposite, who said they would have spent less, who would have modelled and would have done what Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, indicated in February 2010 that they would do. He said, 'We should be spending less.' That was his prescription for the GFC. He was not prepared to lead a coalition that would argue that, at its worse point, the economy needed the injection of cash that was required to keep it buoyant. They need to be called out for their failure on the economy. Media Ownership media ownership. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know my long standing interest in this matter. At the heart of our democracy is the need for fair and balanced media reporting. Last week I, along with many Australians, was very concerned that the wealthiest citizen of Australia signalled her intention to acquire a controlling interest or to engage in a full takeover of our second largest media company in Australia, Fairfax. I think there is an urgent need for Ms Rinehart to indicate that this is a friendly takeover, to maximise the benefit of its shareholders. Sadly, there are many reports in the media that this is not the case and there is a threat, potentially, if editors and journalists do not support her commercial agenda, as someone who is fiercely opposed to the minerals resource rent tax and supports global warming deniers. I think that is a terrible threat to public interest, to the future of our democracy because, as I said, at the heart of our democracy is the very need to have fair and balanced reporting. I am not saying that Miss Rinehart should not express her views-she is entitled to express the views that she has expressed-but she is not entitled to trash our democracy and remove editors and journalists if they express opinions that are contrary to the opinions that are held by her. SoI ask today that Miss Rinehart come out and indicate her intentions in relation to media ownership and let Australians know that this is a friendly takeover or controlling interest and that the public interest and our democracy will not be trashed.

216,Mr Murphy (Reid) (12:58,"I would like to raise, again, in this chamber the issue ofBroadband (Question No. 360) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 11 May 2011: (1) Can the Minister confirm that a retailer wishing to offer a voice only service will be required to pay NBN Co Limited's entry level wholesale price of $24 per month? Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian Government is committed to the continued availability of a voice-only service for those who need it. The government's retail price control framework provides a range of protections for consumers, including those on low-incomes. In conducting its review into arrangements for retail price controls, the government sought views on how low-income users should be provided with equitable access to affordable basic telecommunications services. The government is considering the submissions received in response to the review. Broadband (Question No. 491) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Will the satellite services that will be offered by NBN Co. Ltd have the capacity to provide video conferencing and interactive distance learning applications. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Long Term Satellite Service will provide service improvements and support video conferencing and large file transfers. It will have the capacity to support a range of consumer and business grade services, including interactive distance learning services such as School of the Air. As outlined in NBN Co's Corporate Plan, the Long Term Satellite Service will be engineered to deliver high-speed broadband services by using Ka-band satellites to deliver peak download speeds of 12 Mbps and upload speeds of 1 Mbps. It is expected these services will provide a broadband experience equivalent to, or better than, what many people now experience on ADSL. Further, NBN Co is also investigating the introduction of higher upload speeds of 2 Mbps with a roadmap of 4 Mbps to support business services. Attachment A which can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office provides an NBN Co information paper regarding e-health Services in Indigenous Communities and further details the expected capabilities and benefits of the Long Term Satellite Solution. This paper notes that the final long term satellite product feature set and network capabilities will be determined once vendor selection and contracts have been finalised. Broadband (Question No. 492) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Will the satellite services that will be offered by NBN Co. Ltd have the capacity to deliver the applications that are currently delivered over satellite for interactive distance learning at the School of the Air and the Northern Territory Open Education Centre in the Northern Territory; if so, will these interactive distance learning services continue to receive government funding. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Mr Jim Hassell, Head of Product Development and Sales at NBN Co, advised in response to a Joint Committee on the NBN hearing on 27 July 2011 that the Interim Satellite Service would not affect the satellite network currently used by the Northern Territory School of the Air. Mr Hassell stated that: What they've already got in place, as I understand it anyway, is that they have the separate School of the Air network... It's not run over a standard network, it's a separate piece of infrastructure, it's a separate satellite dish that people have in their own homes and it's a completely separate service which is actually been designed to deliver remote education. With our interim solution we had to take internet capacity which is currently available in the market and use that. But when we launch our own we have greatly increased the capacity and we build on that our business grade services which is a whole range of kind of different service level commitment which allows you to give that kind of service. (www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-01/school-of-the-air-faces-long-wait-for-nbn-benefits/2818784).

Funding for School of the Air is a responsibility of State and Territory Governments. healthdirect Australia (Question No. 623) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 21 September 2011: For each month since July 2007, how many calls have been made to healthdirect Australia. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: The most appropriate healthdirect Australia call volume category to assess the number of calls made to healthdirect Australia is 'Calls Received'. A total of 2,706,687 calls were received by healthdirect Australia from 1 July 2007 until 30 November 2011. Calls received by healthdirect Australia for each month since July 2007 until November 2011 are identified in the table below.

(2) To whom within (a) his department, and (b) the Australian Army, did the Pentagon release its report. (3) On what date did the office of the Chief of Army receive the report, and from whom. (4) On what date did the (a) Minister's office receive the report, and from whom, and (b) Minister receive the report. (5) Is he able to indicate the reason for the delay in providing to the families of the three dead soldiers, a copy of the Pentagon's report. Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A classified copy of a United States (US) Report into the helicopter crash on 21 June 2010 was available to the Australian Inquiry Officer who conducted the Australian Inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths of Private Tim Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer. A copy of this classified US report was included in the evidence supporting the Australian Inquiry, which was completed in late 2010. This US report was provided to the Australian Inquiry Officer during the course of his Inquiry. It was not subject to a formal release process and not authorised for release at that time. Subsequently, the US Report has been provided to the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer. This US report focussed on the cause of the accident in the context of the death of the US soldier who was also killed in the incident. The Australian Inquiry Officer drew from it in preparing his report. Accordingly, in preparing to release the Australian report, both to the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer and to the public, Defence needed to ensure that classified US information was not included in the material being released. Staff level liaison with US Defence personnel to ascertain the ability to release the US material included in the Australian report commenced at the beginning of December 2010. I am advised that in January 2011, the US Army provided an unclassified copy of the US report to the next-of-kin of the US soldier who was killed in the crash. A copy of this unclassified version of the US report was not received by Australian Defence personnel until the beginning of April 2011. At that time, Australian Defence staff in Washington were advised by their US Army counterparts who provided that US report that the US Army considered the briefing of the report to the next-of-kin as public release. A copy of the unclassified US report was received by the Chief of the Defence Force's Commissions of Inquiry Directorate in Australia in mid-April 2011. The delay in obtaining the unclassified version of the US report is acknowledged. This was the first instance in which Defence has had to conduct a combat death Inquiry in conjunction with another country. There were no established protocols for this. The US report mentioned above is one of two conducted by the US. The other was focussed on air safety. An Australian Officer attended this second investigation as an observer, and a substantial body of material from that investigation was also provided to Australia. My Office received a copy of the Australian Inquiry Officer's report on 8 August 2011, under cover of a submission seeking my approval for release of the Australian report. The Chief of the Defence Force has acknowledged that the Australian report should have moved through the Department much more quickly than this. After appropriate consideration of the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force and the content of the report, I approved disclosure of the Australian Inquiry Officer's report to the families in late September. Given the potential sensitivities involved with release of the Australian report, I also discussed its release with US Defence Secretary Panetta when I met with him in Brussels at the beginning of October 2011. Following my discussion with Secretary Panetta, an Australian Army representative met with the families of Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer on 12 and 13 October 2011 to provide them with a copy of the Australian report. In relation to the US report, a copy of the unclassified US report that is the focus of this Question on Notice was provided to the families of Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer by the Australian Defence Force on 20 October 2011. It was appropriate that the Australian Defence Force used the Australian Inquiry report as the basis for informing the Australian families. So far as the delay in release of the Inquiry report is concerned, the Australian Inquiry Officer report into the Blackhawk crash was managed by a small number of staff who support the Chief of the Defence Force directly on all operational and administrative issues with regard to the deaths of Australian Defence Force members. This Directorate was not staffed with sufficient suitably qualified personnel to manage concurrent inquiries into the 10 Australians killed in action during the period June to August 2011. The Chief of the Defence Force has effected remedial actions to minimise delays to the release of inquiry reports on combat deaths in the future. These measures include:  Appointing a high calibre and experienced senior Army lawyer to lead the COI Directorate;  Appointing a non-legal Chief of Staff to provide oversight, prioritisation and monitoring of all matters that are referred to, and processed within, the Directorate;  Assigning additional legal staff resources to the directorate and strictly caveating their duty statements;  Drafting a new CDF Directive and developing a dedicated chapter in the Administrative Inquiries Manual; and  Placing the Directorate under the oversight of the recently appointed Director General Strategic Issues. While it may provide little comfort to the families, the Chief of the Defence Force has written to the families to apologise for the delay. I have apologised publicly and do so again. Broadband (Question No. 731) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 17 November 2011: Further to the Minister's answer to question in writing No. 587 (Hansard, 3 November 2011, page 109), based on what specific program objectives did the Minister conclude that each of the 18 programs failed. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Reports such as the 'Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Communications Outlook 2007' indicated that Australia continued to fall behind other OECD nations on broadband take-up, quality and price during the Coalition's 11 and a half years in government. Tourism Australia: Airline Marketing Campaigns (Question No. 733) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 17 November 2011: (1) In (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, and (c) 2010-11, what total sum did Tourism Australia contribute towards joint marketing campaigns with (a) Qantas, (b) Virgin, (c) Jetstar, and (d) other airlines, including campaign costs borne by Tourism Australia, and costs to airlines in money or in kind. (2) What total sum is Tourism Australia projected to contribute in 2011-12 towards joint marketing campaigns with (a) Qantas, (b) Virgin, (c) Jetstar, and (d) other airlines, including campaign costs borne by Tourism Australia, and costs to airlines in money or in kind. Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Each year Tourism Australia engages the support of industry partners and airlines in international cooperative marketing programs to ensure maximum leveraged state and territory government and private sector investment. Airline partnerships help to convert consumers' desire to travel to Australia into travel bookings through a combination of destination messaging in price point marketing. Tourism Australia currently has three global Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) in place, including two long-standing MoUs with Qantas, Singapore Airlines and a recently ratified agreement with Jetstar announced in October 2011. Tourism Australia's airline MoUs outline a long term spirit of cooperation and investment in international markets with each airline, usually at three-year intervals. In 2008-09, Tourism Australia directly invested $7.4 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $18.5 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 16 airlines in 36 markets in a total of 60 campaigns. In 2009-10, Tourism Australia directly invested $17 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $34.6 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 17 airlines in 32 markets in a total of 87 campaigns. In 2010-11, Tourism Australia directly invested $12.8 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $23.3 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 14 airlines in 23 markets in a total of 50 campaigns. Note: Tourism Australia's contractual agreements with airlines prevent public disclosure of annual airline investments. The values listed above do not include Tourism Australia's cooperative investment in international media hosting or other trade and business events. (2) In 2011-12, Tourism Australia's planned investment in international airline partnerships is $16.5 million AUD with a projected total investment value of $34 million AUD. In October 2011, Tourism Australia signed a $9.6 million marketing deal with Jetstar aimed at boosting Japanese inbound tourism and further expanding brand Australia's presence in the Asia Pacific. The three year agreement runs to mid 2014 and will see Tourism Australia and Jetstar each contribute at least $1.6 million per year on a range of joint marketing, digital and social media activities. Note: Tourism Australia's contractual agreements with airlines prevent public disclosure of annual airline investments. The values listed above do not include Tourism Australia's cooperative investment in international media hosting, or other trade and business events. Resources, Energy and Tourism: Travel Expenses (Question Nos 734 and 735) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 17 November 2011: In (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, and (c) 2010-11, what sum was spent on travel by his office, his department, and Tourism Australia, including the total sum per airline. Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Minister's Office Information about destinations and the cost of travel undertaken by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries is tabled in the Parliament every six months in the report Parliamentarians' Expenditure on Entitlements paid by the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance). The report also includes car transport costs as advised by other departments in respect of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. The reports and supporting information are published on the Finance website. Tourism Australia 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Total Travel $3,489,170 $2,695,777 $2,627,952 Spend Tourism Australia does not maintain records of travel costs by airline. Under Tourism Australia's travel policy, all carriers should be considered when booking air travel. As a general principle, air travel must be at best value subject to business purpose, security, safety and effectiveness of the individual. It is expected that all employees will take advantage of any advance purchase discounts offered by the airlines.

(2) What is the name of each superannuation fund contained in the clause of each modern award in part (1) that imposes an obligation on the employer to pay superannuation contributions into the employee's superannuation fund.

following extracts from a Full Bench statement in September 2008 and Full Bench decisions in December 2008 and September 2009 dealt with superannuation in modern awards: 12 September 2008 – [2008] AIRCFB 717 ""[29] We do not think it is appropriate that the Commission conduct an independent appraisal of the investment performance of particular funds. Performance will vary from time to time and even long term historical averages may not be a reliable indicator of future performance. We are prepared to accept a fund or funds agreed by the parties, provided of course that the fund meets the relevant legislative requirements."" 19 December 2008 – [2008] AIRCFB 1000: ""[90] The terms of the exposure draft concerning the default fund provision were the cause of a number of submissions from employer and employee interests, from superannuation funds and the superannuation industry. We have decided to allow as a default fund any fund to which the employer was making contributions for the benefit of employees on 12 September 2008. This approach is likely to minimise inconvenience for employers. While funds other than those provided for will not qualify as default funds employees may still exercise their right to choose in favour of these funds."" 2 September 2009 – [2009] AIRCFB 800 ""[66] In our view the nomination of default funds should be made on some readily ascertainable basis and one which does not lead to any disruption. For that reason it was decided to provide for named default funds as the primary basis. The secondary basis was any fund to which the employer was making contributions before 12 September 2008. That date was chosen because it was the date on which the exposure drafts of the priority modern awards were published. [67] A number of funds have since made applications to be included as named default funds on the basis that the fund was nominated as a default fund in an award-based transitional instrument relevant to the coverage of the modern award or on the basis that the representatives of the main parties covered by the award consent. In our view either basis would constitute a good reason for the fund being specified as a default fund in a modern award. Where such grounds exist an appropriate application could be made. We do not intend to deal with such applications, however, in this decision. [68] Returning now to the proposal that we should change the relevant date from 12 September 2008 to 1 January 2010, and assuming the proposal could be characterised as a transitional provision, we doubt whether such a variation would go the heart of the matter. Most funds voicing objection to the default fund provision did so on the basis that they are fundamentally opposed to any limitation on the ability of an employer to choose the default fund. Simply substituting one date for another would not remedy that complaint. Indeed, it might create a deal of disruption in the industry between the publication of this decision and 1 January 2010. [69] The relevant legislation provides for default funds to be included in awards. Our present view is that we should continue to provide for default funds where there is a history of award regulation of superannuation in the industry or occupation the modern award covers. It should be emphasised, however, that, self-evidently, the default fund provision only operates where the employee does not nominate a fund. The superannuation legislation enshrines the right of an employee to choose the fund into which the employer should make contributions. Consistently with the legislation the award provision does not limit an employee's right to nominate a fund. Nor does it limit the ability of superannuation funds which are not default funds to market their products to employees and employers. We have decided, on the basis of what has been put in the proceedings, not to alter the date of 12 September 2008."" [emphasis added] 114 of the 122 modern awards contain a standard clause in relation to Superannuation. The provision is reproduced below: As outlined in the Full Bench decision [[2009] AIRCFB 800] highlighted in paragraph 69 above, the provisions makes it clear that the award only nominates a default fund to be used if the employee does not choose to nominate an alternate fund. Furthermore the obligation to pay superannuation is derived from Superannuation legislation listed below, not from the modern award. 1. Superannuation (Standard clause) 1.1 Superannuation legislation (a) Superannuation legislation, including the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth), the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992 (Cth), the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth), deals with the superannuation rights and obligations of employers and employees. Under superannuation legislation individual employees generally have the opportunity to choose their own superannuation fund. If an employee does not choose a superannuation fund, any superannuation fund nominated in the award covering the employee applies. (b) The rights and obligations in these clauses supplement those in superannuation legislation. 1.2 Employer contributions An employer must make such superannuation contributions to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee as will avoid the employer being required to pay the superannuation guarantee charge under superannuation legislation with respect to that employee. 1.3 Voluntary employee contributions (a) Subject to the governing rules of the relevant superannuation fund, an employee may, in writing, authorise their employer to pay on behalf of the employee a specified amount from the post-taxation wages of the employee into the same superannuation fund as the employer makes the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0. (b) An employee may adjust the amount the employee has authorised their employer to pay from the wages of the employee from the first of the month following the giving of three months' written notice to their employer. (c) The employer must pay the amount authorised under clauses 0 or 0 no later than 28 days after the end of the month in which the deduction authorised under clauses 0 or 0 was made. 1.4 Superannuation fund Unless, to comply with superannuation legislation, the employer is required to make the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0 to another superannuation fund that is chosen by the employee, the employer must make the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0 and pay the amount authorised under clauses 0 or 0 to one of the following superannuation funds or its successor: (a) Name(s) of default fund; or (b) any superannuation fund to which the employer was making superannuation contributions for the benefit of its employees before 12 September 2008, provided the superannuation fund is an eligible choice fund.

Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Each reporting unit within a registered organisation is required to keep proper financial records with respect to its transactions and financial position. Sections 253 and 254 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 require a reporting unit to prepare general purpose financial reports and operating reports. In particular, under subsection 254 (2) (d), the operating report must give details (including details of the position held) of any officer or member of the reporting unit who is a trustee, or is a director of a company that is a trustee, of a superannuation entity or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme but only where eligibility for the officer or member being a trustee or director prescribes that the officer or member is an officer or member of a registered organisation. Failure to comply with this section can attract civil penalties. Fair Work Australia has made an inquiry under section 330 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 of the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia as to whether subsection 254(d) has been complied with and is awaiting a response. Centrelink: Concession Cards (Question No. 740) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 21 November 2011: In respect of Centrelink concession cards, (a) why do they not contain photo identification, and (b) has she received reports of (i) cards being used by family and friends, (ii) cards being used when scanned or photocopied, (iii) cards being used after they have expired, and (iv) multiple cards, and/or addresses, and/or names being connected to one person; if so, what actions have been or are being taken to prevent such card misuse. Mr Brendan O'Connor: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The main reason concession cards do not have photo identification is cost. Costs would be incurred in several ways. There are more than five million existing card holders. Of these, a minimum of 22 per cent would be subject to renewal during a year. This figure excludes new grants and replacement cards. Cards are also commonly reissued when a customer changes address, name or payment types. (b) Yes, reports have been received of alleged misuse. The following arrangements are in place to mitigate against misuse:  All cards have provision for a signature. A signature is only one method of determining that the person using a concession card is the person entitled to use it. This does not preclude a concession provider from seeking supporting evidence if they have any doubt about the identity of the person presenting the card;  If a concession provider has doubts about the person's identity, they are within their rights to ask for more identification, such as driver's licence which does include a photograph. It is up to the concession provider to decide whether to offer the concession;  When a customer changes their name, the Department of Human Services requires the change request in writing and in some cases, evidence to verify that they intend to use this new name in the community. Examples would include an Automatic Teller Machine card with the new name, a marriage certificate or driver's licence showing the changed name.  Provided they meet the respective qualifications, customers are allowed to hold multiple cards. Different cards can provide varying concessions, with some being restricted to cardholders and others being extended to partners and dependants. One example would be a customer who can hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card as well as a Low Income Health Care Card;  Concessions may be available not only to the card holder but also to other family members, for example dependent children and sometimes partners. The concession validation systems (detailed below) provide those details for the concession providers to enable concessions to be extended to those family members, where eligible;  The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Concession Entitlement Validation or PBS Online enables pharmacies to confirm whether a customer has concession entitlements for the provision of PBS prescriptions. This involves matching the customer's identity between Medicare and Centrelink. The customer has to present both their Medicare card and Centrelink concession card at point of purchase to allow this electronic confirmation. There is information on the Medicare website about obtaining concessions under the PBS – ""Is your concession valid today"". The Medicare Safety Net is the other part of the Concession Entitlement Validation system, where details about the customer's identity, concession status and details of any Family Tax Benefit PartA payments are provided to Medicare from Centrelink;  The Centrelink Confirmation eService is an online system designed to provide approved organisations with the means to verify and confirm that a cardholder has concession entitlements. Approved organisations include councils, transport authorities, water authorities, education authorities, banks, legal aid services, health services, welfare agencies, energy authorities, telecommunication authorities. Organisations must register with the Department of Human Services by completing a Deduction and Confirmation Services Business Application form. There is information and application forms on the Department of Human Services Centrelink website by searching ""CCeS"";and  Confirmation of concession entitlement (or interim voucher) can be issued to customers to validate concession card entitlements where a customer has lost their concession card or has just been granted a concession card and needs to claim concession entitlements urgently before their new or replacement card arrives. It can also be requested by a customer if they are having trouble obtaining their concessions from the concession providers. Commonwealth Debt (Question No. 744) Mr Robb asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 21 November 2011: (1) What sum was the Australian Government's total gross debt (a) when the 2007-08 Budget was delivered, and (b) on 17 November 2011. (2) What is the percentage of growth in gross Government debt between the two periods in part (1), and can the Minister indicate how this percentage compares to that of OECD countries including Germany, France, Italy, the United States, Spain, Norway, Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Israel and Chile. (3) In which financial year does the Government estimate it will reach the new Commonwealth debt ceiling of $250 billion. (4) Is the Government considering increasing the debt ceiling beyond $250 billion. (5) Between the two periods in part (1), what total sum of interest has the Commonwealth paid on its total borrowings. (6) What is the latest estimate for the (a) Government retiring all Commonwealth net debt, and (b) Federal Budget's 'structural deficit'; and as a percentage of GDP, how does this compare with other OECD countries. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the 2007-08 Budget, the market value of Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) on issue as at 30 June 2008 was estimated to be $59.3 billion. The market value of CGS is not available on a daily basis. In the 2011-12 MYEFO, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2012 was estimated to be $253.5 billion. (2) In the 2007-08 Budget, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2008 as a percentage of GDP was estimated to be 5.0 per cent ($59.3 billion). In the 2011-12 MYEFO, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2012 as a percentage of GDP was estimated to be 17.0 per cent ($253.5 billion). The percentage point change in CGS between 2007-08 and 2011-12 is 12.0 per cent. According to IMF data and estimates, between 2007 and 2011 general government gross debt in select OECD countries changed by the following: General government gross debt (as % of GDP) 2007 2011* Percentage point change from 2007 to 2011 Australia# 5.0 17.0 12.0 Chile 4.1 10.5 6.4 France 64.2 86.9 22.7 2007 2011* Percentage point change from 2007 to 2011 Germany 65.0 82.6 17.6 Iceland 29.1 101.2 72.1 Ireland 24.9 109.3 84.4 Israel 78.1 71.1 -7.0 Italy 103.6 121.1 17.5 New Zealand 17.4 35.3 17.9 Norway 58.6 55.4 -3.2 Spain 36.1 67.4 31.3 United Kingdom 43.9 80.8 36.9 United States 62.3 100.0 37.7 *IMF estimate. # Note: Australian data is for the Australian Government general government sector, is sourced from the Budget papers and refers to financial years 2007-08 and 2011-12. Data for all other economies is for the total government sector and refer to calendar years beginning 2007 and 2011. Source: IMF Fiscal Monitor September 2011, 2007-08 Budget and 2011-12 MYEFO. (3) and (4) Information on the end-of-year market value of CGS on issue for the years 2011-12 to 201415 is published in Table B2 of the 2011-12 MYEFO. The face value of CGS on issue for the equivalent end of year period is expected to be lower than the market value for the years 2011-12 to 2014-15. The Government does not have any plans to amend the legislative limit and will continue to monitor the size of the CGS market. (5) The interest expense on CGS for the years 2007-08 to 2010-11 is published in Note 10 of the Final Budget Outcome for those years. The estimated interest expense on CGS for 2011-12 is reported in Note 10 of the 2011-12 MYEFO. (6). (a) The updated medium term budget projections included in the 2011-12 MYEFO show that the budget position is projected to improve over the medium term with net debt projected to return to zero in 2020-21. (b) Treasury's latest estimates of the Australian Federal structural budget balance, as well as detailed descriptions of the underlying methodology and assumptions, were published in the October 2010 Treasury Roundup article. For international comparisons, the IMF and OECD produce estimates of structural budget balances (including Australia's) across all levels of government in their Fiscal Monitor and Economic Outlook publications. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: Pradaxa (Question No. 746) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 22 November 2011: (1) Is she aware that approximately 300,000 Australians at risk of severe and disabling stroke would benefit greatly from the listing of the medicine dabigatran (Pradaxa®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); if so, why is she deferring the listing of Pradaxa on the PBS. (2) Why has she called for another inquiry into the efficacy of Pradaxa when similar work has already been performed and the drug approved for listing by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. (3) Will she provide a detailed breakdown for the basis of her claim in her press release from 30 September 2011 that listing Pradaxa on the PBS 'will cost the budget up to $1 billion over the forward estimates.' Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: (1) and (2) Dabigatran (Pradaxa®) is currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacements. At its March 2011 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommended extending the current PBS listing of Pradaxa to include the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (a condition associated with an abnormal heart rhythm). However, in recommending the listing of PRADAXA on the PBS for patients at risk of stroke because they have atrial fibrillation, the PBAC noted the following:  PRADAXA derives its advantage over warfarin when warfarin is used sub-optimally;  improving the use of warfarin by means of an education campaign aimed at prescribers, pharmacists and patients would be less costly;  the benefit of PRADAXA observed in the clinical trial may or may not be wholly reflected in the Australian population;  a number of patients who are reluctant to take warfarin because of its stringent monitoring requirements and interactions with other drugs and foods may be treated with PRADAXA. This would likely lead to additional benefits and costs not measured in the trial;  low risk patients currently managed on aspirin may be inappropriately transferred to PRADAXA; and  listing PRADAXA would cost the budget up to $1 billion over the forward estimates. The Government has not deferred the extension to the listing of Pradaxa, but based on the PBAC's advice, the Government has decided to seek more information about how Pradaxa would fit into the current treatment options of Australian patients at risk of stroke. Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, the former Chair of the PBAC, has been commissioned to review options for improving the health outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation therapies. This review will consider how current treatments are used and what should be the role of newer therapies for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, such as Pradaxa. Unlike warfarin, where bleeding associated with the use of the drug can be quickly reversed with vitamin K, this solution is not available to treat bleeding associated with Pradaxa, and so it is more difficult to manage. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has already issued two safety advisory alerts regarding Pradaxa based on the increase in bleeding-related adverse events reports and new requirements for kidney function monitoring. The review being undertaken by Professor Sansom will take all these issues into account to ensure anticoagulant therapy in Australia delivers optimal health outcomes for all patients. Terms of Reference for the review are available on the Department's website at pbs.gov.au. (3) Details of the Minister for Health and Ageing's Submission to the Cabinet in relation to the proposed extension to the listing of this medicine on the PBS are Cabinet-In-Confidence. In addition, the detailed costing of the proposed extension to the PBS listing of Pradaxa contains Commercial-in-Confidence information. Warfarin (Question No. 747) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 22 November 2011: (1) Is it a fact that Warfarin is the most common cause of drug-related hospitalisation. (2) For 2010-11, can she provide data on the number and cost of Warfarin hospitalisations, and the proportion of Warfarin prescriptions that were subsidised for pensioners and for veterans. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: (1) This data is not available. (2) This data is also not available. However, in 2010-11 over 2.4 million Warfarin prescriptions were subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and over 232,000 prescriptions were subsidised through the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for a range of conditions. This does not include any prescriptions that were dispensed to general patients, as the cost of the drug is under the general co payment of $34.20. Atrial Fibrillation (Question No. 748) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 22 November 2011: (1) For 2010-11, can she provide data on (a) the number of strokes that occurred as a result of the condition atrial fibrillation, and (b) the proportion of atrial fibrillation patients who (i) took Warfarin, (ii) took Aspirin, and (iii) sought no treatment. (2) Does she know the common reason(s) why many atrial fibrillation patients seek no treatment; if so, can she indicate the reason(s). Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: (1) These data are not currently available. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, How we manage stroke in Australia 2006 provides an overview of the associated risk factors and treatment of patients who have suffered a stroke. The Institute's report is available at www.aihw.gov.au/publicationdetail/?id=6442467815 (2) The management of atrial fibrillation is a complex and evolving medical area. The use of anticoagulants is one of a number of treatment options available and is clinically appropriate for some but not all patients with atrial fibrillation. The decision to use an anticoagulant is based on clinical judgement and individual patient factors such as (but not limited to) the risk of stroke, risk of bleeding, other medical conditions (co morbidities) and a patient's lifestyle factors such as risk of trauma from falls and compliance to treatments. The Government has recently commissioned a review of oral anticoagulation therapies in the management of atrial fibrillation to be conducted by Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom who will be supported by an expert Reference Group. The terms of reference for this review are: (a) To report on current and future options for improving the health outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulants. (b) To report on modes of health system delivery which may be used to optimise the use of currently available anticoagulants. (c) To report to what extent optimisation of the use of currently available anticoagulant treatments used in patients with atrial fibrillation would improve health outcomes and at what cost. (d) To examine the future role of newer anticoagulant therapies for atrial fibrillation. (e) To report on any other matter relevant to items a to d above and on any other matters referred to it by the Minister. The report from the review will incorporate the most recent literature, feedback from stakeholder consultation and advice from clinical experts and consumers currently involved in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and associated stroke. It is anticipated that the report will be completed in 2012. Strokes (Question No. 749) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 22 November 2011: For 2010-11, can she provide the cost to the Government of each stroke in Australia, and the proportion of this cost that was paid by the (a) Commonwealth, and (b) each State and Territory. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: The direct cost to Government for each stroke in Australia during 2010-11 is currently not available. However, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report: How we manage stroke in Australia 2006 contains an estimate of the financial impact of stroke in Australia, and explains the limitations and complexity in determining the cost of caring for patients with stroke. The Institute‘s report is available at www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=6442467815 Prospective Marriage Visas (Question No. 750) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 23 November 2011: (1) How many applications for a Prospective Marriage Visa (subclass 300) were made in (a) 2006-07, (b) 2007-08, (c) 2008-09, (d) 2009-10, (e) 2010-11, and (f) 2011-12 (to date), and in which posts were these applications made. (2) By post, how many of the applications in part (1) were (a) approved with visas granted, and (b) made by people under the age of 18 years, in (i) 2006-07, (ii) 2007-08, (iii) 2008-09, (iv) 2009-10, (v) 2010-11, and (vi) 2011-12 (to date). Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The number of Prospective Marriage Visa applications lodged is as follows. (a) n 2006/7, 6876 applications (b) in 2007/8, 6907 applications (c) in 2008/9, 7794 applications (d) in 2009/10, 7365 applications (e) in 2010/11, 7257 applications (f) in 2011/12, 2180 were lodged as at 31 October 2011 The table below shows the posts where these applications were lodged: Name of post 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 Grand Total DILI 4 4 9 3 2 1 23 HO CHI MINH CITY 611 596 646 571 606 178 3208 HONG KONG 48 45 44 39 34 17 227 NEW DELHI 197 204 226 204 213 63 1107 PORT MORESBY 14 13 18 10 10 5 70 SUVA 102 99 106 103 99 28 537 TEL AVIV 30 35 36 36 23 4 164 Grand Total 6876 6907 7794 7365 7256 2181 38378 1 The posts referred to in 'other' are Rangoon, Vientiane, Nuku' Alofa, Nicosia, Honiara, Buenos Aires and Beijing.

Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) When fraud is detected during processing of a Prospective Marriage visa application, it is recorded on file and in electronic case notes. This information however, is not recorded in a fashion which allows for statistical reporting. The Department is therefore unable to report on the number of Prospective Marriage visa applications refused on the basis of having provided bogus documents or incorrect information. Legislation allows for a visa to be cancelled if it is found that incorrect information or bogus documents were provided as part of the visa application. Since 2006, no Prospective Marriage visas have been cancelled on these grounds. Prospective Marriage Visas (Question No. 752) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 23 November 2011: (1) In (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, (d) 2010-11, and (e) 2011-12 (to date), how many of the applicants for a Prospective Marriage Visa (subclass 300) who were under the age of 18 years arrived in Australia and subsequently married the proposer. (2) How many of those applicants (a) failed to marry their proposer then returned to their country of residence, and (b) arrived and subsequently applied for some other visa, and which type of visa did each apply for. (3) How many applicants in part (2) have applied for protection visas, and how many have made an application, or been granted permanent residency, under the domestic violence provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) (a) The table below shows the number of Prospective Marriage visa holders who were under the age of 18 when they were granted the visa (1) who married their sponsor and lodged a Partner visa application onshore, (2) who did not marry their sponsor, did not enter Australia or departed Australia without lodging a Partner visa application, (3) who have not yet lodged a Partner visa and still lawfully hold a Prospective Marriage visa, and (4) who applied for other visas1.

Family Violence claims may only be made once the Prospective Marriage visa holder has married their sponsor and are assessed in the context of a Partner visa application. (2) (b) and (3) (a) Records indicate that since 2007, no Prospective Marriage visa holders in the under 18 category applied for a visa other than a Partner visa, including Protection visas. (3) (b) Three Prospective Marriage visa holders who were granted their visa when they were under the age of 18 applied for permanent residency under family violence provisions after they arrived in Australia. Of those three, one applicant met the family violence provisions for the grant of the Subclass 801 permanent visa. Another applicant was found not to meet the family violence provisions for the grant of the Subclass 801 visa. A decision has not yet been made in relation to the third case. ________________ 1 The ‗year‘ column refers to the year in which the visa holder applied for a partner visa in Australia or departed Australia, not the year the Prospective marriage visa was granted or the applicant entered Australia. Partner Visas (Question No. 753) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 23 November 2011: (1) In respect of applicants being granted partner visas on the basis of being in a de-facto relationship with an Australian citizen, how many applications has his department received from people using documentation from relationship registry authorities throughout the States or Territories for same sex couples as a way of meeting the co-habitation or other 'genuineness' criteria. (2) Is it possible to use such registration provided by State and Territory governments to circumvent existing migration criteria; if so, what is the Government doing to close this loophole. (3) How many applications have been received by over-stayers or other visa holders to support protection visa applications; what are the countries of origin of those applicants; and how many protection visas have been granted to applicants using such registration as proof that they are in a same sex relationship. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Although evidence of registration will be held on file and recorded in case notes, the information cannot be recorded in a way which allows Departmental systems to report on the number of Partner visa applicants who have registered their relationship under a relevant law of a State or Territory on the basis of a same-sex relationship. Under Regulation 2.03A of the Migration Regulations 1994, couples who register their de facto relationship are not required to satisfy the twelve month relationship requirement that applies to other de facto relationships. The provision to allow de facto couples to register their relationship was introduced on 1 July 2009 as part of a package of measures to remove discrimination against same sex couples and their children. This provision does not undermine the integrity of the Partner visa program because visa applicants must still be assessed as being in a genuine relationship against the definition of de facto as per Section 5CB of the Migration Act 1958. (3) The table below shows the number of (non irregular maritime arrivals (IMA)) Protection visa applications received by the Department between 2006 and 2011 and their source countries. Most applicants arrived holding a valid visa. In 2010-11, only 27 raised a protection claim after arriving at an Australian airport without documentation.

Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question asked of the former Minister for Health and Ageing is as follows: The information requested relates to the business affairs of the Redcliffe Hospital Foundation (the organisation) and its provision as a response to the question would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation.

Foreign Affairs and Trade: Corporate Credit Cards (Question Nos 779 and 782) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 24 November 2011: In (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, and (d) 2010-11, (i) how many corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff, and (ii) what was the total cost of all transactions made on these corporate credit cards. Mr Rudd: On behalf of the Minister for Trade and myself, the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The number of corporate credit cards issued to departmental staff in Australia and the total value of transactions are as follows: (a) 2007-08: 212 cards and transactions of $3,418,187 (b) 2008-09: 233 cards and transactions of $3,827,420 (c) 2009-10: 263 cards and transactions of $4,035,134 (d) 2010-11: 525 cards and transactions of $6,041,072* * The increase in cards issued and transactions in 2010-11 compared to 2009-10 is primarily due to a change in departmental policy on use of credit cards allowing certain travel expenses to be charged to the corporate card. Prior to receiving a departmental credit card staff are required to sign an undertaking that they understand the conditions governing the use of the card. The credit card payment process includes a third party review of all credit card transactions. Information on credit cards issued by the department's overseas offices is not maintained centrally. It would entail a significant diversion of resources to collate this information and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified. Immigration and Citizenship: Corporate Credit Cards (Question No. 780) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 25 November 2011: In (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, and (d) 2010-11, (i) how many corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff, and (ii) what was the total cost of all transactions made on these corporate credit cards.

Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (i) and (ii) The total number of people claiming zone1 or overseas forces2 tax offsets on their returns and the estimated total cost to revenue of the offsets are: Zone Tax Offset 2008-09 2009-10 Number of claims 583,533 584,410 Estimated total cost to revenue ($m) 229 233 Total cost to revenue is the estimated amount of the zone or overseas forces tax offsets used to reduce tax payable. Data for the 2010-11 income year is not yet available as the lodgement period is still open. It is not possible to distinguish between the different zone or overseas forces tax offset categories, as all such offsets are claimed under the one category. (iii) and (iv) As per response to (i) and (ii). ____________ 1 Broadly speaking, a zone tax offset is for people who live or work in certain remote or isolated areas. These remote areas are called zone A and zone B. There are also special areas within these zones. 2 An overseas forces tax offset is for people who:  served in a specified overseas locality as a member of the Australian Defence Force or a United Nations Armed Force in the last financial year; and  income relating to that service was not specifically exempt from tax. Defence: Travel (Question No. 785) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in writing, on 24 November 2011: (1) Since1 July 2010, what (a) number, and (b) proportion (as a percentage), of times have Defence (i) civilians, and (ii) Australian Defence Force members, not chosen the lowest practical fare for domestic and international travel in accordance with the Whole-of-Government arrangement exemption reporting codes. (2) Since1 July 2010, what (a) number, and (b) proportion (as a percentage), of flights were booked by Defence (i) civilians, and (ii) Australian Defence force members, on all applicable airlines, and at what cost. (3) Has his department made any savings under the Whole-of -Government arrangements; if so, what sum since 1 July 2010. Mr Snowdon: the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Defence does not categorise civilians and Australian Defence Force members differently when booking travel and is therefore unable to provide a breakdown of these categories. The proportion of exemption reporting codes used between 1 July 2010 and 31 October 2011 are as follows (based on a total of 378,472 tickets 353,240 domestic and 25,232 international). Period: 1 July 2010 to 31 October 2011 Domestic International Grand Total Reason Code Description % % % Approval/Entitlement to travel at a higher fare class 1.7% 0.7% 1.6% Health& safety issues/Personal responsibilities 0.1% 0.0% 0.1% Lowest Practical Fare/International Best Fare of the Day 57.0% 90.9% 59.3% Accepted Require flexibility to change booking 38.5% 6.3% 36.4% Unsuitable due to time/routing or connections 1.7% 1.8% 1.7% Refusal to accept LPF (not part of WoAG Reason Codes) 0.9% 0.2% 0.9% Grand Total 100% 100.0% 100% (2) Defence does not categorise civilians and Australian Defence Force members differently when booking travel and is therefore unable to provide a breakdown of these categories. The table below outlines the number and proportion (as a percentage) of flights booked with domestic (total 675,543 flights) and international (total 72,753 flights) airlines. Domestic Airline Name Domestic Airline Name West Wing 0% FLY TIWI 0% Total 100% International Airline Name Airline Name AIR CANADA 1.25% AIR TAHITI NUI 0.01% VIRGIN AUSTRALIA 1.83% OLYMPIC AIRWAYS 0.06% THAI AIRWAYS 1.11% AIR MAURITIUS 0.01% AIR NIUGINI 0.79% AIR INDIA 0.01% AIR NEW ZEALAND 0.79% AEGEAN AIRLINES 0.02% JAL-JAPAN AIR LINES 0.18% HAHN AIR 0.01% V AUSTRALIA 0.18% REGIONAL EXPRESS 0.01% EL AL 0.17% JAT 0.01% AIR FRANCE 0.33% AIR LANKA LTD 0.01% GULF AIR 0.96% CROATIA AIRLINES 0.01% K.L.M. 0.17% AIR AUSTRAL 0.00% AIR PACIFIC 0.16% FLYBE BRITISH EUROPEAN 0.01% International SAS 0.16% AIR MALTA 0.01% LAN CHILE 0.03% AER ARRAN EXPRESS 0.01% OMAN AIR 0.22% WESTJET 0.00% AIR CHINA (CAAC) 0.02% ESTONIAN AIR 0.00% AER LINGUS 0.04% AVIA EXPRESS 0.00% AIR PORTUGAL 0.02% SKYWAYS AB 0.00% JET AIRWAYS INDIA 0.06% ISLAND AIR 0.00% AIR VANUATU 0.04% LAO AVIATION 0.00% Virgin Atlantic 0.01% AIR UGANDA 0.00% AIR CALEDONIE 0.02% PRECISION AIR 0.00% Total 100% (3) Under Whole-of-Australian Government arrangements all domestic and international airlines were invited to provide pricing on the basis of providing services to Whole-of-Australian Government. Accordingly there is no way of identifying what price Defence would have achieved if we had contracted separately, and in turn identify what savings have come as a direct result of the Whole-of Australian Government arrangements. However, data is showing that Defence travellers are adopting different travel practices, such as the use of more restricted fares, therefore lower unit costs for travel are being incurred. Tourism Research Australia: International and National Visitor Surveys (Question No. 786) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 24 November 2011: In respect of a recent media report ALP ups spending on focus groups by Tom Dusevic (The Australian, 14 November 2011) on the Australian Labor Party increasing spending on focus groups, specifically the $5 million spent on a survey of domestic and international tourists: (a) what is the purpose of the report referred to in the article; (b) did the report make any recommendations to the Government, if so, (i) what were they, and (ii) has the Government adopted any; (c) what research methodology was employed by the agency; (d) on what grounds (i) was the cost of the consultancy justified, and (ii) did ORC Australia win the right to undertake the survey; (e) on what date did his department commission the report; (f) what length of time did the research take to complete; and (g) will the full report be made public, if so, when.
