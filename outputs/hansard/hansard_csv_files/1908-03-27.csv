R Ing's Issue Of The Argus, A Paragraph To The Effect That Information Has Been Received By The Prime Minister That The Acting Adminh Istrator Of Papua., Judge Murray, Has Sus","mond. I should like the Prime Minister to state whether that' information has been received by him, and upon what ground the Acting Surveyor-General has beein suspended? ; answer would be to lay the papers on 'the table. The Surveyor-General has been suspended, not by a personal act of the Acting Administrator, out by resolution of the Executive Council. In laying the papers on the table, let me add'that the suspension relates to the land transactions of officers. As previously mentioned, so soon as we heard of those transactions, and before any direct charges had been made, I addressed to the Acting Administrator a. strongly-worded memorandum setting forth the only conditions on which officers should be allowed to have dealings in land. aware of this when the Estimates relating to Papua were under the consideration of the Committee? ceived information. were under consideration honourable members were happy in the belief that the administration of Papua smoothly -. question on the subject, and replied that the contrary was the case. Mr KE LL Y The n , I misapprehended the honourable gentleman. In future cases of a similar nature will the. Prime Minister give the House information at the earliest possible moment, instead of waiting for the activities of the press to enlighten honourable members? the activities of the. press to enlighten hon27 March, 1908. orable members on this subject. The papers were submitted to me on the very day that the Estimates relating to Papua were before the Committee, and, in reply to a say that affair's in Papua were not running smoothly; that charges had been made against! officers, and that a charge, for which, apparently, there was no -primd facie justification, had been laid against the Acting Administrator. vFollowing up that statement, I said more than once, in answer to questions, in the course of the debate, that I thought the. Committee might take it for' granted that the present Acting Chief Surveyor would not be continued in that office. That was as clear an intimation as possible. it. brought to' the House the papers which I had dealt wijtb -that afternoons and should have laid them on the table had the discussion taken a more direct turn, or had any honourable member asked for information. I am not satisfied with the recommendations made in this connection, and, consequently, as regards penalties, at all events, the case is still sub judice. I did not wish, unless asked to do so, to intervene By laying before the Committee the propositions submitted to me, since they could not be dealt with for at least six weeks or two month's, the time that must necessarily elapse before a reply can come from Papua. moil in Papua? that fact, but did not wish to plunge the Committee into the incomplete inquiry at the time, since ' certain recommendations had been questioned by me.

38,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"I desire towhether the Victorian Government have decided to repatriate -from Western Australia ioo families reported to be stranded there. I may say that I am asking this question in consequence of a telegram which I have received from Tasmania. that the Western Australia lecturer has unsettled several families in Tasmania, and I desire to know whether there is any truth in the report that there are ioo Victorian families in Western Australia who desire to return to their own State? self on many matters in order to satisfy honourable members. My last information on this question was an indignant reply from the Premier of Western Australia, pointing out that no Victorians who were desirable settlers had been "" stranded "" in that State, that there was ample opportunity to obtain land, and that he was making arrangements in regard to employment. I believe that the Premier of Victoria stated to the newspapers that, under the circumstances, he intended to take no action in the matter.

What action has been taken to investigate the complaints made by Mr Hay Kirkwood as to letters containing cheques, postal notes, and valuables posted at Eaglehawk not reaching their intended destination? 2.

In cases of complaints of loss of letters or property in the past, would it not be sufficient to require aggrieved' persons to sign written pajrticulaTS, in prescribed form, without demanding an inquiry fee of 2.Â£d., which seems like adding insult to injury? honourable member's questions are as f o l low1.

As senders who have safeguarded their correspondence by registration are 'required by I am informed Universal Regulations to' pay a fee of 2^d. before inquiry is made with respect to alleged missing articles, it is considered reasonable to require the same fee from those who have not ta'ken any precaution, although in -many instances thei'r letters, & c , are said to have"" contained valuable articles.

As a matter of fact, most of those who have hitherto voted by post could have recorded their votes at polling booths had they chosen to do so.

143,Mr Batchelor (South Australia),"exceedingly unsatisfactory, and much discontent is occasioned by grievances which could be easily remedied. The reports of the Public Service Commissioner, when one knows the facts, often make one's blood boil. Is it not idle, for example, for him to report to Parliament that no reductions in salary have taken place in consequence of the classification of the Service when, as has .been pointed out repeatedly in this Chamber, many South Australian, postmasters have had their salaries reduced by Â£ 1 5 0 and lesser sums? A piece of tyranny which recently came under my notice relates to the entrance examination system. Twp young ladies in South Australia passed an entrance examination much more severe than was necessary to show their qualifications for the work which they desired to do, and were temporarily appointed as telephone attendants. were not made permanent, owing to a disagreement between the inspector ancl the Deputy Postmaster-General, as to how manv persons should be employed. The Public Service Commissioner is charged with the duty of saying how many persons shall be employed in any Department, the Minister and departmental head responsible for the work to be done having no "" say"" in the matter. with which I am dealing, the ladies gave the fullest satisfaction j but, after some months, were told that they must again present themselves for examination. On this occasion, not having opportunity for special preparation, they failed to gain a sufficient number of marks. many examinations must be passed by applicants for positions in the P.ublic Service? Every one knows that a person who has passed anexamination well might not be able, twelve months later, to pass the same examination, even if the same questions were set. session of the necessary qualifications, .appointees who satisfactorily discharge the duties assigned to them should not be again subjected to the ordeal of examination. between the two examinations ? months', I think. different where persons pass an examination, and are not appointed to the Service. If such persons presented themselves again after a long interval, it might not be unfair to ask them to. prove that they were still qualified ; but it is altogether unnecessary to submit to a second examination those ' who have given practical proof of their ability to discharge the duties assigned to them. I shall not enumerate all the other reasons for discontent and dissatisfaction. South Australian officers have reason to complain because there has been no reclassification there such as took place in Victoria, and, I think, ih New South Wales. Had there been a reclassification, postmasters whose salaries were considerably reduced as a consequence of the original classification would have had an opportunity to get their positions improved because of the improvement in the business of their offices. These and similar matters, however, could best be investigated by a Royal Commission. If complaints are brought forward in this Chamber, and no action is taken, the effect is apparently to condone the administration. It would be, I believe that the appointments therefore, far better to have complaints investigated by a Committee or Royal Com-' mission. The appointment of such a body in the near future would allay a great deal of dissatisfaction. already said that I question the utility of much of the discussion on the Estimates; but I cannot help expressing my opinion in connection with this division that', in the Tn the case interests of the public and of the"" Service, an amending Public Service Bil l should be introduced. So many elements of discontent are now operating against the effectiveness of the Service that it is necessary that some such step should be taken. T believe that in the Public Service ComI ask how missioner we have an officer who is discharging conscientiously, fairly, and to the best of his ability, the duties of his position.

ComBut once having shown the posplaints are constantly being made in the House as to dissatisfaction in the service, but we are debarred by the Act from any personal communication with the Commissioner. I am sure that honourable members generally have faithfull y observed the provision in the Public Service Act that he shall be free from any direct' personal reOf course, the case is presentation by tis.

146,Mr Knox (Kooyong) [12.29],"I havew ith a desire to exercise an impartial judgment, inequalities have occurred in the distribution of the advantages of the service. I hope that at an early stage an amending B ill will be introduced, and that it will provide for the appointment of additional Commissioners to co-operate with and assist the present Commissioner in his laborious work. In expressing that hope, I do not suggest for one moment that Mr permeates the service. McLachlan has failed to deal fairly with all cases with which he has been called upon to deal. But the time has arrived when that excellent officer should have additional assistance so that he may be able to devote more attention to general principles than to individual cases, the consideration of which, under present conditions, must largely interfere with his more responsible duties of general administration. WhilstI recognise that it is well that temporary employment in the Public Service should be available, I feel satisfied that the system requires to be better regulated. I. have recently brought before the Postmaster-General cases relating to contract post-offices, and the discharge from the service of male and female employees who have done excellent wprk for the Department. AlthoughI am sure that the Postmaster-General and his colleagues are in sympathy with the representations that have been made to them on the subject, those peqple are suffering a great injustice. If for no other reason than to remove such injustices an amending Bill should be introduced at the earliest possible moment. I also think that it should provide for a Board of Commissioners, as it is unreasonable to expect one Commissioner to attend to the administration of a huge service extending over the whole Commonwealth. Such a change would be in the interests, not only of the Public Service, but of the people. It would be well to review, in the light of our experiences since the establishment of Federation, the whole of the conditions of the service. Minisier in charge of these Estimates will convey my representations to the Minister of Home Affairs. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [12.39] I , like other honourable members who have have an officer well fitted for the position of Public Service Commissioner. I am not personally acquainted with him, but gather from honourable members generally that he is a fair man, has a good grasp of the work of the Department, and, in short, is eminently . qualified for the position that he occupies. I have often thought of directions in which the system could be improved. Like the honourable member for Franklin, I am strongly of opinion that, some such system as that which exists in New Zealand, if applied to the Commonwealth, would tend to a very large extent: lo allay the undoubted dissatisfaction that The New Zealand, system, however, could be improved upon.. I do not approve of the rights and privileges of individuals, whether public servants or members of the general public, being adjudicated upon by a tribunal that is practically responsible -to no one. able member think that the Public Service Commissioner should be responsible to Parliament ? Colonel FOXTON I shall deal presently with that phase of the question, and the honourable member will find that I am in accord with him. The position of the Commissioner under the Act is such that it is only in respect of his general administration that there is an appeal from him to Parliament. It is difficult to bring an appeal to this House from the Public Service Commissioner's decision in respect of an individual case,, and the aggrieved public servant has to go to law to seek redress: A very important improvement could be made upon the New Zealand system, which, as described by the honourable member for Franklin, permits of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner to a Board consisting of a representative of the Commissioner, a representative of the complainant or that section of the Public Service which is interested in the appeal, and the stipendiary magistrate of the district. I understand that in New Zealand stipendiary magistrate's are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner. That might be regarded as a slight objection to the system. In the case I hope that the of the Commonwealth, however, we should have as Chairman of the Board a stipendiary magistrate, who would be in no way under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth. He would be absolutely independent of him, and might be expected therefore to be more impartial as Chairman of such a Board than he would be if he were under the control of the Commissioner. per annum to apply such a system to so vast a country as the Commonwealth.",27,Department Of Home Affairs

149,Mr Mahon,"It would cost .Â£100,000Colonel FOXTON the honourable member. My own opinion is that it would not cost more than does the present system. I have had some experience of the system in force in Queensland,'which bears some resemblance to that in operation in New Zealand. The Board, instead of being the final Court of Appeal, is required in respect of every case to make a report and recommendation to the Minister. We should then get what the honourable member for Wannon desires, namely, the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament. grounds for a Minister to disregard the report of such an independent board, seeing that for any action he might take he would be responsible; and my suggestion would mean a considerable improvement on the present system, under which the Commissioner is practically an autocrat. nothing to say against the Commissioner personally, because I am satisfied he always acts with the best of motives from his point of view. But there is undoubtedly a very strong feeling of. dissatisfaction throughout the Commonwealth service, a dissatisfaction which the system I have suggested would tend to minimize. A l though the Commissioner is eminently well qualified f o i his position, and is a man in whom, I am sure most, if not all, honourable members have perfect confidence, lie necessarily has to see through the eyes of his inspectors. whether the inspectors in the outlying States are in all casesthe best men for such positions; and my own impression is that they are cases-whic h I do not care to mention, at all events now-in which it has been made manifest that the inspectors have not reported equitably and fairly. We find tliat in the Department of the Postmaster General, and especially , in the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs in Queensland, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, and large bodies of officers openly state that they have been passed over in the most unblushing manner-that men have been pitchforked over their heads in a way for which there is no justification. are complaints of that kind. Colonel FOXTON -Possibly, but we autocracy. ought to do our best to minimize them. If there wereonly occasional complaints, one might hesitate; but when we find the complaints general-whe n we find The honourable member for Brisbane sugthat oflicers not personally interested gests a plan of appeal from the decisions I do not agree with join in the complaints-ther e is evidently something wrong. Having. regard to the high character of the Commissioner, I believe that the fault must lie in the reports of the inspectors, .or of the heads of Departments. We sometimes find that , the Commissioner is not in accord with the Government; and I do not blame him for that, because either side may be right or wrong. We have, however, been furnished with a printed paper in connection with the Postal Department, having reference to the approval of the Commissioner as It would require very good to the status of the Assistant Secretary in the Post and Telegraph Department. That office having been created, the Secretary to .""""e Department very naturally represented u that the officer who was to assist him in his administrative work, should be placed in the administrative branch. To that the ComI have missioner simply replied that he was unable to f a l l in with the view presented, and refused his sanction. If the work of the Secretary is so great that it has to be divided, it necessarily follows that those who take on themselves a portion of the responsibility for the administration should, along with the Secretary, be placed in the administrative branch. I compliment, the Postmaster-General on the fact that, notwithstanding the attitude of the Commissioner, the Government propose to give the Assistant Secretary a salary commensurate with the duties he has to perform. I hope The question arises' that, if there is an amendment of the Public Service Act in contemplation, such a provision as that which I have suggested will be included, because I believe not. There are that would largely tend to allay the uneasy feeling there is throughout the service. From my experience of the Public Service Act in Queensland, I do not think that the expense would be anything like what the honourable member for Coolgardie suggests. The inquiries would not be more numerous, nor would the evidence be any more voluminous, than in the cases which are at present investigated ; the only difference would be a slightly different tribunal, whose recommendations would go to the Minister for final decision. With the Minister would rest the responsibility of dealing fairly as between the In any large service there Commissioner and the public servants; and that, in my opinion, would provide a further check on anything in the nature of",28,Department Of Home Affairs

151,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [12.55],"t of the Public Service Commissioner;. and raises the question whether it is desirable that those decisions should be reviewed by some authority. The proposal involves a reversal of the deliberate determination of Parliament some time ago that finality should rest with the Commissioner; and for this purpose his office was invested with the security of , tenure enjoyed by the Judges of the Supreme Court. No step backward should therefore be taken without proof that the present system has failed and that better methods were available. Has such proof been given ? To my thinking, the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane would involve such a huge expenditure as to render it utterly impracticable as a remedy. Colonel FOXTON a standing board, but a .board which would probably be composed of different individuals for each case. ference as to the cost of the honourable member's proposal. If the hearing of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner is to be of any value, the board should investigate the case on the spot. That might work all right in acompact country like New Zealand, but in a spacious territory, such as that of the Commonwealdi, it would entail on the people an enormous burden in the shape of travelling expenses and the payment of substitutes for officers who were engaged in hearing appeals. The honourable member may not be aware that this Parliament has already had some experience of boards of inquiry. Under the Public Service Act there is provision for boards of inquiry into any disputes or any charges levelled against officers. ' Colonel FOXTON -That is not quite the same thing. different, but the difficulties and troubles in connection with those boards would be repeated and aggravated in the case of the boards suggested by the honourable member. A t the present time, an officer feeling aggrieved may obtain a board of inquiry in certain circumstances. A large number of such inquiries have been held during the currency of the Public Service Act. The Public Service Commissioner summarizes the results in his report, states that there were twenty-six boards of inquiry in 1903, at a cost of Â£i>593'> cost of Â£ 3 , 6 5 6 ; seventy-six in 1905 at a cost of Â£ 3 , 2 5 5 . ; and forty-six in 190S at a cost of Â£2,008'a total of 192 boards at a cost of Â£10,5.12 in travelling and other expenses spread over the four years. Then, 'in the case of Queensland, in the Post and Telegraph Department,'there were three inquiries held in1903 at a cost of Â£ 2 6 0 ; ten in 1904 at a cost of Â£ 1 , 2 6 8 ; eleven in 1905 at a cost of Â£ 9 2 5 ; and eight in 1906 at a cost of Â£ 6 1 5 a total of thirty-two inquiries at a cost of .Â£3,058. That is a very expensive method ""of correcting thepossible abuses in the Public Service. Colonel FOXTON -And is not going to law expensive? does not advise, his friends to go to law. Colonel FOXTON -No, and I never go I do not. suggest to law mvself if I can help it . orable member's practice reinforces my contention. We should not encourage litigation in the Public Service at the expense of the country. We ought to devise some cheaper and less cumbrous method of disposing of such cases. ber would not deprive public servants of the right of appeal? Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.1s p.m. which I have urged against the proposal to constitute local boards of inquiry, is based upon the ground of the expenditure which would be involved. But there are many other grounds which justify the Government in disregarding the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane. In the first place, these boards would arrive at different determinations regarding the value of similar positions in the various States, so that in a very short I know it is slightly time anomalies would be created greater than those which existed previously, thus making uniform classification, or any other arrangement of the service, practically impossible. The proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane has been discussed previously in this House, and the Commissioner was asked to give his opinion upon it, which he did. Amongst other things, he points outI f the proposed substitution were adopted, and he the Chairman would be a local Slate official, and the Commonwealth Government would be entirely unrepresented.

It is only by some such method that something like justice in the treatment of these cases can be secured.

' The suggestion made by the honourable member for West Sydney has very much to recommend it , and I trust that in the amending legislation which the Government has in view something will be done to meet this difficulty. I am sure that the Public Service, from the Commissioner downwards, would welcome any device of this character that would enable a correct understanding of the position to be a'rrived at. Whilst our Public Service comprises many excellent officers, animated solely by would be unreasonable to assume that it consists wholly of such men. It often happens that a man of grea't ability has also great failings, and allows his personal prejudices to override his sense of justice, so that public servants under his control often suffer injustice, and have no redress.

If may be that the Public Service has a better proposal, but I know that in one State, at least, the officers are very dissatisfied with the pre-sent state of affairs. I do not believe that the administration is responsible for the friction, but rather that, if inquiry were instituted, it would be seen that the administration is correct. But, in the absence of any inquiry or means of investigation of the character I have suggested, a desire to do their duty, it the officers feel there is injustice, and the dissatisfaction increases. The proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney would, in the end, make the Public Service more satisfied with the decisions, even if these turned out to be not very widely, different from tliose arrived at at present'. The services of police magistrates and other justices, who ' discharged similar duties in the States, would be always available in different centres of population, and the courts could be constituted at the minimum of expense. The suggestion does not mean the introduction of any foreign authority into the administration, but I suggest simplv a tribunal to fake evidence locally, and 'the forwarding of that evidence, together with the report of the presiding, officer, for-whatever It might be worth, to I s 'the Act out ot the Commissioner, who would then be placed in a better position to deal wi'thi The complaints.

All who are interested in the construction of public works must know that now often an extraordinary delay takes place between the voting of money by Parliament and the carrying out of a work.

The same remarks apply to a large extent to the appointment of an Assistant Military Engineer. out!' that the item will be knocked out, but in' any case, I should like to say a word or two about it. The defence scheme necessarily involves some work in this connection, and if we are to have the work done in . Australia by Australians, it will probably be done cheaper under the system suggested by the Government than if we import a military engineer of the Royal Engineers in Great Britain, or from elsewhere. What is proposed is that the Director-General, being himself an expert, shall have the assistance of an Assistant Military Engineer, and that they between them shall carry but the works ordered from time to time by the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, . the Director-General has hitherto, without any extra pay, and af great inconvenience to himself, done a large part of the work, but it is now proposed, and I think rightly, that he should have the assistance provided for on the Estimates. bers should not blame the Department partment, but the system we blame. orable members ought to recognise that, under existing conditions, it is impossible to act differently. I ask honourable members, if they can, to give us information which will lead us to do better, because the who has .to superintend a very large Department is not above learning. But if it is proposed to establish a huge Public Works Staff, with an army of inspectors, to carry out small works and repairs all over Australia, it will prove much more expensive' than the present system. The honorable member for Dalley desired to know why it was that there was such a large sum proposed on the Estimates for the central staff. The reason is that the staff is not only professional, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, but is a staff which mote portions of the Commonwealth?"" does immense work in the preparation of plans and other details. The central office, being in the State of Victoria, the work can be done here without States? can never see beyond Victoria. staff being on the spot, we are taking advantage of the services of the officers in order to save money on the works carried out in this State; and the same step would be taken if we happened to be in New South Wales. The fact that the central office is here, enables it to proceed with local work without any reference to the State Public Works Department. This, in some measure, accounts for the size of the central staff, and, in the light of that fact, the expenditure is not, by any means, abnormal. The honorary Minister has, I think, rather missed the point, because no one really wishes to blame the Department. So far as 1 have seen, the Department does its work really well when it undertakes it ; but the trouble is the delay in necessary repairs. Up to quite recently, if repairs were required to a small building in a country village, the central office had to be requisitioned, and all the routine gone through, before the work could be undertaken. This state of affairs was considered by the Government, with the magnificent result that up to Â£ 5 0 can now be spent on repairs without reference to the Honourable memhead office. If the cost of repairing a post office in the remote portions of Queensland, DeWestern Australia, or Tasmania amounts to Â£ 5 1 , the officer responsible for undertaking those repairs has to make an elaborate report to the central office in Melbourne, and thus delay ensues. The Inspector of Public Works in my own State -wh o is a thoroughly competent man. and expenditure in connection with the work of his State Department-is obliged to make a complete report to the centra! office in. Melbourne whenever a Commonwealth undertaking exceeds Â£ 5 0 . Until we adopt a system of decentralization, and vest greater powers in the local authorities, delay is inevitable.

Sir member recommended him to me. bers of the Labour Party, and some members of the Opposition, as likely to happen in regard to this Department, has happened. We said that the thin end of the wedge was being introduced, and that the Department would ultimately become very expensive. On the first ""Estimates,' provision was made for the appointment of an Inspector-General of-Works and a clerk, at & total cost of about Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 . I was afraid at the time that ultimately there would be the duplication which we now seem likely to get. I do not know why we should need a Commonwealth staff when there are States staffs to do this work. have no more to do than they had to do prior to Federation; there has been merely a transference of control. I know that in Queensland, Commonwealth and State works take their turn. Commonwealth work is not put on one side to allow State work to be pushed ahead. because State officials have shelved applications, Ministers have neglected their duty in allowing' it. They should have called upon outside firms to do what was necessary. As for the Brisbane Post Office, I know that most f a it h f ul supervision is being given there; in fact, that the contractors are growling that it is too much. spector-General of Works was an officer in the Defence Forces.

It will be remembered that the honourable member for Lang asked the honourable gentleman whether his attention had been directed to the report of an interview with , Mr O. C Beale, who, by innuendo, charged honourable members with corruption. His attention was also called, to an article in the Bulletin which, by inference, made a similar charge, against many honourable members. that he would try to devise some means to sift such charges to die bottom, and to consider whether the law could; be set in motion. These charges have been the property of the public for something like three, weeks, and I should like to know whether the Prime Minister has yet given any consideration to the matter. I presume he will say that he could not force the people concerned to give evidence, but will' he tell us what steps he has taken ? the course of discussion recently, some statements were made concerning the present Acting Administrator of Papua. A l though I did not attach much importance to them, seeing that Judge Murray has been amply vindicated by the report of independent Royal Commissioners, still I apprehend the Government will not permit these aspersions on a valued and eminent public servant to pass unnoticed. The Prime Minister having had no earlier opportunity of. dealing with the matter, this will, perhaps, I am be a fitting occasion to remove any doubts entertained that the present Administrator of Papua retains, undiminished, the f u l l confidence of the Government.
