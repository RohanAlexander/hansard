Motion agreed to. ter) [3.29] -by leave-Following the decision of the Privy Council in the James case, the Ministry has given the most careful consideration to the best course to be taken by the Commonwealth to safeguard the interests of primary production, the joint Commonwealth and State schemes for tbe orderly marketing of primary products having been rendered unconstitutional as the result of the decision. The Government feels that it is expressing the view of the large majority of the people when it says that it would be disastrous for Australia as a whole if the system of orderly marketing of a number of important primary products were allowed to lapse into chaos. It is assisted in this conclusion by the fact that the Privy Council decision has disclosed a gravely anomalous position, viz., that there is no power in any Parliament, Commonwealth or State, to provide for the effective and stable control of marketing. This gap in the constitutional powers of the parliaments can be filled only by popular vote at a referendum. The Government, therefore, after an exhaustive examination of all the possibilities, has decided to seek an amendment of the Constitution. A pronouncement as to its exact nature will be made to Parliament as soon as possible. General seen the statement in the press attributed to Mr E. E. Field, president of the Farmers and Settlers Association, who, in commenting upon the decision of the Privy Council, saidI t appears to me a travesty and reflection on our boast of self-government when a judicial tribunal 13,000 miles away can create chaos As the question raises a matter of government policy I am not in a position to reply to it.",17,Assent To Bills

During that time proposals towards a settlement were advanced both by the representatives of the Japanese Government and by myself as representing the Commonwealth Government. A proposal then advanced by the Commonwealth Government was taken into consideration by the Consul-General for Japan and is now under the consideration of the Japanese Government. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government is of opinion that it is not in a position further to discuss this matter at the moment. was stated by the president of the Primary Producers' Association of Western Australia, that the Prime Minister placed at the disposal of representatives of wool-growers certain confidential inforbers the documents which he says he has mation and documents in respect of negotiations proceeding between this Government and the Government of Japan in regard to trade relations? If this be true, what explanation has the right honourable gentleman to offer to this House for divulging to private persons information which, so far, has been withheld from members of this Parliament? when the honourable member was in Perth, I replied to the suggestion now made by him. I did not submit to that conference any private or confidential documents whatever. One telegram was made available to it. It came from a member of this House who at that time was in the East and who in the last words of his telegram said that the Government might make the contents of the telegram available to representatives of the Graziers Association. That is the only document which I submitted to that conference. I certainly gave information to a body of men who represented those who were directly concerned with the negotiations that were proceeding, but it was given in the strictest confidence. As I said publicly some time ago, I would be pleased to give the same information to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), but details of negotiations so delicate as these couid not be broadcast to the world. given to the other body, as declared by the president of the primary producers' organization ? to the discussion that had taken place between the Japanese Government and ourselves, and I have no apology to offer for having done so. These graziers represented the .people who would be directly affected by any arrangement made with Japan in regard to the wool trade, and they were entitled to know from time to time what was taking place. The only complaint that I have heard on other occasions is that the Government should have consulted the bodies directly concerned at an earlier stage. Therefore, I feel that there is no need for an apology. Minister lay on the table of the Library for the information of honourable memplaced at the disposal of the wool growers ? that I did not submit any document except a telegram, which was a private communication received by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties. WhatI really did on that occasion was to amplify the information which I gave in two broadcasts over the air to the people of Australia.

It was first suggested that a conference be held between representatives of the various parties that would be affected by any change, but that suggestion was not accepted by the representatives of the workers. Later it was suggested that a comprehensive investigation might be held by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but that suggestion also was rejected and a deputation from the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which met in Melbourne, made it quite clear that it did not desire any investigation whatever to be made into this matter. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, as it later outlined to the Premiers Conference, had to take the stand that the only bodies that could deal with the question satisfactorily were the industrial tribunals of either the Commonwealth or the States. When the matter was brought to the notice of the Premiers in Adelaide, as was promised to the deputation from the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the proposal was defeated by a majority of the States. wealth Government accepting that decision?

I Defence inform the House of the latest developments in the manufacture of aircraft in Australia? When the House rose at the end of last session the position was that, at the instance of a group of Australian industrialists prepared, at the request of the Government, to take up the important work of manufacturing aircraft in Australia, a delegation had been despatched to Great Britain and various other countries to study certain aspects of the manufacture. A t the present time it is only after very great delays that the necessary supply of aircraft for defence purposes can be obtained from overseas. It is equally apparent that, in the event of hontilities occurring, it is unlikely that of aircraft at all. For defence purposes, therefore, it is absolutely essential that aircraft.

In Committee of Supply; [4.17] -In presenting the budget for 1936-37, it is my privilege to record continued improvement in the position of Australian finance, and to submit proposals for the reduction of taxation, the expansion of the defence programme, the restoration of certain expenditure reductions, and other matters of government and Dangerous policy. Before giving the budgetary results for 1935-36 and the Government's proposals for 1936-37, a short review of conditions in Australia may appropriately be made. In practically every direction, the position of the people of Australia has materially improved in the last twelve months. Evidence of this is to be found particularly in the improvement in employment, as well as in the almoBt general rise of export prices, in statisties regarding overseas trade, in the steady growth of savings bank deposits, and in the continued and increased confidence of the people as expressed in investment and the inflow of money from abroad Workers Act-Regulation s into Australia. Export Prices. In 1933-34, when wool prices averaged 15.84d. per lb. the dip yielded Â£63,000,000. In 1934-35 prices averaged only 9.75d. per lb., and the value of the clip was Â£40,400,000. Last year prices recovered to 14.01d. per lb., and Rules 1936, the clip produced over Â£58,000,000. Last year export prices for butter were on a higher level than in recent yean. Telegraphy Act-Regulation s The present outlook, as regards both the season and prices, is promising.",26,Papers
85,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer )Seasonal conditions in overseas exporting countries have been responsible for a. marked increase of the price of wheat. For the seven months ended July, 1936, the average price was higher at 3s. 7|d. a bushel than for any similar period since 1928. Wheat produced in 1935-36 was of the value of Â£26,740,000 as compared with Â£20,970,000 in the previous year. Eveni f the recent high level of 4B. 7&d. a bushel be not maintained, wheat-growers have a very much happier prospect than in recent years. The general position of export prices as a whole may be seen from the following table of index numbers at half-yearly intervals (base 1,000 in 192S) :1932June December 1933June December 710 1934June December 1935June December 1936June 747 July Generally, seasonal conditions in Australia are particularly good. Internal Recovery. The steady increase of employment, which began shortly after the previous Lyons Government came into office, has been maintained throughout the year. The percentage of unemployment reported by the trade unions to the Commonwealth Statistician reached its highest level30 per cent -in the second quarter of 74,000,000 in 1934-35. The increase con1932. The improvement since then is tinues to reflect revival of the purchasing indicated by the following figures:Per ceut.

The prominent position of persons have got back into full-time metal manufactures and machinery employment in Australia since early in indicates rapid growth and improvement 1932. There has been a greater percentage full of unemployment in the year just ended than in any previous year since the depth of the depression. Although these percentages are based only on a proportion of employable persons, the improvement they indicate is confirmed from other sources. The general improvement is also reflected in savings bank deposits, which have increased in recent years as follows:Â£ June1931 193,000,000 1934 211,000,000 1935 218,000,000 1936 225,000,000 533 Another reliable indicator of improved 550 conditions is the building industry. The total value of building operations in the . . . 607 capital cities and suburbs has increased as follows:648 Â£ 550 1932-33 6,850,000 1933-34 11,186,000 652 1834-35 17.610,000 736 1935-30 21,972,000 .. 772 Overseas Trade. A feature of the overseas trade position for 1935-36 was the recovery of the export trade as compared with the previous year. Under the influence of an all-round improvement in world prices, especially wool and wheat, and of the continued expansion of gold production, exports reached a new high level since 1929-30 of Â£stg. 108,000,000, as compared with Â£stg. 90,000,000 for 1934-35. Imports in 1935-36 reached fstg. 85,000,000 as compared with Â£stg. power of the Australian community, and indicates the continued demand for further raw materials and machinery. .. .. 25.7 Of the Â£stg. 11,000,000 increase in .. 20.0 imports, fstg. 9,000,000 is accounted for .. .. .. 17.8 by increased imports of non-competitive goods, mainly machinery, motor vehicles, in the equipment of secondary industries. This movement, in turn, accounts for year when two further operations-of appreciable shrinkage in the rate of Â£21,657,0.00 and Â£16,551,000 respectively growth in imports of finished goods -were arranged on the London market. The steady increase in the number of A ll maturing and optional redeemable factory employees in Australia over the loans have now been converted, and there last five years is of interest in this conwill be no need for further conversion nexion and affords further evidence of operations in London until towards the expansion193132 . . 193233 . . .. . . 371,000 1033-34 . . 193435 . . 193536 (estimate) The favorable commodity balance inof which Â£850,000 accrues to the creased from Â£stg. 16,000,000 for 1934-35 Commonwealth and to Â£stg. 22,000,000 for 1935-36. slight extent to which the trade balance these conversions is the progressive failed to provide the Â£stg. 23,000,000 improvement of the rates of innecessary to meet our overseas interest terest at whioh the conversion loans bill, was made good by the migration of were floated.

The average has been 11.3 per cent.

Parliament, It is now proposed to apply Â£1,068,000 of the excess receipts of the Commonfederal wealth in 1935-36 towards the reduction 4,637,620 4,022,072 of this deficit. This is in addition to the 03,073,227 60,991,277 sum of Â£213,000 applied in reduction of the deficit in 1935-36. From the time it became apparent that there would be a substantial excess of receipts over expenditure in the Commonwealth accounts for 1935-36, the Government has not been without requests and advice from various sections of the public on the subject of its future financial policy. These observations have ranged over the whole field of federal taxation, direct and indirect, and have also included proposals for additional aud varied grants to the States. Al l these proposals have had the careful consideration of the Government. In placing before the Parliament the proposals in the budget for 1936-37, the Government has endeavoured to select those forms of taxation the reduction of which is likely to have the most beneficial economic effect. The Government was faced with selecting one or other of two simple alternatives-eithe r to reduce both direct aud indirect taxes to the full extent that was possible, consistent with our obligations, or to make some appreciably lesser tax reductions and to make increased money grants to the States. Of these two alternatives the Government is confident that, in presenting a budget providing for substantial remissions of taxes, it is acting in the best interests of Australia as a whole. Notwithstanding the increased sum of Â£1,336,000 required from revenue for the development of defence, and the growing cost of old-age pensions, the budget provides for remission of taxes to the amount of Â£5,275,000 in a full year, and for other expenditure proposals costing Â£1,235,000 in a full year. In the present year these revenue remissions will cost Â£3,868,000, whilst the expenditure pro-posals, including defence, will cost Â£2,311,000. The total cost of the revenue remissions and expenditure proposals in the present budget is therefore Â£6,179,000, and the total cost of all these adjustments in a full year will be Â£7,846,000. The burden of these revenue and expenditure alterations on the budget next year will thus be Â£1,667,000 more than this year. Mr Oasey. 1936-37. EEVENUE 1936=-37. Sales Tax. In 1933, the rate of sales tax was reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent., whilst from year to year the list of exemptions has been extended. As compared with the peak period, the total value of the concessions made to date is Â£3,740,000 on an annual basis. The Government proposes to recommend to the Parliament the provision of further relief from sales tax to the amount of Â£3,000,000 for a full year. The rate of tax will be reduced from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., involving a loss of Â£2,000,000 per annum, whilst further exemptions to the annual value of Â£1,000,000 will be provided for. The cost of these concessions for the balance of the present financial year will be approximately Â£2,000,000. Iu the selection of classes of goods for complete or partial exemption the Government proposes to follow its established policy of seeking, in the first place, to provide for the exemption of goods which are the prime necessaries of life. This policy provides the greatest possible relief to those least able to bear the burden of the tax. Opportunity has also been taken to provide for exemptions which will remove certain anomalies and vvill simplify the administration of the law. Among the exemptions will be certain goods generally referred to as "" consumable aids to manufacture"", these being goods which are used up or consumed in the process of manufacturing other goods. The reduced rate of tax will apply to all taxable transactions on and from to-morrow, the 11th September. This will mean that sales tax returns for transactions in the month of September will be based on the rate of 5 per cent, for the first ten days of September and 4 per eent. for the balance of the month. The full list of exemptions will be set out in the amending bill that will be introduced shortly. These exemptions will take effect as from the date of assent to the measure. Primage. Certain remissions of primage duty are proposed which will total approximately Â£170,000 for a ful l year and approximately Â£.1.28,000 in the current year. Income Tax. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 containing the uniform taxation provisions, agreed upon by the Commonwealth and the States following the inquiry by the Royal Commission on Taxation, was passed during the last sitting of Parliament. Uniform income tax legislation has also been passed by the Parliaments of New South ""Wales and Tasmania, and bills to a like effect have been introduced into the Parliaments of Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. The Government of Western Australia has announced its intention to introduce a bill on the subject in the near future. In addition to dealing with uniformity in taxation, the 1936 Commonwealth act contains a number of concessions to taxpayers. The most important was the introduction into the act for the first time of a concessional deduction of Â£50 for a wife, or in the case of a widower, for a. female relative caring for his children, where the wife's or female relative's personal income does not exceed Â£50. It is estimated that this concession will involve a remission of income tax to the extent of Â£320,000 for a full year. Concessions have also been granted in the 1936 act to non-residents. The most important was the granting to all nonresident individual taxpayers of the same statutory exemption as is allowed to residents. This concession will, it is estiTaxable Income. Â£ l Â£ 2 00 Â£201-Â£500 Â£501-^1,500 . . Â£ l , 6 0 1 Â£ 3 , 0 00 Â£3,001 and upwards mated, involve a remission of approximately Â£50,000 for a full year. The Government proposes to make reductions of income tax. One of the most severe forms of emergeucy tax imposed in 1930-31 was the special property tax. In 1933-34, the rate of this tax wa3 reduced from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent. Last year the rate was reduced to 5 per cent. As stated in ray budget speech last year, the Government recognized this tax as a. severe form of emergency taxation from which relief should be given as soon as a reasonable opportunity presented itself. The Government considers that the opportunity has now arrived and proposes to abolish the tax, the remission resulting thereby being estimated at Â£1,300,000 for a full year. In addition, the Government proposes to reduce the rates of normal income tax on individuals by 10 per cent., in respect of both income from personal exertion and income from property. This concession will involve a remission of approximately Â£435,000 for a full year. Owing to the fact that all the assessments cannot be issued in sufficient time to collect the tax before the 30th June, and also on account of belated payments, the full amount of the foregoing remissions will not be reflected in the revenue of the year. Since 1931-32, the only variation in the rates of normal income tax was a reduction, in 1933-34 of 15 per cent, of the rate of tax on income from personal exertion. The following table shows a. comparison of the normal rates of tax at present in force and the 1931-32 rates, in relation to the 1915-16 basic rate:Percentage Variation on 1015-1910 Basic Bate. 1931-1932 Bates. 1035-1036 Bates.

The proposals for the remission of taxes may be summarized as follows:Sales tax . . Income tax . . Primage duty Total remissions In reducing taxes to tlii.s extent, the CrovoL'sment is adhering to the policy it has consistently adopted, namely, that taxes should be reduced to the fullest extent consistent with Commonwealth obligations. The fields of taxation in which reductions are now being made are those which, in the opinion of the Government, are entitled to preference as being not only most justified, but also most beneficial to the people as a whole. Endeavours have been made to hold the balance fairly, not only as between direct and indirect taxe3, but also as between emergency taxes due to the depression and pre-depression taxes. In arriving at a decision as to the fairest and most beneficial forms of taxation relief, the Government has not only kept in mind the relation between revenue from direct and indirect taxes in the federal sphere, but has also taken into account the direct taxes imposed Mr Casey. by the State governments. There is only one body of taxpayers in Australia, and they have to bear the burdens of both toss of Commonwealth and State taxation in all llcveuue in 1930-37. its forms. The Government has given very careful consideration to the question of reducing taxes other than those included in these 320,000 280,000 budget proposals. The cost of reducing customs and excise duties on petrol, beer 1,300,000 1,035,00 0 and spirits to such an extent as to ensure the reductions being passed on to con435,000 385,000 sumers, is so great that the Government has been reluctantly compelled to exclude 50,000 40,000 them from the remissions. Land tax has been halved in the last four years, and 2,105,000 1,740,00 0 now produces Â£1,200,000, as compared with an average of Â£2,S46,000 for the five years ended June, 1931. Revenue Summary, 1936-37. The total estimated revenue for the year, after allowing for remissions of taxes, is Â£81,550,000, made up as follows:Per annum.

Special^ Grants. In 1935-36 special grants, totalling Â£2,750,000, were paid by the Commonwealth, on the recommendation of the Commonwealth viz.:-South Western Australia, Â£800,000; and Tasmania, Â£450,000. This represented an increase of Â£350,000 on the total of special grants paid during. 1934-35. Tlie third"" annual report of the commission has now Been received, and contains recommendations that the payments for 1936-37 should he as follows:-South Australia, Â£1,330,000; Western Australia, Â£500,000; Tasmania, Â£600,000total, Â£2,430,000. This is a decrease of Â£320,000 below tbe total paid last year, although it is still in excess of the 1934-35 grant.

The' commission's report is being tabled to-day L o c a l Government Works. Last .year, with a view to relieving unemployment, the Government undertook to. provide Â£100,000from revenue* for the purpose of subsidizing interest and sinking funds on loans raised for,public works by local governing authorities. Subsequently, it was decided that, grants for this purpose would be made by the Commonwealth through the States, at the rate of Â£100,000 per annum for ten years. These grants will enable many authorities to undertake public utility works which otherwise would have been beyond their capacity. Federal Aid Boads, &c. The present Eederal Aid Roads Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States, which expire on the Slst December next, provide for payment to the States of 2Â£d. a gallon in respect of petrol imported, and of 1-Jd. a gallon in respect of excise petrol. It has been agreed between the Oommonwealth and State governments that these agreements shall be extended for a period of six months. The estimated payments to the States on this basis, in the present finanat an estimated increased cost, over and cial year, total Â£3,000,000. The Government has decided to submit to Parliament proposals for new agreements with the States, to cover a further period of ten years, commencing on the 1st July, 1937. It is proposed that these agreements shall provide for payment to the States of 3d. a gallon on petrol imported, and 2d. a gallon on excise petrol. It is proposed that this should be given effect to by a continnanc?. in a position, by reason of the improved of the Federal Aid Roads Agreements with the States, in their present form, for increase of Is. a week to invalid and a further period of ten years on the existold-age pensioners. This increase will ing terms and conditions-au d that a further ^d. a gallon of the customs duty and a Â£d. a gallon of the excise duty should be made available for the same period for the purposes of roads, works, or forestry. The additional cost in the first year of the proposed new agreements, namely, 1937-38, is expected to exceed Â£600,000. The basis of apportionment amongst the States will be the same as that provided for in the existing agreements. Invalid and Old-age Pensions. Honourable members will remember that the Government introduced, in 1933, a scheme whereby the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions was designed to increase witli increases in the cost of for a first child to those with an income living. The pension rate was accordingly not exceeding Â£208 per annum-the payMr Oasey. increased in July, 1935, from 17s. 6d. to 18s. a week, following an increase of the price level. The total expenditure for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1936, was approximately Â£12,800,000, the highest amount expended in any one year in respect of this service since its introduction in 1909. The increase of approximately Â£1,000,000 over the preceding year was due partly to the increase of the maximum rate of pension from 17s. 6d. to 18s. per week and partly to the increase of the number of successful applicants reaching pensionable age. On the 30th June, 1936, there were 287,235 invalid and old-age pensions in force, an increase of 13,257 during the twelve months. It, is estimated that the net increase of the numbers of invalid and old-age pensioners in 1936-37 will be about 13,500, above 1935-36, of about Â£600,000. The Government proposes to increase the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions from 18s. to 19s. a week. This will be given effect to as from the next pension pay-day following the passage of the necessary legislation. The estimated cost of this liberalization is Â£760,000 per annum. The Government is happy to find itself general financial position, to make this give the pensioners a greater purchasing power than they have had in any previous year since the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions. The existing provision in the act, whereby the rate of pension varies in accordance with the cost of living, will be amended to give effect to this increase of Is. a week, liy substituting a new scale of index numbers for that at present in the act. The estimated total expenditure for the present financial year on invalid and old-age pensions is Â£13,980,000. Maternity Allowances. The present scale of payments is Â£4 merits rising by 5s. for eacb surviving child under fourteen years of age, up to a maximum payment of Â£5. The allowable income limit also rises by Â£13 per annum for each surviving child up to a total of Â£299. It is now proposed to liberalize the law by providing for payment of an allowance of Â£4 10s. for the first child and Â£5 in every case in which there is auy previous surviving issue under the age of fourteen years tional concessions proposed in this budThe Government had proposed to exempt amounts paid as unemployment relief tax from computation as income for maternity allowance purposes. However, owing to complexity arising from varying provisions in this regard in the various States, the Government proposes instead to increase the amount of allowable income from Â£208 to Â£221 per annum in the case where there is no previous surviving issue, and to allow a correduction was as follows:responding increase throughout the existing income scale with a maximum income of Â£312 per annum instead of Â£299 as at present. This concession is of considerably greater value than exemption from unemployment relief tax. The increasing scale of allowable income for each child will still be retained to determine those eligible for the allowance. The cost of these liberalizations is estimated at Â£55,000 per annum, and Â£42,000 this year. War Pensions and Repatriation Benefits. As from the 1st January la3t, a number of additional concessions and benefits were granted to certain ex-members of the Australian Imperial Forces, and the Naval and Air Forces. Provision was made for service pensions for certain classes of ex-members of the forces, for restoration of commuted pensions and for additional pension and other benefits to certain dependants. In addition, provision was made for certain ex-members of the forces to receive medical treatment in repatriation hospitals or sanatoria and for improved treatment facilities and more modern hospital accommodation for patients in repatriation institutions. The Government believes that these concessions have substantially relieved the position of a large number of deserving cases, that, under the law as it stood, were suffering some degree of hardship. In this budget the Government proposes to increase the rate of service pensions by Is. a week, and also to increase by Is. 6d. a week the pensions to children of incapacitated soldiers. Several other minor concessions will be made to remove anomalies in the existing legislation. The estimated annual cost of the addiget is Â£162,001). In addition, the Government is providing Â£123,000 in the budget for the extension and improvement of repatriation hospitals and institutions. Salaries and Allowances. In 1931 the salaries of Commonwealth employees were subjected by the Financial Emergency Act to reductions as part of the plan for the rehabilitation of Government finances. The scale of Per cent. On salariesUp to Â£250 .. 18 From Â£251-Â£1,000 .. 20 From Â£1,001-Â£2,000 .. .. 22* Over Â£2,000 .. .. 25 As part of the plan to restore tbese reductions as the finances permitted, restorations totalling 10 per cent, have been made as under:During the financial yearPer cent. 10-13-34 .. .. . . a 103435 .. .. 2-J 103530 .. . . 2 * These salary restorations in the last three years freed all service salaries up to Â£485, 1930 standard, from any reduction under the Financial Emergency Act. In view of the general improvement of Commonwealth finances, it is now proposed completely to restore the salaries of all Commonwealth employees to the normal rates. Where the salaries of employees are, under ordinary legislation, subject to automatic adjustment in accordance with cost of living variations, such adjustments will continue to operate. The present cost of living reductions, as compared with the 1930 standard, total approximately Â£1,300,000 per annum and will, as stated, continue to operate. The cost of this restoration in respect of the public service and other Commonwealth employees will be Â£97,000 for a full year and Â£74,000 for the current year. -In Tespeet of allowances to members uf Parliament and salaries of Ministers, the Government proposes that a partial restoration be made, viz., by an amount equal to 10 per cent, of the normal rate. iT-he reductions then operative will bePer cent. 'On allowances of members of Parliament On salaries of Ministers The cost of this partial restoration will be Â£13,000 for a full year, and Â£10,000 for the current year. Health. The Government, having regard to the great importance of public health, and the necessity for close co-operation between the Commonwealth, the States, and the medical profession, has decided to (establish a National Health and Medical ^Research Council. Additional funds are being provided to make the work of the Department of Health more effective, with special reference to cancer, maternal welfare, aud the nutrition of the people generally. Defence. The trend of recent international events has -emphasized the importance of national defence. At the time the first Lyons Government assumed office, bright hopes were held that the burden of armaments would be relieved by reduction on the part of the heavily armed powers and the elimination of competition through agreements limiting the fighting strength of the various nations. 'The results have proved disappointing. 'They are doubly so to ""those democratic -nationa such as Great Britain and the aominions which have strenuously supported policies for the limitation and seduction of armaments, and 'the maintenance of peace -the 30th June, .1934. Of this sum Whi'e steadfastly pursuing a policy to -fliis end, ""the Government, in view of its grave responsibility for national -security, must, nevertheless, take the -world as it finds it . The Prime Minister iof the United Kingdom recently said'Takine ""risks for peace"" has not removed the dimmers of war. 'We have really no altermative in the present state of the world but io -review our defences and to provide necessary means both of safeguarding against agression and of playing our part in tlie enforcement by common action of international Mr Oasey. The great strides made in recent -years in the development of air communications is an important reminder to Australia that, in spite of our geographical remoteness, we cannot ignore happenings elsewhere. Without being alarmist, the Govern.. 5 ment wishes to put clearly before the .. 7i people of the Commonwealth the provision that it is incumbent upon them to make for national defence. The defence vote this year will be the highest in the history of the Commonwealth, but it is essential constantly to bear in mind that the burden entailed by preparedness is small in comparison with the human and monetary cost of war. The Government, therefore, is making provision in this financial year, not only for the amount required for the final stage of the three-year programme, but also for Â£1,480,000 for the commencement of a new programme. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, will, at an early date, place before honourable members full particulars of the Government's proposals for defence. The increasing financial provision for defence in recent years is shown in the following table:Â£ 193233 3,194,196 193334 4,166,048 193435 -. ,5.519.856 193530 .. 7,017.121 1930-37 (estimate) 8,809,107 The position of the defence trust account, is as follows:In 1934-35 an amount of Â£4,160,000 was paid to the account out of the accumulated excess .of .revenue over .expenditure for the thuee years ended 'Â£2,228,054 was expended in the last two financial years, leaving a balance at the -30th June, 1936, of Â£1,931,946. During the present year the -Government proposes to pay a sum of Â£2,000,000 to this account out of the excess Teceipts of 1935-36. The total sum available in the account at the 1st July, 1936, will thus be Â£3,931,946. Allowing for the ourselves estimated expenditure from the tru3t account for the present financial year of obligations. Â£1,952,008, it is expected that there will be a balance at tbe 30th June, 1937, of stations at Townsville (Queensland) , Â£1,979,938, which will be available toMinding (Western Australia), Dooen wards assisting the defence programme (Victoria), Cumnock (New South after that date. Australian War Memorial. The Government has decided to prowas brought into operation in March ceed with the completion of the Australast, and has proved of great benefit to lian War Memorial in Canberra. The the people of Tasmania and those on the erection of this building, which, in addimainland. tion to its function as a national memorial, is to house the war museum, was proposed shortly after the war. Although Parliament passed the necessary legislation in 1925 and certain funds were provided in 1928-2,9, the subsequent depression, prevented the completion of shipped to all countries other than New the structure. The Government has now Zealand during the 1936 season. The decided, subject to the requisite approcost is estimated at Â£4,500.

The council is continuing its investigations into animal and plant diseases, pests and scourges, forest products, goldmining, fisheries, and many other problems of primary production. In many directions the work of the council has already bech of great benefit to Australia, and has effected savings far exceeding the expenditure.

Loan Councili n May last the estimated Commonwealth loan, expenditure for 19.36-37 was, after discussion, set down at Â£3,750,000. however, that if the carrying out of its public works programme is to be assured, the prudent course is to make provision for not more than Â£3,107,000 from the Loan Eund, and the balance from revenue. The Postal Department is being granted Â£440,000 more this year for works purposes .to enable it to meet the ever-increasing demands of tlie publio for further services. A further Â£3S3,000 is being provided for the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway, on which Â£122,085 was expended last year. Eor works in the Northern Territory a total sum of Â£114,356 is provided for 1936-37, as against Â£72,582 actually expended in 1935-36. In addition, an amount of Â£60,000 is being provided in -.the ordinary Estimates for roads and 6tock routes, water supply facilities, and manent employment will have improved -assistance in regard to freights, rents, water boring, &c. The central staff of the Commerce Department and some sections of other departments were removed from Melbourne to Canberra ..during 1935-36. It is now proposed to undertake a programme of works, extending over several years, with the object of removing to Canberra the staffs of the Defence and Postmaster-General's Departments. These works include the erection of administration buildings, a considerable number of cottages, additional school accommodation, and extensions of the water supply -and sewerage systems. It is ;a great satisfaction to be in a position to present a budget which has BO many happy features. I do not pretend that the Government can justly claim all the credit for all the improvement of which this budget is the convincing demonstration. Many factors affecting the prosperity of a community are Mr Casey. This is particularly so in the case of Australia by reason of the fact that we depend in a substantial measure upon an export trade in which profits are determined by world prices. But I do claim At the meeting of the that the policy of the Commonwealth Government has had a verygreat influence in bringing about the desirable results reflected in this budget. Unwise The Government feels, financial, monetary or tariff policy would have gone far to prevent the effective operation of the factors making for improvement. Artificial speeding up of activity in Australia through credit expansion might have had temporarily beneficial effects but would have introduced the probability of dangerous repercussions. In addition to meeting our defence and other obligations the Government is most glad to have been able to improve the position of the invalid and old-age pensioners, and of incapacitated ex-soldiers and their children, as well as to liberalize the law relating to maternity allowances. The Government is glad also to have been able by this budget to improve the position of every section of the Australian community. Those who -are still, unfortunately, without peropportunities of being absorbed into industry, consequent upon the spur to enterprise that the substantial tax remissions will bring. Economic prophecy is a precarious venture, but so far as it is possible to attempt to forecast the future upon the basis of the -experience of the past, J may at least express a reasonable hope that this budget will be the beginning of a period of greater prosperity and happiness for the people of our country. I move That the first item in the Estimates under Division 1-the Senate-namel y "" Salaries and Allowances Â£7,900"" he agreed to. Progress reported. The following paper was presented The Bndgpt 1930-37-Papers presented hy the Honourable R. G. Casey, M.P., for the information of honourable members on the occasion of tlie Budget of 1930-37. Ordered to be printed. Sitting suspended from 5.28 to 8 p.m. In Committee of Supply: I moveTbat there be granted to His Majesty, for or towards defraying the services of tlie year 1036-37, a sum not exceeding Â£4,404,750. As honourable members will remember, Supply Act No. 1 of this year, which was passed in May last made provision for the first three months of the present financial year. That period will expire at the end of the current month. As the appropriation under that act will then be exhausted, a further appropriation of revenue is necessary to meet ordinary requirements pending the passing of the Estimates for the current financial year. The new Supply Bill provides for an appropriation from revenue of Â£4,404,750. which amount it is estimated will cover expenditures up to the end of November next. Provision is made for certain increased post office expenditure due to normal expansion, for certain urgent defence services, and for a few minor urgent new works for various departments, to be charged temporarily to Treasurer's Advance. Provision is also made for increased expenditure on salaries, based on the budget proposals for the restoration of salary reductions. These increases, however, will not be paid until the financial relief measure embodying them has been passed by the Parliament and has received the royal assent. Apart from these relatively minor matters, the bill is based on last year's expenditure and does not provide for anything which involves new policy. Although supply is sought for two months, honourable members will have an opportunity to debate the budget and with it, of course, the whole of the Government's proposals, at as early a date as possible. gentleman guarantee that the guillotine will not be applied to the discussion of the budget and the Estimates? in the interests of all parties to fix a time for the passage of the Estimates as a whole. I have no doubt that such action would be taken in agreement with honourable gentlemen opposite, in order that every item of the Estimates might be equitably dealt with. At the moment, however, the Government has no proposals in that regard. It is confidently hoped that well before the end of November, when this supply will be exhausted, the Parliament will have had full opportunity to debate in detail the general estimates of expenditure for the year. I trust that, by reason of the information which has already been made available iu the budget speech, a fuller explanation of this measure will not be necessary. I commend the motion to the committee. The Opposition will vote against the motion, because it feels that at this juncture there is no occasion for the introduction of a supply measure. Parliament has already passed a Supply Bill covering the first three months .of the present financial year. Honourable members will recall that during the consideration of that measure the committee was given to understand by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) that before supply for the first three months of the financial year had been exhausted, Parliament would have reassembled, and the budget would have been introduced. The honourable gentleman said that Parliament would be enabled to examine in detail the various items contained in the Estimates for the next financial year. I submit that that statement carried with it the clear -implication not only that we would be able to examine the details of expenditure for the current financial year, but also that we would be able to control expenditure for the whole of the financial year with the exception of the three months for which supply was then ""sought and granted. The motion which the Treasurer has just moved will, if passed, take out of the control of the Parliament the management of the finances of the country for a further two months, making a total of five the honourable months of the financial .year. I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary on the 10th September to grant supply for the months of October and November. Even conceding that, in order adequately to examine the statement delivered this afternoon, and control the estimates of expenditure set out in the",27,General Conditions In Australia

That would not only give to the committee the fullest knowledge in respect of the policy and the proposed legislation of the Government, but also provide the fundamental safeguard of enabling Parliament to exercise some check, if check be desirable, supply. Otherwise, the Government will upon contemplated governmental expenditure. The Treasurer, as I stated earlier, gave us to understand that the supply for three months granted to him before the recess, was required in order that the services of the Commonwealth might be maintained and covered, and that, before any additional supply was sought the committee would be in a position to control the expenditure of the Government from the 30th September to the end of the financial year. Although those were not actually the terms which he used, I submit that we may reasonably claim that his statement carried that implication. I urge tbe honourable gentleman to reduce his proposed Â£4,404,750 to Â£2,250,000. I undertake that if, in the last week of October, it should be apparent to the Government that full and proper consideration of the budget and the Estimates make desirable the passing of another supply bill ni> unreasonable obstacles will be placed in its way. We should then know that the choice confronting us was cither a curtailment of tbe budget debate or the granting of furrhor supply. At tlii-= stage, the committee is exposed to the possibility that, having been granted supply and lacking agreement within its ranks upon major items of policy, the Government might adjourn Parliament for a fortnight, three weeks, or a month, in order to permit the heterogeneouscollection of mixed elements which constitute it to resolve their difficulties. I do not propose to abuse the parliamentary control of public expenditure merely to permit Ministers to accommodate themselves to the political difficulties which their administration has incubated. It can justifiably be said that during the recess they have not given anything in the form of a demonstration which would warrant the Parliament giving to them this additional two month's supply before the budget has been considered. We shall not hold up this debate. I ask the Treasurer seriously to consider my suggestion to seek one month's supply. If at the expiration of that period it is clear that more time is needed properly to deal with the Estimates and the legislation resulting from the budget, we shall feel justified in granting another month's be in command of the finances until the SOth November; a Government, mark you, which has muddled trade relations with certain of our customers, has exasperated the States of the Commonwealth, has bungled the matter of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, has arrived at a complete negation towards the issue of a 40-hour working week, which it undertook to affirm, at least in principle, and has produced utter confusion in respect of Commonwealth action in regard to the major problems of the country. exhausted. short summary appears to me to justify the Opposition iu opposing this grant of supply for a period much longer than tlie necessities of Government administration demand, the effect of which, furthermore, would be to deprive the Parliament of authority over the finances of the country for at least one month longer than the circumstances of the Treasury w -irrajit. If the honourable gentleman wiil not accept my suggestion to ask for one month's supply, we shall oppose the bill.",44,Supply Bill No 2 1936 37

[8.35] -In my budget speech I set out fully the Government's works proposals for the year 1936-37, including those to be financed from revenue, and those from trust and loan funds. Details of these works will be found on pages 276 to 287 of the Estimates. Corresponding details are set out in the schedule to the Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill. I am about to deal only with the new works chargeable to the revenue account. A further bill will be submitted later to provide for certain works expenditure which the Government proposes shall be paid for out of loan moneys. The total of the proposed expenditure on public works, &c, in 1936-37, as detailed in my budget speech and in the Estimate?, is Â£7,684,305, as compared with Â£5,236,537 actually expended last financial year-a n increase of Â£2,447,768. The new expenditure is to be provided for as follows:FromHevenuc Loan Total The revenue for new works is as follows:Proposed appropriation e Udu 61. Â£ Departments and services otlier business undertakings and territories of wealth Business undertakings Territories Total The increase of the proposed appropriation for works from revenue in the current year over the expenditure in 1935-36 is Â£953,297. The amount required for defence is Â£1,117,772. This is in addition to the amount of Â£1,952,000 to be expended. from, the defence trust account, which, as honourable members know, is financed from the excess reveuue receipts of previous years. The appropriation recommended for postal works is Â£1,750,000. A much (Corio Treasurer) greater amount could profitably be devoted to this service, which is defiuitely reproductive. The necessity, however, for a balanced programme, with due regard to all interests, forbids a greater allocation to these works. A further Â£600,000 for postal works, will be included in the Loan Appropriation Bill for the year. The total proposed expenditure for postal, telegraphic and telephonic works is thus Â£2,350,000.. The increase of Â£278,709 in the provision for territory works is due mostly to the necessity for developmental policy, in regard to both the Federal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. It is proposed to inaugurate a programme of works, extending over some years, with a view to the eventual transfer of all Commonwealth departments to Canberra, but the immediate need is to provide office and dwelling accommodation for the officers of the Defence Department and the Postmaster-General's Â£ Department. Additional funds are also 4,570,967 being provided for the development of 3,107^339 the Northern Territory, particularly for mining development. 7,084,306 Full information with regard to the appropriation proposed from specific works proposed to be undertaken during this year will be made available, eiSSnui. if desired, by the Ministers in chargeof , i"" r u l the respective departments. 1935.36.

[8.44] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to appropriate from loan funds an amount of Â£600,000 for works to be carried out by the Postmaster-General's Department. If honourable members will refer to the table towards the end of the budget speech headed "" public works, etc."", they will -find set out there in tabulated form, the details of the amounts to be expended during the current financial year on pub.ic works. The grand total is Â£7,614,305. This amount is to be drawn from loan funds, trust funds, and revenue.

Many of the amounts included in the proposed expenditure have already been appropriated in earlier sittings of the Parliament under special acts, such as those relating to Farmers' Debt Adjustment, the Port Augusta to Port Pirie railway, unemployment relief works in the States, and grants to the States for mining and forestry. The only amount and included in the proposed loan expenditure which has not already been appropriated is a sum of Â£600,000 for postal works. The present bill accordingly provides only (Corio-Treasurer ) for the appropriation of that amount. As explained in connection with the proposals for new works expenditure from revenue, the total amount to be provided for post office, telegraphic and telephonic works in the present year is Â£2,353,000. Of this sum, Â£1,750,000 is provided for in the new works votes from revenue, and Â£603,000 is on the loan Estimates.. Of the Â£603,000, Â£3,000 was provided in an earlier appropriation.

That tlie House do now adjourn. I again bring under the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) two urgent matters which I understand have already received his attention. I refer in the first place to the case of a woman who has been denied an invalid and old-age pension because the department contends that she is not totally and permanently incapacitated. A portion of the letter from the Deputy Commissioner readsThe evidence shows, however, that whilst Mrs. is not such as to render her totally and permanently incapacitated for all work, and she is considered capable of rendering light household duties. The department contends that because this woman is capable of washing up a few cups and saucers, and dusting furniture, she is not entitled to an invalid pension. The evidence submitted to the department proves conclusively that she can perform only light household duties, and consequently cannot obtain a position from which she could obtain sufficient remuneration to maintain herself. Many persons capable of performing light household work, as this woman is able to do, are deprived of a pension. The department is not giving effect to tbe spirit or to the letter of the act, and is administering it in an unsympathetic way. A case brought under my notice shows the extent to which the Repatriation Department will go. A man who applied for a service pension, was informed by the medical officers of the Repatriation Department that as he was not unemployable he was not entitled to a pension. He then applied for an invalid pension, which was granted on the grounds of permanent incapacity. Although this fact was brought under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) a communication has been received from his department stating that as the applicant is not unemployable, he is not entitled to a service pension. theatre of war? The fact that this man has been granted an invalid pension shows that the Repatriation Department is treating this man in an unusually harsh manner. Invalid pensions are not granted unless applicants are entitled to them. I have brought this matter forward in the hope that something will be done immediately, particularly in view of the fact that a service pension has been refused by the Repatriation Department to a man although that man is actually receiving an invalid pension on the ground that he is totally and permanently incapacitated. I trust that the Treasurer will bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation and that he will request is not in good health, her condition the Repatriation Department to grant this man a service pension. I join with the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) in raising question against the manner in which the Repatriation Department is dealing with some claims for service pensions. As stated by the honourable member for Werriwa, persons who are eligible for and are in receipt of invalid pensions are refused service pensions. In delaying the payment of service pensions, the Government is paying persons only 18s. a week when they are entitled to 30s. weekly. I have felt for a long time that the medical officers of the Repatriation Department are unnecessarily harsh in interpreting the act, and in certain instances do not grant pensions to persons entitled to them. The Government should recognize that any returned soldier who receives an invalid pension is entitled to a service pension, more particularly if the invalid pension has been granted during the last five years. The Government sbould review the attitude adopted by the Repatriation Department, and give incapacitated returned soldiers the consideration they deserve.",48,Second Reading
