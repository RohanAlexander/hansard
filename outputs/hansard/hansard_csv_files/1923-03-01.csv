H is would have been the wild platitudes of the Communist or Socialist, which mean nothing to sane minds, but carry away those who do not understand them. If we are to have platitudes, I prefer them savoured with a little sanity rather than those which the honourable The honourable member repeatedly said that the combination now in office is without common principles or' common ideals, and was brought about merely for the purpose of keeping the Labour party out of office. That is quite absurd. The two parties that have combined have common ideals and a common basis, and we shall endeavour to carry through a programme which represents those ideals. But even if that were not so. I think it would have been very proper foi the parties on this side to combine 1 if for no other objective than to keep the present Labour party out of power. Some things are so terrible to contemplate for Australia that almost any preventive action would be justified. One of those possibilities is the advent to power in the -Commonwealth of the Labour party as ^at present constituted. I had a very con-siderable respect for the Labour party of those days of which the honourable member for Bourke spoke, which put upon the -statute-book some admirable measures. placed those measures on the statute-book are in the House now, but the parties opposite have kicked out all but two of those who went over to them from the Labour party. orable members to resist the temptation to in lerject. very considerable admiration for the Labour party of days gone by. and the things for which it stood. members opposite flatter themselves if they think that tbey are anything lik'e the old Labour party, or that their proposals resemble the principles for which Labour stood in years gone by. In those days of alleviation, will meet tlie position.

To-day the position is no nnolojry for this statement. . . ' Australia very different. I say quite f r a n k ly that. is moving to the crisiswhile bhe Labour party is in its present position, and stands for those things that My remarks may have been are forced on it from outside, I am going to do everything in my power to keep it out of office. I am sorry to have to say what I must say about the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), but he said much about the party on this side, and I must point out that honorablt members opposite are not so blameless as he might suggest. There isone phase member would have uttered. which I desire to mention for the consideration of the honourable memher. We all know what the Labour party stands for to-day. The party makes no disguise of the fact that it stands to-day for what its programme says-the socialization of production, industry, distribution, o and exchange. I presume that, should the Labour party come into power, honorahle members opposite are prepared to carry out their own programme. gretted that the honourable member did not tell the country what his party's programme was. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) went up and down the country aud made many speeches. I have the greatest admiration for those speeches, because he skated over such thin ice that it is almost inconceivable that he did not go through. This, however, did not.happen; the honourable member evaded all the dangerous subjects and avoided all mention of the real objectives who for which his party stands'. The present Government may have some demeritspersonally, I hesitate to believe it hasbut they and their supporters certainly had the courage to tell the country what they stood for and what they believed in. There are quite a number of gentlemen opposite who did nothing of the sort. I free the honorable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) from any such charge, aa -he never hesitates to say what he thinks. He not only says it on the platform, but Honorabl« has also put it into books, and I have in front of me'one of his very frank utterances in regard to a policy for Australia :Xn skin-plaster legislation, no mere policy instrumentality, tlie sole alternative to a long period of absolute slavery.

5,Mr Brtjce,"Then it is to be reA t least I admire my honourable friend opposite for thus declaring what he thinks and stands for. I now desire to deal with some of the questions as to which the honourable member for Bourke says that the Government could have solved them in a day ancl submitted to Parliament a policy in regard to them. If , however, the honourable member w i ll consider those questions for a moment-and remember that I am not' so fortunately placed as he is in having his policy made for Mm-h e will see that the Government was in considerable difficulties in attempting its I thc question that I mentioned in Adelaide, and which appears to have caused such intense pain to the honourable member for Bourke. He did not like my referring to the Empire and Empire defence. most vital question of all, seeing that Australia's defence is wrapped up in the question of Empire defence. less for the honourable member to talk of all those great ideas and ideals of Socialism that he would bring into force in Australia, unless he takes the first necessary step, namely, to assure Australia's safety and the integrity of the territory whicli we govern to-day. That is why, I take this subject fii'st. It is, as I have said, the most important question that faces Australia to-day. think, not one of us, certainly not any of us who came into close contact with the recent war, but is determined that there shall be no repetition of tliat tragedy if we can avoid it . I think there are few of uswho do not believe absolutely in the reduction of armaments as f a r as it can be brought about ancl a minimum even on defence. or warlike preparation to-day is not to be contemplated in any civilized country, and even for defence we must consider what is the minimum compatible' with our safety. it is a sacred obligation on us to provide for the safety and integrity of the country we are called upon to govern. It is a question of thedefence of Australia, and we can only defend this country if we are inside the Empire, and if we have the assistance of the Motherland and the Empire as a whole. I believe in the League of Nations. Some day I believe that that League is going to insure the peace of the world if it gets the support it should from all the nations. But that hour has not come, and we have to-day to preserve our safety. To attempt this task alone, and not under an .Empire defence scheriie, is to court disaster, and the cost of the attempt would place a paralyzing burden on the people of Australia. I ask honorable gentlemen opposite to turn their minds to the importance of this great question. I know task in the period allowed. there are some men I shall never conwish, first of all, to deal with vince, and I know also that there are some who realize these facts, but have not the courage to state them. But I appeal to every man who has courage and vision to realize the importance of the question. The Government believe that I suggest to h i m that it is the to-day, for the discussion of the question of an Empire naval defence scheme, consultation between the Dominions and It is usethe Motherland is essential; and if an Imperial Conference is not summoned, Australia will press for one at the earliest possible moment, believing, as we do, that the formulation of a common scheme of defence is vital to our safety and our whole future welfare. ""Wrapped up in the question of Empire defence, is the question of Empire foreign affairs. There are some in Australia who think that we can be a law unto ourselvesThere is, I that we are 12,000 miles away from. Europe, and need not worry about what happens in other parts of the world. I remind those who take that view that the distanoe of 12,000 miles did not save us from being involved in the late war, nor will it save us in the future. We have to t r y to insure that any Empire foreign policy for which we expenditure must bear responsibility is one to which Expenditure for war we have assented. W it h f u l l appreciation of the responsibility for what I am saying; I suggest that this question to-day ds not in a satisfactory position, and that, unless some better arrangeB u t within those limits ments can be made, the position of an outlying Dominion like Australia will become intolerable. If we are to take any responsibility for the Empire's foreign policy, tliere must be a better system, so that we may be consulted and have a better opportunity to express the views of -the people of this country. This is a matter that will have to be considered at the Imperial Conference. We -cannot blindly submit to any policy wiliich may involve us in war. We want to know where we aire going. Another great question of vital concern to the safety and welfare of the Empire is that of commuaiications-wireless , shipping, and all mean's of communication between Australia and the Motherland. These are problems which come first-our safety must stand before everything. When that safety is assured we may then consider schemes for the betterment of our internal condition, but not before. As to the other question, that of ing for herself. Empire trade relations, the 'Government that we expect from the Motherland regard it as of paramount imjportance. We some additional consideration in return all realize the .great .change that has come for what Ave have done, but we realize her over Australia's position during .the last, vast and very great difficulties. Howfew years.

It is to the Motherland we must look primarily in considering the question of markets and the disposal of our surplus products.

Thirdly, we propose to encourage private enterprise to come in and help in the development of the Territory, and in the building of the Capital.

May I suggest to my friends-wh o say that we could have produced our policy here and gone ahead w it h legislationone thought in regard to this matter. It is not the work of a week or of two weeks to prepare the whole basis upon which we would propose to hand over a great undertaking of this character to a Commission which would be responsible for the futur e conduct of such an important matter. The next point to which I wish to direct the attention bers relates to matters Commonwealth first of these questions is that of immigration. members of the position in regard to immigration are all familiar with the fact that, the exception of the territories to which I have just referred, the whole of the land in Australia is in the hands of the iStates, and that the States control this side of the question. I remind them, however, of the necessity for getting into Australia, and I can tell them this much of the policy of the that we intend to press on with gration. have made a policy speech which merely indicated that we proposed to do this. The question is how dt is to be done, and the consideration matter which will take a little Within a fortnight no Government could have taken the whole of this position, examined what has been done in the past, ascertained stood in relation to the States, Ur. Bruce. its opinion on all that has already been done, and formulated a policy for the future. Yet that is exactly what is suggested should have been done. The suggestion is absurd. The Government propose to consider the whole question of dmmigration. A t the conference with the States, to which I have already referred, we propose to review all that has been done up to date, the agreeWhen, we ments entered into w it h the three States concerned, tlie position of the British Government in respect to the matter, and the assistance it is prepared to give. When we meet the House, and set out our polioy, we hope to be able to say clearly aud exactly how we propose to bring about a steady flow of settlers. There is much talk about its necessity, but we find that there are really few people who pay much attention to it generally, and very few who consider particularly how the result which they desire may be brought about. The finances of the Commonwealth and of the States will form another matter for consideration at the Conference. The Commonwealth, and each of the States, conducts its own finances, both w i th regard to revenue and loan. There are too many people in Australia who seem to of honourable memthink that Commonwealth and State involving the finances are entirely separated. The and the States. The credit of Australia is the credit of the Commonwealth and of all, the States. I need not remind honourable It w ill be for us to t r y to insure that our finances throughout the whole and land settlement. They country shall be conducted on the very with best possible basis, because a weakness in any link is a source of weakness in the whole chain of our national credit. The necessity for our credit to-day being placed upon the very best possibli© basis will become apparent to all when the Conference is held. I do not propose to set people out the figures at this stage, but the Commonwealth authorities will place beGovernment, fore the Conference the f u l l and exact immiposition concerning existing loan commitIt would be simplicity itself to ments-no t riie loan commitments of any one State, or of the Commonwealth alone, but of Australia as a whole. We intend also to set out details of the loans of that, I suggest, is a which are to be converted between the time. present date and 1930. It will be an excellent thing that Australia's national immigration position, for once at any rate, should be presented as a whole, so that we may exactly where it all take stock of the real facts, and performed ceive precisely where we stand. facts, when they shall have heen made known, will, I think, prove rather ill uminating. have to deal also with the question of the future borrowing policy of Australia. The best policy i u the interests of Australia as a whole would be to have one borrowing authority. is that we should have a uniform basis for raising loans. quite impossible position exists. Commonwealth has laid down definitely as its policy that it w ill not issue tax-free loans; the States to-day are issuing tax-free loans. The Commonwealth, while it does not tax State loans, taxes its own loans, and the result is that the whole of the moneys available for investment by people with large incomes will inevitably flow into the tax-free loans. These are the people who should largely provide our income tax, and who should help materially to-support the Government under which they live and have protection. by investment in tax-free loans. Such a state of affairs is altogether wrong, and cannot continue. A loan is supposed to be so issued that .every individual subscriber w ill get the same return, but as matters stand those possessed of . large incomes are getting a much greater return than smaller investors. been made of the amount of revenue Specific arrangements are already in which we are losing owing to these State operation in two of the States; but for loans being tax free? wealth loses very heavily. matter of fact.

We believe that public health and its preservation are among the most important questions with which we are faced. They are of such paramount importance, indeed, that they should be That obligation they can avoid dealt with on a national basis. We shall be prepared to come to a working arrangement with the States, but we do not wish to carry on in existing circumstances; for that would simply mean further duplication and more waste of time and effort. The consideration of electoral arrangements need not be dwelt upon now, but that question must also come forward. the Commonwealth and the States generally to carry on as at present is unThere will be still another matter for lose, as a the Conference; and, with respect to it , whether that gathering can provide awhich should be done.

The whole question is a national one, and should not be approached independently by each State. It must be handled by the States and the Commonwealth in conjunction. ment will not try to centralize too much. that, but that we should have a method of co-operation. I a.m against centralization. I favour co-operation and the avoidance of duplicated effort, for only in that way can we hope to achieve anything. The Government will be prepared to seriously bring forward proposals, and to embody their outcome in 'their policy -provide d that we can arrange with the States to do away with overlapping. Thus, again, the policy of the Government depends upon what arrangements we may be able to make at the Conference. ' Also, in respect of the collection of statistics, we ought to be able to arrange that there shall not be a continuance of duplication. One further subject is that of the River Murray Agreement and the basis for the development of the whole of the Murray Valley. Commonwealth and States are involved in. the scheme for the looking of the river, and are involved also in the greater part of the plans of settlement proceeding in the Murray Valley. ""We must discuss the whole business in order to arrive at a considered policy. Another matter-agai n depending uponwhat arrangementswe miay be able to make with the States--ha s to dowith securing uniformity of railway gauge. The question is difficult,, but surely every man will agree that it would have been eminently desirable to have all. our railwaysuniformly constructed, and that all fu-tua-e lines, should be. of similar gauge-. Further, I think that all. thinking men will agree that at some time uniformity of gauge must be. brought about throughout the continent. ""We must meet the States and consider the existing financial position, taking stock of the obligations which both Commonweallth and States have entered upon.. When we have that picture clearly before us, we should be able to consider what practical steps may be taken. We must lay down some definite basis; and, if we are not going to proceed with active work a.t once, something, must be done to prevent or minimize ever-increasing losses. It must be remembered, however, that, while the Commonwealth pays one-fifth, the States will be called upou to meet four-fifths of the burden. This is a question for the States to decide in the light of their financial position. They must determine at what pace we shall proceed, and obviously the Government's policy must depend upon tlie outcome of the Conference to be held with representatives of the States. On the question of industrial relations, I do not think there is any one, not excepting members of the Opposition, who does not agree that a dual authority is undesirable, and is leading to very serious 'difficulties in Australia to-day. We have the State tribunals and the Pederal tribunal side by side, and neither the employer nor the employee can arrive at finality. It is a position intolerable to both sides.

It is the duty of the Government, however, to look into the position first, and form its own opinion of what action should be taken. In regard to repatriation generally, I only wish to say that the Government w ill , as past Governments have attempted to do, honour our obligations to the soldiers. seems to have been a suggestion that that is one thing we have not done. The suggestion is not true. We are maintaining to-day, and ' will continue to maintain, our policy of preference to soldiers. The Government has quite realized, and I think every thinking person must have done likewise, that the best possible treatment must b© meted out to those who are old, infirm, and sick. This question will be considered by the Government, will announce quite clearly and definitely what its policy is. It is a matter which obviously must be looked into, and no Mr Bruce. Government should be asked to declare There is the what it intends to do in an important matter of this kind within a fortnight of taking office. There is one thing which The ComI , can promise will be done at once. While at the TreasuryI investigated a number of anomalies and hardships occurring under the regulations which govern There the administration of old-age and invalid pensions. The investigation is now finalized, and within a very short period we ought to be in a position to announce a very substantial relaxation of some of The different activities w ill not these admittedly harsh regulations, and a removal of some of the anomalies which The ""War Service Homes exist at the present time. dothat before the House meets. wide' question in which every one is interested, namely, economic and efficient administration. The Government believes in that, and w ill do everything in its power to' bring it about. Mere pious expressions as to what one is going to do with regard to efficiency and economy are of very little, use; the Government must be judged upon what it actually does. It does no more now than give the country the assurance that it realizes the absolute necessity for both efficiency and economy. I do not wish, however, to be misunderstood. I am convinced that the country does not desire economy that is brought about by injustice. The Government is determined to do all that is possible to secure efficiency ancl economy, but it is certainly not going to achieve those objects by disregarding all justice and equity in respect of those There in the employ of the Oommonwealth. W it h that one qualification, the Government w ill do everything in its power to effect these two ends. As to the practical steps that are being taken, the Government' w ill proceed immediately with the appointment of the Public Service Board of three Commissioners recommended by the Economies Commission, and provided for in the Public Service Act.

The Government recognises that Protection, is the accepted policy of Austr.alia, and it has<Australia has adopted, namely, that its no intention, as some seem to think, of tearing up the Tariff. The Government, however, believes that with regard to our policy of Protection some great factors have to be taken into account. One of these is that the most vital question with which we are faced to-day is the sale of our surplus primary production in oversea markets. I think that view is generally accepted by even the strongest Protectionists. The Government realizes the importance of the question of the sale of our surplus production. It has heard many suggestions that owing to the duties on agricultural machinery and fertilizers, our production is becoming so costly in primary industries that it is imwhole policy of a White Australia. In the possible to dispose of our surplus in the markets of the world. We propose to refer the question of the duty upon agricultural machinery and fertilizers to the Tariff Board, and to request, it to report as to its effect upon the industry concerned. That report will be submitted to this House, and no action will be taken without the concurrence of the Honse. I think all will agree that it is only right and proper that we should have before us a considered report upon the effects of these duties on the great primary industries. ister include 'in the reference to the Tariff Board the question of the duties on mining requisites? may have any matter referred to the Board; but I am now announcing that the particular matter with which we are going to ask it to deal relates to the duties on agricultural machinery and fertilizers. The next question with which I propose to deal is that of sugar. The Australia that the white sugar industry of the Commonwealth should be safeguarded against the competition of blackgrown sugar, and it proposes to take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard it. I think that, in that determination, the Government will have the support of not a part, but the whole, of the people of Australia. We all realize that the question involves two principles. It involves, first of all, a principle which industries must he protected against unfair outside competition. We have even protected ourselves in this regard against our own kinsmen of New Zealand. That being so, surely we are going to protect ourselves against the blackgrown sugar industry of other countries. This question involves, secondly, the great principle of the maintenance of a White Australia. The sugar industry which has sprung up in the tropical parts of Australia is to-day of vast importance. Millions of pounds have been invested in it, and it gives employment to a great number of men. To destroy the industry, would be to strike a vital blow at the action which the Government proposes to take to safeguard the industry, I think we will have the support of the whole of the people, but whether the means we propose to adopt to this end will meet with united support is another matter. During thc Avar, and the post-war period, protection was afforded to the sugar industry of Queensland by means of an agreement which expires on 30th June next. That agreement the Government does not propose to renew. It is an agreement Avhich might have been suitable in the extraordinary and abnormal circumstances which then preA-ailed; but it cannot be contended that it is right to-day to give to one iudustry treatment that Ave are not prepared to accord to another.

32,Mr Bruce,"I have been tryin g toMi-. SCULLIN (Yarra) [5.28] -The Prime Minister in his concluding remarks really supplied an answer to his own argument. He said that he had not given tlie House the policy of the Government. There was no need for him to have made such an admission. He ranged over a large number of subjects, but made no attempt to give the House or the country an idea of the policy of the Government. The reason is not far to seek; the Government cannot agree upon a policy. At the outset of my remarks I may be permitted to adopt the usual course of congratulating the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply. Although they are new members they made very creditable speeches, having reral is a blank; we are asked to take the gard to the fact that they had nothing to talk about. There was not in the Governor General's Speech a hint or suggestion, let alone a text, upon which to base their remarks. I sympathize with them; it was nothing short of refined cruelty to ask two new members to move and second an Address-in-Reply to a speech which was a blankI might almost say a "" blankety blank."" In the circumstances they did .admirably. May I also congratulate the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) upon having made a very long speech without telling the House or the country anything. That is a task which requires a good deal of skill, and for one who has not been very long in Parliament the Prime Minister acquitted himself admirably. I noticed that there was a tone of complaint in his speech. I pass over the superior tone because the honourable gentleman cannot help it, and we are accustomed to it, but I take exception to his complaint against honourable members on this side doing anything that will embarrass the Government. I remind ham of his famous speech at Maryborough, in which he said, "" If Mr Hughes be thrown out I will go out with him, and we shall put up a stiff fight against those who attempt to run the Government of tlie country."" I pass by the boast-fulness of that threat, and the breach of his pledge to go out of office if Mr Hughes was put out-h e did not go out, but took his chief's job-and I draw attention to this other aspect of the statement at Maryborough, that if he, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, with Mr Hughes were put out of the Government, those two together would put up a stiff fight against anybody ""who attempted to run the Government of the country."" He should not now complain if we, on this side of the House, put up' a stiff fight against those who are not even "" attempting to run the Government."" Surely we, as representatives of the majority of the people of Australia, are entitled to make a fight against a Government assuming office and immediately seeking to get Parliament into recess for four months without giving the slightest indication of how the country is to be governed. The Speech delivered by the Governor-GeneGovernment on trust, and ask no questions. The Prime Minister charged the honourable member for Bourke with talking wild platitudes in regard to the socialization of industry and those other awful ^ proposals which he said would bring rain to Australia. I remind the honourable gentleman that long before he entered politics the proposals submitted by the Labour party were similarly described. When we faced thc electors in 1910 and placed before them a definite and concrete programme our proposals were described as a wild revolution, which would ruin Australia, plunge the country over a precipice, break the marriage tie, and destroy the sanctity of the home. Every evil that thc imagination could conjure up was predicted as certain to happen if the Labour Government should attain to the Treasury bench. The Labour party was nevertheless intrusted with the reins of govermnent. Por three years we had a majority in this House ancl in another place, and, so far from Australia being ruined by our administration, those were some of the best years of prosperity that the country has known. So satisfied with our legislation were the people that there has been no attempt by those who had been prophets of evil to wipe our enactments off the statute-book. The Prime Minister said, also that if the present Government had no other policy than to keep the Labour party out of office the combination of parties would be justified. merely a policy of negation. on to say, repeating the platitudes that we hear so often, that he had great admirationand respect for the men who used to be in the Labour party, for those Labour Ministers who placed on the statute-book some admirable measures, and he gave his meed of praise to the legislation of Labour during 1910-13. In what political camp was the honourable gentleman when Labour was doing those things? leagues of to-day, when we were placing upon the statute-book those admirable laws which have stood by the country i u its time of stress and trial? assailing us as bitterly then as they are to-day. was described as involving r u in to Australia. have great respect and admiration for the men who did those things, but not for the present Labour party. bour was governing and legislating so admirably, where were those members of the Millions Olub whom the PrimeM i nister addressed in Sydney, who cheered him as the representative of the new Government, and who supply the funds with which honourable members opposite contest their elections? There was just the same bitter hostility to the party that represents the workers and Democrats of Australia as there is at tlie present time. It is said that the Labour party has changed, but I remind the Prime Minister that the majority of those who are in the Labour party to-day were in the House when the measures to which he refers were placed on the statute-book. Many of those who now sit on the Opposition benches heljjed to formulate the programme which the Prime Minister described to us as admirable. But it is said that a change came over us, and that, although we are the same men, our methods are different. that to be true, I ask the Prime Minister, and those who sit behind him, whether he will say that the men who l e f t the Labour party in 1916, and who had helped in that legislation the honourable gentleman eulogized to-day, have changed. They were of the old Labour party, and they had been welcomed into the bosom of the auti-Labour party as everything that was good ancl noble and patriotic; but, as a reward for leaving the Labour party, and That is thus smashing it , they have been sent into He went political oblivion by the people. There are now only two of those members l e f t in the House, ancl one who was acclaimed throughout Australia as the greatest man the Empire knew ha|s been thrown overboard, since he was discredited before the country. The day will come when those whom the member I refer to left, and who have a majority of the Australian people behind them, will govern the country and give Where were he and his colthe people the same, sort of admirable legislation as in 1910-13, and this legislation in its turn w ill no doubt be eulogized by even its critics. They were The Prime Minister repeated the old gibe of 1910 and previous years-the gibe Every one of those measures that is used when our critics are not "" game "" to attack the real definite proHow, those gentlemen profess to posals of the Labour party-namely , that we are dominated from outside. What does that mean ? We who represent the When Lagreat toiling masses of Australia share with them the responsibility of shaping our programme in the' interests of the country. We are not dominated by them, nor they by us, but we are here as their representatives endeavouring to give effect to the programme on which we are mutually agreed. I would sooner, however, be dominated-if there be any domination-h y the great rank and file of the honest men and women who are the workers of this country than by the Millions Ciub, Flinders!aue, or the money magnates of Australia. The Prime Minister, after making this general charge of domination from outside, placed before us a long list of the problems which faced Australia. I remind tlie honourable gentleman that the present Government have not inherited these problems from Labour Governments,, but from his own oolleagues and party. All these financial and economic difficulties have been handed down by anti-Labour Even allowing Governments, and these difficulties the Prime Minister and his Government cannot surmount or deal with on their own authority and responsibility, but have to go cap in hand to the State Governments in order to ascertain how they must be met. The Prime Minister was very interesting when' he said that the Government and the party behind them were unitedthat they were one in common ideals, and were banded together on a common basis. This, as I have said, was very interesting in view of the emphasis laid by the other head ai the' Government (Dr. Earle Page) been done in their name by their Prime on his contention that the Government is Ministei-. composed of two separate entities.

He has indicated that the Government have made up their minds upon this question, but why is it shrouded in mystery, and why are the people not told what the Government have at the back of their minds on the matter of the proposal to tear up the Constitution or alter it? It needs a great deal of alteration, but I can conceive of its being amended in directions that would not be progressive, but, on the other hand, would be of a most retrograde character. sonnel of the Government would lead me to expect that anything would be likely to .happen in the nature of retrograde steps. Now, things about which we are told nothing, I come back to the big question confronting Australia to-day, the most serious problem of unemployment, which, day after day, as our amendment states, is being accentuated by the influx of unemployed from other countries. Yesterday, an honourable member .of the Opposition asked thc Prime Minister whether he had noted a' statement in a cablegram published in the press that a dangerous and notorious housebreaker in B r it a in shares of the had been let off by a Court because it was stated he was being sent to Australia. I do not say The price of the that because this appeared in a cablegram in a newspaper, it is true; but if the matter was regarded as of sufficient importance to cable out to Australia it was also sufficiently important to cause the Government toi take some note of it . The answer made by the PrimeM i nister was that he ""knew nothing about It is because of the genedt, indicating that the Government are not watching these matters and are preT h a t is not so. The pared to let any one be dumped into Australia. What is the experience of these men when they land here ? If they are lucky they are sent away to a job in a country district at £ 1 or £ 1 59. per week. In the midst of the harvest some of them got £ 1 10s. per week. These arc the "" good wages "" guaranteed to them. But when they have been at work foi a few months and have become a little skilled, if they ask for a rise they are sacked and new immigrants are put in their places. We see statements in the press by immigration officers and by the State Ministers in charge of immigration, that Australia is absorbing all the immigrants who arrive. It is true that in most cases they are absorbed, but in a few months they are transferred to the unemployment market. I have met scores of these men stranded in Melbourne, seeking employment. In many cases they are getting preference over Australian-born. I contest the statement of the Prime Minister that the policy of the Government is preference to soldiers. Theiir policy, as carried out by mostof the commercial houses of Australia with which the Prime Minister The perand his colleagues are associated, is that of preference to imanigrants wherever possible, very often evom to the extent of sacking meu to make room for them. having enumerated all these The unemployed problem in this country is seriou'si, and is being added to, because the Government are continuing the policy of dumping immigrants from other parts of the world, while they are, at the same time, parting with (industries that would absorb them. For instance', they have closed the Harness Factory, which, since it was established in 1911 with eighty men, has been doing excellent work, and is still capable",41,Mathews Tha T Is The Death Of Australia.

Its only crime is not that it is not being carried on successfully or doing splendid work, but that it is entering into competition with private enterprise as carried on by people who are supplying the party funds fortius Government. to go. The Woollen Mills are being disposed of for the same reason. the leaders of the party opposite, in discussing the question of the disposal of the Woollen Mills, said that he would also sell the railways of Australia under the same conditions. What are we to get from the Government? They are silent in regard to most important questions discussed last session for months, scandals so smellful that the Government responsible for them were discredited in the country and defeated. We have not heard a word about the wireless scandal, that impudent attempt on the part of a monopoly to get control of public money. Not a word has been said about the War Service Homes1 scandals Not one word has been said about many matters first of all exposed in this House and later on condemned by the people of Australia. The things that led to the defeat of the National Government were virtuously condemned by members of the Country party', but the members of that party are now silent-no w that they are sharing the loaves and fishes with the Ministers responsible. I would like to ask the head of this Composite Governmenb and hiis copartners if there is any agreement as to the Government's policy, because if there is-and there ought to be, otherwise on what basis did the Government come people ought to have it . There is only one thing that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) boasted about when he met his own organization. He did not go to them and say, "" Gentlemen, the Country party has won upon the fundamental principles of its policy."" He did not point to anything which he during the secret negotiations which he held with the head of the Nationalist party; his only boast was in regard to the important portfolios which he had secured for his colleagues. The managers managed so well that they got a job each! I notice that the most [4] disgruntled men in the party, those who were the sorest, have displaced some of the old men on some of the Committees. By degrees other little things may come along which can be given to other dissatisfied members. These gentlemen posed here as the Simon Pures of politics, yet . the only boast.which they could make was Consequently it has that they had secured this and that portf o l i o ; not that they had secured this meaOne of sure of reform, this legislation, this alteration of the regulations in the interests of the men who put them therethe men' who sowed the seed, and ploughed thc furrow on the land; not a word about the alleviation of the conditions of those farmers; nothing .but that the managers secured important portfolios. I think that it is one of the most disgraceful things that has ever happened in the public l if e of Australia. If we cannot be content with their policy -o r the Jack of policy-w e are given to understand that we must be content with the personnel of this Government. I am _ not. going to enter on a personal description of each qf them, but I w ill show the opinion of some of the Leaders upon men who now are their colleagues. The honourable member for Bourke to-day made a quotation which was contradicted by the Prime Minister. The Melbourne Argus, on 3rd November, -reported the present Prime Minister to have said t h a t tlie Country party was run by paralyzing leaders, men incapable of leading; men who, if they obtained power, would lead the country to disaster. I ask the other half of this Prime Ministership, the Treasurer, seeing -that he has had so many secret negotiations with the Prime Minister during the last few monthstogether?-the does he think that the Prime Minister meant what he said when he described the Leader of the Country party as ""a paralyzing Leader"" ? D i d he mean it when he described h i m as "" a man incapable of leading "" ? D i d he mean it when he said that if the Country party obtained power they would -lead the country to disaster? had gained for the farmers He surely meant it , because such a paragon of all bhe virtues would not tell a l i e ; he would not attempt to fool or bluff the electors. He must have believed it . To attempt to fool or to bluff the people of this country is not done, or, as the Prime Minister would say, it is not proper.

The obvious intention* to force a long recess, ""without informing the people of their intention, is striking a blow at democratic attacked each other, and as the political . goveniment, and is raising in its place an fight developed it became more fierce. , ^oligarchy. I was pleased to bear the admission of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) that he and his party would have been prepared to link up with all the conflicting elements on that side of the House if only for the purpose of keeping the Labour party out of oflice. They would have been willing to take such a step because of the awful policy for which we stand ! The honourable gentleman trotted out the old gag about our movement not being the same as of yore. He said that he had held some respeot for the Labour movement of years gone by. It is a. fact that our party is not just what it was years ago. We progress with the times. We do not believe in the policy of laiss'ez /aire. We are not content with the objectives and achievements of years and centuries ago. We change our scope and outlook with respect to tlie industrial ;and social conditions of our country; but, fundamentally, there is no difference. It .is the "" socialization of industry "" to-day; it was "" the breaking of *he marriage t i e "" a few years ago. The interests which the Prime Minister and the gentlemen who support him on the Government side, of the House represent have dressed up the socialistic bogy, but the interests .who will be opposed to us in ten or fifteen years' time will say, "" We respected the Labour party of 1923."" To-day they pick out the characters that have loomed large in the political history of this country and laud them as statesmen, although in their day those gentlemen were denounced as "" radicals "" and "" extremists."" We had the spectacle to-day of the Prime Minister attempting to put up an 1 argument based on that comparison. I would point out to him, and to those who support him, that he may put that dope over the electors, and may get it accepted by the unthinking people outside Parliament, but he cannot induce members of this House to swallow it . The principles of the Labour party, with its humanitarian outlook, have remained fundamentally the same. Against us_ at the election were a number of parties. There were a few Independents, and men calling themselves by this name and that, who contested the constituencies on different platforms. Theypersonally Now the fight is over; and the Prime Minister comes to us and says, "" We are united on fundamental principles."" He tellg us that he has not formulated his policy, and, in fact, does not possess a policy. What has become of the policy he put before the electors? Is he going to carry out the rival policies of the different sections of his following ? How has he dove-tailed them into one another? Was the agreement on which they came together simply a compact for portfolios, and nothing else? In the Prime Ministter'Ss speech we had a lot of talk about problems. In fact, I thought that I was back at school again listening to my schoolmaster on Euclid. One does not need to come into this House to learn 1$hat there are problems to be solved. What we are concerned to know is what' the Government intend to do to solve them. If the Prime Minister will go outside, he can be informed of many problems. The unemployed man, with a wife and hungry children around him; the stranded immigrant, brought out to Australia by . misrepresentation; the low-paid worker, existing on the basic wage, or less, and trying also to find suflicient funds to combat the greedy onslaught of the. capitalistic classes, who are endeavouring to make inroads upon his wages; the old men and women, who are receiving miserable pensions of 15s. a week, can all tell the Prime Minister of problems that have to be solved. 'The man who claims to be able to lead the Government of this country ought to be able to give some intelligent statement of how he intends to grapple with these problems. Having mentioned the problems, however, he placed all the difficulties he could in the way of solving them. Instead of breaking down the barriers standing in the way, he devoted his time to showing that the problems could not 'be solved. I have never listened to a more pessimistic speech in this House. He mentioned the problem of dual control. Does he in that connection subscribe to the solution proposed by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) ? Will he",42,Mathews Tha T Is The Death Of Australia. I Shall Merely Refer Hon
39,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [6.19],"make the Commonwealth subservient to the States1 Is this part of the compact 1 The honourable member for Cowper said publicly thab it was. A national feeling, he told us, is developing in favour of a supreme National Parliament which will delegate powers to provinces or new States. At this stage in the national development of this country, what is to become of the principle on which we federated"" One nation, one destinyone Parliament, one people "" ? If part of the compact was to accept the policy of the honourable member for Cowper, this National Parliament must become subservient to the States. If the Prime Minister proposes, in regard to the questions of dual control, taxation, finance, and other matters, to accept the policy enunciated by the honorahle member for Cowper, this country will take a retrograde step. The sooner the country knows of bhat intention, so that it can organize to prevent it from being carried into effect, the better. The Government ought to have the courage to inform us at once, without losing a moment, whether that is part of its policy and part of the compact on which this composite Ministry was established. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. last year many'matters were needing the immediate attention of this Parliament, but owing to the dissolution, the election, and the necessary time which had to elapse before Parliament could be called together matters' of the greatest importance have been held in abeyance for three or four months. Now when we have the opportunity of settling-down to the work of reconstruction, the Government are meeting Parliament merely because they are constitutionally bound to do so, and then intend to .adjourn over another somewhat lengthy recess. I wish to refer briefly to some of the matters which should immediately be dealt with, and which should have been handled earlier had the opportunity presented itself. Industrially, Australia is in a chaotic state, as many of its industries aro threateneed with serious trouble, and it is essential that this Parhas placed them aside, and is proceeding liament should function as intended. The position of the coal industry in Australia is indeed grave. The Industrial Disputes Act, framed with the intention of relieving the situation, needs amending in several important directions. In its present form it is not only-unsatisfactory from the workers' point of view, but it is unsympathetically administered, and the industrial organizations are not likely to receive proper treatment until that Act is radically amended. In the first place it was intended that there would be a chairman to deal with disputes of a grave nature extending beyond the limits of one State, and we were promised that machinery would be provided under which sub-chairmen would be. appointed to deal with matters of a minor character appertaining to particular districts. That has never been done, and in spite of the agitation on the part of miners' organizations, which have frequently asked that the promises should be honoured, nothing has been done. Mr Hoare, the secretary of the Northern Miners Federation, clearly shows that the unions are anxious that this machinery should operate so that disputes which are now. accumulating may be settled, and states that a request has been made to the Prime Minister to appoint additional men to act in the capacity of sub-chairmen on the Coal Tribunal. He goes on to say what I have already mentioned, that the unions were under the impression that this would be done. Claims which should have been settled have been accumulating for many months. What is known as the "" deficiency claim,"" which exists in the South Coast mining district, has been unsettled'for many months merely because deputy chairmen have ' not been appointed. Notwithstanding the pro-' mises given to these men by the chairman of the Tribunal that this matter would be dealt with first, the mine-owners contend that the Tribunal cannot deal with it because it relates to only one district, and the claim has been disallowed. In the meantime the mine-owners have filed a claim for a decrease in wages, andnotwithstanding the clear undertaking given that the question of "" deficiency claims "" would first be considered, the Tribunal to inquire into the mine-owners' claims, . which constitute a direct attack on the miners' wages. The whole force of this",46,Mathews Tha T Is The Death Of Australia. I Shall Merely Refer Hon
40,Mr Lazzaeinl,"A t the close ofindustrial legislation is being employed -to attack the miners and their Federation, and to seriously interfere with the economic position of its members. It is -useless to suggest that sufficient respect is Conference, and we should be here to deal not being shown to our arbitration laws when a Tribunal of this character, created to give at least justice to all, is functioning only in the interests of the mine-owners. The situation is becoming serious, and unless immediate action is taken the Government will be faced with grave industrial trouble, and will be called upon to explain to the people why Parliament is going into recess and the representatives of the electors are having their mouths gagged. We have been informed that a conference is to be held between Federal ancl State Ministers, and in at least two of the .States which will send representatives a strong feeling exists against arbitration and industrial legislation generally. Wales a Nationalist Government is in office, although the Nationalist party in tlie Federal arena was defeated at the election. In that State a deliberate attempt has been made to make inroads into industrial laws. In South Australia the same positiion exists, as the Government of that State are particularly hostile to this kind of legislation. this a deliberate conspiracy to aggravate the position and create industrial strife in Australia? are flouted it will simply be because they have been unsympathetically administered, and because the whole of the machinery is being used to the detriment of the working classes. deliberate attempt to destroy industrial We have in this country men who are out to break up our big industrial organizations. task, ancl a lot of things will happen before they succeed. Impossible although the task really is, there are men who are attempting it. This Parliament, I contend, should be sitting when the Conference takes place in order that the voices of honorablo momlbers on this side of the House may be raised, and the forms of .the House, if necessary, used to test the opinion of honourable members on such happenings should they come about, as would, appear to be likely in the very near Mr Lazzarini. future. The Government should take the Parliament into its confidence. Wev should know something as to the programme that is to be submitted to the immediately with any situation arising out of it. Surely some honourable members opposite who, during the whole of last Parliament, and on the hustings in December last, declared loudly and persistently that responsible government miust be restored, and that this Chamber should be the real factor in the government of the country, will agree with the views to which I have just given utterance. They told us, during the recent election campaign, that responsible government must be restored, and the rights and privileges of honourable members preserved. That cry on their part has now ceased. We are back again to the old system Tlie policy of the Government In New South is to shut up the Parliament as soon as possible, and deal with the'affairs, of this country by Executive act. In effect, they say, "" If we cannot 'gag' Parliament in one way, we will ' gag' it in another, and that is by adjourning it for several months."" That is their policy. There are other questions of grave im* portance which make it imperative that Is the Parliament should remain in session. There is, for instance, the position in the Near East, which is fraught with grave If the industrial laws danger to Australia, in common with other nations. In yesterday's 'newspapers there appeared a cablegram in which the hope was expressed that the whole situation would be peacefully A settled. I would remind honourable is being made members, however-, of a statement made organizations. by Lord Curzon, the representative of the British Government at the' Conference convened to endeavour to bring about a They are taking on a difficult peaceful settlement of the trouble. When the negotiations with the Turks broke down a. few weeks ago, Lord Curzon, turning to the Turkish representative, said, "" You are sacrificing the chance of peace for matters not worth the life of a single man, or the firing of a single shot."" If that is so, why does the situation remainunsettled? 'Did that statement on the part of the British representative mean, that oil was of no value to the Turks, but of great value to the people of other nations? It was in connection with the situation in the Near East that the cxPrime Minister( Mr Hughes) cabled to the British Government that if war occurred, Australia, with all its resources, would be behind Britain. If the position to-day is that the issues involved are. not worth the life of a single man or the firing of a shot, it must have been the position .at that time, and if , after we adjourn, the bartering that is going on over these trivial things ends by the Turks demanding what they are asking for, and going to war, it will remain for' one or two men, perhaps for one man, in the Cabinet to decide whether this country should participate in the conflict. The Parliament likewise sliould learn very quickly what the Government intends to do with regard to immigration. I asked the Prime Minister yesterday whether he was aware that a man described by the police as a dangerous criminala notorious housebreaker-wa s discharged by the magistrate before whom he was 'brought on the strict understanding tliat he would leave England for Australia, taking advantage of our immigration arrangements. A cablegrain to that effect appeared in an influential Sydney journal, whicli is constantly hammering for immigration, autl tbe statement, true or false, calls for consideration and immediate action. The Prime Minister, however, told me that, he know nothing about it. He may not read the daily newspapers-ther e is no law requiring the Prime Minister to road the daily press-bu t when either in the daily press or by other means such matters are brought under our notice, the Prime Minister ought to know of them, and should be prepared to take immediate action. statements made by honourable members on this side of the House as to the way in which immigrants are being treated. I have here a quotation from the Sydney Evening News, of 27th December last, which reads as followsLondon, Tuesday. Five ex-service men who emigrated to Australia were charged at Hull with stowing away among the vegetables on board the steamer Opawa.

Neither the Commonwealth nor the State immigration authorities, however, have worried about the inatter. I want to deal further with the policy to which the late Government was committed, and which, I presume, the present Government will continue, since it is really the same, under Which large sums of public money are to be expended in bringing immigrants to Australia, as they allege, to settle on the laud.

I do not object to the development of the rural industries of the Commonwealth, but the party on this side contend that our first business is to satisfy every land-hungry person already in Australia, whether Australian-born or not, who is prepared to go on the land and may be expected to make a success of land settlement because of his knowledge of Australian conditions. We claim that money available for land settlement should first be used to assist Australians prepared to go on the land.

H . Cohen, of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. On the subject of external trade and trade within the Empire, to which the Prime Minister referred this afternoon, I quote the following from MrJ . J . Weekes, of Messrs. J . . J . Weekes Limited, who was interviewed on his return to Sydney recently, and who said, referring to Australia HouseThe chief value of our famous Australia House seems to be in its advertising activities for Victoria. The impression that a stranger receives when visiting Australia House for information relative to Australia is that Victoria is the Commonwealth. Coining down from Charing Cross along the Strand, one catches the name ""Victoria,"" while the road immediately in front of the building, made out of Commonwealth property, is named "" Melbourne Place."" One insignificant window is devoted to New South Wales, and, when I passed it, all that it contained was two dusty bottles of jam, thc labels of which wave covered witli solidified dirt, as ndicativ-j of the industry of New South Wales. I do uot put that forward in any parochial spirit, but i u order to show that the largest exporting State of the CommonI bring wealth, and the State which has tbe largest resources and the greatest amount of capital sunk in its development and industries, is treated by this advertising agency, Australia House, as though it never existed. If our Commissioners in the Near East have not increased tlie value of exports from Australia to the East by £ 1 , and if Australia House is being used in the way my opinion indicates as an advertising agency, it is clear that the Prime Minister this af ternoon, omitted to mention was dealing with those that remain to be solved. This House should continue in session and devote itself to the consideration of these and other matters which have been referred to in this debate. I wish to make a brief reference to the Government itself. We are told that it is a composite Ministry, and that there is, on the other side, a common ground of understanding. We have been told that monwealth will be governed for at least a",49,Mathews Tha T Is The Death Of Australia. I Shall Merely Refer Hon

46,Mr Lazzarini,"The honourable,timo by tlie present Administration, and the House is entitled to know the conditions under which it has been formed. The compact arrived at between the parties opposite should be laid on the table, and we should be informed of the reasons and the consideration, for which men who went to the country with such discordant notes and supporting policies diametrically opposed, have in so short a time after the elections become a happy family, and have combined to gag this House by forcing us into recess for as long a time as possible. Earlyi n the negotiations we were told through the medium of the daily press that certain honourable gentlemen opposite had no desire to enter the Cabinet. were told that all they desired to do was to get r i d of Mr Hughes as Primo Minister, and that, having done that, they would be prepared to ment provided they were given a big say in regard to its policy. I am told, and I think it is common knowledge, that some of the managers of the Country party were very anxious to get office, and so that the opportunity of realizing their ambition might not slip by, they were even sworn in before other members of their party were aware of what was happening. The PrimeM i nister said this afternoon that no attempt had been ma'de to side-track or mislead the people. The public utterances of honourable members opposite, and interviews published in the press, prove conclusively that every Country party candidate gave the electors an assurance that if he were returned he would strenuously oppose a Nationalist Administration . It was upon that condition that many honourable members who now support . the Government were returned to this House. If their actions since the election do not amount to a deliberate flouting of the people's w ill , I have yet to learn what that term means. This statement made in Sydney by the former Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) just before the present Government w'as formed, shows what he thought of what was happening behind the scenesI cannot talk to you about what is generally called politics, but which is not really politics at all. I cannot relate the .story of the intrigues and those sinuous meanderings, which are a superficial sign of tbem, however much I wish to do so. I place on record also the statement by the present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) during the election campaignIf he ( Mr Hughes) is cast out I will go out, too, and we will put up a stiff fight against those who attempt to run the Government. Many statements were made also by the present Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) in condemnation of the Nationalist Government. It is useless to try to make the House or the country believe that the opposition of the Country party waa directed solely against the former Prime Minister. The Leader of that party devoted more attention to the Nationalists We and their administration than he did to the Labour party, because, I suppose, he knew that if he was to be defeated it would be by a Nationalist. I repeat that-the only possible reason for the support a Nationalist Governcombination that haa been effected between the parties opposite was the desire of certain honourable members to gain portfolios. Honourable members opposite went before the people w it h a definite policy. They gave solemn pledges to their constituents. They attacked those parties which wereopposed to them, but immediately the elections were over the enemies came together and agreed upon a mutual sacrifice of the policies on which they had been returned. To-day the Government say they have no' policy, because they have not had' time to formulate one. My answer to that is that the only policy which the Government are .entitled to p u t before this House is that which members opposite advocated on the hustings. If we are to have a continuation of the intrigues which have happened during the last few weeks, constitutional government and parliamentary institutions will be brought into ridicule and contempt. Such actions will assist those influences which are working for the destruction of the constitutional system. If ever the institutions' of responsible government are destroyed the destruction will be due to such actions as those we have witnessed lately, the dominant motive in connection with which seems to be the desire to attain office. The longer the preseut Government remain in power the stronger will become the hostile feeling amongst the people and their contempt for the laws which the Government may enact. If those lawsi chafe or become irksome the people will be justified in evading them wherever possible, for the that has a policya party which, I proreason that the Government had no phesy, will be intrusted with the reins mandate from the people to administer of government when the .next appeal is or legislate for the country. The party made to the people. If this is the best in power is made up of discordant that a composite Cabinet can do, the elements-of men who fought each other people will certainly say that they do not bitterly in the last Parliament and on want another experience of such a Gothe hustings. The Government have no vernment, and Ministries of this nature right to be in office. When elections will go the way of all other frauds. I have resulted in a tangle such as exists am pleased with one paragraph in the in this House, there is only one thing to be done, and that is to adhere to the Governor General's opening Speech. It policies upon which we were elected; readsand if no party is able to govern withmeeting It affords me pleasure, on this the first out a sacrifice _ of its principles, we monwealth, should go back to our masters. parently, honourable members on the other side are dumb. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) said that members of the Labour party had their policy handed to them at the door, and that they had to put it into practice. We do not deny that. We are capable of fashioning our policy prior to coming into this chamber, and we are prepared to fight for it on the floor of the House. It is not paragraph I have just quoted. It conwrong to do that; but what is the matter with honourable members opposite? Are they afraid of their own ignorance? Members of the Labour party are prepared to take the risk of being considered either ignorant or funny. I like to meet my opponents face to face. Honourable members opposite do their fighting through the press; they hire men to do it for them. The Prime Minister has facetiously referred to the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), who characterized his amendment as a placard. The people should know what is being done in Parliament. It is hard to explain why only 47 per cent, of the people take any interest at all in the proceedings. Speech, such as we heard yesterday, is indicative of what we are to expect from a composite Ministry, what may happen at the next election? Oblivion, I should think, for Parliament. The Speech is the greatest insult that has been offered to any Parliament. It was a great insult to the two new members who were asked to make speeches in moving and seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The task set them -would have beaten Mr Hughes. We are challenging this affront to the only party , of the ninth Parliament of the Comto be able to congratulate you upon the sound condition of the trade, commerce, and industries of Australia. How do honourable members opposite like that? my mind when I think of the statements uttered in the Conservative press about the ""go-slow"" policy and the Bolshevik ideals of the Labour party.. Those statements are given the lie direct by the tains an admission that the industries, trade, and commerce of Australia are in a flourshing condition. I well recollect reading in last session's Hansard a speech by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, who told the Country party that they derived their political existence from maligning the land in which they lived. I have never read a more damning indictment of any party than that. It gave the lie direct to those who maligned Australia and its workers. It was shown that this country was more prosperous than ever before; that there was more wheat, more wool, and more manufactured goods of every kind. Yet our opponents say that if the LabourI f an opening party get into power it will mean a Soviet Government and the nationalization of the little farm .and the little icecream cart. If we are to judge Australia and its Government by what happened here yesterday we are surely getting back to the days of childhood. Never in our history has a greater farce been witnessed. The Ministry call themselves an Economy Government; yet we saw two horses with postilions trapesing in front of the Governor General's carriage.

This is a Ministry supposed to be equally balanced, but I ask whom they have got fro m South Australia from the Country party. If there is no reply, I shall read an extract, not from the Labour Daily Herald, but from the Adelaide Register. It is a report of a meeting held in March, 1921, of farmers and settlers at Brookman's Buildings, in Grenfell-street, Adelaide, a tony building where the wool sales take place, and where, I believe, there is a sharebrokers' "" den."" The extract is as follows:. Senator Wilson said tlie parting of the ways had been reached. He went on to speak about the difficulties of thc position of the council, and was greeted with cries of "" Sit down."" Senator Wilson, thumping his hand on the table--' I will not resume my seat until I have made my position clear. 1 will not be put down hy any disloyalists.

(Loud applause.) Senator Wilson -If I Have unwittingly offended you, 1 am sorry, but I have a duty to perform to those whom I represent and to myself, and I tender my resignation as a member of the council and of the association. As will be seen, the Ministry has dropped a man who knows something affairs, and has put-in supporters of tlie Ministry disloyal. ever, I would like the Government to do the best it can for Australia, and I am prepared to give it a "" spin,"" though I protest against the intriguing to get an opponent Further, the man selected from Australia, during last session, when the Electoral Bill, which provided for the grouping of candidates, was before the Ur Yates. Senate, saw that he would be l e f t out in the cold because he had no party with which to be grouped, and he"" proposed an amendment in that connection. How can it be said that the Government are doing the. best in the interests of the country when one of their first acts was performed in secret? Are they afraid of the opinion of the electors concerning the events that led up to the combination of the parties? Surely there was no need for one wing of the present Government, during the negotiations, to leave the train at No r t h Melbourne. That is what they did w i th me when they took me to Darlinghurst. They carried me from Adelaide to Belair, where they put me on the train, and upon arrival in this city I was taken off at No r t h Melbourne. My father was stricken with paralysis while I was in Darlinghurst, and when I asked to be allowed to go and see him they sent a man all the way to South Australia with me. This man followed me to the hospital and watched me whilst I saw my father die. He even followed me through the streets of Adelaide at 2 o'clock in the morning, while* I was making the necessary funeral arrangements, and next day he followed me to my sister's house ana to the funeral of my father. was a Labour man. It was government, according to the ideas of those in power. God knows, I did nothing wrong!

We learned that one of the memhers of the Government boarded the express somewhere out of Sydney in a hurry, dropped off the train at North Melbourne in order to complete the negotiations, and went to the Governor General tc be sworn in. Now the Government aro suggesting that we on this side of the House are blocking the business of the country because we want' to know what the Government are going to do. right. trust and fail in my duty to those I represent did I not challenge the Government in this matter, and demand to know what they intend to do, and when they intend to do it. Generated in the dark, as this Government was, we do not know what is likely to happen between the adjournment and the next meeting of Parliament. There is no justification whatever for the Prime Minister's objection to the attitude taken up by honourable members on this side of the House. If honourable members supporting the Government intend to justify themselves before their constituents they will have to get up after I or some other honourable member has sat down, and say what they think bf this business. The Prime Minister has pleaded that the Government have not had time to formulate their, policy. Some of the Ministers, at all events, have been here since Federation was established, and they should not require three weeks for the framing of a Government policy. The Minister for Customs, for instance ( Mr Austin Chapman), if he were allowed to have his way, would not ask for three weeks to make up his mind as to the policy of removing the Federal Parliament to Canberra. After all the intriguing and manoeuvring to get this composite crowd together, vb is an insult to our intelligence to tell us now that the Government have not had time to formulate their policy. I do not know how His Excellency the Governor General felt yesterday when reading the Policy Speech, but if I had been in his position I should have felt small enough to resemble-a threepenny bit. The honourable member for. Bourke( Mr Anstey), when moving the amendment 'to the Addressin-Eeply, referred to the Prime Minister's speeches throughout Australia as a kind of knock at the door and a saying of "" good-day "" in the different capital cities. The Prime Minister knew whose door to knock at. No public meeting was called in Adelaide when Mr Bruce visited that city to explain how he was going to govern the Commonwealth. I accepted an invitation from the Lord Mayor to meet the Prime Minister, and I was amongst the audience but not on the platform. I heard what he had to say. I suppose it was the usual "" guff "" put out at such gatherings of. "" representaI would be recreant to my tive "" citizens of Adelaide. them when I was unfortunate enough to lose my seat in this Parliament some years ago. A t the declaration of the poll on that occasion, held at about the same time as that fixed for the reception of successful candidate, claiming to know his audience, said he was glad to see present so many trade unionists who had voted for him. When I got up to follow, I said I -was surprised that Mr Blundell should have suggested that there were any trade unionists at the gathering. I knew pretty well all the gentlemen present, and I knew also that the trade unionists were away in the fields, factories, and workshops, making it pos; sible for those gentlemen to attend that mid-day meeting and functions like that arranged by the Lord Mayor to meet the Prime Minister when he visited Adelaide recently. There was the President of the Chamber of Commerce( Mr Clarkson), who was called upon to make a speech. I noticed they had not invited the ""President or Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council. by ticket, I suppose? You do not drink the Lord Mayor's wine and whisky at tickets-of-admissiongatherings. I am not complaining. I only want to make clear the nature of the ""representative"" gatherings that met the Prime Minister in the different capital cities.

Asi n the case of the Governors, every one who goes is asked, "" W ill ye no come back again?"" WhatI want to know is, when any appointment of the kind is proposed who is going to do the job, aud what are we going to get out of it? We have over tliere our High Commissioner and our Agents-General doing She the one job. Yet Sir Henry Barwell goes Home on a f l y i ng visit to see whether the old place is where it used to be and, I might have incidentally, to have a look at the battlefields which he never trod while the fight was on, and in the brief period during which he is in London he is able to discover that the people out here do not know how to pack the f r u it ; that tlie labels are no good; that it is second-grade dried f r u it .

But they did not want was here before it was always a mystery It is too to me what the High Commissioner did to justify his job. I know that he guzzles bo a great extent; he is at every soiree that may take place in London.

One honourable member said of the H i g h Commissioner's The Government are not office that a shrewd business man living in a small villa on the outskirts of London could do the job at about one-tenth the price it costs bo keep SirI f the Prime Joseph Cook there, and that he would do it f a r better for Australia. honourable member said it ; he said that he could hot understand what good the H i g h Commissioner's office was.

65,Mr Yates,"I do not say that thejob; and, .when be has got him, how is hegoing to judge the results ? I saw in the Sydney Bulletin or Smith's Weekly a reference to Mr Little, who leceives £2,000 a year. 'Somebody said that he was wasting his time in Melbourne for months and months. Nobody here cared. He went to China, and he told us the very same tale-that tins have gone over to China with nothing in them ; that there were cases containing a shortage of tins; that the very people who wanted a trade opening did not know how to take advantage of it when it was made available to them. I do not know whether they are rogues or fools; it must be one or the other, because some cases are -marked to contain four dozen tins of jam and they contain only two dozen. Beforo this question of trade relations is passed over in the airy manner in which the Prime Minister would have it passed over, I want to know what does the term "" Empire trade relations "" mean ? What effect is it going to have, and who is going to pay-the ""dummy""? I am, out to represent "" dummy."" I now touch on a subject on which I . feel rather keenly-the tory. The Prime Minister said, regarding the Northern Territory, that there would have to be an alteration of pastoral and mining and communication facilities would have to be improved. When I first came into this HouseI was as keen about the development of the Northern Territory as I am now. I knew nothing of the Territory, having been always a city dweller, but I tried to find out something about it so that I could enlighten the heathens here, and bring under their notice some of the potentialities and possibilities of that great country, which South Australia kept white for so many years. quired at the library in South Australia, but the only work on the Territory that I could get was a dissertation upon territorial conditions by J. L. Parsons, at that time Consul for Japan.. When I got over to Melbourne, I inquired of the librarian here, and he immediately put me on to the report of a Commission, comprising David Lindsay, Mr Combes, and another gentleman, who, in 1908, went through the Territory and took evidence regarding the three routes proMr Yates. posed for the building of the railway. They reported in favour of the direct line. Why this economy Government should have sent the Public Works Committee up there when all that' information was lying at hand in the Library, printed by command of this House, I am at a loss to understand. It was emphasized in evidence beforo that Commission that if the transport facilities were improved, and the freight were reduced by the building of a direct line, nearly every pastoralist up there would be prepared to forgo half, or even three-quarters, of his holding, because with the building of the line through the Territory they would be able to ""carry on with a lesser area. The Prime Minister said that communication facilities would have to be improved, that some railway development would have to take place. Do honourable members think that I , as a South Australian, am going to rest content without knowing something about what tradesman or this railway development means? I would not be doing my duty for the money I receive, I would not be worthy of the confidence that has heen reposed Northern Terriin me by my constituents, if I allowed this House to rise without placing on record my opinion that you have toyed with the Territory for too long. You leases, and that transport have fooled it. You are building Canberraa big mighty city. What are you going to get out of it? Perhaps all the ""guns"" might go there; it would be easier for them to pick the pockets of members of Parliament than of shrewd business people. Every man asks, "" When shall we meet in Canberra?"" When shall we meet in Port Darwin for the development of this land? When shall we have our railway right through? You have had Commissions I ingalore. You have sufficient knowledge if you care to do the job. I am prepared to promulgate a scheme for carrying it out if you so desire, and it will not cost the Commonwealth a penny. I noticed a question on to-day's business-paper, in the name of a Labour member from New South Wales, who wanted to know whether the Government had given consideration to the matter of linking up Sydney with Darwin by way of the Condobolin-Broken"" H ill railway. Where is the ""joke? What is the move? Do the Government intend to repudiate their contract with South Australia? the Canfberra advocates in the Ministry, what oi' the compact with my State? In the construction of the North-South railway, we look for something which will prove immensely valuable to the Commonwealth, something which will pay, something which will be really developmental, something which will help to keep Australia white. But South Australia has to be ""very careful; she needs to be wide awake. I remember a threat to build a line through Camooweal to the Territory. The North-South project represents the biggest national work which the Commonwealth Parliament could authorize to-day. . It would .prove more advantageous to Australia, it would be a far .better and a bigger thing than the building of the East-West line. Before they get into recess, I desire to ascertain for 25s. a week, but it was not until he the bona fides of the Government. If they wish to bring about the comprehensive development of the continent, they will not only adopt the recommendation of the Public Works Committee to continue South Australia's northern railway as far as the Macdonnell Ranges, but will carry the construction right through to Darwin. With respect to the Federal CapitalI «an only say that if the Ministry-including, as they do, such prominent advocates of Canberra-hav e not found time to frame a policy, then God help Australia! ' 1 would like to see Australia more i'uliy populated, hut I hope there will be no attempt to introduce any other nationality until we have exhausted the emigrant resources of the Old Country. About forty-five years ago, I came out here as a "" Pommy,"" and I do not think I have proved a bad sort. I prefer that our new citizens should be immigrants from Great Britain. But do the Government know that the existing immigration policy is being abused? secretary of the Lahour party in South Australia a lot of these newcomers flocked axe fairly treated, it devolves upon the to the labour office. They knew where they could find a friend, and get a little advice, and sometimes necessary succour. I rememlber one little Scotchman, coming to me. I was so impressed with the truth of his story that I was instrumental in having it published in the pres3, and, I ask following the publication of the facts of his case, another Scotchmana shipbuilder-go t him a job. Afterwards, this young fellow went to Iron Knob, where he worked for the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, and proved himself no sluggard. Ho had been brought out from the Old Land, and handed over to that apparently negligible body known in Perth as the Ugly Men's Association. They sent bun up to the Wyndham country. association are very decent citizens. migrants who are committed to their care as they treated this young .Scot, they ought to be prevented from taking a further hand in the settlement of their country. A t Wyndham the newcomer worked had put in a fortnight that he discovered what his wages were. Then he said he would nob stop there for the money; he could have done better in Scotland. He ""got bhe boot,"" and walked down from Wyndham to Perth, working on the way for others, at the same wage. By boat, he came over to South Australia with four others. The four were ""pinched"" at Port Adelaide, but he got ashore by changing clothes with a grimy fireman. And so he got a decent start at last in this new country.

69,Mr Yates,"It will all depend onand regarding which I demand a statement from the Government, if it is worthy of the name of Government. I want"" froni some responsible Minister information regarding the Immigration Department. Is the Government still paying Percy Hunter £2,000 a year ? Doesi t still cost £150,000 to bring out 10,000 immigrants? are facts. effect last year. If they are facts, what' has the Goveniment to say about them? Who has fallen down on the job? Where are these Empire builders when the Empire wants them? What an awful disgrace ib is that the men who saved England for Democracy have now to be dispersed to the four corners of the earth, because the laud they saved cannot keep them 1 Last week, in the House of Commons, the Government promised to place a surtax on excessive profits, and yet England is distributing 1 its men folk all over the British Empire. and there were a glorious lot of patriots somewhere: but let us wait until the history of the war is written, aud we can see rib in cold type, free from the bias that is already dying out. . We shall then know it for what ib waa. Some people appear to be all right on this earth, but the gibbet will be very high for them down below. Noithing angers me more than to think that people should play upon the sentiments, the patriotism, and the good faith of the community in the manner that they do. My language about them is always in the same tone as it is to-night, because that is the way I feel. I am only human, but I would scorn to do what I condemn, ' and I hope I shall never descend to it. A lot of it was practised, however, in the guise of patriotism! during the war. What have we done with the £150,000 ? Hasi t been used to feed the vultures that sit on the fence and wait for these departmental plums? Some of them are about to be distributed now. I believe the Ministry is in hot water because they have not given preference to .returned soldiers. I am anticipating one of the lines mentioned by the Prime Minister when I deal with the question of preference to returned soldiers The Nationalists promised it; we diid not, and. yet it was said that our side was not .sincere. Let me cite my own case. Mr Yates. ' When I came back from the war, I was invited by Captain Blackburn to become a member of the executive of the Returned Soldiers Association. I told him that there were many others who had come back long before me, and as they had more right to the job, I did not want to stand in their way. He replied, I want to know whether these "" You are a member of the Federal ParI read statements to that liament, and you will be invaluable to us on the floor of the House."" I said, "" Very well, If that is what you want 1 me for, and if you will make quite clear to the members of the Association tha reason for my contesting the position, I will do it . "" I got the job. I fulfilled the duties to the best of my ability. The election came round. Mr Blundell opposed me. I ' believe he was two years my junior. Owing to a statement that was promulgated herea lie which I had never been able to nadl down-h e had returned soldiers going round for him. One member who sat on the executive It was a glorious war, with me was a member of Mr Blundell'a committee which worked to defeat me. I was a Labour man, and that was the reason. Let me state another instance of ""preference."" I am prepared to say that if it is possible to lean in favour of the "" digger "" we should do so; but I do not go as far in that direction as some would. There is the case of an old man in the Taxation Department in South Australia. I do not know his name. The incident was told to me on a tram car while I was going home. He is a man of sixty years of age, and had three sons who went to the war. One was killed, and one came home gassed, ""and the week before last he had to leave his job so that a returned soldier could take his place. That is "" preference to soldiers"" run mad. That man could not have gone to the war; all the males in his family went; he lost a son there, and has now lost his job. I come now to the question of finance. The Treasurer cannot handle that question, because he does not understand it. I remember before the State elections in South Australia a statement made by Sir Joseph Cook was reported in the Melbourne newspapers and repeated in the Adelaide papers , Because he had said that I talked repudiation they used that against me at .the election. It was said that we must not talk repudiation,, because finance is : a ""shy bird which we must ritft frighten away."" made some similar reference this afternoon. He told us that we must be careful how we handled the credit of Australia. I think the week after that statement was made about finance ""being a shy b i r d "" the Board of Works in Melbourne floated a £500,000 loan locally, and,"" if I recollect the facts correctly, there was such a mob round the door that the police had. to control it, and some even got through the windows in order to be in early. Last week, or the week before, the South Australian Government floated a £3,000,000 loan at 5 per cent, in three hours, three times over. The subscribers got in with both feet and both hands. false money-wallowin g in the trickery of juggling with credits. develop that theme any .further, because I intend to do so at the right time, on the floor of this House, and to cite authorities which the Government will not dare to dispute. finance and taxation was made a big one during the election. I made a big point of it, too. If we are in any trouble today because of high and excessive taxation it.is because we played ""ducks and drakes"" with the Commonwealth during the war, and did not know how to finance it. it by the throat; and now, in order to get out of the mire and save the vultures from the result of their own conduct, they have formed a Taxpayers Association. I got a letter from the association asking me a few questions regarding my attitude. I suppose all honourable members know what kind of questions the TaxpayersAssociation would ask. Here is a nice one to put to a Labour man: "" If returned to power, are you in favour of the abolition of the maternity bonus?"" As I have two grandsons and a prospective third one, should I be likely to oppose the maternity bonus? The Prime Minister saidFinance is a matter to be considered by the trolling body of the Taxpayers Associatnter-State Conference. A weakness in any 'State is n weakness in our whole national credit. '' Thereshould be one borrowing authority, and a uniform basis for raising loans. .Wo, will issue no loans tax free. NowI come to the Taxpayers Association, and I shall read the names of the personnel of the executive:. The first The Prime Minister name, on the list is that of Mr A. Allnutt, who died suddenly during the week of the elections. He was a director of Messrs. D. and J. Fowler Limited, of Adelaide, one of the four large wholebale grocery firms. The next is Mr C. Bastard, the proprietor of the Adelaide City Baths, at one time a Labour man. There is also Mr A. E. Clarkson, who was president of the Chamber of Commerce, and who spoke at the reception tendered to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) shortly after his arrival in Adelaide. There is also Mr Robert Duncan, of Messrs. Duncan and Fraser, of Franklin-street, Adelaide, the large motor assembling and manufacturing firm, They were wallowing in whose premises, which were insured for £90,000 odd, were recently destroyed by I shall not fire. Another is MrM . A. Goode, of Goode, Durrant, and Company, or Mathew Goode and Co., both of which firms arc in the "" r a g "" trade. There is also Mr W. J. H ill , of Pengelly and Company, the railway carriage, tram car, and The question of furniture manufacturers, of Edwardstown, and Mr S. J. Jacobs, the financier and money lender, who, I suppose, holds more beer stock than any other man in South Australia. He is simply a financier, or money lender. I also notice the name of Mr J. W. McGregor, who controls the Torrensville Woollen Mills, We allowed the financiers to grip and who is reputed to have made a couple of fortunes during the war period from the excessive prices obtained for goods manufactured. The next is Mr T. H . Robin, a managing director of one of the big timber yards. Mr FredM . Simpson is a partner in the firm of Messrs.. A. M . 'Simpson and Sons, who have a monopoly of the tinware manufacturing trade in South Australia. Mr NormanH . Taylor, of J. N . Taylor and Sons, importers, is also included. I have submitted these names to show that not one is a primary producer. The executive of the Taxpayers Association in South Australia consists of men who live on the traffic between the actual producer and the consumer, but they are the contion. The point I ami endeavouring to make is that our financial difficulties of to-day were born of the war. When we wanted man power for the successful carrying on of our military operations abroad, many honourable members opposite and some members of the present Government taunted men for not enlisting. election I was reminded very frequently of what I said in this Housei n 1915, that if I had been Treasurer, instead of takixg 75 per cent, of the profits illicitly gained by the profiteer under the War Profits Tax ActI would have taken 100 per cent, of them. that occasion that I would grab them withboth hands, and I repeat it . l t may be termed confiscation, but I would take it. The Government wanted funds, and iu order to secure the money they had to pay the highest rate ruling, namely, l t was said at the time that the men who went to the Front were doing their "" bit,"" aud that those who stayed at home should invest their money in war loans. Did every one who stayed athome contribute in that way? If they did not, they "" squibbed "" on their job. Those who did contribute are not paying taxation on the interest on"" the loans which are burdening the Commonwealth to-day. which income tax \vas payable, the rate of interest was raised to such an extent that it was equivalent to the remission of income tax. The representatives of the Taxpayers Association are typical of the men who to-day condemn Labour, and who term us Bolsheviks. They are the men who, as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) said, have declared that we ' would bring blue ruin in our train. have to be faced to-day, and I would dispose of our financial obligations as we created them. It will take some time to educate the people to realize that that is the situation confronting us; but when they do, God help the other side. The people will eventually see how they were tricked during the war, and how they were "" egged "" on by the misrulers of the country. Then we shall come into our own, and there will be very short shrift for those who support the present financial policy. Included in the other matters incidentally referred to by the Prime Minister are health, River Murray, Post and Telegraph administration, preference to returned soldiers, Tariff, amendment of the Constitution, and shipbuilding, the disbussion of which I can Mr Yates. leave to other honourable members on this Does the cap fit? In the recent side. I would be neglecting the duty devolving upon me as a representative of the people if I did not voice my strongest condemnation of the Government for going into recess when so much remains to be done, and before their policy has been submitted. Until they do that, I am X said on not prepared to say yea or nay. It would be the height of trickery to assume power as the Government have done, and refer to this "" r a g "" as their authority, which, as the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) termed it, is a mere blank sheet. The Government cannot say that per cent., free of income tax. they have submitted these niatters to Parliament, and then continue to govern for the next five or six months without consulting the representatives of the people, who are sent here to do the job. We have the task 'of unravelling the financial difficulties with which the Government are surrounded, and placing matters on a proper basis, and then we will only be doing the job we have been sent here to conscientiously perform. When loans were floated on I shall, refer briefly t.o the amendment -.of the Constitution. Some honourable members believe that Parliament can inake the necessary amendments,. and I , too, believe that we are capable of framing amendments and submitting them to the people by means of a referendum. I am anxious that the question of unification shall be submitted to the people of Australia, because I believe that when they really understand what it means, Great problems and how it will aid in the development of the Commonwealth, there will be no difficulty in carrying it. Reference has already 'been made to the creation of new States, which was at oue time anathema to certain members of this Chamber. The Labour party nearly succeeded in carrying an amendment of the Constitution, and then the ex-Prime Minister was responsible for a proposal in an emasculated form which, because of certain objections, was not proceeded with. It is now suggested that the amendment of the Constitution should bo referred to a Convention. Why not be honest? Do we not believe in Federation and what was said when it was first put to the people"" One flag, repatriation, one nation, one destiny""? We were told that there would be one Parliament and one Governor General, instead of six State Parliaments and six State Governors. We are to have a super-Parliament^in the shape of a constitutional Convention. When .the Hon. Crawford Vaughan was Premier of South Australia, a' Conference of Premiers was held in South Australia, and every florist's shop had to be emptied iii order to decorate Government House, in which the delegates were welcomed. Pair ladies were there, as they were here yesterday. The representatives of the different States, including "" Billy"" Holman and all the "" top-dogs,"" sat in .conference, and decided to pass uniform legislation. If honourable members will peruse the reports of that Conference, they will find that a decision was reached to pass about, twelve uniform Acts. sense, was it necessary to pass twelve measures when one would be sufficient? Continual reference is made to the overlapping of Departments. A simplification of the present position is long overdue. We have a duplication of work in our Electoral and Taxation Departments, and, in fact, we are fools to tolerate six Parliaments as they exist to-day. The people want Unification. They want one flag, one Parliament, and, if given the opportunity, will work out their destiny in the best possible way. In regard to the amendment of the Constitution and the New State proposals, the Prime Minister should be more outspoken. He should take the House into his confidence, and let us know at , once what the Government propose to do. Isi t reasonable that Parliament should close down for the next three or .four months, and that when mingling with my constituents during all that time. I should have to confess that I do not know what the Government are going to do? The Prime Minister told us that during the adjournment the Government would think matters out, and let us know their programme as soou as the House resumed. With the closing down of Parliament, the honourable gentleman, I suppose, will ""skedaddle"" to Berne, while his '' bride '' will devote her attention to Melis right, then he should admit it . This bourne, and perhaps pay a visit to Adelaide. But that it notwnat the honourable gentleman was sent'here to do. Until we -grasp our job seriously, and realize to the full the work we have been sent here to do, we shall do no good. [6 ] My desire is that Australia -.shall develop and prosper on the linet> along which it developed under the rule of LabourI t was a Labour Administration that made it possible for the Commonwealth so to progress in subsequent years that the Governor General was able to speak, as. he did yesterday at the opening of Parliament, of its wonderful advancement and prosperity. What will happen if we accept without protest the position as it stands to-day? I am astonished that the Prime Minister should object to our setting out here the principles for which we stand, and putting before the public what we, as members of this House, intend to do. I can assure the Ministry that every proposal which they put Why, in the name of common forward, and which, in my judgment, is fair and square, free from party bias, and honestly designed in the best interests of Australia, will receive my assistance and support. I protest, however, when they ask me to "" buy a pig in a bag."" I object to put my name to a blank cheque which they may fill in and spend as they please during the next three months. The supporters of honourable members opposite may be content to allow that sort of thing to go on, but my constituents will not tolerate it , and I for one would not ask them to do so. I object to the adjournment of the House for any lengthy period. We should know more than we have been told by the Prime Minister. Supporters of the Government, however, are dumb. They have been "" gagged,"" but I shall not hesitate to tell the people what the positionactually is. I am an outspoken man. I do not mince my words. I "" call a spade a spade,"" and I shall explain to the people the situation as I see it. My view of it may be wrong. If I have said one word in excess of what is a fair estimate of the attitude of the Government, let the Prime Minister correct me. I am sure that I have not done so. All that I want is knowledge. If the Pririie Minister can show that my summing up of the attitude of the Government is wrong I shall admit my mistake, but if on the other hand it Government will go down to history as a political freak. If it persists in its present attitude it will be regarded as one of the freaks of parliamentary administrations, not only in the manner of its birth, but also in the exercise of its functions, and I believe that it w i ll be brought to an end by means of either a political earthquake or political suicide. support the amendment submitted this afternoon by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) for the reason that this is the first Government in the history of Australia or, so far as I know, of any country, that has sought to take charge without first submitting its policy to the Parliament and the people. parties that now compose the fusion went to the country with well-defined programmes, and after the general election spent several weeks in bringing about the. present composite Ministry. Were they young and inexperienced politicians we might forgive them;, but I know many members of the Country party to be men of practical experience. The Country party, as a matter of fact,"" formulated a programme and said they were proud of it. electors of Australia to return them on their respective programmes as submitted, and, that being so, it should not have taken the Government more than ten days to frame their policy, and it might have been embodied in His' Excellency's Speech at the opening of Parliament. It is somewhat of -a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia that the Government should ask us to agree to an adjournment of from three to four months in order that they may frame their policy. It is not fair to the people that during that long interim the affairs of the country should be administered by Executive act, when there are confronting us big questions that should be dealt with by the ParliamentJtself. I heard with regret the one definite assurance given by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce)' this afternoon that the Govermnent do not intend to renew the existing sugar agreement or any agreement. I invite, the honourable gentleman to mount the ex-Prime Minister's charger, to take a. ride through northern Queensland, at the condition's under which the landholders there have laboured and lived for tlie last ""fifty years. If , having done so, he conies back and tells us that those who are cultivating the cane-fields of Queensland should not be controlled by an agreement, and that this great national industry should be thrown once more into the hands of the Colonial Sugar. Refining Company, I shall say I that he does not possess the degree of in telligence for which I now give him credit. If there is in this Parliament to-day any representative of Queensland who, knowing the conditions of the sugar industry, and knowing hew the cane, producers in that State have been robbedI used' the word "" robbed "" deliberatelyThe two by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, is yet prepared to allow this great national industry to be thrown once more into the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he is hot afit and proper, man to represent the industry. No doubt there are in th® southern Statesthose who contend that we are paying too great a price for our sugar, but if the industry is handed over to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company we shall The two parties appealed to the continue to pay a big price for it . In the short statement that he made on the subject to-day the Prime Minister said that his Government intended to control the sugar industry in a way that he would set out very clearly later on. I gathered from his remarks that it was proposed to impose an import duty on sugar-that , by that means, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would be allowed to take control of the industry and the sugar supplies of this country in order that the people might obtain cheap sugar. But an import duty on blackgrown sugar, no matter what that duty may be, w ill not solve the problem, because to-day every one recognises that the whole of the sugar business of the country as controlled by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Sugar is grown in Java and other places w i th the assistance of black labour employed at 2s. or 3s. a day, and living under conditions that represent practical slavery. It is useless in the circumstances to say that the imposition of an extra duty of l d . or 2d. per lb. on black-grown sugar will solve the whole problem and insure and te look a supply of cheap sugar to the people of Australia. I intimate, right here that novote of mine w ill be given to enable the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to once more obtain control of the sugar industryof this, country.",59,Mathews Tha T Is The Death Of Australia.

I wish briefly to supplement what has been .said by the honourable member for Adelaide .( Mr Yates) regarding the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister stated that a number of pastoralists and gentlemen representing mining industries in the Northern Territory are at present in Melbourne er about to arrive horc, and it is tbe intention of the 'Government to consult with them as to the best ways andmeans of settling the Northern Territory. I have lived in Queensland for a number of years, and have travelled through the centre of Australia. In view of the fact that the Queensland Government .have already a railway running from the port of Townsville duewest to Cloncurry, and that -there is a line constructed from Port Darwin past Pine Creek, and ia view also of the fact that Mr Crompton Wood, the Britisb -cotton expert, has told us that in the cotton industry we have one of the greatest assets of the couutry, J say that 'we -shou'l-d be doing wrong to the peopleof the north -and of Australia if we were to again renew the pastoral leases of the Northern Territory. The lessees iu the first instance socured .their land for something like 2s. 6d, per annum per square mile. a tenure of forty-two years.
