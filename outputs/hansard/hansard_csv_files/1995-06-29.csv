If arguments put forward in a manner that the time comes that there is ever to be an reflects, I think, prejudice of a different sort, elected president, my view is that the people perhaps in the manner of one of the speeches should do the electing. That is the view that we might have heard earlier this day. the rest of Australia seems to have-if the The proposal that has come forward starts polls are any guide. AlthoughI do recall that from a premise which is fundamentally in 1988 we were faced with a referendum to flawed. The opening premise is that a very change the constitution and in the opinion small change-a minimalist change-can be polls, about 80 per cent of people said, 'Yes, made and nothing else will change. The this change is excellent and we must have it,' system will continue to function as it is. That but once we got into the detail of it and what is a flawed proposition. It will be argued that it was really entailing not one single state there can be an election by the parliament: passed the referendums. that is, a collegiate election of a head of state It is important that we look at the detail and and that this person somehow remains above what is really involved. Let us suppose that the political process. Nonsense. Once that the people had their way.

This is not the place for that debate because here, under our Westminster system-altered There are lots of questions that have to be and perhaps corrupted as it is-we still have addressed.

House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder. There are years in which I personally have fought shoulder to shoulder with the environment movement on the Ben Lomond uranium mine. I think that my involvement in the fight over getting on stream the big uranium mine at Ben Lomond was instrumental in stopping it from coming on stream. There were a number of actions by the French mining company which reflected the same sort of attitude that the French are showing now. In fact, the manager at Ben Lomond resigned at the time over the irresponsible attitude of the French mining company at Ben Lomond. I fought alongside the environment movement again in the area of North Queensland which is very similar to the situation of Lake Pedder, the Downey Creek area. I thought that it was very wrong to log what was a virgin rainforest area, and I fought very hard and publicly against my own government to try to stop the logging at Downey Creek. On a number of occasions in the past I have found myself involved on that side. I had a lot to do with a lot of the people in the environmental movement when we instituted the first stand-alone solar energy system on Coconut Island in the Torres Strait. The town there was, in my day, totally looked after by solar energy. I supported that not because I wanted to be particularly clever or imaginative, but just because it happened to be the cheapest way of doing it. The incoming state government spent $8 million more of the taxpayers' money to put in the primitive diesel generators throughout the rest of the Torres Strait, and set this country back some 20 years in that area. But increasingly, now, the environmental movement seems to be taking an extreme position that takes no cognisance of the destruction wrought upon the rest of the community. It takes no cognisance of the pain imposed upon literally millions of people in Australia who cannot find a permanent job. I quote from the book by the honourable member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), not from my own fund of knowledge. He says the teal unemployment figure is 16Y2 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Fraser showed a lot of courage and integrity in taking the position he did in his very outstanding book; and once again, even though he is known as a very strong environmentalist, he has taken a very strong and courageous position here. It is one of considerable integrity. Obviously there are no votes for him in Canberra in making the decision this way, whereas there might have been a few if he had gone in the other direction. The proposal to drain Lake Pedder takes away the one advantage poor little Tasmania has got. When members go through all of the poverty indicators, as I did this week, Queensland",127,Adjournment There Has Been A Story Circulating In My
443,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,,131,Representatives Main Committee
444,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (10.00 A.m.),"I am rising to speak today on the report of theMC 2734 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 leaps out in front on almost every single example; but undoubtedly Tasmania is neck and neck with Queensland in the poverty stakes for Australia; and this would take away from this little island state one of the great advantages that is has. The electricity system is really something that the rest of the world should look at. I spoke to a person who is very high up in the electricity industry in Queensland. I cannot mention his name, because he would probably get sacked if I did. He said to me, 'I'm completely out of line with the electricity decision makers throughout Australia. I believe small is beautiful, not big is beautiful; but I wouldn't expect you to understand that.' I said, 'On the contrary, I went to Tasmania and I was absolutely staggered. As you drive along there is a one-megawatt generator here, a three-megawatt generator there, and a five-megawatt generator there.' In Queensland, anyone who talks about anything under 250-megawatt generators is regarded as a Martian. I am quite sure that that would be the same in Victoria or New South Wales. We went to the aluminium smelter there, and the people there were telling us all about how it operates. I said, 'But what if you have a strike or some disruption to your electricity supply?' The people of Brisbane went for two weeks without a power supply until we had to go in and do what was a very dirty job-one of the ugliest jobs that I have ever had to do-and sack half the industry to get the power turned back on in Brisbane. I said, 'What happens if you have a stoppage?' and they said, 'We do not have those here.' A system comprising hydro-electric generators, the biggest of which is 40 megawatts, is a system that is almost unassailable by anyone. An oppressive government might want to use electricity to raise finance. For example, the Queensland government has done this through a sneaky little trick: it has added two per cent taxation on electricity. It has been the only government in Australia to do that. But that is centralised control. Solar energy has such great appeal to so many people because it is a freedom thing. People can rig up their tents anywhere they like and they do not have to worry very much about anyone else. The cost of the excessiveness of the environmental movement is graphically illustrated by this ridiculous proposal. In North Queensland, at the present moment, there is a good chance that we will never get 1,500 jobs: there is the Rainbow Harbour project; the Palm Cove project; the East Trinity Inlet project; and one other project, which I cannot remember. There are four in Cairns. In my own electorate, south of Cairns, there are 250 jobs at Clump Point, 30 at Mission Park, 70 at Kirrima, 1,100 at Port Hinchinbrook, 40 at Dungeness, and 70 at Secret Harbour. That is a grand total of 3,000 jobs that these people are costing us. I do not know of a single valid environmental issue associated with any single one of those projects. The actions of people in the environmental movement are becoming wildly excessive and the pendulum is swinging wildly against them. In fact, I think they take very great risks when they go into certain areas now in North Queensland because the level of hatred has got quite out of control against them. I went to Herberton where World Heritage has taken away all the forestry jobs. There were 23 people in the pub that night and not a single one of them had a job in Herberton. These people are trying to feed their kids. They have no family life. The jobs have been taken away from them by people who are indulging themselves with excessive behaviour. This is illustrated graphically by· this rather outrageous proposal to drain Lake Pedder. Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2735 In the demonstration at Port Hinchinbrook where 1,000 people paraded down the main street, I was on a backhoe with a fellow whose brother had bought two pieces of machinery to operate at Port Hinchinbrook. He was looking down the gun barrel of bankruptcy. This particular bloke had lost his job. It had been taken away from him because of the cutbacks on main roads by the Queensland government and by the federal government. The week before that he had a job with his brother. These are just average working class, if people like to use that term, Australians. They are the battlers out there who are trying to have a go. The federal government is listening to outrageous people and it is costing this country dearly in every single way-for example, in the current account deficit. This is very relevant to this debate. My electorate is the heartland of the fish and prawn farming industries of Australia. The comparable countries of Taiwan and Japan are looking at $2,000 million and $3,000 million a year of production from their prawn and fish farming industries. When I became northern development minister, there was not a single prawn or fish farm operating in Queensland and, as I understand it, in Australia. I am proud to say that we have leapt ahead. I do not want to claim the credit there. The person responsible for getting the industry going was the appointee of the present government, Dr Joe Baker. He was an outstanding appointment to Landcare and I must praise the current Keating government for appointing him to that position. By the time we were finished, from a standing start, within about seven or eight years, we were bringing in $30 million or $40 million. Right now some $40, $50 or $60 million should be coming in and only about $25 million I think that would be a fair figure-is coming in from prawn and fish farming. The reason for that is that every single attempt to build a pond in North Queensland has been opposed by the green movement and the green movement has been listened to by government decision makers. When I say 'government decision makers', that would be the most ridiculous exaggeration that I have made in this place because any relationship between them and decision making would be purely coincidental. The government has absolutely no ability to make decisions. The present Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, has absolutely no ability to make decisions. AllI can say is, please do not sack Senator Faulkner, because he is the greatest asset we have in Queensland. We can win votes from him all over the state. The fact that the split in the polls in Queensland is 62 to 38 reflects the attitude of the working class to a government that will listen to academics from the universities in Queensland and layabouts on fat government jobs in the cities but will not listen to people living in the areas concerned. I could count the number of green movement people living in my electorate on the fingers of both hands. They do not live in the area, nor do they live in the bush, as I have all my life. People living in my electorate live in these areas because they love the bush. The decision makers come from cities like Townsville, Brisbane, Canberra and Sydney. They do not live in the bush. The fact that the vast population of Queensland lives in areas like my own means that the government has antagonised them beyond belief. the working class have no jobs and they have no jobs for their kids. Harking back to the gentleman I met when I was riding on his backhoe going down the main street during the demonstration, he said, 'You know, it's really heart breaking because our daughter was hoping to get ajob at Port Hinchinbrook and she's had to leave town. She's gone down to Brisbane. We've lost our daughter and our son left last week. So we've lost our son MC 2736 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 as well.' There were tears in his eyes when he said that. His family has broken up thanks to Senator Faulkner, who has left a dirty great, grubby mud hole in the ground. 'Faulkner's mud hole'. A kilometre of coastline was cleared eight years ago and it will stay cleared for another eight years. It has absolutely no vegetation on it whatsoever. It is eroding out into the ocean and doing untold environmental damage, yet Senator Faulkner has decided to keep that situation as is because he has been listening to absolute imbeciles who clearly have no love for their country. Anyone who had any love for their country would demand that that area be rejuvenated. There is no way in the world the Goss government is going to rejuvenate that area, and the federal government is not either. honourable member for Kennedy. He has made a point but I ask him, in his concluding remarks, to refer back to the report before the Main Committee. away from Tasmania the one great advantage that it has. The reason that it got processing of minerals into aluminium is only concealed. Mrs Crosio-The recommendation of the report was not to drain. Mr KA TTER-That is what I am saying. The proposal by the green movement is to take this away. I am trying to illustrate the absolute outrageousness of the proposal in the first place. People from Tasmania may not have a view such as mine, but the fact that something like 95 per cent of the Australian population lives within 30 or 40 miles of water would indicate that people love to live near water. To take water away from an area to make it more beautiful is something that I simply do not understand. To come to the aesthetics, 95 per cent of the Australian people prefer to have water than not to have water there. Most certainly the Tasmanian population says, 'If we can get cheap, clean, power from hydro-electricity schemes, then let's do it.' I am not saying that we should do it in some of the mainland areas, because we need that water badly for irrigation. If there is a choice, the water should go there rather than be used for energy creation, but in Tasmania it gives aluminium as simply congealed electricity. If we have cheap electricity, we have an advantage over the rest of the world. The reason why so much of it is done in Canada and New Zealand is to give those countries cheap hydro-electric power. If we do not have cheap hydro-electric power, if we drain Lake Pedder, we will have no cheap power and this little state-which is doing it so hard and so courageously-would not be given the opportunity to expand the aluminium industry which is being contemplated at the present moment. The destructive force and the destructive nature of the environmental movement to the people of Tasmania is clearly illustrated. The green movement has caused thousands of jobs to be taken away from the forestry industry and now it is contemplating what will effectively close down the aluminium smelters, that is, the removal of the existing hydro-electric operations. These people cannot be construed as loving the Australian environment. They cannot be construed as loving the Australian people. They have no humanity towards their fellow man. They love trees, but not people. (Time expired) report handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment",131,Representatives Main Committee

448,Mr Quick (Franklin) (L0.15 A.m.),"I welcome this opportunity to speak briefly on theThQrsday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2737 Recreation and the Arts Inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder. I was not a member of that committee but as a Tasmanian I thought it was incumbent upon me to give evidence. Having given evidence to the committee and having Lake Pedder in my electorate, I naturally have a great personal interest. I know I should adequately reflect the views of my constituents on this somewhat controversial issue for Tasmania and for the rest of Australia. This issue of draining and restoring Lake Pedder to its original state, like the forestry issue, has polarised views in Tasmania but, unlike forestry, we have seen a clearer and more easily definable polarisation. In my view and in the view of most Tasmanians, this inquiry should never have proceeded in the first place. If the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, had asked the five members of the House of Representatives and the 12 senators who represent Tasmania, I think he would have had almost unanimous support, apart from Senator Devereux and perhaps Senator Coates, for this inquiry not proceeding in the first place. But ministers being ministers they do not usually consult people in the states that they intend to have some impact on. The findings of the committee were those that have been espoused by most people, apart from the dark greens. The dark greens have their own agenda to ensure that they can achieve maximum media coverage for their own electoral gain. It is interesting to note the results of a survey carried out by the 7.30 Report in Tasmania on 26 June, a couple of nights ago. One thousand people across Tasmania were surveyed about whether they thought Lake Pedder should be drained. The overall result for Tasmania was 89 per cent voting no and 6.5 per cent voting yes. Of those surveyed, 95 per cent of Liberals and 90 per cent of Labor voted no. Of the green component only 22 per cent of greens among the 1,000 people said it should be drained. Surprisingly, 66 per cent of those who had green allegiance said to leave it as it is. That the minister bowed to pressure and agreed to this inquiry is, as I say, regrettable. Apart from educating members of the committee and closing this issue, hopefully once and forever, in my mind and in the minds of a vast majority of Tasmanians it has been an absolute waste of taxpayers' money. During the inquiry it has been interesting to note the claims and counterclaims made by the proponents and opponents of this proposal. Perhaps those on the committee and the public at large across Australia can now better understand the difficulties faced by those of us who represent our constituencies in these controversial parts of Australia when we are faced, inevitably in this day and age, with these environmental issues. You can never win, whatever you say, and you are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. It is a case of agreeing with the umpire if the decision goes your way but disagreeing vehemently if the umpire's decision is not what you see as the right and proper decision. Christine Milne, the Tasmanian leader of the Greens, said that the federal committee report was a safe, popular and politic decision but one that was cowardly and contradicted its own findings. When I made my own submission to the inquiry, I said that I was opposed to the damming of the original Lake Pedder. I marched with the many thousands against it. We were, as were many others on their trips to the west coast of Tasmania in those rather turbulent days in the 1970s, forced to remove the 'No dam' stickers from our cars, to save them from being vandalised in the towns on the west coast which were very pro dam. I can bond with the member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), when he delivered the report and made a statement. He said: MC 2738 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 I share the disappointment of those who loved and lost the original lake and believe that the decision to flood it was an appalling mistake. I also mentioned in my submission that, if a proposal to dam the original lake were mooted today, there would be no way that it would proceed. However, we live not in the 1970s but in 1995, and we have the present Lake Pedder to consider, a huge lake covering 242 square kilometres. I call it a lake and not a dam-unlike the member for Dunkley( Mr Chynoweth), who wrongly asserts that we should call it Dam Pedder. I would ask the member for Dunkley to look at some of the names given to other such structures around the world, and see how many of those are called dams rather than lakes. Over the past 20 years, the large Lake Pedder has developed its own ecosystem, the flora and fauna adapting to the new lake's surrounds. It is a beautiful lake, nestling in a World Heritage area. Granted, it is not as scenic as the original one, but it still possesses its own unique beauty. It is visited by tourists and used by recreational fishermen, and is a source of wonderment in that part of my electorate. The lake is also an integral and significant part of the Tasmanian hydro-electric network. If the lake were ever drained, it would have an adverse effect on the capacity of power generation for all Tasmanians. Worthy of note is that part of the report in section 3.72 under the heading of 'What questions need to be answered before commencing any restoration?' It states: The evidence about environmental aspects of the restoration proposal was characterised by enormous diversity of opinion and not a great deal of established fact. At best, discussion about the prospects for a successful restoration was based on predictions which in tum were based on extrapolations from similar studies and the wisdom of experience. The proposed draining was going to be no real comfort to the aquaculture industry in my part of the world, a thriving industry providing a huge number of jobs and a vast amount of export dollars for this country. The apple industry, which also would have been impacted upon if the proposal had gone ahead, is also based in my area, and that industry in the Franklin area contributes to 80 per cent of Australia's export apple industry, and is expanding at an enormous rate. In my submission to the committee, I stated that there are far more pressing environmental problems facing Tasmania, and Lake Pedder is way down on the list of priorities. I agree wholeheartedly with section 5.8 of the report, which states: Some of the other potentially expensive environmental problems that require urgent attention are the deterioration of inland water resources, ecologically unsustainable land clearing, protection of endangered species, eradication of feral animals, restructuring of forest industries and urban air pollution ... The Lake Pedder restoration proposal is therefore an optional project compared to the other pressing environmental concerns. I would like to conclude my brief remarks by reading into Hansard the editorial from the Mercury of 28 June. Under the heading 'No room for compromise', it states: Some of the reactions to the fIndings of the Federal Government inquiry that Lake Pedder should remain as it is again reveals the view that many of the darker greens have of umpires-and of compromise. Simply, it is that umpires are people whom other people are expected to obey; that greens take notice of them only when the decisions go their way. And compromise is what the other side is required to do to make a democracy work, but what greens do only as a temporary measure to allow the regrouping of ""troops"" and energy. It is not diffIcult to believe that had the House of Representatives committee investigating the feasibility of pulling the plug on Lake Pedder decided that this should be done, conservationists now deploring the Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2739 finding would, instead, be urging the State Government to play by the rules and abide by the umpire's decision. Instead, the committee-whose chairman, Mr John Langmore, said the decision to flood the lake had been ""an appalling mistake""-stated that there were more pressing environmental goals to which money should be allocated. As well, it said providing more money for further assessments would be irresponsible. From that, green guru Dr Bob Brown has simultaneously condemned the committee for a spineless decision, but has hailed the report as being a ""milestone in the fight to restore Lake Pedder"". The State Government and the Opposition have welcomed the findings of the committee but have criticised the decision to have an inquiry. Both believe it was a waste of time and money-a view probably shared by a majority of Tasmanians. However, it was not a waste. The motives of those who sought the inquiry and those who agreed to it can be debated and questioned, but the investigation did serve a valuable purpose. At the very least, the inquiry provides substance for the arguments of those -in the future who will most likely be confronted by further demands from conservationists that the lake should be drained. The findings of the inquiry provide a starting point from which a rejection of the demands can be made. When pressure again builds to have Lake Pedder drained-and there is no doubt that Dr Brown and others will keep the issue on the green agenda-those who want this course of action to be followed will have to identify what has changed from 1995 which makes such a measure acceptable. The inquiry said that although draining Lake Pedder was technically feasible-and, after all, most things which have been done by human technology can be undone-there was doubt that the environmental benefits would outweigh the costs. The inquiry said symbolism was the most compelling reason for draining the lake. It is a fact that Lake Pedder is a powerful icon for today's conservationists. But will it have such an impact tomorrow? People who have never seen the original lake, and have grown up with Pedder as it is today, may find it difficult to match the fervour of conservationists from Dr Brown's era. The passage of time may make it difficult to keep the flames of enthusiasm alive. Conservationists cannot convince a majority of Tasmanians today to pull the plug on the lake. The task may be even more difficult in the future. Rather than continue their efforts, surely there are areas of concern more worthy of their attention? previous member and, in particular, the editorial from the newspaper. I agree with the previous member: the editorial sums up the situation very much as it is. Certainly, this Lake Pedder inquiry has been a very interesting one for the members of the committee. I do not think I have ever participated in an inquiry which has had before it such diametrically opposed evidence. I do not know how we could have had one witness after another come forward with evidence which contained such enormous contrasts. Indeed, it was hard, on many occasions, to come to any other conclusion than that some of the witnesses had allowed their emotional attachments to the issue to cloud their judgment. Frankly, it is just not possible, in many instances, to find a common harmonious thread through the evidence that was received. There is room for differing opinions on many issues. Even in costing the worth of electricity, there are various methodologies that can be used. The committee received evidence that the value of the power that would be lost if Lake Pedder were to be drained was as different as $0 and $27.8 million per annum. The future value of electricity from Lake Pedder was put at between $0 and $450 million per annum. Those are enormous disparities. The real figure",134,Representatnes Main Commitiee
449,Mr Truss (Wide Bay) (10.29 A.m.),"I am interested to follow the contribution by theMC 2740 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 may be somewhere in between, but it is not possible to accept that all that evidence is accurate. Should Lake Pedder be drained, the cost of rehabilitation was put at both $0 and in excess of $2 billion dollars. Mr Robert Brown-Two billion? in evidence. When a committee is confronted with those sorts of contrasts, it is difficult to come to a conclusion as to what the reality is. Lake Pedder is in an attractive area of the globe. The old Lake Pedder was a very beautiful area. Some people regarded it as one of the wonders of the world. It is also beyond dispute that the enlarged lake is an attractive area. If you want to dispute which is the more beautiful, that is largely in the eye of the beholder. Certainly, it is the surrounds of the lake which make it a wilderness. The enlarged lake enhances the area of water, but it has covered areas which were considered by many to have great wilderness value. I have to admit that, as somebody who had not been to Lake Pedder before this inquiry, the image that I had of Lake Pedder was very different from the reality. I had seen the beautiful posters. I had an idea that Lake Pedder was surrounded by dense jungle-temperate rainforests and the like. It came as a surprise to me when I went there to find that the area largely comprised button grass plains. The large trees that I had envisaged were nowhere to be seen. There were only a few tangled bushes. In a sense, the media have succeeded in portraying an image of Lake Pedder that is a long way from the reality. Fraser Island in my electorate is similarly portrayed. The public image of Fraser Island is of a sand area with gigantic trees and magnificent lakes. However, only two per cent of Fraser Island is covered in rainforest. The vast majority of it has vegetation of much lesser quality. So there is a public image of Lake Pedder which is a long way from the reality. The posters that are widely distributed these days by the Pedder 2000 supporters display a very beautiful picture, but it is a scene that would have been seen by very few Australians. However, even if the original Lake Pedder were there today, very few visitors to the area would ever see it the way the pictures portray it. To begin with, it rains for something like 300 days of the year, and it would be a rare occasion for visitors to see it with blue skies. On the day of the committee's visit, we were particularly fortunate and we did strike one of those rare fine days. It was a delight to be there. In addition, the exposed beaches were not seen by lots of visitors because, for a very large proportion of the year, the water level is high enough to cover the beaches. There were only a few days of the year when aircraft were able to land on the beach, and so visitors to Tasmania-even those who had travelled around the world to have that wonderful experience of flying into Lake Pedder-had a 90 per cent chance of not experiencing it. Generally speaking, it was only those who were brave enough to hike in by foot for many miles, through very rugged terrain and in unpleasant weather conditions, who saw it. So it was not the idyllic lake that is often portrayed. Indeed, the opportunity to see Lake Pedder has really only come about for most Australians and visitors from around the world because of the hydro-electricity schemes in the region. These schemes led to the construction of good all-weather roads that have enabled people to visit Lake Pedder in much larger numbers than in the past. So there has been a degree of",137,Representatives Main Committee
450,Mr Truss,"Yes, between $0 and $2 billion were the figures placed before the committeeThursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE . MC 2741 imbalance in the way in which Lake Pedder has been portrayed to the people of the world. It was a beautiful area. It is still a beautiful area. It has tourism potential, and that tourism potential is likely to be enhanced as the years go by. Mr Robert Brown-Is the water currently fulfilling any economic purpose? the Tasmanian hydro-electric generation system. It needs to be emphasised that Lake Pedder is responsible for about 65 megawatts of electricity generation-and that general figure is agreed by the committee-of Tasmania's capacity of 1,173 megawatts. It is possible to argue that, at the present time, there is an oversupply in the Tasmanian system of about 60 megawatts so the system would not necessarily fail if Lake Pedder was not there. However, it needs to be remembered that, because the Tasmanian system is so totally dependent on hydro-electricity, Lake Pedder is very much a part of an integrated system. A water storage could not be removed from the system without it potentially having significant impact, particularly in times of dry weather. Lake Pedder is a very important part of the Gordon system, which is a very important part of the whole Tasmanian system. Let us now look at that overcapacity of 60 megawatts, because I think we need to put that into some degree of perspective. It is a very small overcapacity. There is a power station just outside the boundary of my electorate which produces more power than the entire Tasmanian system, and there are several others in the state of Queensland that have a similar capacity. Each unit at the Tarong power station produces 350 megawatts and Tasmania's entire spare capacity is only 60 megawatts. There is not the slightest doubt that Tasmania will grow into that capacity. Even though it may not be needed today, it certainly will be within a decade or so, and that is irrespective of whether any major new industry comes to Tasmania. Just the growth in general domestic use, and the normal industrial type growth that will occur in Tasmania, will see that 60 megawatts needed at some time in the future. The key element in Tasmania's future electricity needs is the Bell Bay plant operated by Comalco. That plant is critical to Tasmania's economy. It is responsible for about 1,600 jobs, 780 being directly employed at the Bell Bay aluminium refinery. Comalco is faced with a very difficult decision at Bell Bay in that it cannot continue the operation in its current form. If it is going to be internationally competitive, it will have to expand the facility. If the facility does not become internationally competitive, it will have to be closed. If Lake Pedder was drained, there is not the slightest doubt that Comalco would not go ahead with the expansion. The committee put the question to Comalco executives in black and white. The answer to the question was that, if Lake Pedder was drained, without any doubt, Comalco would close. In fairness, it has to be said that, even if Lake Pedder is not drained, Comalco could still close. But if a decision was made at any level to drain Lake Pedder, and reduce Tasmania's capacity to supply hydro-electricity, there is no doubt that Bell Bay would close. I think that fact alone was enough for the committee to come down and say that there should be no further advancement of any proposals to drain the lake. One of the critical arguments put forward by Pedder 2000 was that jobs lost through the closure of Bell Bay would be made up for by extra tourism. In fact, Pedder 2000 spoke about 600 new jobs being created in the tourism area. Frankly that figure is just beyond belief. It would mean that there would have to be enormous growth in tourism to Tasmania. I do not believe that a remote lake would generate that number of extra tourists to Tasmania.",138,Representatives Main Committee
451,Mr Truss,"Let us get onto that key question, whether this lake is a critical element inMC 2742 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 What has to be borne in mind is that the Pedder 2000 proposal also involves excluding tourists from any area too close to the lake. A lookout point 15 kilometres away from the lake is being offered. NowI just do not think that hundreds of thousands of tourists are going to come from around the world to look at Lake Pedder from 15 kilometres away. In that sort of context, these claims are barely credible. Indeed, the real basis of the proposal is that this area should be returned to wilderness, that it should have its wilderness values restored. An essential element of that is to exclude visitors-to have as few people there as possible. I think a case could be mounted that tourism numbers would actually decline, rather than grow, if Lake Pedder was to be drained. I have a problem with this whole idea of devoting large parts of our continent to wilderness areas. It really is the ultimate in environmental snobbery to suggest that vast areas should be preserved for all time and people should be excluded from them. I am all for the development of national parks, and even wilderness areas. But their essential value to mankind is greatly enhanced if people are allowed to still enjoy them. If we start having large areas that people are not alloweq to enter, we have to really seriously look at the environmental values that we are setting for our nation. The other very important element that has been raised by other speakers is that even most environmentalists regard the draining of Lake Pedder as a low priority-even if it was technically feasible and even if it was a good idea environmentally. It is beyond doubt in my mind that there would be some cost. I am not prepared to put a figure on where, between the nought and two billion, that cost would be. But I am sure there would have to be some degree of human intervention to restore several hundred square kilometres to an acceptable environmental standard. Surely when you look around at the problems confronting our own nation, Tasmania in particular, or the globe, this will never be a high environmental priority. Surely land degradation is a more significant issue-and the greenhouse effect, and the implications of world population. When I look at problems like the spreading deserts of Africa, the land degradation in our own continent, projects like the Three Gorges Dam in China, which is proceeding without much environmental objection, they all have to have a much higher priority than venturing, in a risky proposal, to drain Lake Pedder. Frankly, I do not believe that will ever change. I believe there will always be higher priorities than draining Lake Pedder. In my view, the idea of draining Lake Pedder is one which has gained acceptance way beyond its merit. Dr Brown in particular has pursued this through the media. He has got a lot of assistance from the ABC, some of whose leading on-air personalities are actively associated with the Pedder 2000 campaign. I think much of the media coverage on this issue has lacked balance, particularly on the mainland. Dr Brown's comments on this report have also been quite extraordinary. To suggest that the committee gave his proposals any comfort at all is really beyond any kind of proper fair reading of the report. I believe that his suggestion that we have given him any sympathy is wrong. While the project is technically feasible, as are many of this type, it lacks environmental priority, it lacks public support, it is potentially expensive, it mayor may not work, and there are enormous environmental and social consequences as a result. I do not believe there is ever likely to be any new evidence which will alter this assessment and this report should be seen as an authoritative document for all time. (Time expired) Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2743 restore Lake Pedder, I think the debate that we have seen in this Main Committee has been quite useful. I have come to the realisation that, having been a member of the House of RepresentativesStanding Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts since 1987, I happen to be the longest continuously serving member of the committee. I have to say that in this, the 37th, parliament, the committee has confronted two inquiries that have been the most challenging it has had to confront, save the conclusion of the irradiation inquiry that was ongoing when I joined the committee. But the two inquiries that we have had before us during this parliament have been the most challenging that I have seen the committee deal with. The first, of course, was the community recreation sport facilities inquiry earlier in this parliament, and the second was this inquiry on Lake Pedder. A number of comments have been made in the media and, indeed, a number of comments have been made throughout the discussion of this report in this debate, indicating that people felt that the inquiry itself was a waste of time. I do not believe that an inquiry such as this can be seen as a waste of time. I regret that the Premier of the state of Tasmania has so strongly come out with that view. This is an inquiry that the committee first got back on 8 December. In just over six months, we have completed an inquiry. There were many questions that we might have gone and looked at in greater detail. There are many ways that we might have sought more resources to have a more detailed inquiry. But on balance, through the consensus view of the whole committee, including the honourable member for Dunkley( Mr Chynoweth) who has a dissenting report, it was felt that it was in the best interests of the issue to conclude the inquiry as expeditiously as possible without undermining the integrity of the findings. I am the 11th person to speak in this debate. Nine of the 14 committee members will have had the opportunity, at the conclusion of my speech, to put on the public record their views. Any fair listener, or reader of the Hansard record, would know that contained within those nine contributions is a wide, diverse range of views. The fact that, besides the honourable member for Dunkley, the committee was able to come to an overwhelming majority view and present it in this report, indicates that there is a great strength not only in this committee but also in the committee system of the House of Representatives. Of course, there are issues that will always be controversial, that are best concluded and decided by split decisions. But this issue was so fundamentally important that it was necessary that people with views on both sides of the argument should attempt to come to the consensus view that is represented by the conclusions of the report. Speaking personally, I first had to be convinced that there was enough merit in the proposal to warrant the inquiry. After discussions, and after listening and viewing presentations by Pedder 2000, I came to the conclusion that this was something that warranted an investigation. But having listened to the evidence, having listened to the submissions that have been made to the members of the committee, I see that-for reasons I will try to outline-the conclusion reached by the committee is the valid conclusion for this moment. I will go through some of the issues and some of the arguments, The first is: is it possible? As a scientist, it was that question that attracted me to this proposal. It is something that the honourable member for Dunkley, in his dissenting report, goes to. The thought that we might be able to tum back and rectify what may have been a wrong decision back in the 1970s should capture people's excitement and should capture people's imagination. The committee clearly concluded that, in a geomorphological sense, the actual original lake could be returned.",139,Representatives Main Committee
452,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (10.44 A.m.),"In speaking to this report, The proposal to drain andMC 2744 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 The bone of contention was the large area that is under water-basically, submerged button grass plains. . We had a lot of discussion about that. We had discussion about how much mud might be covering those plains. I am a member of the committee who believes that the rehabilitation and restoration-we had discussions about the different meanings of those words--of those plains is possible. I agree that it would be a scientific challenge to achieve proper rehabilitation but it is possible. In having come to that conclusion, I have to underline that that possibility would require a great deal of resources. Of course, if it was left, over a longtime nature would in its own way rehabilitate. But if we were to leave it at that, we would not be doing the right thing by the proper institution of this proposal. I am not going to try to put a figure· on the amount of resources that would be required-I know that the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) has, as an economist, been amused by the figures that have been bandied around in the debate about a whole host of issues-but it would be a large cost. Therefore, in looking at this proposal and where it might rate compared with the priorities of other important environmental projects that we need to contend with, it has to rank at the moment as a lower priority. Simply put, in an airport lounge recently I bumped into a prominent Australian who asked me what I was doing. When I informed him that I was involved in this inquiry, he said, 'But surely we would be better off using the money to plant trees.' Even if we just look at it in simple terms in that way, it is easy to see how a number of the committee members came to a similar conclusion as I did: whilst the project may be worthwhile, at the moment there are definitely other priorities. The other fact that we have to face is that this proposal would need the majority support of the community. I say to the Tasmanian members who have entered this debate, some of whom have felt that the inquiry was a waste of time, that one reason it was not a waste of time was that many members of the committee, like me, only realised through this inquiry the type of controversy and the environmental politics in Tasmania that the discussion of this proposal led to. It was not the inquiry that created this controversy; it was the proposal. I hope that the report in some way defuses that controversy and can mean that people that are looking at this fairly will see that there are other proposals that they might put their energy to that need to be immediately addressed. There is some discussion about whether our report closes off the thought of restoring the original Lake Pedder forever. We can have the semantic argument about whether it does or does not. I am not sure whether it will be my children's generation-it may be their children's generation-but at some stage this proposal will be revisited. It will be revisited because people will continue to read the dissenting report of the honourable member for Dunkley and their imagination will be sparked by the sentiments of that report. But it will only happen when a whole host of conditions change. These are conditions that will not be challenges just for the Tasmanian people but will be challenges for the whole of Australia and for the whole of the international community. They will be about how we best use energy, how we best provide employment efficiently against energy uses, and how we best generate energy. One of the interesting parts of this debate that probably did not get the weight that it could have-it perhaps got ignored because we got tied up in the costings of the energy-is the simple truth that there is, on balance, great environmental benefit in using the hydro method of generation of electricity. But that has to be taken in contrast with and comparison to the Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC2745 type of environmental benefit that might be achieved by doing other things with the areas that have been impounded. I know that some of the critics have said that this was the safe and politic conclusion to come to. But, as I have said, without full agreement-not only at a national level but, especially, in the Tasmanian political arena-it would be futile to put this proposal further up the priority list at the moment. I appreciated the comments of the honourable member for Lyons( Mr Adams). He, as a member who was added to the committee, has given recognition to the way in which the committee conducted the inquiry and the fact that-whilst there was the range of views that this debate has illustrated and I have emphasised-we were able to get on with the job and we were able to come up with a report that makes a worthwhile contribution to the debate. The role of the chair, the honourable member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), has also been acknowledged. People know of his great commitment to matters environmental. He also brought with him a large degree of economic expertise, and the economic aspects, as has been illustrated by other contributors to the debate, are very important and controversial. So the fact that he chaired the inquiry that came to the conclusion that this has was very important. We could get into a whole host of debates. I listened with interest to the discussion of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Truss) concerning the effect on tourist numbers if we were to drain or not drain. They were things that there was a certain degree of disagreement about around the table. Of course, if Pedder 2000 had a management plan for the drained lake, it was not necessarily the management plan that we would have envisaged. There would have been-and the report goes to this-a need for a lot of work to be done on an environmental assessment and a management plan that went to not only the way that the lake could physically be drained, but also the rehabilitation efforts. There has been discussion of what we would have done with the large population of platypuses that are in the impoundment. I think that, as with the button grass-there would have had to have been efforts for the rehabilitation of the flora-the fauna would have had to have rehabilitation. Those animals that have flourished in the new, larger lake would have had to have been dealt with, and the rehabilitation of the appropriate fauna that we had in the original lake would have had to have been assisted. I think that this has been a worthwhile inquiry. It is in the best traditions of the committee system of the House of Representatives, and I am sorry that there have been those critics who have just dismissed it as being a waste of time and not a major contribution to what is an important environmental question.

At times I felt that there was a certain reluctance on the part of the committee to come to grips with the amount of detail that was required for the detailed examination of the processes of retaining confidentiality within government departments and government agencies. We began this inquiry on the basis that it is a statutory requirement that Australian citizens provide confidential personal information about their finances, their property or their health to government agencies, in order to gain benefits from those agencies. It is a process of trust. All members of this House would have, on occasions, struck individuals who are most reluctant to provide any personal information. Whilst those individuals want the benefits, they also have a great distrust of the bureaucratic processes of government, of personnel within government, and of the ultimate designs that governments may have on the records that they are required to give in order to gain health, social security or employment benefits, or even to be able to register for some form of entitlement in the future. It will not surprise the House that members of this committee approached the task with a very strong view that we should enforce a process that built trust between the community and Commonwealth departments and agencies. People who have disclosed personal information to a Commonwealth agency for a statutory reason should not be in any doubt that this information will be held in confidence by that agency. We examined the processes within each of the major agencies. It is obvious that the major holders of confidential information are the departments of human services and health, social security and veterans' affairs, the large service providers. Mr Robert Brown-Taxation. of checking to see whether people are eligible to claim an entitlement from the government, and whether they have made a full disclosure of their finances or assets. Over the last few years, with the introduction of the tax file number, there has been a drawing together of records held by organisations such as Taxation, Social Security, Health. This involves a data matching process to ensure that people are being up-front and fair. In some ways, data matching has increased the level of distrust in the community as to whether the Commonwealth will carefully safeguard the information supplied by its citizens. Data matching can create fears and concerns. I remember when the tax file number was first introduced and the then Minister for Health-I think it was former Senator Graham Richardson-gave the flick to the need for much confidential information. He took the view that, if individuals are not cheating the system, there is no need to worry too much about confidentiality and the Commonwealth ought to be entitled to do what it likes with personal records. Ultimately, over a period of months, Senator Richardson had to yield to the views of the Senate. The post of Privacy Commissioner was established and there were battles between Senator Richardson and the Privacy Commissioner as to the degree of confidentiality that should be applied to records held by the Commonwealth. We have looked at all of those things and we have come forward with a fairly good report. In my view as deputy chairman of the committee, it lacks detail and bite in a couple of areas but as a first attempt it is a good one. I suggest that it needs a follow-up in a year or two to see whether agencies have taken note of these recommendations, whether they realise that the",143,Representatives Main Committee
454,Mr Cadman,"Taxation, of course, the largest. Taxation is a critical element in the processThursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2747 parliament is serious about the protection of confidential information and whether they have adopted procedures where there are blatant discrepancies and blatant failures to safeguard confidentiality. Just in passing in regard to this matter, I refer the Committee to an article on the front page of today's Canberra Times, indicating that Australian tax officials are browsing individual files. To me it is a matter of deepest concern that an individual, without supervision or approval from a superior officer, can go and browse the taxation retums of any constituents. That article, entitled 'Flash! And the tax office lights up', by Mike Taylor, is a report of a hearing concerning the ATO, where an officer had extended his browsing rights to gathering information from a private employer for whom he worked for a short period of time. He then returned to the tax office and used the information that he had gained while in private employment to organise audits and raids on his former employer in the private sector. He was pretty severely dealt with by the tax office, but in the process of the hearing it was disclosed that it is considered by the tax office that it is not inappropriate that audit officers browse files and try to pick up information about the behaviour of certain individuals that might lead them on a trail to make fines following an audit. This is a wrong process and I think it discloses an ethos and a practice that the committee felt was there but was never disclosed by the tax office. Part of this process is driven by an incentive payment to the officer if he instigates a successful audit. It is money in his pocket if he screws somebody for every bit of tax that he can get out of him. So we have here a grossly improper process. A person using the authority of the Crown for personal gain on a particular issue can go to any individual and draw up a list ·of misdemeanours, relying on confidential information. The power of the Crown can be held over that individual in the hope of gaining some sort of conviction or, from my knowledge of the community, a willingness to admit that there may have been a breach and then a willingness to settle quickly to stop any further disruption to a business or to a place of work. That is grossly improper and it was never disclosed by the tax office. In the strongest terms I condemn the tax office for neither making disclosures nor saying that it encouraged a tum-back process to allow audit officers to browse filesI quote from the newspaper a statement which I understand was made by a Merit Protection and Review Agency disciplinary appeal committee: ""These officers are empowered to access and search the ATO records of any people who to them looked likely to be avoiding paying tax. ""These activities were subject to limited supervision in that while approval ought to be sought before accessing records, according to the evidence it seems that this was not always the case."" So there is a financial incentive offered to tax officers. They go and browse the files, sometimes without approval, as admitted by the tax office, completely in breach of all the confidentiality rules and regulations laid down the Commonwealth and deserving the highest condemnation. That matches other information that came to us from an ICAC inquiry in New South Wales into the affairs of state government officials. It indicated that there are officials selling confidential information to private organisations-banks, credit agencies and all sorts of groups. Mr Justice Roden, in that inquiry, said that he believed-and it is on our record-that the Commonwealth officials are just as much in breach as he found state officials to be. He believed that an ICAC type inquiry into Commonwealth administration would disclose, in areas MC 2748 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 such as Telecom, social security and health, a commercial value for information held in trust by the Commonwealth. I pursued that line of argument with him and he was strongly of the opinion that the Commonwealth needed to clean up its act. I refer the Committee to appendix E, which is a study of a number of cases of Commonwealth breaches identified by Mr Justice Roden even though it was not his purpose to investigate those breaches. . During the inquiry, Telecom made three submissions and appeared twice because the committee was very unhappy with its attitude. The Telecom representatives said that it was now a commercial organisation and did not have to worry about confidentiality to any great degree. Finally, they admitted that they had put in place a very strong, cogent and cohesive process for confidentiality for all of their employees. Within weeks it was revealed that Telecom was bugging its clients to find out what their views about Telecom were. So here is a group--a Commonwealth group--grossly misleading a Commonwealth parliamentary committee. While that organisation was giving evidence somebody in the same organisation was listening into private conversations; unauthorised. Tony Packard, one of my state members, was chucked out of the New South Wales parliament for listening to private conversations on his own premises, yet we had somebody meant to be providing a service listening in an unauthorised way to conversations. I believe there is need for stringent application of a code of confidence and privacy throughout the Australian Public Service. We have come up with numerous recommendations, including: the head of each department having full responsibility for confidentiality practice; strong guidelines for all Commonwealth agencies on monitoring and reporting to parliament on the privacy processes within each department; disclosures having to be notified, noted and reported, including the date, the type of search and the person to whom the information was disclosed; confidential third party information on computers is critical and the browsing of computers should have very strict procedures placed on it; and the Australian National Audit Office ought to conduct efficiency audits of all of these major user agencies on a regular basis. The Australian National Audit Office has found gross discrepancies in practice in a number of departments, has provided this parliament with at least two reports and is in the process of doing a third report. It can demonstrate time and time again a cavalier attitude on the part of a number of agencies or elements within agencies. The Telecom. example I quoted earlier typifies a cavalier attitude and must be condemned and changed. . In data matching, where information is gained from the Australian Tax Office in the tax file number process, there is a privacy process in place, and I must say that all government departments tend to observe the processes very well. But where there is not a tax file number the process is outside the scope of the Privacy Act, and we had evidence of as many as 100 million data matches out in the community which are known only to departments, unknown by the individuals involved, and they are completely unauthorised and unsupervised. We do not know whether they are destroyed at the end of the period of the data match, no records are kept and there is no process of accountability. This matter must be brought within the ambit of the Privacy Act as we Qelieve that semi-government agencies must also be gathered within a confidentiality code that protects the privacy of Australian individuals. Indeed, the committee goes so far as to recommend that there should be a privacy code of confidentiality across the nation that the private and public sector need to adhere to. This has been an important inquiry and I trust it is one that will be revisited by future parliaments. (Time expired) Thursday, 29 Jllne 1995 MAIN .COMMITTEE MC 2749 Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs after the reference on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth had been given to the committee. As indicated by the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, the 'reference was received from the former Attorney-General, the member for Holt( Mr Duffy), who is now one of the members of the committee. The reference is particularly interesting to me. Anyone who has ever gone into a renovator's dream property and scratched away at the wall and exposed more unforeseen repairs will understand the nature of the problem that we are facing here. This issue is an incredibly complex one with which to grapple, particularly for those of us who are barely literate in terms of information technology. ' In the good old days, we had bits of paper on file, people put their signatures on the bits of paper and the files were stuffed in drawers. In the good old days it was easy to controlperhaps. However, the complexity of information technology today and the way in which 'it hangs together in government departments, across the nation and at an international level means that it is very hard to understand, let alone to keep up with the pace of change. This is particularly so for people who are my age, but I will not speak for my children. This report is the tip of the iceberg, and, although the committee recognises this fact, the committee was very keen to ensure that it produced a report which gave some direction. With this issue, as with many others around information technology and information policy in Australia, we are in the situation of beginning to understand what we have yet to deal with. As a result of other aspects which were identified in the course of preparing this report, I expect that this committee will be given more references of a similar nature in the relatively near future. In addition, other committees, other departments and the community will need to deal with the issues around information policy in Australia. There are a number of points of view and points of concern from which to look at this issue, and there are, perhaps, points of opportunity. Australia is the second most involved country in information technology next to the United States. Our per capita use of information technology, particularly computer technology, is second only to the United States. This situation gives us a number of things to consider, such as how to use the situation to our best advantage by playing with these things and by putting them all together. The situation also provides us with opportunities to make use of our natural advantage. We should take account of the fact that there is progress in Australia which we need to be aware of. Some of the progress relates to privacy and the protection of information. We have an opportunity which is, in many ways, ahead of most other countries, and it is, therefore, important to get it right for government, to get it right for business and to get it right for the country as a whole. The OECD has recognised this requirement in a number of ways. Justice Michael Kirby chaired the OECD committee which looked at developing security guidelines for the protection of information. If Australia wants to be the leading light in the Asia-Pacific region in this area, our progress gives us that opportunity. Given that' Australia can develop the legal, technological and cultural framework to deal with the power of information technology and the ability to protect information, we have a magnificent opportunity to place ourselves at a particular point in the world in the international trade area that will be of benefit to us.",144,Representatives Main Committee
455,Mr Staples (Jagajaga) (11.15 A.m) I Became A Member Of The House Of Representatives,"MC2750 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995"" The bottom line is that if a big company is spread around the world, and its information is circling the globe at increasing volume and increasing speed, it wants to know· that its information is safe from predators of whatever kind. If we have the legal, technological and cultural framework here in Australia, we do not become the weakest link, and the weakest link of information is the biggest risk to any company because information really is dollarsThat is part of the problem we have seen throughout this process. We might not like to think it is nice, but what often happens out there is that there is trade in information. That happens in the private sector, in the commercial world and, unfortunately, I believe it also happens in the world of government-state' and federal. There is money paid for information of names and lists. A lot of charities and a lot of businesses operate on the basis of buying names that they think might be applicable in getting support for their particular needs. Whether it be the problem described in the Canberra Times this morning, as the member for Mitchell( Mr Cadman) pointed out, of people doing it for their own particular advantage or the problem of someone who is going to trade that on for advantage to somebody else, these issues really have to be confronted-and confronted very seriously. And, again, the issue of government is just a tip of the iceberg. The committee has done a pretty good job, considering the limitations it was under, to deal certainly with the beginnings of these issues. As I said, I expect there will be many more to follow. One emphasis that seemed to come through most of the submissions was that it was a cultural matter. It is not just cultural. It has to be more than the sort of passive reaction that says, 'Oh, yes, we will talk about it and try to make people more aware of it.' It has to be a far more aware response than that. As we have recommended in this report, it needs a very direct, active response by senior managers to accept responsibility. It should not be just something done around a cup of tea, like a workshop or a seminar, but active responsibility for protection of information. That responsibility must also be sheeted home at a very high level. In fact, the secretary to the department must be the person ultir,nately very much on the front line in this regard. I think culture is important. The legal framework and people's responsibilities, particularly in relation to the Privacy Act, are important. But it is also important from the point of view of technology. One of the things we face is that technology in this area is changing dramatically and it is therefore very important that the Privacy Act is kept in touch with the changes in technology. We have spoken about data matching. I know from my own experience that in some aspects of government there is great benefit to government and the taxpayer from some forms of data matching. They are quite useful in the way in which programs can be put together to save money, to identify problems, and so forth. Many of the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner quite legitimately relate to the problems around data matching and the problems that technology will allow an interference in the rights of privacy. The Privacy Act needs to be flexible or modified sufficiently quickly to keep up with the technology so that governments and individuals are enhanced by the Privacy Act all the way through. Among the other issues that have been raised is browsing, which in many ways is a cultural problem. Some people might be a bit bored at lunch time and decide to go for a little wander through the files to see what interesting things are there. It all sounds very exciting. But culturally, and in terms of people's rights, it is a pretty nasty thing to do. On the other hand, Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2751 there are issues of hacking and there are people who would do that for purposes of industrial or government espionage, fraud, theft, mischief, or, in many casesviruses which can wipe out vast amounts of information, whether it be commercial or government information. One of the things the committee has recommended, which is very important in terms of sanctions and the Crimes Act, is the way in which all aspects, all points of that interchange of information, become subject to sanction. In the past, that has not necessarily been the case. There is quite a degree of disparity in the way in which issues of information crime are dealt with between various acts of sanction. What we are suggesting is a far more concrete way, a far more deliberate and comprehensive way to deal with this matter. It is something which I am sure will go a long way to producing not only a better culture but also a better legal framework. As I said before, I believe that the terms of reference were quite limited and perhaps in some sense that indicates how unaware we were, even a matter of a couple of years ago, of things that had been changing around us. I would expect that there would be a number of other approaches through other committees about how these things are impacting upon our society, upon the way we conduct government and, indeed, business. The recommendation of a national privacy code, as the member for Mitchell has already indicated, is a very important concept to be grasped. We have found that, as many organisations are privati sed or corporatised, one way or another they move outside the direct ambit of the Privacy Act, and then a lot of information also moves with them. Whether or not it concerns issues that we have discussed, such as Telecom or many others, there is a need for Australian citizens, for the good conduct of business and government, to ensure that that privacy code extends right across the national framework. I said at the outset that in Australia, with the fact that we are intensely information richor have the potential to be information rich-we have an opportunity to position ourselves to set up legal, cultural and technological frameworks to ensure that we have an industry and an attitude which is in advance of those of any other country in the world. We have opportunities here to make ourselves a centre of information and information policy that we can draw on. Once we start drawing on policy and legal frameworks, we start to develop technological and industrial edges as well. This is where the future is; we are all part it. I believe that this report is, again, the beginning of perhaps a renovator's dream of information policy. member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) for allowing me to precede him, because I wanted to make a few remarks and I do have another commitment. I would echo very much the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Cadman) and the honourable member for Jagajaga( Mr Staples) in the presentation of this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The reason I wanted to speak was to highlight two particular problems I see. The first is that, while I endorse everything that is in the committee report, there is a real problem in the conflict between the public's right to know and the privacy of the individual. I do not know, even in these recommendations, whether we have actually given enough emphasis to that",147,Representatives Main Committee

458,Mr Sinclair (New England) (11.28 A.m.),"I just thank my colleague the honourableMC 2752 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 apparent conflict. The line drawn between the absolute necessity, for public purposes, for there to be availability of information and the right of individuals to protect their own information as something sacrosanct is a fine line; and I accept that. But it worries me. It is not that anyone would suggest that,under every public service log or under every area of information, there is necessarily information to which everybody has a right to gain access. I want to talk in a minute about a few abuses of that which worry me. There is certainly a real problem: if you prevent information being disclosed, then it is going to be very difficult for the public servant in many instances to undertake his responsibility. It is also difficult for the public at large, if they are denied access to some of that information, to understand the processes of government; and, for ministers and for government itself, it becomes extraordinarily hard to formulate public policy. We have made a number of recommendations which are all trended towards the development of the privacy code to which the honourable member for Mitchell referred, and towards the prevention of undue disclosure. That is all an absolute necessity, but I am worried that there may be too much emphasis on the protection of the information as distinct from the real requirement to ensure that information is available for the purposes for which it is required. Of course, in stating the reasons that information is to be channelled between departments and the way in which there are to be controls, we have tried to ensure that there are not too many restraints; but it is a side of the privacy debate that needs to be identified. In the presentation of this report, it would be wrong if that were not given some emphasis. Having said that, and having agreed with my colleagues, I feel that there are two other important things to mention. Essentially, the days of the Internet have changed the availability of information and the access to it, in a way that really does promote enormous challenges. One of the examples where that is apparent is in a number of instances in recent revolutions, where it has been possible for information to be exchanged over the Internet about what is happening long before anyone else knows. In closed societies, such as those of China and the former Soviet Union, it has been particularly important, because the information has come out through the Internet before it has come out in any other form of communication, and that ensures that, in closed societies, there is some chance of knowing what goes on. The Internet has enormous implications in all sorts of ways, quite apart from those on which Kerry Packer is currently trying to capitalise. It is important that it be used in a way which does not unduly discourage individuals by making them feel that, whatever they say or do, everything they own and all their personal affairs are suddenly going to be available at large. Of course, that is the reason for our recommendation of a privacy code. One aspect of the availability of information that numbers of us have referred to over time has been the frequency with which, in recent times, individuals-particularly in Nigeria, but in Africa generally-have been writing to individuals to solicit funds or to suggest that there are huge sums of money available in some way for people to be given access to. A number of my own constituents have received such letters in the past fortnight. I have received one myself, in my private capacity. It appals me that out there, regrettably, there are likely to be people gullible enough to respond. I want to use the opportunity of this debate to say that, if anybody receives a letter of that sort-suggesting that there are many millions of available funds which, in some way, are going to be accessible to them and which they can pay into their bank account, perhaps gaining Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2753 access to some commission for so doing-they should firstly take that letter to their nearest federal member. If they do not know who their federal member is, they should write to the federal Attorney-General, enclosing that letter. Under no circumstances should they try to make contact with the person whose name is on that letter . . There are several letters-there is not only one individual involved-and all of them are highly suspect. As I say, they are part of the invasion of privacy which the sale of confidential lists of names in fact represents. Unfortunately, the problem exists commercially as much as it does in the public sector, and these names may well have even come from the Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Commission or electoral rolls. They could have come from anywhere. This isa very good example of behaviour which this particular report attempts to redress; I am concerned that the nature of the lure being offered is such that I have little doubt that people will be tempted to respond. I say to any of them that, if they have any doubts at all, and if they do not know the person writing the letter, they should not respond. They should take the letter to somebody else and get advice before they react to it in any way. I know of at least 20 instances in my own electorate in the last few weeks where such letters have been made available. They are all totally false. The funds to which the letters refer are non-existent, and the economies of the countries from which the letters emanate are in such a state that if they were true, it would be the people of those countries who would be prejudiced if any such transaction did result. Having said that, I commend the report; but I think there does need to be a balance between the public right to know and the essential privacy of the individual. In the report we have attempted to identify that balance. I believe it has been reasonably effectively secured, and for that reason I support the recommendations in the report. of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in supporting the 39 recommendations which the committee has handed down. This report on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth is another indication of how effectively many of the committees of the House of Representatives are working. I had a previous term in this place from 1984 to 1987,and I have noticed a tremendous change in the ensuing years. There is a very real sense of cooperation in those committees. On many occasions we might not agree, but the result is that the reports which are handed down are thought provoking. As they are worked out, wherever possible we are able to come to common principles. The report we are discussing today has had a fairly long and tortuous history. It has been to two parliaments and it has been subjected to two Attorneys-General. Because of the recent trend to refer bills to the committee for consideration, perhaps it has not been possible to give this report the attention that this committee would otherwise have chosen to give to it. During the period over which this reference has been considered, four substantial reports on bills have been prepared in 10 months. I believe that both the government and the opposition have been very pleased with the way that the committee has been able to consider bills and bring forward recommendations, many of which have been considered and have been adopted by the parliament. That is the upside. The downside is that the report we are discussing today has been delayed. It was initially brought before the committee by the former Attorney-General, now a member of the committee, the honourable member for Holt( Mr Duffy). Terms of reference were",149,Representatives Main Committee
459,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.36 A.m.),"I am pleased to join with other members of the HouseMC 2754 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 advertised, and numbers of meetings and public hearings took place. Following the election in 1993 and the appointment of the current Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) to that position, the terms of reference which have resulted in this report were seen as being of continuing significance, to the extent that the Attorney again referred the terms of reference to the committee on 28 May 1993. Further submissions were called for, and 109 submissions and 40 exhibits were received from a wide range of groups in society. This is one of the important aspects of the work of the committee system. We are able to advertise in newspapers, and people who have an interest in what the law should be or how the law should be changed are able to make a contribution. In this case we received contributions from civil liberties groups, consumer organisations, law societies, academics, financial institutions and, most importantly, Commonwealth departments and agencies. It is fairly clear that anyone who had an interest in this particular area of confidential information has brought forward a submission. We have brought forward a unanimous report, but, as the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) said a moment ago, as society in Australia becomes more complex we have a continuing conflict between the right of privacy of the individual and the right of the public to have access to information. Significantly, in the course of its deliberations the committee considered the possibility of the amalgamation of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. There are views one way and the other. Initially I was sympathetic to bringing both of these acts under the same umbrella, but on reflection it was a decision of the committee that the two acts should continue to be separate acts. After all, they deal with different aspects of citizens' rights. The Freedom of Information Act concentrates on the right of the citizen to have access to information in the public arena, and the Privacy Act emphasises our individual rights to privacy. As has been indicated by prior speakers, what we need to do is to create a culture in the public services of Australia and in government agencies and, I believe, in the commercial organisations also, where the privacy of the individual is respected. It takes a while for such a culture to build up. It simply cannot be legislated for and it does not happen overnight. However, from the submissions we received and from the attitudes we were able to perceive from groups contacting us, I think that we are well along the way to an improvement in this culture of privacy. As society develops and becomes more complex and as technology gallops along, there are additional complications. The honourable member for Jagajaga( Mr Staples), in his contribution, drew our attention to a number of those matters. Most importantly, the committee has directed its attention to the need for computer security. As we have more people working at home-I do not know whether they would be called outworkers-on private computers, a lot of the information which would normally be stored in a central area goes home with the person. Clearly, what we need to do is to make sure that that information is subjected to the same rules, regulations and protections as information generally. Also, it is very important to realise that, as the government and all governments accept, the federal bureaucracy does not always have the best and most efficient means of handling matters and, as a result of this, we have more contracting out. The law must therefore be applied to the agencies contracting with government in order to make them responsible for privacy principles in the same way as the government bureaucracy itself. It would be terrible Thursday, ·29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2755 if, in the purs.uit of financial efficiency and efficiency in government generally, we referred matters out to private organisations and, when those referrals were made, the citizen was no longer protected in the same way as a citizen would have been had matters continued to be handled by the government. It is very important that the committee has covered this in its recommendations. Another thing that we really have to look at is that, although there has been a growing appreciation in government of the need to preserve a citizen's privacy, because it has not been a high priority the junior pen-pusher-the junior office boy, or office person, to be politically correct-quite often has been responsible for privacy. The result is that there have been some fairly appalling lapses of privacy. The committee heard very disturbing examples where, in some cases,Commonwealth public servants have even sold information. That is very worrying. One of the recommendations very much necessary to treat privacy with the importance that we want it treated is to ensure that senior managers in government agencies and government bodies are indeed responsible for privacy. When one looks at the many and varied laws throughout Australia, one finds that different items of legislation provide for different levels of privacy in different circumstances. That is why I support very strongly the proposal of the committee that there be the development of a privacy code, so that we can have a consistency of standard. I certainly hope that the government takes this up when there are consultations between the Commonwealth government, on the one hand, and the various state and territory governments on the other. This really is very important. As the honourable member for Jagajaga pointed out, the government in this country needs to help create the legal, cultural and technological framework to make sure that we have the right approach to privacy in Australia. The right honourable member for New England also highlighted another matter which I was going to mention-the Internet. Almost on a daily basis, when we open the newspapers we find how this new technology is galloping along. I am told that there could be up to a billion people on the Internet by the year 2000 and currently in Australia we have 500,000 people who apparently are linked to the Internet. One really must look very seriously at the Internet to see how it is possible to protect the privacy of individuals because the. technology is different. It could be that our report may have been overtaken by technology and that a future committee must look at this again. It is one of those very important items of activity which must be consistently reviewed on a regular basis. The Internet and people surfing the Internet is very much a new phenomenon. One can imagine, if there is a breach of privacy, that it would be possible for that information to be put on the Internet and, by the year 2000, that information would be available to a billion people throughout the world. That is certainly a mind-boggling and very concerning situation. As prior speakers have indicated, this is a report which attracted the unanimous support of both coalition and government members. Some of us would have liked the report to have been a little more extensive in some areas, but it is vital for the government to recognise that this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a unanimous report. It represents the collective wisdom of both sides of parliament. We sat down over a period of three years and sought to bring forward recommendations to the government. We have had many submissions and two sets of public hearings. We sat during two parliaments and the result is, in the dying stages of this parliament, we are fortunate to be able to present this report. . . MC2756 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 I hope the minister looks at it very seriously because the current situation is, in my view, that the privacy of individuals in our society is inadequately protected by the current law. No reasonable person in Australia today will deny that privacy is inadequately protected, but,as the right honourable member for New England has pointed out and as I alluded to earlier; it is absolutely vital to ensure that there is a balance between the right of privacy of an individual on the one hand and the right of the public to have access to important information. I hope that the government will consider this report expeditiously. In the past some reports have taken far too long to be considered. In fact, the lead. time to a response to some of these reports has been so long that the report has been entirely out of date and committees have had to go back to the drawing board yet again. Because the committee has had quite a substantial amount of additional work during the period of its deliberations, already we have had to visit this area on two occasions and we have had two committees. I understand orily three members of the current committee were members of the previous committee and there has been a lot of duplication. It is important that the government takes on board what this committee has recommended, comes back promptly with a response and adopts as many of the recommendations contained in this report as is possible. I urge future Attorneys-General-we hope the next Attorney-General will be a member of the coalition-to continue to refer this subject matter on a regular basis to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is a vital area and we all have a vested interest in making sure that we have principles and laws of fairness and equity in this area on the statute books in Australia. I am very pleased to support the report and I join colleagues on both sides in doing so. I urge the government to give a prompt response and I hope that the response is a positive adoption and acceptance of the recommendations which we, as a committee, have made. House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I wish to bring to the attention of the House serious neglect of questions relating to the protection of confidentiality of information held by the Commonwealth. I refer in particular to the ASIS fiasco, as the entire history of the ASIS fiasco runs contrary to the spirit of the recommendations in this report. I particularly refer to the invasion of the privacy of ASIS officers and of the wife of one of the officers, and serious breaches of privacy and the principles of medical confidentiality. I will, in this context, examine the most publicised case, that of an officer whom I shall describe as 'officer 2'. The illegal and unethical treatment of officer 2 was the catalyst to the AS IS fiasco, as we are all aware. In 1989, friction developed between officer 2 and a Foreign Affairs colleagueMr Douglas Woodhouse, a senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administrative officer-while en poste in New Delhi. False and malicious-indeed, defamatory-rumours concerning the officer and his wife were spread by Mr Woodhouse. Upon his return to Canberra, Mr Woodhouse made an unsigned and highly defamatory statement to AS IS management, on the condition that it would never be shown to the ASIS officer. denied natural justice and procedural fairness to the officer and his wife. Officer2 and his wife were placed in a Kafkaesque situation in which they were not informed of the nature of the",151,Representatives Main Committee

462,Mr Aldred,"The member rightly expresses some concern. This extraordinary caveatThursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2757 allegations against them, nor did they know the identities of the accusers. Thus they could not respond to the allegations. This action violated the safeguards rightly recommended in the report now before us. However, even this travesty of an inquiry, based on hearsay, triggered a second internal investigation in January 1991. The officer attempted to resolve these rumours by approaching the present director-general, Mr Rex Stevenson, without resolution. The second inquiry, which concluded on 28 May 1991, was again based on hearsay and unsigned statements, and was critical of the officer. Once again, all key witnesses refused to sign their combined records of conversation without serious qualifications. Understandably, the officer found its verdict bizarre, and formally lodged a grievance through internal ASIS procedures. On 30 April 1991, the officer began a series of complaints to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich. Consistent with the record of that farcical organisation, nothing was· resolved. The most significant document in the ASIS fiasco is the secret report of the AS IS grievance panel of 12 July 1991. The ASIS grievance· panel was headed by one of the most widely respected and outstanding officers in ASIS, a staff and welfare association representative and an independent member-a former senior diplomat. Its findings were unanimous. The grievance panel found, inter alia, that officer 2 had 'a satisfactory work record and some of his operational work was assessed as above average'. It also found that 'internal AS IS inquiries' had been 'unreasonably protracted and biased against the officer'. The grievance panel found that the ASIS investigation had placed an 'unreasonable strain on the officer's family' and 'that the matter should have been settled much sooner'. Further, it stated that the portrayal of the officer by ASIS inquiries was 'overstated and biased'. The grievance panel also found that the officer's assessments for 1989 and 1990, relevant to the grievance panel's inquiries, were 'missing', that 'it would appear they have been hidden or destroyed', and that they were believed by the panel to be favourable to the officer. In plain English, AS IS internal investigators had deliberately destroyed the officer's relevant records, which would have supported his case. This is a most appalling indictment. The deliberate destruction of Commonwealth documents isa serious offence, and violates the principles and procedures espoused in the In confidence report. . The ASIS panel recommended that the officer's operational record be corrected and that the officer was suitable for further work. Indeed, it pointed out that the Director-General of ASIS valued the work of the officer and wanted to keep the officer on staff. Most pointedly, the grievance panel found that, if the officer proceeded to leave ASIS, 'His separation provisions should be handled in a cooperative and generous way.' Due to Senator Evans's negligence, they were not. The most significant unexamined matter in the AS IS fiasco which is of special relevance to the In confidence report is the malevolent role of Mr Douglas Woodhouse, the senior DFAT officer who was the source of the allegations against officer 2 and his wife, which allegations the Samuels report accurately described as 'little more than unauthenticated gossip'. Mr Woodhouse consistently refused to sign these allegations, even when officially requested by ASIS. Mr Woodhouse also claimed that the officer's wife was 'a security risk'-although she was not on the ASIS staff-and threatened her that 'he would destroy her husband'. In a most serious breach of the Privacy Act and confidentiality, Mr Woodhouse claimed to use as a 'subsource' the doctor of the officer's wife who, according to Mr Woodhouse, MC 2758 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 reported that the wife of the officer was receiving psychiatric treatment and was suicidal. Significantly, a recent DFAT possible parliamentary question brief prepared in May 1995 for Senator Evans suggested that ASIS could legally receive from, and use, medical information from a doctor of an Australian citizen without revealing the source. The PPQ reveals DFAT's and the Attorney-General's Department's contempt for the Privacy Act and principles of medical confidentiality. This conduct highlights a major deficiency in the In confidence report we are now debating in that it merely confines its concerns about medical confidentiality to cancer and epidemiology. However, the issues of the political use of medical information and invasion of privacy are much broader. Senator Evans should be condemned for the use of KGB psychological tactics. I refer to Senator Evans's use of a rumour based pseudo-psychological report prepared by ASIS and used uncritically by Mr Roger Holdich and Mr Rex Stevenson for the so-called confidential briefing of Senator Sue Knowles and other senior Liberal MPs. I emphasise that the use of the so-called psychological report was on Senator Evans's initiative. Senator Evans's actions were explicitly criticised in Justice Samuels's report as 'highly inappropriate'. So much for DFAT and Senator Evans's respect for medical ethics and the Privacy Act. After the ASIS fiasco, Senator Evans can never again be described as a champion of civil liberties or human rights. He would certainly be highly uncomfortable with the general approach of the In confidence report. No investigation of the ASIS fiasco would be complete without the most rigorous scrutiny of the role of Mr Woodhouse and the motives for his grossly improper and illegal conduct. I refer to Mr Woodhouse's allegations which were made on his imposed condition that they were not to be disclosed to the officer or his wife. It should be pointed out that Mr Woodhouse has had no formal training for investigations of any kind. Characteristically, DFAT, in its indomitable style, rewarded Mr Woodhouse by promoting him to be head of the fraud and discipline unit. He is now enjoying his unearned fruits of a valued position in Washington. Yet Senator Evans, at a Senate estimates committee on 31 August 1993, at a time when Woodhouse's role in the AS IS fiasco was well known to him, described him as 'an outstanding officer from my experience'. Evidently, Senator Evans approves of Woodhouse's KGB management style based on character assassination. The question must be asked: why has Mr Woodhouse escaped punishment for his serious criminal offences against DFAT and AS IS officers? The dust over the AS IS fiasco has not settled. The In confidence report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will, by bringing debate on privacy concerns to the fore, make it more difficult to cover up the AS IS fiasco. Threatening to imprison journalists and muzzle the press are no solutions to the security fiasco that Senator Evans has created. The government has nothing to gain by tapping the telephones of journalists, including that of Sydney Morning Herald journalist David Lague or the ASIS officers concerned in the recent controversy. This is a most lamentable invasion of the privacy of individuals in a democracy. The use of medical records, especially contrived or deliberately misinterpreted, as in the ASIS fiasco, and used as a form of character assassination, as in the ASIS case, should have no place in Australia. Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2759 I call on the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) to stop the telephone interceptions of our most noted journalists and related surveillance. We must defend press freedom, even though Senator Evans suddenly finds press freedom a personally repugnant concept. Nor should DSD ever again engage in, or distribute, the product of interception of international telephone calls made by Australian citizens, as it did in the ASIS fiasco,· especially when these citizens were the major complainants to an inquiry to which the government was a party. It is widely recognised that there is an ineluctable tension between the principles of privacy and publicity in a democratic society .. However, this government is incapable of achieving the fine balance necessary to ease that tension. In failing to respond to the challenge in a mature manner, it is at odds with the philosophical approach taken in the In confidence report. I recommend careful study of the In confidence report to the government. They are obviously in need of guidance from this report, which, hopefully, it will provide. I seek leave to table the possible parliamentary question which is referred to in this speech. I commend the In confidence report to the House. Leave granted. Debate (on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon) adjourned. Industry, Science and Technology Committee Report Debated resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mrs Easson: That the House take note of the paper. . . . and the winner is? CouldI .indicate at the outset my appreciation of the work of the member for Lowe( Mrs Easson) and the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid), both of whom carried the brunt of this inquiry, together with the secretarial staff. It is worth noting, when you compare to it some other committee reports, the relative promptness with which this report was written. The inquiry obviously concerned the year 2000 Olympics and the contribution the games can make to Australia's image in the region. More particularly, the inquiry looked at the sports equipment industry, issues such as the marketing of Olympic merchandise, the question of the infrastructure that will develop around the Olympics and, in general, Australia's possible gains from this Olympic win. CouldI at the outset also raise in a bigger sense the question of employment and its relationship with this inquiry. The main reason I am particularly interested in that aspect is the fact that a predominant part of the Olympics site is in my electorate. It is worth noting that the central west region of Sydney, in the last quarter figures, has an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent, two percentage points above the national average. It is also worth keeping in mind that there was a very strong drop in the unemployment rate in the region in the last year, going down by 4Y2 per cent, whereas the national trend only went down by 1.6 per cent. To some degree it is catching up but it is still at a higher level. It is also worth noting that in the particular municipality where the Olympics are sited, Auburn, the unemployment level is significantly higher than in the other two councils areas that constitute that sub-region. There is a particular problem in regard to unemployment in this region. I took opportunity to write to some companies, trying to register with them the need to employ local labour to partly overcome this problem. There have been some embryonic",154,Representatives Main Committee
463,Mr Ferguson (Reid) (Midday),"I wish to speak on the report entitled Olympics 2000Me 2760 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 efforts made by the Auburn Council but it tends to be a council· with minimal staffing and really it has not focused enough on the problem. I have to say also that there have been some gestures by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to try to ensure that its local agencies provide a good part of the work force. It is worth noting in a broader sense Discussion Paper No.3, Creating jobs, by Peter McDonald, where he said on page 30 when referring to this region and the north-west region of Melbourne: Both are old industrial areas which did not fare well in the shake-out that occurred in manufacturing industry in the early 1980s. Both have a large pool of unemployed persons in manufacturing, construction and transport. Taken together, these two areas alone contain almost 130,000 unemployed persons, about one i.n six of Australia's total of unemployed people and an even bigger proportion of those who are unlikely to benefit from current and future economic growth. . He further stated on page 32: There is potential for redevelopment for the Ford site in Homebush ... That is very close to the Olympics site. He continued: The mid-west of Sydney has two additional features which cannot be ignored. The first is the principal site of the Year 2000 Olympic Games is within the region. The second is that the region contains locations which can function as regional centres providing for the possibility of commercial expansion. This applies especially to Parramatta. We have here the reality that there is very high unemployment. We have the presence of the Olympics but we have the possibility of actually doing something about it. In an article in the Australian Quarterly, Winter 1995, in regard to the region and the related question of unemployment in the region, Phillip O'Neill and Robert Fagan said: Jobs in the service sector provided most employment growth in the western suburbs between 1986 and 1991 but often remained inaccessible to retrenched manufacturing workers, especially from NESB groups, and young people although they were often located in the same or adjacent LGAs. Local geography exerts a major influence over people's access to waged work. Commuting costs have a major impact on the incomes of low-wage workers concentrated in lower-cost housing areas on the metropolitan fringes. Public transport is inadequate in western Sydney especially for cross-hauling between suburbs. Continued suburbanisation of economic activity has made this increasingly common in the 1990s. This discriminates severely against young people and women in one-car families. Using public transport can also become a security fear for people having to cope with the changing working hours, especially for part-time positions in manufacturing and retailing establishments. Information sources about employment opportunities both regionally and in the wider labour market are often relatively poor amongst the people most vulnerable to high unemployment rates. Finally, there is considerable anecdotal evidence, at least, of discrimination by prospective employees in the willer Sydney labour market against employing 'westies' given their long journeys to work and social stereotyping. As I have said, this Olympic site is in a region that has significant problems. More particularly, the unemployment problem in that region is related to the high proportion of people from a non-English speaking background. An article by Ian Burnley and James Forrestcoincidentally, in the same journal-about unemployment levels states: For males, there is a focus on the western (Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith), southwestern (Bankstown, Liverpool, Campbelltown) and southern suburbs (Sutherland) ... But there is a greater focus among females in the middle western suburbs: from Parramatta extending to Auburn and Ryde and northwestwards into Hornsby. These are not high unemployment areas for the general population, and emphasise therefore the particular impacts of birth place/gender disadvantage derived from occupational segregation. Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2761 As I said, I was absent, and not able to playa big role in the committee's inquiry but I can see the need to focus on the applicability of a lot of these suggestions to local hire and to working with companies and the CES to ensure that this stereotyping and discrimination against people in that region is overcome. Turning to the broader inquiry, I think it substantially deals with the major problems. It is worth noting what the report it has to say about the Olympics and what it will be providing. On page 5 of the summary it notes that, for the first time in Olympic history, all athletes will be housed in the Olympic Village at Homebush Bay, that the majority of venues will be within 30 minutes of the Olympic Village, that competition in 14 sports will be held at Homebush Bay, that 15,000 media people are expected to converge on Sydney, and that every night of the games 220,000 additional people are expected to be staying in Sydney. That gives us some dimensions of the issues and the possible ramifications. One of the important focuses of the Olympic planning of the previous state government, and it is being followed through by the new state government, is the concern with the environment. This inquiry notes the very good work done in respect of energy conservation and the use of renewable sources, water conservation, waste avoidance and minimisation, protecting human health, and protecting natural and cultural environments in the area. There has been significant remediation of what was once a very contaminated site due to a variety of uses for such things as abattoirs, timber yards, and fairly unsavoury industrial plants, et cetera. There has been very significant regeneration of Homebush Bay and, to a large degree, that was the reason that this site was chosen. It is worth noting the comments of Karla Bell from Greenpeace. I think we are aware that Greenpeace played a very substantial role in making sure that Sydney's bid was environmentally strong and therefore more viable for support. She stated: It is no good just doing a bit of energy conservation because they have been doing that in Europe for 20 years . . . You have to leapfrog technologies, and you have to move into renewable technologies. It is no good doing tertiary treatment on sewage just because we do only primary at Malabar ... What you have to do is waste water recycling et cetera. She is focusing there on the possibilities in the environmental fieldsand that relates again to Australian manufacturing industries. If we can get a bit of visibility, and a bit of success through this village, and through some of the companies that are connected with it, it is certainly good for what is an expanding international industry. In the consideration of the use of solar energy and energy efficient appliances, recycling surplus heating from air conditioning, the use of recyclable packaging and non-toxic materials, and the question of public transport and all those things, these games have provided a very strong focus for trying to maximise the advantages and minimise the unattractive outcomes from the environmental point of view. The inquiry report said: 2.84 In this context, selling the success of the remediation project is critical. Controversy over the environmental credentials of the Sydney Olympics has the potential to damage public confidence in the Games and to adversely affect Australia's reputation on environment issues. Given our rather poor performance at the Berlin conference on updates on global warming, anything we can do to improve our image is worthwhile. Specifically on the solar question, as people are aware, Australia did a lot of work on this aspect, and on page 33 the inquiry notes: MC 2762 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 29 June 1995 2.91 The proponents of solar technology for the Olympic Games site foresee an impediment which the Commonwealth can help to overcome in relation to planning. To make the site a viable and environmentally sound urban development it is claimed that an energy audit is .needed before other detailed planning is undertaken . . . 2.92 According to Dr Mills, an energy audit of the site is needed now to allow energy planning to proceed. To provide a platform for an innovative 'environmental urban development', proper planning should require the addressing of energy requirements up front. The inquiry is essentially saying that we have an industry in which Australia is at the head of the field-or has been traditionally, at least-and that this energy audit is a very serious requirement in relation to the general work that is being done on the environment of the site. Public transport has been briefly mentioned, and one of the issues that is on the agenda with the New South Wales state government is the question of whether there will be an in-out railway line or loop. This is a very important ingredient of the environmental issues of the games. Certainly, a loop in and out of the site would provide a lot quicker system, thus ensuring that the number of people using cars will be minimised. For the difference in the amount of money there is between the up-front costs of a simple one-track loop and the long term costs, there can be no argument whatsoever but that we should go for that system which maximises public transport use and minimises car use within the games. The other suggestions of the inquiry cover a variety of issues that are really out there in the marketplace and are central to the games and their place in Australian industry. The committee has suggested that there be additional funding for an Olympics tourism marketing campaign. I do not think we need to elaborate upon the vital nature of tourism to Australia's gross domestic product. It is such that, this week in parliament, it is leading policy debate in large part in areas such as visa policy and the export market development grant changes. Once again, this committee is saying that tourism is a central requirement of the country and that there should be additional funding for it. With regard to broadcasting, we are quite aware that these Olympics will provide the most up-to-date technologies. Some of those that have been mentioned as having a lot wider applicability for the future are optical fibre, compressed digital video, multimedia, interactive media, digital television, and high-definition TV. The inquiry report says that there should be a strategy for the introduction of new broadcasting technologies to Australia in time for those Olympics. Both sides of politics are certainly aware of that massive requirement for this country. We are also concerned-and this is, once again, a widely held view in Australia industry, and this particular committee has previously dealt with it-about the question of purchasing policy. The inquiry report says that there should be the collection and provision of information on the level of Australian industry involvement. Perhaps the committee could have been a bit more radical and could have pushed on the question of pressurising industry to actually do it. But at least it is a step in the right direction that we are saying that that information should be out there and available for public and industry knowledge. We have sought that an electronic commerce system for the Olympic Games be developed, and that there be an Olympic employment skills study. This study would involve actually finding out what skills are required so that, if any shortage is going to come on line, we do not deal with it in the normal, conventional fashion of this country by trying to bring in 5,000 Italian stonemasons or some such, but we actually get out there in the training sector and try, in advance, to do something about it. Thursday, 29 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2763 Once again, this is an opportunity to promote Australian sporting expertise. As the economies of our region improve and the middle class grows in these countries, there is more demand and more concern for fitness and more access to sporting time, leisure, et cetera. These games provide Australia with an opportunity to market itself in those crucial fields and, of course, in the very closely related area of sporting equipment. The report essentially says that Australian industry should seek to maximise its opportunities, and it certainly covers the issue of the environmental standards that have been a major hallmark of this submission and the resulting successful application. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon) adjourned.
