(2) What action did the Australia Taxation Office do about this and when was it taken. ber’s question: (1) In preparing the response to this question the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) utilised the relevant data of practising members of the legal profession. The population was identified by matching ATO records against records held by the regulators on the legal profession. The following figures are current as at 30 September 2004. Profession 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Barrister 32% 31% 36% 35% 36% Solicitor 28% 28% 30% 29% 28% Statistics prior to 1999 are not included because taxpayer records have been archived and there would be a significant cost to the community to extract the information. (2) The ATO has and is continuing to vigorously pursue the lodgement of all outstanding returns including the use of reminder notices, demands for lodgement, issuing summonses and prosecutions. Further information regarding the ATO’s legal profession project is available in the Commissioner’s 2002-03 and 2003-04 annual reports.

These guidelines took effect on 30 June 2003. The Commissioner is considering recent advice on the extent to which the existing secrecy provisions allow him to supply publicly available information to various professional bodies and industry associations in accordance with Recommendation 2. On 11 June 2003, in response to Treasury’s request of 20 March 2003, the Tax Office offered its views on Joint Taskforce Recommendation 12 and other alternative suggestions and strategies to deter high income professionals from avoiding their taxation obligations. The Tax Office has since undertaken a significant review of the ATO Prosecution Policy. The outcome of that review will be the publication of a revised prosecution policy which, among other matters, will ensure that Tax Office staff may elect under s.8F of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, in appropriate circumstances, to treat offences otherwise than as prescribed taxation offences. This will enable a broader range of sentencing options (including custodial sentences) to be considered by a court if a prosecution results in conviction. (5) The Commissioner, in his capacity as a creditor, has continued to take action to overturn arrangements designed to disadvantage creditors by funding trustees in bankruptcy to challenge such arrangements in the Courts. The Commissioner is also currently considering the recently released Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia Discussion Paper– Strengthening Bankruptcy AntiAvoidance Provisions. This discussion paper examines possible approaches to strengthening the ‘clawback’ provisions.

The population was identified by matching ATO records against records held by the regulators of the legal profession. In the chart below judges and magistrates are shown together as Judiciary, as ATO records do not distinguish between the two.

(2) Will he provide an explanation now; if not, why not. (3) Can he say why the Commissioner of Taxation’s Report for 2002-2003 did not explain why the ATO employed Mr Clarrie Stevens over a period of eight years during which he did not lodge an income tax return? (4) Will he provide an explanation now; if not, why not. ber’s question: (1) and (2) The Commissioner of Taxation’s Annual Report for 2002-2003 focused on current activities designed to address non-compliance with tax laws within the legal profession. The process of identifying those outside the tax system has become more sophisticated with the development of better data matching tools which in the past were not available to the ATO. (3) and (4) The Commissioner of Taxation’s Annual Report for 2002-2003 reported on the broad strategies and results of the ATO’s activities in relation to the legal profession. Generally, the engagement of counsel for the ATO is done through the Australian Government Solicitor, and the ATO would have relied on the AGS’s vetting and selection processes.

(2) The decision whether to publicly release the evaluation report will be periodically reviewed in light of the continuing relevance of the report to policy development and advice.

The request for tender (RFT) was advertised on 13 November 2004 and closed on 10 December 2004. (2) The RFT asks whether the Chairman’s Lounge membership will be provided free of charge. No tenderer will be penalised for not offering this membership. (3) The RFT specifically asks tenderers to provide details of upgrades to other classes of travel if no seats are available.

172,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In addition to the Australian Federation of Pregnancy Support Services, Family Planning Organisations funded under the national family planning program through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements also offer pregnancy counselling, both telephone and face to face; website information sheets; interactive facilities; and links to both national and international websites. The Department, through the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) provides funding to a range of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services for the provision of comprehensive primary health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, inclusive of a focus on child and maternal health. (b) The Australian Government is currently involved in the development of the National Agenda for Early Childhood (for children 0-5 years, including pregnancy) which is currently being finalised with input from state and territory governments. The National Agenda proposes a broad framework for a national approach to prevention and early intervention with the aim to ensure all children get the best possible start in life. The National Agenda will focus on four broad areas: healthy young families; early learning and care; supporting parents and families; and child-friendly communities. The National Agenda encompasses pregnancy and has a focus on detecting problems early so that appropriate intervention/s can be initiated. Maternal and Child Health is a priority action area identified in the national public health nutrition strategy, Eat Well Australia 2000-2010, endorsed by Australian Health Ministers in 2001. This action area focuses on the promotion of breastfeeding and improving nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, infants and children. The Australian Government acknowledges the important role of breastfeeding in infant nutrition and supports activities to both promote and protect breastfeeding. Activities to promote breastfeeding include: funding the Australian Breastfeeding Association ($100,000 in 2004/05) to promote breastfeeding in the community. The Association fulfils an important role in supporting Australian mothers to establish and maintain breastfeeding; and dissemination of the Australian Dietary Guidelines (NHMRC, 2003). The guidelines aim to provide advice about healthy food choices and lifestyle patterns to promote good nutrition and health for all Australians, including pregnant and lactating women. The recommendations acknowledge the nutritional, health, social and economic benefits of breastfeeding. Activities to protect breastfeeding include: implementing Australia’s response to the World Health Organization Code for the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes via the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula (APMAIF). APMAIF is a joint industry-government mechanism for monitoring industry compliance with a self-regulatory agreement that governs the marketing of infant formula in Australia; and administering the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code to protect the quality, safety and labelling aspects of infant formula. The Government’s 2004 Election policy included a commitment to provide further funding of $30 million over four years to Beyondblue, the National Depression Initiative. Beyondblue has a program which focuses on post natal depression. (2) It is the role of the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Human Services to provide practical and financial support to pregnant women and/or new mothers. This includes, for example, the parenting payment, maternity payment and other related family assistance payments. The Department of Health and Aging provides subsidies to the Australian public through the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for medical and pharmaceutical services. Women (Question No. 536) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 9 February 2005: (1) What support does the Minister’s department provide to (a) pregnant women and (b) new mothers. (2) Will the Minister require the department to provide further financial and practical support to pregnant women who would otherwise choose an abortion; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government, through the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), provides a range of payments and services to support pregnant women and new mothers. The Government provides a range of family assistance including Maternity Payment, Maternity Immunisation Allowance, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) PartA and FTB Part B. Additionally, from 1 July 2005, mothers returning to work after the birth of a child will be assisted by the quarantining of FTB PartB payments. This means the income they earn after returning to work will not affect the FTB PartB received earlier in that financial year. FaCS also supports new mothers by providing support for child care. Principally, this assistance is in the form of Child Care Benefit (CCB), a means tested payment made to families to assist with the costs of child care. CCB is available for families using approved child care services or registered carers. In addition to the financial support available through the Child Care Benefit, the Government announced in the election context that a 30 per cent Child Care Tax Rebate would be implemented. The Child Care Tax Rebate will cover 30 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses, that is, regular fees for approved care, less CCB entitlement, for families who receive CCB and meet the CCB work/study/training test. The Child Care Tax Rebate will be payable on costs from 1 July 2004, and will be payable up to a maximum of $4,000 per child per year. The Child Care Tax Rebate is payable in addition to any CCB entitlement. The Australian Government Jobs Education and Training (JET) Child Care supports JET creches, which are flexible and innovative services that enable parents to participate in training and work activities in areas where no other suitable child care services are available, or where it is deemed in the best interests of the child and parent to remain in close proximity. JET creches are run in conjunction with education and training activities for targeted vulnerable groups such as teenage parents. Creches enable parents to attend their courses while their children receive care on-site or nearby. There are a number of creches attached to high schools to support young teenage mothers. In 2004-05, 75 JET creches have been funded across the five states and territories of WA, SA, NT, NSW and QLD. The total funding for JET Child Care creches in 2004-05 is approximately $4 million. The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy provides support through a number of projects which help pregnant women and new mothers. The Strategy focuses on the Government’s concerns",173,Questions In Writing
173,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followabout the health, development and well-being of Australian children with a focus on children from 0-5 years. The Government has committed nearly $490 million to the Strategy over the next four years. The Strategy consists of four main streams: Communities for Children ($142.4 million over four years) targets up to 45 disadvantaged communities providing funding for local early childhood initiatives; Early Childhood – Invest to Grow ($70.5 million over four years) provides funding for national early childhood programs and resources. It will ensure that Australia continues to be one of the world leaders in best practice in the early childhood development arena; Local Answers ($137 million over four years) gives communities the power to develop their own solutions and help them help themselves by supporting locally developed and implemented projects which provide help in such areas as parenting and relationship skills, community strengthening and participation for young parents, volunteering, mentoring and leadership; and Choice and Flexibility in Child Care ($125.3 million over four years) continues the groundbreaking work of the first Strategy in providing Australian parents with flexible and innovative child care solutions. It will fund the continuation of the in-home care program and provide additional places for families without other formal child care options. There will be incentives for long day care providers to set up in areas of high need, and funding will continue to the quality assurance systems for family day care and outside school hours care. From the Prime Minister’s announcement in April 2004 to 1 March 2005, 21 projects were approved for funding which provide support to pregnant women and young mothers under the Local Answers initiative of the Strategy at a total of some $4.3 million. The Department also supports pregnant women and young mothers through programs such as Early Childhood-Invest to Grow and Responding Early Assisting Children (REACh). REACh aims to improve the capacity of parents and other caregivers to respond appropriately to children’s needs for care, stimulation and safety. It encourages early intervention approaches to prevent child abuse, neglect and other poor outcomes for children. Early Childhood-Invest to Grow funds projects that provide targeted early intervention and prevention projects in various areas of Australia. These include: home visiting; parenting education and workshops; family therapy and support for families of children with a disability; education and support for mothers with intellectual disability; and advice for new mothers about available services. Funded projects also include development of resources or tools for use by parents, professionals and the community to support positive early childhood development. These include the $4 million Parenting Information Website, which will shortly commence development. Most recently, the Government announced a grant of $615,000 under the Early Childhood – Invest To Grow program to help expand nationally the Core of Life ‘Pregnancy, Birth, Breastfeeding and Early Parenting’ Program to address the rate of teenage pregnancies. The Family Relationships Services Program (FRSP) provides funding to 100 community organisations to deliver family relationships services through about 350 outlets across Australia. The program’s current aims are to enable children, young people and adults in all their diversity to develop and sustain safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships; and to minimise the emotional, social and economic costs associated with disruption to family relationships. (2) Practical support for women around reproductive choices is the primary responsibility of the States and Territories, with some support also provided by the Australian Government, including that outlined in answer (1). Battle of Long Tan (Question No. 539) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 February 2005: (1) In respect of Australian veterans at the Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War, can the Minister confirm that all Australians who were awarded an individual citation from the then Government of the Republic of Vietnam have been given permission to wear them. (2) Has the Government also authorised the wearing, by Australian veterans, of unit citations and awards provided by the then Government of the Republic of Vietnam; if so, when; if not, why not. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The Government is unable to confirm that all Australian veterans of the Battle of Long Tan who were awarded individual citations and awards by the then Government of the Republic of Vietnam have permission to wear them. Each veteran has to apply to the Australian Government to have individual citations and awards formally approved for wearing. (2) Yes. At the time of the Vietnam War, the Government accepted an offer and approved the wearing of a Cross of Gallantry Unit Citation for the following three units: Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (1970); 8th Battalion the Royal Australian Regiment (1970); and No2 Squadron RAAF (1970).

(1) and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one Electorate or ESA may be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining Electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the Electorate of Ballarat may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the Electorates of Bendigo, McEwen or Lalor. The Eureka ESA is most closely aligned with the Electorate of Ballarat and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to this ESA. There are currently 18 Job Network members and other Job Placement Organisations operating in the Eureka ESA. Their names, office locations and the number of job seekers on their caseloads are shown in Table 1.

Caseload numbers are for the “JN Active Caseload”, that is job seekers currently in assistance with a JN site or very recently referred for assistance. Caseload numbers are at a point in time and change as job seekers are referred to a site or exit assistance at the site. JPOs are not allocated a specific business share, but compete to secure vacancies from employers and to refer eligible job seekers. (3) The numbers of Newstart and Youth Allowance (Other) recipients placed into jobs by Job Network providers and other Job Placement Organisations in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, in (i) Australia and (ii) the Eureka ESA, are shown in Table 2.

Total Job Placements include those that may become long term job outcomes at a later stage. (4) Details of the number of long term unemployed jobseekers commencing in Intensive Assistance in the Eureka ESA in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 are shown in Table 3. The delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. The delivery of the new Intensive Support service under the Active Participation Model (APM) commenced on 1 July 2003. Details of long term unemployed Intensive Support participant numbers in the Eureka ESA in the years 2003 and 2004 are shown in Table 4.

Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. The number of participants refers to all job seekers assisted in Intensive Support in that year. (5) In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs. (6) The Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients. Outcomes estimates for Intensive Assistance for the Eureka ESA are shown in Table 5. Table5 includes (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment following their placements.

Casual employment includes employment on a temporary, seasonal or casual basis, which may be full time or part time. The delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003, and as a result PPM survey data for Intensive Assistance for 2003 and 2004 are not available. The delivery of the new Intensive Support service under the APM commenced on 1 July 2003. PPM survey data for Intensive Support at the ESA level are not yet available.

Employment is not a stated objective of the programme, however, the valuable work experience gained through the programme combined with the continued support of the Job Network, supports the objectives of the APM. PPM survey data for the Eureka ESA are not available for individual years due to insufficient numbers of survey respondents. Shark Fishery (Question No. 567) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 14 February 2005: (1) In respect of the anti-finning regulations in the Northern Territory Joint Authority Shark Fishery, how and where are the shark trunks being landed at the Port of Darwin being disposed of. (2) What records are available in respect of shark trunk disposal. (3) How is compliance with the anti-finning regulations being determined.

(6) What level of training in fisheries compliance is given to the compliance officers and can he confirm that the compliance officers are members of the Northern Territory police force. (1) Shark trunks are being sold to local, national and international markets. Product uses include fresh and frozen fillets for human consumption, fish emulsion and they are internationally processed into seafood balls, tempura and soups for human consumption.",178,Questions In Writing
175,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) All shark product weights and cuts are recorded by fishers in monthly market logbooks at the point of sale and comparisons are made with logbook returns from Traders/Processors to validate monthly returns from individual fishers. (3) Random on board vessel inspections are made by Northern Territory Fisheries Police officers to ensure compliance with gear and fin ratio regulations. The Fisheries Group of the Northern Territory Department of Business, Industry and Resource Development also holds annual fin ratio review workshops with industry and compulsory logbook returns are analysed regularly. (4) Shark trunks are not being dumped at sea. Fishers are required to land a prescribed amount of meat with every fin landed (fin ratios). In addition, recent licence conditions prevent shark meat from leaving port again on board a vessel. (5) There are 17 dedicated Fisheries Police members in the Police Marine Enforcement Section of the Northern Territory Police Force. In 2004, 47 random compliance checks were made on vessels operating in the Northern Territory shark fishery. (6) Officers of the dedicated marine police section are fully trained and endorsed Northern Territory Police officers. Asylum Seekers (Question No. 581) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 14 February 2005: (1) How many asylum seekers from tsunami affected countries are (a) being held in detention; and (b) on temporary protection visas (TPVs). (2) Will the Government urgently review the applications for permanent protection for those asylum seekers from tsunami affected countries. (3) Has the Minister’s department been approached by any asylum seekers from tsunami affected countries requesting assistance relating to the welfare of their families in tsunami affected areas; if so, (a) how many; and (b) is the Minister able to assist those families; if so, how. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) Departmental systems indicate that, as at 11 February 2005, there was one protection visa applicant from a tsunami affected country who was in detention. This person’s application was recently remitted to the Department by the Refugee Review Tribunal. Further checks are being undertaken in order to decide the visa application. (b) Departmental systems indicate that as at 11 February 2005, there were some 90 remaining temporary protection visa holders from tsunami affected countries. (2) Applications for further protection visas lodged by temporary protection visa holders from tsunami affected countries are being assessed on their merits under the normal arrangements for determining applications for further protection visas. To be eligible for grant of a further protection visa, an applicant must either be found to be owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention or be accompanying a family member who has been found to be owed such protection obligations. The tsunami and the damage and disruption it has caused do not meet the grounds set out in the Refugees Convention for identifying persons owed refugee protection. However, where the Refugee Review Tribunal affirms a decision to refuse a further protection visa, the Minister has a noncompellable personal power to substitute for the Tribunal decision a decision which is more favourable to the applicant, where the Minister considers this to be in the public interest.",181,Questions In Writing

(b) My Department is maintaining communication with relevant migrant communities in Australia, including monitoring the needs of those whose relatives are missing or have been killed or injured. Concerns by immigration detainees about the welfare of family members in affected areas have been addressed by providing access to overseas phones calls and through tracing assistance from the Australian Red Cross. It is not possible to identify the extent to which the calls were from asylum seekers from tsunami affected countries requesting assistance relating to the welfare of their families in tsunami affected areas. Immigration Removals (Question No. 595) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 16 February 2005: (1) Can he confirm the report in The Age on 28 January which stated that a person accompanied by three security guards on a Thai Airlines flight had been chained by the hands and feet and had gaffer tape around his head covering his mouth; if so, were these actions taken by the Australia Government and, if they were, why. (2) How was this passenger able to eat, drink or go to the toilet. (3) Have there been other instances of people being transported under similar conditions; if so, how many. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: I am advised that: (1) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) was responsible for the removal of this person as he had no entitlement to remain in Australia. In exceptional circumstances the use of restraint on high risk removees during a removal operation may be required. This includes cases where the removee presents a high security risk or behaves in a way that threatens the safety of themself or others. In this case, the removee was violent, noisy and disruptive during the removal process. He assaulted the escorts and attempted to bite them. He also bit his own lips, apparently in an attempt to delay his removal and appear unfit to travel. The escorting officers found that it was necessary to restrain the person with hand restraints, leg restraints and mouth tape, to allow him to board the flight without posing further danger to himself or others. (2) The removee was restrained for the minimum time required. The flight departed Sydney with a stopover in Melbourne. The restraints were removed when the flight departed Melbourne on its international leg. The removee was allowed to eat and drink. He was also allowed toilet breaks.",182,Questions In Writing

In addition, five were restrained by the hands only. During the period July 2004 – February 2005 there were 11 reported incidents of removees restrained with hand and leg restraints. Four of these 11 removees were additionally restrained with mouth tape. In once instance it was also necessary to tape a removee’s finger nails due to attempts in the past to use them as an instrument to harm himself and others. Commercial Agreements (Question No. 601) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 16 February 2005: (1) Has the Minister read the article titled ‘When the journalist is a party spin doctor, it’s bad PR for real news’ in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 February 2005. (2) In respect of those parts of the report that say “In shades of Australia’s cash-for-comment scandal, a conservative syndicated US columnist and pundit has been secretly contracted for $307,000 by the Bush Administration to promote the President’s education policies in his columns and TV appearances” and “it is no longer clear who is and who isn’t a journalist in the US”, can the Minister guarantee that the Australian Government has not entered into any similar agreement with a journalist or commentator in Australia; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes.

Disclosure of commercial arrangements between radio current affairs presenters and sponsors is provided for by the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000. The standard requires on-air disclosure during current affairs programs of commercial agreements between sponsors and presenters that have the potential to affect the content of those programs. Commercial radio licensees are also required to provide the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) with particulars of each commercial agreement between sponsors and presenters of current affairs programs or their associates. This register is published on the website of the ABA. Licensees are also required to publish these details on any website operated by or on behalf of the licensee. Compliance with the Standard is a condition of a broadcaster’s licence. The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice also provides for the disclosure of commercial arrangements. The Code requires the disclosure, by licensees, of any agreements or arrangements under which a licensee, an independent producer or a presenter agrees with a third party to endorse or feature the third party’s products or services in a factual program in exchange for consideration. The disclosure must be made either during the program or in the credits of the program and should adequately bring the existence of any such commercial arrangement to the attention of viewers in a way that is readily understandable to a reasonable person. It should be noted that my Portfolio responsibilities for media issues in Australia do not include the operation of the print media. Any concerns the honourable member may have regarding the impact of commercial agreements on the representation of news and current affairs in the print media should be directed to the Australian Press Council (APC).",183,Questions In Writing

(2) On 24 May 2001, the ABA released a discussion paper and a proposed variation to the Sydney Licence Area Plan which considered the option that another community radio broadcasting service to serve Sydney be made available for allocation, operating on the 1386 kHz frequency. I am advised that after considering the submissions received, the ABA decided to approve the variation to the Sydney Licence Area Plan on 28 March 2002, making an additional community radio broadcasting service available for allocation for the Sydney licence area operating on 1386 kHz. (3) (a) to (c) The ABA has advised that: On 27 February 2003, after carefully assessing the applications received the ABA decided not to allocate the licence as it considered that no applicant had adequately demonstrated that it could satisfy all of the criteria at section 84(2) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. On 27 February 2003 the ABA decided not to make the 1386 kHz frequency available for temporary community broadcasting due to problems that had recently been identified in relation to serious electro-magnetic compatibility and possible health and safety issues due to the location of the transmission tower at the nominal transmission site at Homebush Bay and its proximity to new residential areas. The ABA advised that it would review this situation in 12 months time. In its 10 May 2004 news release, the ABA announced the commencement of its review to explore the issues surrounding the use of the 1386 kHz frequency in Sydney and possible options for its future use in the Sydney licence area. Written submissions were sought from the public in relation to the matters raised in the paper.",187,Questions In Writing
182,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(4) I am advised that the ABA has not made a decision regarding the future use of the 1386 kHz frequency for the Sydney licence area. This decision has been deferred until such time as the Government digital radio policy is further developed. (5) See answer to Part (4). (6) I am advised that Sydney Christian Broadcasters Ltd (Rhema Sydney) was one of eight applicants for the community radio broadcasting licence to operate on the 1386 kHz frequency. At the time of submitting its application, Rhema Sydney stated that it had over 4,249 financial members, provided petitions and letters of support with over 7,500 signatories and provided over 500 letters of support from churches. Rhema quoted a 1998 Australian Community Survey that indicated that 20% of the Christian population (476,000 people in Sydney) attended a church on a monthly basis. It claimed a target audience of between 237,000 and 755,000 people; however, did not provide evidence to support this. It should also be noted that there is already a community radio broadcasting service licensed in Sydney to serve this Christian community. (7) The allocation of licences for community radio broadcasting is a matter for the ABA. The ABA indicated in its 10 May 2004 news release that it is considering a range of options for the use of the frequency including retaining it for a community service, making it available for an open narrowcasting service, using it for Digital Radio Mondiale trials or making it available for other purposes. The ABA is required to consider the appropriate use of the 1386 kHz frequency for Sydney in a manner consistent with the objectives of the Act. Wollongong Hospital (Question No. 656) Ms Bird asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) Is he aware of the community campaign in Wollongong to have the Government allocate an MRI licence to Wollongong Hospital. (2) Will he list the occasions his office and department have communicated with constituents and community groups in the electoral division of (a) Cunningham and (b) Throsby, including details of the identity of the correspondent and the date and mode of correspondence (ie letter, facsimile, and email), concerning the allocation of an MRI licence to Wollongong Hospital. (1) I am aware of the community campaign in Wollongong to extend Medicare eligibility to the MRI unit at Wollongong Hospital. (2) My Office and my Department have responded to many representations from constituents and community groups regarding the extension of Medicare eligibility to the MRI unit at the Wollongong Hospital. For privacy reasons, I do not feel that it is appropriate to list every such communication. I should point out that there is a Medicare eligible MRI machine within Wollongong located less than 500 metres from the hospital and that the state government is responsible for the provision of MRI services to public patients in public hospitals. Broadband Services (Question No. 658) Ms Bird asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) Is it the case that Broadband service is not available in all areas of the electoral division of Cunningham; if so, which areas do not have access to Broadband.",188,Questions In Writing
183,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) What reasons does Telstra give for not providing access to Broadband. (3) What action is Telstra taking to address this situation. (4) Is the Minister able to say when Broadband services will be available throughout the electoral division of Cunningham. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question based largely on advice from Telstra: (1) No, it is not the case. Broadband services are available in all areas of the electoral division of Cunningham through a variety of technology platforms including Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), CDMA EVDO and other wireless broadband technologies, one way satellite and two way satellite. There are a number of service providers operating infrastructure to delivers broadband services in the electoral division of Cunningham, including Telstra, Fish Internet, Australian Private Networks, Clear Networks and NewSat. The Australian Government’s Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme is providing financial assistance to service providers to enable them to supply services at metropolitan comparable prices to eligible customers within the non-metropolitan parts of the electoral division of Cunningham.

(11) Will the JOPC have a role in terms of future strategic planning in respect of border protection and in particular in respect of decisions regarding the future acquisition and use of assets; if so, what. the honourable member’s question: (1) Section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 provides the legislative basis for cargo reporting. Subsection 64AB (8) relevantly states that: A cargo report is to be made not later than: (a) if the cargo is carried on a ship: (i) the start of a prescribed period; or (ii) if the journey from the last port is of a kind described in regulations made for the purpose of this subparagraph-the start of the shorter period that is specified in those regulations; before the estimated time of arrival of the ship at the first port in Australia since it last departed from a port outside Australia. Currently, the prescribed period for reporting is 48 hours unless the journey from the last port departed outside Australia is likely to take less than 48 hours, then not later than 24 hours before its arrival is the prescribed period. No journey’s have been prescribed. (2) When the JOPC is fully established, only vessels proposing to enter Australian ports will be required to provide details of their cargo, as currently required by section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901. (3) Sections 184A to 185AB provide the legislative basis to board and/or search certain foreign and Australian vessels.",190,Questions In Writing
188,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toThe jurisdiction with respect to Australian ships is based on international law under which States can exercise jurisdiction over their own vessels provided those vessels are not located in the territorial sea of another State. The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships falls variously within 12 nautical miles, 24 nautical miles and 200 nautical miles. Australia has sovereignty within the 12 nautical mile territorial sea claimed by Proclamation in the Gazette No. S 297, 1990, under section 7 of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. Therefore, Customs enforces a range of Commonwealth laws. The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships between 12 nautical miles and 24 nautical miles is limited to establishing the identity of a ship or, the prevention or punishment of a contravention or an attempted contravention in Australia of the Customs Act 1901 or an Act prescribed by regulations consistently with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Acts prescribed are the Migration Act 1958, Quarantine Act 1908, Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984. The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships between 12 nautical miles and 200 nautical miles is the exercise of board and/or search powers where there is a suspicion that that the vessel is, will be or has been involved in a contravention, or attempted contravention, in Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Generally states do not have jurisdiction over foreign ships on the high seas. There are three exceptions to this that allow a boarding to be made and powers to be exercised over foreign ships. The first exception is where an agreement exists between Australia and the flag state of the foreign ship. No such agreements are currently in place. The second exception is to board a ship without nationality to establish the ship’s identity. The third exception is exercising powers over a mother ship that may be on the high seas. That is, although the mother ship is located on the high seas it is linked to a ship closer to Australia (daughter ship) and the two ships are involved in a contravention of Australian law. (4) As above. (5) (a) No. (b) No. (6) The Australian Maritime Identification System (AMIS) is not a reporting zone. At this stage there are no new reporting requirements proposed under the AMIS. (7) (a) Yes, when Australian Customs Vessels are assigned under operational control to the Commander JOPC for specific operations. (b) Yes, when the ADF vessels are assigned under operational control to the Commander JOPC for specific operations. (8) For military operations and combined exercises, the Chief of Defence Force (CDF) will assign ADF forces to the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS). Within any constraints imposed by CDF, the commander of an operation or exercise. For the conduct of civil and Customs operations and joint/combined exercises, the Chief Executive Officer Australian Customs Service (CEO Customs) will assign airborne surveillance assets, and may direct other assets such as Australian Customs Vessels, to the Commander JOPC for his/her control and management for specific operations or exercises. The Commander JOPC will issue orders that accord with the Rules of Engagement (ROE) promulgated by CDF through CJOPS and by the CEO Customs. (9) JOPC is not charged with the enforcement of any specific legislation. Its purpose is to simplify and strengthen planning, as well as command and control arrangements for military offshore maritime protection functions and the conduct of civil maritime surveillance. (10) There are 8 Australian Customs Vessels; 17 Coastwatch aircraft; 15 Navy Fremantle Class Patrol Boats and 12 Navy Armidale Patrol Boats yet to be delivered. In September 2004 Government announced the acquisition of an additional two Armidale Class patrol boats. The number assigned to JOPC will vary depending on Customs and Defence tasking priorities and requirements. (11) The JOPC will contribute to future strategic planning, particularly in respect to the counterterrorism aspects of border protection. It is also anticipated that JOPC will have input in respect of decisions regarding the acquisition and use of assets, although JOPC will not own any of the particular assets. It is intended that JOPC will use Customs and ADF assets to execute a particular operation during a particular period and at the end of that operation, hand back control of the asset. Australian Federal Police (Question No. 678) writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) How many Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers are based at the AFP station in the Torres Strait. (2) How many AFP officers are currently assigned to conduct joint patrols to combat transnational crime between PNG and Australia. (3) Does the AFP plan to introduce any other measures to combat the drug trade between PNG and Australia. the honourable member’s question: (1) There are two AFP employees based full time on Thursday Island, with additional support provided by the AFP’s Cairns Office as required. (2) The AFP in North Queensland participates with State and Commonwealth agencies in all joint cross border-patrols between Australia and PNG. The number of AFP members deployed varies in proportion to the circumstances and the objectives of the patrol. (3) The AFP is working closely with State and Commonwealth agencies at both a tactical and strategic level to counteract the illicit drug trade between Australia and PNG. On available evidence, current strategies are sufficient and effective, however operational and intelligence practices targeting illicit drug activity in the Torres Strait are monitored and reviewed as required.

191,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Justice And Customs, In","(4) What procedures are there to assist with the transition of files and/or investigations from an AFP officer who is being deployed overseas to the AFP officer assuming responsibility for that file or investigation. (5) Have any files and or investigations been left in abeyance as a result of overseas deployments. (6) Has the AFP conducted an inquiry or requested a report on the effect of the deployment of AFP officers overseas on the ability of the AFP to deliver key capabilities in Australia; if so, what are the details and the findings. (7) Does the AFP intend to conduct an inquiry or has the AFP requested a report on the effect of the deployment of AFP officers overseas on the ability of the AFP to deliver key capabilities in Australia; if so, when; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: The AFP has a sophisticated and pre-existing methodology for accepting, allocating and monitoring matters referred to it for investigation. In considering acceptance or rejection of referrals the AFP applies its Case Categorisation & Prioritisation Model (CCPM). Decisions to accept or reject a referral take into account a number of variables including CCPM classification, referral evaluation and recommendation, and available capacity. The AFP has a number of publicly available stated performance measures against which it monitors its outputs. The AFP makes decisions on the allocation of capacity to crime types and geographical offices based on its understanding of the criminal activity and the requirements of client agencies. As part of its regular performance review, the AFP monitors the potential displacement of current activities by the demands of emerging threats. In particular, the AFP has been vigilant to the possible impact of its overseas operations on its ability to conduct domestic criminal investigations. The AFP monitors its activity through operational hours allocated to a matter and through the results achieved. Performance reports are provided to the National Managers Group each month and to the Executive Management Board every two months, and these provide an opportunity for a number of interventions to occur where decisions concerning resource allocations are seen to impact work delivery. The nature of the AFP’s core activities has changed over the past five years especially with respect to overseas operations. The impact of these changes on domestic operations has been minimal both in terms of activity levels and results achieved. Details of the impact on domestic operations is included in the following answers addressing your specific questions. (1) The IDG deployment force is made up of resources from the AFP’s Outcome1 areas, ACT Policing and from State Police forces. In order to permit the deployment of resources without impact on domestic operations the AFP has specifically a) recruited staff into ACT Policing and specifically into the IDG, b) encouraged voluntary movement of staff across the AFP business streams, c) has redirected some work to offices with available capacity and d) seconded staff to international work directly from state police services. (2) AFP staff do not move to the IDG permanently, but for an agreed period of deployment. This arrangement allows for a fixed term allocation, which in turn is covered through a backfilling strategy. For example a 70-week EOI process allows staff to voluntarily apply to fixed length transfer to encourage movement across AFP business streams to maintain appropriate resource levels. This movement is balanced by recruitment strategies which to date have seen more than 170 staff come into the AFP. The recruitment strategies target a balance between fixed term engagement and permanent appointment to the AFP. (3) The AFP examines the operational case load of each deployed officer well in advance of deployment, and makes decisions about case load and allocation. Prior to deploying a member overseas",193,Questions In Writing
192,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toor to another geographic location the member and their supervisor review cases allocated to the member to identify cases that can be completed prior to deployment and those needing reallocating to a new case manager. Because of the resource management decisions taken, and because the management of case load is continually reviewed, the AFP has experienced minimal impact on its domestic operations because of its IDG involvement. Performance measures quoted in the following answers, particularly to Question 6, demonstrate this position. (4) Prior to deploying a member overseas or to another geographic location, the member and their supervisor review cases allocated to the member to identify cases that can be completed prior to deployment and those needing re-allocated to a new case officer. When a case is re-allocated the new case officer is provided with briefing and reviews case situation reports to become appraised of the case. In the case of major investigations a second case officer and/or core team may be allocated to the investigation to ensure continuity of investigation. (5) The number of matters rejected is indicative both of internal resource availability and demands by client agencies. Matters rejected increased from a low of 184 in 2000 to a peak of 389 in 2002 (impacted by the Bali bombing investigation), but have since declined to 288 in 2004. (6) The AFP has committed itself to investigating serious crime. Over the five years from 2000 to 2004, the number of High or Very High Impact matters has increased from 386 new cases in 2000 to 700 new cases in 2004. Over the same period, the total number of domestic cases has decreased by 19%, primarily because minor matters have increasingly been handled by alternative strategies, e.g. outposted officers. The number of cases finalised has remained steady over the period. The number of cases resulting in convictions has increased from 282 in 2000 to 300 in 2004. The quantity of illegal drugs seized has remained high over the five-year period increasing from 2.0 tonne in 2000 to 2.6 tonne in 2004. Results in the intervening years are variable. Over the past five years, the AFP has met its Portfolio Budget Target of 65% of resources devoted to High or Very High Impact matters. (7) As indicated above, the AFP will continue to monitor the impact of emerging operational activity on traditional law enforcement activity. Criminal Investigations (Question No. 682) writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) To what extent is information acquired in criminal investigations shared between the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state law enforcement agencies. (2) Is there a common computer network available to both Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies for use in investigations as opposed to the information contained in Crimtrac. (3) In circumstances where an AFP officer is investigating a matter, are there procedures or computer systems that automatically advise a state police officer investigating a related matter of additional information that may be added to the AFP investigation files. (4) Are there procedures or computer systems that automatically advise AFP officers of additional information which may be added to State databases. (5) In circumstances where an AFP officer is investigating a matter, are there procedures or computer systems that automatically advise ASIO of any additional information that may be added to the Federal investigation files.",194,Questions In Writing
193,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Justice And Customs, In","(6) Are there such procedures or computer systems that automatically advise AFP officers of additional information which may be added to ASIO databases. the honourable member’s question: (1) Information acquired during criminal investigations is shared between the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and State law enforcement agencies to the extent necessary to achieve effective and efficient operational outcomes under the relevant legislative and governance frameworks. (2) No. Joint investigations between the AFP and State law enforcement agencies utilise liaison officers who have access to agency on line services. Joint initiatives between the Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies are further supplemented by installing AFP and relevant State agencies on line services within the joint investigative team to service the requirements of the investigation. Information is readily shared between the Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies through the application of a variety of non AFP information systems when appropriate. (3) There are no computer systems which automatically advise either the AFP or State law enforcement agencies of information regarding an investigation. However procedures have been implemented to facilitate information flow between agencies. In any investigation regular consultation occurs between agencies and in many instances agencies are co-located to facilitate information flow. The appointment of agency liaison officers to investigations assists in cross-agency information sharing. The AFP and State police conduct nation wide criminal history checks to access cross-jurisdictional information regarding persons of interest. AFP computer terminals are being progressively installed in State Police Operation Centres (POC) to enable access to AFP systems for specific incidents or investigations. (4) Refer to response (3) above. (5) No. Security protocols do not allow shared computer systems between the AFP and ASIO. There are procedures which facilitate information exchange between ASIO and the AFP. The AFP and ASIO have established a close working relationship, and share information through formal written request and verbally through regular case officer and senior management meetings. (6) Refer to response (5) above. Mr Willie Brigitte (Question No. 691) Since Mr Willie Brigitte was deported from Australia, has ASIO had access to Mr Brigitte for the purpose of conducting an interview; if not, has ASIO or any other government agency sought access. I have responded to questions dealing with Attorney-General’s Department and Australian Federal Police access to Mr Brigitte (Question Numbers 84 and 283 asked on 2 December 2004 in Senate Estimates – copies of those replies are attached). Given the fact that Mr Brigitte is the subject of a current judicial investigation in France and there are legal processes underway in Australia, it would not be appropriate for ASIO to comment further on this matter.

Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (Question No. 704) Mr Price asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) Is he aware of a report prepared by the Parliamentary Library ‘Medication for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): an analysis by Federal Electorate (2001 – 03)’. (2) Can he explain the variation in prescriptions for dexamphetamine sulfate between electoral divisions; if not, why not. (3) Does he plan to investigate the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD; if so, how will this be conducted and when; if not, why not. (1) I am aware of the report prepared by the Parliamentary Library ‘Medication for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): analysis by Federal Electorate (2001–03). (2) From the data provided in the Electorate reports it is not possible to provide a simple explanation for the variation between electoral divisions in the prescribing of dexamphetamine. Establishing the reasons for such variations is complicated by the uncertainty of the data. Dexamphetamine is currently the only drug listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) specifically for the treatment of ADHD. As dexamphetamine is priced under the general patient co-payment of $28.60,",196,Questions In Writing
197,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:there is limited available information on the number of prescriptions and prescribing patterns. The Health Insurance Commission only collects data where a Government benefit is paid. As such we do not have data on prescriptions that cost less than the general co-payment amount. In addition, as dexamphetamine is classified as a Schedule8 medicine (see 3 below), the states and territories are responsible for collecting data on the prescribing of these drugs. (3) I encourage best practice in providing guidance to doctors on the quality use of medicines. Best practice guidance comes through sources such as the National Health and Medical Research Council and through National Health Priorities initiatives. The Australian Government does not regulate the treatment and prescribing practices of doctors. The decision to prescribe medications, including medicines for the treatment of ADHD, is a judgment made by a doctor approved to prescribe by their respective state and territory health departments with regard to individual circumstances. The states and territories regulate the prescribing of some drugs as they are classified as Schedule8 Drugs– drugs of addiction. Most states and territories only allow dexamphetamine to be prescribed by an ‘authorised’ prescriber, such as a consultant pediatrician or a consultant psychiatrist. Medicines for ADHD should always be prescribed as part of a comprehensive treatment program which includes psychological, educational and social remedial measures. Detoxification Programs (Question No. 706) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 8 March 2005: (1) Can he confirm that pharmaceutical products and other treatments are available for patients withdrawing from (a) illicit drug, (b) alcohol, and (c) cigarette use through programs and schemes provided through his department. (2) Can he provide the (a) details and (b) costs of each program and scheme that provides pharmaceutical products and other treatments available for patients withdrawing from (i) illicit drug, (ii) alcohol, and (iii) cigarette use. (3) For each year since 2000, (a) what was the estimated cost borne by the taxpayer, and (b) how many deaths were attributed to (i) illicit drug, (ii) alcohol, and (iii) cigarette use. (1) (a) (b) and (c) The Australian Government has programs that increase the availability of pharmaceutical products for treating dependence on heroin, alcohol, and tobacco. However, the provision of drug and alcohol detoxification (withdrawal) programs is primarily the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. (2) (a) and (b) (i) (ii) and (iii) There is a general Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidy for two drugs used in treating alcohol dependence (acamprosate calcium and naltrexone hydrochloride), and one drug used in treating nicotine dependence (buproprion hydrochloride). In 2003-04, the cost of acamprosate was $3,473,441, naltrexone was $2,078,329, and buproprion was $14,390,389. Under section 100 of the National Health Act 1953, the Australian Government also funds the cost of (a) bulk purchases of methadone hydrochloride syrup supplied to pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals for the management of opiate dependence; and (b) the supply of buprenorphine hydrochloride tablets as recommended for the treatment of opiate dependence, including maintenance and detoxification (withdrawal) within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. The funding is by way of reimbursement to the wholesale",197,Questions In Writing
198,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:supplier or importer of the drug. In 2003-04, the cost of methadone to the Australian Government was $4,336,285 and of buprenorphine $15,982,495. Other treatments are the responsibility of state and territory governments. (3) (a) The most recent data on the costs of drug use are for 1998-99. The study, Counting the cost: estimates of the social costs of drug abuse in Australia in 1998-9 was published in 2002. There is no estimate of how much of the total social cost was borne by taxpayers. However, the table at Attachment A shows the estimated tangible costs (such as lost productivity and hospital costs) for illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and the estimated proportion of those costs borne by the government sector, including state and territory governments. The remaining costs were borne by industry and by individuals. (b) (i) (ii) and (iii) Mortality data is predominantly provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on registered death certificates received from state and territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. Deaths are classified according to ICD-10-AM which is the international statistical classification of diseases and health related problems. ICD-10-AM classifications of deaths from causes including drug use are attributed to the event leading to the death rather than by the specific drug per se. For example, death may be recorded as caused by lung cancer (malignant neoplasm) or a motor vehicle accident. Hence, information on drug-related deaths is not available for every year since 2000. For alcohol and tobacco, the Department has estimates of deaths derived using the aetiological fraction methodology. This methodology relies on the prevalence of a risk factor and associated relative risk of a particular illness or injury. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the aetiological fractions methodology shows that in 1998 some 19,019 people died in Australia as a result of tobacco smoking. Information from the National Drug Research Institute for alcohol shows that in 2001 an estimated 3,004 people died as a consequence of risky or high risk levels of alcohol consumption. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Information Paper (2003) Drug Induced Deaths 2001 provides some information about deaths attributed to drug use (excluding alcohol, tobacco and volatile substances) in Australia. This indicated that in 2001 there were 1,038 drug-induced deaths registered.

Canberra: Department of Health and Ageing Visas (Question No. 708) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 8 March 2005: (1) How many s417 applications are currently before the Minister. (2) How many s417 applications have been delegated to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to determine. (3) On what basis are s417 applications divided between the Minister and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. (4) What is the average processing time for s417 applications from receipt to decision. (5) What proportion of s417 applications are from people currently in immigration detention. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) As at 28 February 2005, there were 1824 s417 requests before both the Minister and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. It should be noted that there is no application for Ministerial Intervention under s417. Section 417 of the Migration Act 1958 provides the Minister with the power to substitute for a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, a decision which is more favourable to the applicant, if the Minister considers that it is in the public interest to do so. This power is not compellable and the Minister does not have an obligation to consider substituting a more favourable decision in a case. In all cases where a review authority affirms a decision on a Protection Visa application, an assessment against the Minister’s guidelines is undertaken by the Department. If the case falls within the guidelines, a submission is prepared to enable the Minister to decide whether he or she wishes to consider the case for intervention. (2) The s417 power is not delegated. Both Ministers exercise their s417 Ministerial Intervention power in their own right. The division of cases between the two Ministers is broadly determined by whether or not the cases are deemed to be made by individuals in the community or cases deemed to be made by individuals in detention. The division of responsibilities for s417 Ministerial Intervention cases between portfolio Ministers is determined by categories and not by the number of cases. (3) Under administrative arrangements put in place after Minister McGauran was appointed as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs on 26 October 2004, Senator Vanstone handles section cases covering people who are not in detention. (4) Departmental systems do not maintain statistics on average processing times for Ministerial Intervention processes in a reportable format. Variations in processing may be determined by the individual aspects of a particular case. The power for the Minister to intervene is exhausted only when finalisation of the case is determined. Every person whose case is brought to the Minister’s attention is advised of his or her decision, whether it is a decision to refuse to consider exercising the public interest powers, or a decision following consideration of the exercise of those powers. (5) As at 28 February 2005, there were 1824 requests processed by the Department or being considered by the Minister. Of these, nine per cent or 171 requests were detention cases. Child-Care Centres (Question No. 711) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 8 March 2005: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 82 (Hansard, 8 February 2005, pages 82-87), for each financial year from 2000-01 to 2003-04, what sum was provided to each (a) private and (b) community based child care centre in the electoral division of Throsby within the Child Care Rebate range (i) 1 to 25 per cent CCB, (ii) 26 to 50 per cent CCB, (iii) 51 to 75 per cent CCB, and (iv) 76 to 100 per cent CCB.

(3) The Long Day Care Incentive Scheme provides not-for-profit and for-profit providers with short term incentives to encourage the establishment of new viable long day care centres in rural and urban fringe areas of high unmet demand. The funding for Long Day Care Incentive Scheme encourages additional places for children under 24 months through the provision of higher per place funding to this age group. Places for children under 2 years receive $30 per place, per week incentive funding and places for over 2 years receive $15 per place, per week incentive funding. Sustainability Assistance is available to existing eligible not-for-profit Long Day Care services. It is targeted to areas of need approved by the department as a contribution to support viability. Sustainability Assistance gives a higher weighting to services that have places for children under 24 months.

Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. The number of participants refers to all job seekers assisted in Intensive Support in that year. (5) In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs. (6) The Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients. Outcomes estimates for Intensive Assistance for the Emerald, Gladstone, Mackay, Rockhampton and Townsville ESAs are shown in Table 5. Table5 includes (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment following their placements.

Casual employment includes employment on a temporary, seasonal or casual basis, which may be full time or part time. The delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003, and as a result PPM survey data for Intensive Assistance for 2003 and 2004 are not available. The delivery of the new Intensive Support service under the APM commenced on 1 July 2003. PPM survey data for Intensive Support at the ESA level are not yet available. (7) Community Work Coordinators (CWCs) are contracted to provide Work for the Dole services on an ESA basis.

There were insufficient numbers of survey respondents in the Emerald, Gladstone, Mackay, Rockhampton and Townsville ESAs to provide statistically reliable outcome estimates for Work for the Dole for 2000. Socio-Economic Status Funding (Question No. 727) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 8 March 2005: (1) Can he confirm that the Socio-Economic Status (SES) funding formula is an aggregate statistic measuring the economic status of districts and not individual families or individual schools; if not, why not. (2) Can he confirm that the SES funding formula gives a potentially misleading indicator of educational need and results in the overly generous funding of some independent non-government schools with boarding facilities; if not, why not. (3) Will the Government review the formula used to allocate Commonwealth funding to independent schools; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) The SES methodology calculates an SES score for each school based on all the Census Collection Districts (CDs) from which the school draws it students. The data present an average socioeconomic profile of the school community, that is, the families of students at the school. The SES model does not set out to measure the wealth of any individual family or school, but rather to rank schools relative to each other based on the SES of each school’s community. Following the SES Simulation Project undertaken in 1998, a series of validation exercises were carried out using the simulation results against other parental income and wealth measures. The findings of the validation exercises support the view that a Census-based SES measure produces a good proxy for parental socioeconomic status, without the intrusiveness and administrative complexity inherent in measuring parental income more directly. (2) The SES approach is a transparent and objective measure based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census data that are consistent for all schools. The SES Index that is used to calculate schools’ SES scores measures the income, education and occupation levels of all residents within a CD. The SES score of each student’s home CD is the only factor that contributes to the school’s SES score. There is no discrimination between boarding and non-boarding students. Data collected by the Department of Education, Science and Training in 2003 show that there were over 140 independent boarding schools, enrolling some 11,000 boarding students. These students come from a wide range of CDs in both urban and rural areas, with about 45 per cent coming from urban areas. The data also show that schools with boarding students are not advantaged by the SES funding formula. In many instances, boarding schools which are located in the same area as day schools have a similar or higher SES score than the day schools. For example: there are two boarding schools located in Wahroonga, NSW; the four other non-government schools located in this suburb all have lower SES scores in Hawthorn, Victoria there are six non-government schools, one of which is an boarding school with an SES score of 124; three of the remaining schools have scores below 124 while the other two have scores of 125 there are five schools located in Brisbane, one of which is a boarding school with an SES score of 116; the other four schools have scores of 102, 113, 117 and 119 the two boarding schools in the ACT have SES scores of 119 and 124; the 13 other schools in the ACT, which also cater for secondary students, have scores ranging from 100 to 122.",218,Questions In Writing
206,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) A review of the SES funding arrangements will be undertaken during the current quadrennium. The review will involve consultations with all non-government school groups and these discussions will inform policy development for the funding of non-government schools for 2009-2012. Broadband Services (Question No. 731) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) Can the Minister list the locations of telephone exchanges in the electoral division of Hunter.

These vehicles are financed through a panel of financiers. The financiers determine the disposal place. (3) Telstra has advised that some 300 Telstra vehicles are located in the Hunter region. (4) Telstra has advised that in the last 12 months, 227 Telstra Fleet units were disposed of through an auction house in Newcastle.",230,Questions In Writing
208,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(5) Yes. See answers to part (1), part (2) and part (4).

See answer to part (4). Fruit and Vegetable Growers (Question No. 735) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) What is the Government doing to relieve pressure on fruit and vegetable growers who are experiencing falling income due to increased costs? (2) What assistance is available to farmers who are currently experiencing loss of income? (3) What is the Government doing to assist fruit and vegetable growers meet increased costs? (1) While it would be inappropriate to directly intervene in private sector markets, the Government has introduced a range of measures to improve the competitiveness of fruit and vegetable growers. The Government has gained improved access to export markets for fruit and vegetable growers and recently introduced legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to make it quicker, simpler and easier to collectively negotiate with buyers of their produce. The Government also provides matching research and development funding for fruit and vegetable industries, to help them lower industry costs and provides support for industry training. (2) There are a number of Government programs available to assist farmers experiencing a loss of income. The Agriculture – Advancing Australia Farm Help Program, is the Government’s key means of providing short term income support to low-income farm families who are experiencing financial hardship. There is also Exceptional Circumstances Assistance for farmers experiencing a severe and prolonged decline in income due to a rare and severe event. Interim income support is also available where a prima facie case for Exceptional Circumstances Assistance has been demonstrated. (3) The Government helps farmers including fruit and vegetable growers face challenges such as increased costs through its Agriculture – Advancing Australia package of programs. This package of programs is targeted at helping producers become more competitive, sustainable and profitable by improving business management, supporting families through change, providing access to professional advice, improving access to markets and building industry capacity to meet future challenges. Australian Government funding of over $1 billion since 1997 for these programs demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to ensuring the long-term prosperity of rural and regional Australia. Joint Strike Fighter (Question No. 737) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware of reports that the Joint Strike Fighter’s (JSF) development costs have risen to about $38 billion. (2) Is the Minister aware that part of the reported increase is being attributed to the United States Department of Defense’s demand for anti-tampering safeguards to prevent sensitive technologies being passed on to enemies.",231,Questions In Writing
209,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) If Australia decides to purchase the JSF, will Australia have access to technology in key areas including the weapons’ guidance and navigation systems in the JSF. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, additional design effort and extension of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program has led to an increase in the cost estimate from US$33 billion to US$40.5 billion.

210,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsAt Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF), a psychiatrist visits approximately every 6 weeks, depending on case requirements. One psychologist and one counsellor are also available during business hours, Monday to Friday. At Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), an onsite General Practitioner (GP) refers clients to a private off-site psychiatrist. For acute and/or urgent treatment, a Mental Health Unit can be accessed via Bankstown Emergency department (Banks House). In addition, there is one full-time psychologist and three part-time psychologists on-site. At Maribyrnong IDC, there is a visiting psychiatrist who attends every 4 to 6 weeks.

At Perth IDC, non-emergency, tele-consultations may take place with a psychiatrist, as well as outpatient appointments via Bentley Clinic. Acute or non-acute consultations or non-voluntary admissions may take place via Bentley and Greylands Hospitals. There is also one part-time psychologist on-site. At Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC), a GP may consult with WA Mental Health Services via the phone. Acute psychiatric patients may be sent to Perth. A visiting psychologist attends one week per month. (b) DIMIA also utilises a number of doctors in its immigration detention facilities, in the following manner: At Baxter IDF, one doctor attends a daily GP clinic on-site, Monday to Friday. There is also one doctor on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At Villawood IDC, three doctors provide five clinics from Monday to Friday, and one doctor provides a clinic on Saturday. There is one doctor, who can be contacted via nurse, on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At Maribyrnong IDC, one doctor provides two clinics from Monday to Friday, and one doctor is on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At Perth IDC, one doctor provides a clinic each Tuesday and one doctor is on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At Christmas Island IRPC, people in detention have the same access to medical care as Christmas Island residents, i.e. consultations via Christmas Island Hospital. One doctor is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (c) Both DIMIA and contracted staff, including psychiatrists and doctors, offer and utilise interpreters whenever necessary. The interpreting needs of DIMIA and its contractors are met in the following manner: (i) For Farsi/Dari interpreters, as at 30 March 2005, there are three interpreters employed by the Detention Service Provider, GSL. Two interpreters were previously employed by GSL, completing their employment in May 2004 and February 2005 respectively. (ii) For Pashtun interpreters, telephone interpreting agencies are used. (iii) For Uzbek interpreters, telephone interpreting agencies are used. (iv) For Tajik interpreters, telephone interpreting agencies are used. Refugees (Question No. 760) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) In respect of those people who could not prove their claims for refugee status, how many were able to show discrimination or threat, not amounting to persecution under the Geneva Convention but enough to make them flee their country, that was not substantial enough for them to gain protection in Australia. (2) How many people had claims of persecution which were not accepted on the basis that the situation had changed since they fled (ie Afghans whose claims were based on persecution by the Taliban). (3) From which countries did the remaining people originate. (4) How long did it take to assess these people’s claims for refugee status. (5) Has the department been developing any further cost effective ways of ensuring that the remaining non-refugees and refugees are identified. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) systems do not record this information in a reportable form. (2) DIMIA systems do not record this information in a reportable form. (3) DIMIA systems do not record this information in a reportable form. (4) DIMIA systems are unable to report on this matter. (5) The Department constantly reviews the process of assessing applications for further protection to ensure they are processed in the most streamlined, cost-effective and rigorous manner. Australia has one of the most efficient and reliable refugee assessment processes in the world. The proportion of those claiming refugee protection who are in need of Australia’s protection varies widely according to their particular claims, their nationality, and the human rights situation in their homeland at the time. The major constraint to further reductions in the cost of decision making are the safeguards in the existing processes to provide individuals with an equitable opportunity to present their case, to receive and comment on any adverse personal information relating to their claims, which might be taken into account by the decision-maker, and to provide applicants with detailed reasons for any refusal decision and opportunities for merits review. Immigration Detention (Question No. 761) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: How many people held in Australian detention centres awaiting deportation are currently serving parole in relation to offences committed under federal or state laws. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: As at 18 February 2005, there were 973 people in immigration detention.

Temporary Protection Visas (Question No. 765) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) How many Iraqi asylum seekers are on (a) expired and (b) soon to expire temporary protection visas. (2) How many in (1) are awaiting the determination of a claim for continuing protection. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) and (b) Where a Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holder applies for further protection before the expiry date of their TPV, the TPV status can continue until the application for further protection is finally determined. This means that the only Iraqi TPV grantees whose TPVs have expired are those who either did not apply for further protection before their TPV expired, or have been finally determined not to be refugees. As at 25 February 2005, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) records indicate that some 20 Iraqi nationals in Australia have had their TPV status expire. (2) As at 25 February 2005 some 2850 applications for further protection, from Iraqi TPV grantees whose TPV has reached 30 months from grant date, are still to be decided by the Department. Temporary Protection Visas (Question No. 766) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) Does the Minister’s department propose to re-assess every individual applicant who applies for permanent protection when their TPV expires.

The Department is under a statutory obligation to assess and decide protection visa applications. (2) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) records indicate that as at 25 February 2005 some 9,300 applications for further protection have been lodged.",237,Questions In Writing
213,Mr Mcgauran,The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs,238,Questions In Writing
214,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsWhether any further visa granted is a temporary or permanent visa will depend on a number of factors, including the person’s actions as they travelled to Australia. (3) DIMIA records indicate that as at 25 February 2005, some 2,500 grants have been made at the primary decision stage on applications for further protection. (4) DIMIA records indicate that as at 25 February 2005, some 1,500 decisions on applications for further protection have been appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal. (5) DIMIA systems show that as at 27 February 2005, some 320 former Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders have departed Australia without waiting for resolution of a further protection visa application. Reports on departures of Temporary Humanitarian Visa holders are not currently available. (6) DIMIA records indicate that as at 25 February 2005, some 4,800 applications for further protection were awaiting a departmental decision at primary stage. (7) DIMIA financial systems do not allow processing costs of applications for further protection to be disaggregated from the other protection visa processing costs incurred by the Department. Refugees (Question No. 768) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) What advice has the Minister’s department given to Afghan refugees about the safety of returning to Afghanistan. (2) What information has the department used to make that assessment and does this include specific information regarding the refugees’ former areas of residence. (3) What information is there on the situation facing refugees of Hazara ethnicity. (4) What criteria are officers using to determine claims for permanent protection. (5) Has the department received assurances that it is safe to return these refugees. (6) What legal advice has been sought on this matter. (7) What legal advice has been sought on the view that only the UNHCR has the right to remove refugee protection. (8) Will the Minister explain the application of the cessation clauses of the Convention in these cases. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Australia does not return anybody who is found to be a refugee to a place of persecution. People who have been found to be refugees are free to leave Australia at any time should they wish to do so and are not obliged to inform the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) of this. DIMIA does not advise clients about safety in returning to their home country. Some 3.5 million Afghan refugees and former refugees have returned to Afghanistan in recent years, many under UNHCR auspices (including some 200,000 Afghans of Hazara ethnicity). (2) As stated above, DIMIA does not provide advice on safety to return. The Department’s Country Information Service maintains information on provinces and districts of concern within Afghanistan from a wide range of sources. (3) The Department’s Country Information Service maintains comprehensive information on the human rights and security situations in countries around the world. Afghanistan, including Afghans of the Hazara ethnicity, is a priority for country research. The Country Information Service is in close consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade network of overseas posts as",238,Questions In Writing
215,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairswell as the equivalent governmental country research agencies in Europe and North America. There is also close consultation with non-government and inter-governmental organisations (dealing with human rights concerns) and individual country experts, as well as extensive and continuous monitoring of academic, media and Internet information sources. (4) A decision-maker must be satisfied that the applicant has met all legislative requirements for grant of a permanent protection visa. One of these requirements is that the decision-maker is satisfied that the applicant is owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. In reaching their conclusion the decision-maker considers whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason at the time of decision. (5) Australia does not return anybody who is found to be a refugee. The Australian Government has not sought such assurances. The most effective way to ensure that persons do not suffer persecution if returned to their homeland is to have a robust process to identify refugees and protect them so that they are not returned. Australia has such a process which includes access to merits review by an independent tribunal of any unsuccessful protection claim. Applicants who are unsuccessful at the tribunal level have access to judicial review by the courts. Their cases are closely and regularly monitored to identify any instances in which the Ministerial intervention powers may be appropriately used to either to allow a fresh protection visa application to be lodged or to grant a visa on non refugee grounds. This process allows consideration of claims that may raise Australia’s protection obligations under other international human rights instruments to which Australia is a party. The persons returned have been conclusively found not to face any well founded fear of persecution. To date there have been no involuntary returns to Afghanistan. (6) The Department has not sought legal advice on this matter. (7) The Refugees Convention does not in any way provide that the cessation clauses can only be applied by the UNHCR, or that only UNHCR can remove refugee protection. The interpretation and obligations under the Refugees Convention is a matter for State parties to the Convention. (8) Where an application for a further protection visa has been made, it is necessary for decisionmakers to be satisfied afresh that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a convention reason. This assessment includes an assessment of whether the cessation clauses of the Convention apply to all of the claims made by the applicant, at the time of decision. To date, the courts have agreed with the Department’s approach to assessment. The Department has been successful in all eight matters involving applicants for further protection which have proceeded to final court hearing and judgment. Temporary Protection Visas (Question No. 769) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) What is the cost of the reprocessing of Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) claims. (2) Have additional staff been engaged to reprocess TPV claims; if not, would the staff reprocessing TPV claims otherwise have been reallocated to other duties.

(6) Has a report been commissioned to consider the re-settlement conditions and well-being of these people. (7) Can the Minister say how many Afghan returnees under the Government’s reintegration package have left Afghanistan for a neighbouring country; if so, (a) to which countries did they go and (b) is the Australian Government aware of the reasons why they are moving. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) DIMIA financial systems do not allow processing costs of applications for further protection to be disaggregated from the other protection visas processing costs incurred by the Department. (2) Staffing resources have been progressively adjusted to match ongoing community caseloads as well as further protection caseloads, drawing on existing Departmental resources and recruitment as necessary. (3) Sixty seven failed Afghan asylum seekers have returned to Afghanistan since 16 December 2002. (4) The Department does not monitor returnees. Australia has effective processes to protect refugees so they are not sent home in the first place. The people in question have had access to that process and were found not to need protection. Australia does not return anybody who is found to be a refugee to a place of persecution. People who have been found to be refugees are free to leave Australia at any time should they wish to do so and are not obliged to inform the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) of this. DIMIA does not advise clients about safety in returning to their home country.

World Health Organisation Framework (Question No. 785) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 March 2005: (1) Did the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control enter into force generally on 27 February 2005. (2) With which countries has Australia communicated about the Convention since Australia became a party to it on 27 October 2004. (3) What were the dates, subjects and outcomes of the communications with those countries. (1) Yes. (2) Departmental representatives attended the second Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Geneva from 31 January to 4 February 2005. Delegation members interacted formally and informally with a large number of other delegations. A full list of participants at the meeting is available from the House of Representatives Table Office. During the period December 2004 to February 2005, the two months leading up to the second session of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the FCTC, there were a number of informal communications at Departmental level with New Zealand, Canada and Japan. Departmental representatives attended a session of the first meeting of the Pacific Senior Health Officials Network on 26 November 2004. The Network meeting was attended by representatives from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, Tonga and Nauru. (3) The IGWG meeting held in Geneva from 31 January 2005 to 4 February 2005 discussed a number of matters that will be referred to the first FCTC Conference of the Parties (COP), particularly the arrangement for the permanent secretariat and the Rules of Procedure for the COP. Various models for the secretariat were discussed and several principles agreed, including housing of the secretariat within World Health Organization (WHO) and the need for maximum synergy between the secretariat and other WHO programs, especially the Tobacco Free Initiative, to avoid duplication and ensure value for money. There was agreement that the secretariat arrangements need to be reviewed after two years. Many of the draft Rules of Procedure were agreed but some key issues (status of non-Party country observers, involvement by non-governmental organisations, and procedures for consensus decision making) will need to be further considered by the COP. The IGWG also agreed that the COP should follow the financial rules of the World Health Assembly. The meeting also reviewed the terms of reference for a study of actual and potential sources of financial assistance for the implementation of the FCTC. This will be undertaken by the WHO To-",241,Questions In Writing
218,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:bacco Free Initiative as interim secretariat to the COP. The outcomes of this meeting are expected to be available on the World Health Organization website www.who.int/tobacco/framework. While the IGWG meeting inevitably focussed on administrative detail, these discussions played an important role in establishing the necessary infrastructure for the COP to begin consideration of substantive tobacco control issues such as product regulation and cross-border advertising. Informal communications with New Zealand, Canada and Japan during December 2004 and January 2005 included topics such as countries views on the approach to be taken at the upcoming Working Group meeting. These communications provided Australia with an understanding of these countries broad policy position on matters such as the secretariat for the Convention’s Conference of the Parties. The session of Pacific Senior Health Officials Network meeting attended by Departmental representatives on 26 November 2004 discussed various matters on tobacco including the economic impact of tobacco in the region and the FCTC. There was general understanding that through the Network there would be benefit from future exchanges about tobacco policy issues. The Pacific Senior Health Officials Network aims to support the Australian Government’s agenda of public sector capacity building by pooling expertise and skills to meet shared health challenges, create linkages between the Department of Health and Ageing and Health Ministries in the Pacific, facilitate communication and provide opportunities to work together and share best practice. (Question No. 786) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 March 2005: (1) With which countries has the Government communicated about the 1989 Unesco Convention on Technical and Vocational Education. (2) What were the dates, circumstances and results of the communications.
