As You Know, Mr Notices","Thursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3385 Thursday, 6 June 2002 ----Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure of mine which I think encapsulates the problems that a lot of people have had. Mrs Joyce Prowse, from Kingstown Road, Uralla, wrote this letter to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Richard Alston, and I hope that the minister will reply and answer some of her questions: Dear Sir, I wish to acquaint you with the fact that the service Telstra provides the rural area of Kingstown Road Uralla is appallingly inadequate. Our telephone connection is frequently OUT OF ORDER due to inadequate installation of PHONE LINES. In this area the telephone lines lie on top of the ground rendering them easy prey for dislodgement or chewing by cattle, sheep, kangaroos, rabbits and foxes. This area also has the highest incidence of LIGHTNING STRIKES, making it essential that lines be placed UNDERGROUND. Before the sale of TELECOM, digging and relaying was the preferred practise by repair linesmen who took pride in their ability to trace and repair breaks and re-lay wires underground. The so-called restructuring and cost saving methods of TELSTRA removed the portable locally stored digging equipment to NEWCASTLE approximately 250Kms. Away across the mountain ranges. In consequence the linesmen are unable to dig the ground with spades and are forced to leave the lines laying above ground, thereby being easier targets for lightning strikes. I have been struck whilst lying on my bed and both the bedside telephone and electric bedside lamp were blown apart and burnt. HadI been standing on the floor I would have been blown off my feet. The linesman who came to expect stated that the strike was often running along the telephone lines and they would cross into the electricity and that had I been standing on the floor I would have been blown off my feet. The digging equipment should be stored locally so that telephone lines can be placed underground. It takes about a week for a truck to arrive from Newcastle with the necessary tools for repair and relaying. This is absolutely stupidly archaic and far more costly both in terms of manpower fuel and dollars ... There is quite a bit more to the letter but what I have read out highlights some of the problems. This lady goes on to say that her family gave her a mobile phone but they cannot get a signal there; they have to drive 22 kilometres away to get mobile phone reception. It demonstrates the inadequacy of the current Telstra infrastructure, particularly for those who live in remote and country areas. (Time expired) Agriculture: Wool Industry Ms LEY (Farrer) (9.43 a.m.)-Yesterday, 5 June, was ‘Wear Wool Wednesday’. I rise this morning to speak up and speak out for the Australian wool industry. I pay tribute to the farmers who have gone through so many long, lean years following the collapse of the wool floor price, and for the shearers and shed hands whose job is surely one of the hardest there is. I have seen the industry from both sides.

Shearing was recently described as the most physically demanding job there is. Of course, it has to be: dragging a 60-kilogram wether across the board 120 to 220 times a day in a shed where temperatures easily reach 40 degrees Centigrade, bent double, with the noise of the overhead gear loud in your ear, and knowing that if you slow down, so does the money; it is a tough working environment. Australians readily associate with the romance and imagery of the outback shearing shed, but I wonder how many have seen it for themselves. I urge all our city colleagues, if they have not yet visited a shearing shed at shearing time, to avail themselves of this opportunity to see, hear and smell something that is uniquely Australian. And let us not forget the pain that wool growers have experienced. Yesterday my colleague the member for Hume, who has been a tireless advocate for the rights of farmers experiencing ovine Johne’s disease on their properties, spoke again about the plight of these farmers as they battle an enemy that they can scarcely understand. They face quarantine, loss of income and loss of heart. Wool producers have suffered enormously, but wool is a fantastically versatile product. Wool is grown all over the 100,000 square kilometres of my electorate of Farrer, from the high rainfall country in the east to the western lands division in the west. That area is now feeling the effects of an oncoming drought. Earlier yesterday our Minister for Trade spoke about the significant contribution that wool makes, as our ninth largest export earner, to the national income, and mentioned that something like 98 per cent of the wool that we produce is exported. Wool is a fantastic export earning industry. But this only happened because our wool growers hung in there, as they did through 15 tough years of high interest rates, low commodity prices and poor seasons. In the western lands division in the late 1980s, interest rates increased in a ridiculous manner. Banks were simply raising them willy-nilly, sometimes to 27 per cent. My family farm has depended on the wool industry for four generations and I have experienced the highs and lows first hand. I would like today to pay sincere tribute to the wool growers and shearers, whose persistence, faith and heart deserve the highest praise and recognition. Griffith Electorate: Health Services stituents in the southern suburbs of Brisbane is the impact on them personally of the health system, and another issue is the impact on them personally of the proposed increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. I was recently approached, for example, by Mr and Mrs Bernie Smith of Carina, who took me through prescription by prescription the 14 scripts which they currently need between them. This will result in increased money which they will have to pay if the proposed changes to the pharmaceutical system are brought about as a consequence of the announcements in the budget. But it does not stop with pharmaceuticals; it goes on to the availability of bulk-billing. Bulk-billing is another very important, emerging concern in my electorate, and it is for that reason that I would like to bring these concerns to the attention of the Main Committee and the parliament. If we look nationally at the bulk-billing provision, we have seen year by year the decrease in the provision of bulk-billing across Australia. When the Howard government was elected, there was 80 per cent bulk-billing provided across Australia-that is, 80 per cent of all medical services provided by GPs were bulk-billed-and that figure has now declined",105,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (9.46 A.m.),"One of the many issues raised with me by my local conThursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3387 to 75 per cent. In other words, now there are about five million GP services per year not bulkbilled which were bulk-billed five years ago. As a consequence of that, Australians collectively are now paying some $60 million more to visit their doctor than they were, and that is before we take into account what they are paying in addition through the increase in private health insurance premiums. IfI look at my electorate, I see evidence of this over the last several years. In the September quarter of the year 2000, the bulk-billing provision rate within my own electorate was something like 74.3 per cent. That has now decreased to 69.7 per cent in the December quarter 2001. Let us look at what is happening today. My office recently contacted a number of doctors’ surgeries across the electorate and found that the figure is getting worse and worse. In fact, of 39 clinics surveyed, we had 11 with an absolutely clear-cut policy of non bulk-billing. This is causing great concern on the part of my local constituents, who are finding it increasingly difficult to find ready access to a doctor who bulk-bills. Of course, when you go to the causes of this, they are complex. But if there is an overarching cause, it is simply this: there is declining public provision of funding to our national health system. It also lies in part, based on the discussions I have had with my own local doctors, on the increased cost of their own medical indemnity insurance. It is as a consequence of that that they feel in many cases that their ability to bulk-bill becomes more and more difficult. Of course, a cause of all of this is the absence of a fundamental commitment on the part of this government to a universal health care system. We on our side remain committed to the restoration of a fair health care system and a fair society. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Health Services intend to follow on from his comments and ask a question: why is it that sometimes you cannot get a doctor at all? That is the most significant problem I find in my electorate, where it can take up to three weeks to get an appointment to see a doctor. I ask myself: why is that happening? When you ask the doctoring fraternity, the Australian Medical Association say in a very shrill manner, ‘We want more provider numbers.’ That is their solution: they just want more provider numbers. They do not think about what impact that has on the Australian taxpayer. They say, ‘Give us more doctors.’ But that is not the solution because it is not addressing the problem, which is that in metropolitan cities you can get a doctor on every street corner because that is where the doctors want to be. If you add more provider numbers into the system you will just get more doctors in Sydney and Melbourne. That will not benefit regional Australia, in particular my city of Townsville and Thuringowa. I think there is a solution. It is pretty radical and when I announced it recently at home the AMA called me some kind of neo-Nazi or something. That was fairly reactionary. I think we should be looking at the model we use for chemists. With chemists, we license the chemist shops. If we licensed doctors’ surgeries and said that they could only practise in a licensed doctors’ surgery, we would not be telling doctors where they had to practise, we would just be saying that they would have to practise in a licensed surgery. That would result in a proper distribution of doctors across the Commonwealth of Australia. I know the doctors might not like it but they are not addressing the problem as it is now. It is up to the government to be proactive in this regard and to have a look at how we might get a better distribution of doctors across the Commonwealth. There are certainly constitutional",106,Representatives Main Committee
277,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.49 A.m.),"The member for Griffith might be surprised but I3388 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 problems which prevent us from having location specific provider numbers. I know doctors do not want to be told where they are going to practise but we have to do something about it. I too received a letter from one of my constituents who said exactly that: he was a new patient and when he went to a doctor he could not get in for three weeks. When he got in and said, ‘What’s the problem?’ the doctors just said that they could not get sufficient doctors. We can get more doctors around the country but we have to be proactive in having a mechanism which makes sure that there is not a mal-distribution of doctors in the country. That way the people of regional Australia will be properly looked after. Franklin Electorate: Community Workers their often unnoticed and recognised work. At a time when less support is coming from governments it is often left up to these groups to deal with the problems common in Australian society-problems such as youth unemployment, drug abuse, homelessness, the breakdown of families, and crime. Community organisations are providing services and solutions at a micro level within their own communities, doing their part to prevent these problems occurring. To demonstrate the work of such community groups I want to mention some examples from my electorate of Franklin. Jordan River Services is not all that far from my electorate office and comprises a neighbourhood house and family support program. The neighbourhood house provides a variety of educational programs and social functions that result in people gaining self-esteem, confidence and life skills. The programs are accessible and cost neutral and are often the steppingstone for people to enter formal training. The family support program assists families in times of crisis and stress. The service focuses on the family unit at times when it is exposed to risks of breaking down and therefore in need of greatest taxpayer support. There are dedicated staff within both the neighbourhood house and family support programs. The Jordan River Services board of management consists of volunteers from the local community. The ongoing success of this service and others like it is thanks to the volunteers who sacrifice time without expecting accolades. Risdon Vale Primary School and local volunteers run a breakfast club that provides a wholesome breakfast for students twice a week. They also invite guests to sit and talk with the students so that they can gain access to information from people they would not normally meet in day-to-day life. Not all children in Australia have a sit down breakfast with the family. This club offers a nutritional breakfast and the opportunity to mix and mingle with people from various walks of life. The breakfast club has successfully modified the children’s behaviour and is now a model for other schools in my electorate. The Clarendon Vale Social Heart runs a homework group for students. Sadly, many Australian homes are not amenable to homework study. Once a week this group provides a quiet working space for students to complete their homework. Like the breakfast club, the Social Heart also invites guests to challenge and inspire these students. In this place, I wish to thank all those involved for their dedication: you are making a real contribution to our community. We would not operate as successfully as a community without your dedicated support. I salute you in this place.",107,Representatives Main Committee

This is an opportunity available to all members and senators to join a relevant service for a period of a week, to be at the coalface, to be able to mix and match from the very lowest levels of the Australian Defence Force to the very highest levels. It is a fantastic experience. When I went to RAAF Edinburgh, the base commander simply said to all of his people, ‘Treat Peter Lindsay just as you would treat anybody else. Whatever he asks you, tell him-don’t hide anything; speak the truth.’ I came away from Edinburgh thinking what a marvellous group of people we have in our Australian Defence Force. Something I never realised is the management ability that is in the Defence Force. I reckon the way they manage themselves is actually better than in private enterprise-and it goes from corporal upwards. Most people would not think that corporals were managers in the Defence Force; they would think that squadron leaders, wing commanders or whatever were the managers, but it starts from corporal level upwards. They are truly mighty managers and do a fantastic job. RAAF Edinburgh is a particularly important base for the Royal Australian Air Force. It has so many scientific elements, with DSTO, AvMed, aircraft research and development. There are a number of private contractors on base. There are a number of simulators on base. And as to the technology that is there, I just wish the people of Australia could see how technologically advanced we are. Some of the science we do at RAAF Edinburgh leads the world. Last night I was with one of the defence contractors. They were telling me that they are now working very closely with DSTO in commercialising some of the things that we develop here in Australia. That is a win for Defence, because we can make dollars from the commercial entity, developing new science and new projects for Defence, but also it is a win for the country because we turn that into export dollars. We make the things here and export them to all sorts of countries all over the world. In conclusion, I would like to encourage anyone who thinks that they might like to have a career in the Defence Force to go to it. There are some mighty careers available now in all sorts of vocations. And you can go in as a mature age recruit-you do not have to be 18, 19 or 20. the time for members’ statements has concluded.

The opposition supports the amendments. Now 35 years old, the act is due for review and amendment and is unacceptably complex. It contains within it unacceptable compliance costs which are a burden to Australia’s energy companies. Likewise, the opposition agrees that it is unacceptable that the current provisions in the act allow precious and major sources of energy to be locked up for such extensive periods of time-according to the Bills Digest, for up to 26 years. Not long before the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act was enacted, Australia imported 100 per cent of its petroleum, and natural gas was virtually unknown here. Today, petroleum and gas represent Australia’s most valuable commodities, and we are a net exporter of energy. Of course, none of these energy sources which underpin the Australian economy are renewable and, while further discoveries will be made, Australia’s energy reserves will not last forever. The government has an important role to play in ensuring that these reserves are exploited in a way which maximises the benefit to the Australian people, the people who own them. This bill will assist in that process, but much more needs to be done. The President of BP Australasia has made this point. Greg Bourne says that Australia is in an energy policy vacuum. I agree with Greg Bourne. Australia lacks a forward-looking, comprehensive and visionary energy policy. We would not be having the debate about whether gas from the Sunrise field in the Timor Sea should be exported from a floating facility or brought to an onshore facility and also used for domestic gas purposes if we had a comprehensive energy policy in this country. Some would argue that government intervention in the market would cause a flight of capital and leave some of our important reserves unexploited. I think not. These are finite and nonrenewable reserves. Whether they are exploited this year or the year after or in a decade’s time is, in many cases, irrelevant and certainly not the key point. We can rush in, or we can plan. We can plan in a way which maximises the benefits of our natural resources for all Australians. With respect to Sunrise, I am not suggesting for a moment that the exporting of gas from a floating LNG facility is a bad thing for Australia. Indeed, it is a good thing. The million dollar question is whether it is in the national interest, whether it will return a maximum benefit to Australians, and whether exporting from a floating facility is a better proposition for Australia than bringing that gas to an onshore LNG facility and using it for domestic gas. It is good to see the member for Solomon in the Northern Territory here this morning. The Northern Territory has long struggled, in an industrial sense; it has long relied on the Commonwealth to keep its economy humming along. But the Northern Territory would prefer to be self-reliant. It would prefer to be industrialised and in a position to attract major investment, infrastructure and manufacturing to itself. Domestic gas would facilitate that process. I do not believe that the government is doing enough to ensure that the national interest has been focused on with respect to the Sunrise gas fields and I call upon the government to do more. At the end of the day, if it is proven that domestic gas from Sunrise is not commercially viable, I will accept that, as I am sure the opposition will. But we are not convinced that enough has been done or that enough encouragement has been given to joint venture partners in the Sunrise project to look sufficiently closely at the prospect of bringing that gas onshore-and not only for the purposes of the Northern Territory but, because there is some doubt over the PNG gas proposal, for the purposes of fuelling areas like Mount Isa, where considerable amounts can be done in terms of value adding to our product there that cannot be Thursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3391 done without a reasonably priced source of energy. They are the additional things that can be done. This bill is a small step in the right direction but it goes nowhere near far enough. On this occasion, the opposition is happy to give its support to the amendments as proposed in the bill. and I endorse everything that he said. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2002 is a good bill and I support it. It will reduce the number of times a permit can be turned over, and turn-over acreage. The companies involved in the gas market in the Northern Territory are happy with this bill. I am told that the re-evaluation to once in five years will reduce costs for those companies. This week, the energy market review, headed by Warwick Parer, met in Darwin and looked at a number of things in the Territory. There is a great need for energy in the Territory. The Macarthur River project will require 25 petajoules of gas. The Nabalco project will require 40 petajoules of gas. A government department, the power and water authority, requires 20 petajoules of gas. There are two projects at Batchelor-Compass and the magnesium projectwhich will require between three and five petajoules of gas per annum. The speculative Pechinet project, which is an aluminium smelter, will require around 150 petajoules of gas. This is a lot of gas, Mr Deputy Speaker; we have a great need for onshore gas in the Northern Territory. Currently, the Timor Sea Bayu-Undan project is being developed by Phillips. That is being piped onshore into Darwin, where it will be liquefied and it will then supply Japanese markets. None of that gas from the Bayu-Undan project will come onshore to service the needs that I have just mentioned. In the Territory, we are looking at the Greater Sunrise Troubadour project to deliver the gas that we require for our energy needs. Currently Shell, the major developer of that project, are saying that that will not be possible; that they want to build a floating platform to convert the gas to liquids in order to supply US markets. They say that this would be $2 billion cheaper than bringing the gas onshore. My sources tell me that this differential of $2.1 billion is all based around the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin. Our argument in the Northern Territory is that this gas will be used for domestic purposes and there is no need to transform the gas into liquids. Of course, gas is transported in liquid form. It is brought onshore, turned into liquid, put into containers and carted around the world. If we are using it for domestic purposes, there is no need to liquefy it; it can stay in gas form and be transported around the country. I welcome the announcement in the budget regarding the capped life of gas plants and pipelines. That has been welcomed in the Northern Territory. Of course, there are other smaller fields that can be developed-Blacktip, Petrel and Tern-but these are marginal, to say the least, and no definite times have been put on them.

The member for Hunter suggested there was a vacuum in energy policy. Maybe he is not aware of the Parer review. This is the energy market directions review, which I am sure will give significant direction in this area of policy. I am sure ex-Senator Parer and his team are going to give us very sound advice on where we should move ahead in this sector. The member for Hunter raised the issue of Sunrise gas and suggested the government was not doing enough in this forum. I congratulate the member for Solomon for his contribution and his very strong commitment to the gas industry and I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter that in the member for Solomon we have a very strong proponent for encouraging the Sunrise gas to come onshore in Darwin. In a recent visit there I had the opportunity of meeting with Phillips and other groups and I also expressed a very strong interest. However, at the end of the day it is a commercial decision. We can certainly express a strong desire to have it brought onshore. We are very much aware of the benefits of that. Hopefully, at the end of the day that may well prevail. I can assure the member for Hunter that both the member for Solomon and I, and others in government, are very actively encouraging that to be considered. Both the policy amendments in the bill are economically desirable developments. The reduction in the maximum number of renewals of a petroleum exploration permit will prevent exploration acreage from being tied up for long periods. This reform will therefore encourage increased exploration for petroleum in Australia’s marine jurisdiction. The other policy amendment in the bill is to reduce the number of times the holder of a retention lease can be required to re-evaluate the commerciality of the discovery. This change will reduce potential compliance costs for the industry. With these amendments, we can say that Australia’s main offshore petroleum legislation is made compliant with national competition policy principles. As I mentioned when introducing the bill, the government’s focus has now turned to reviewing the presentational aspects of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. The government expects to introduce a rewritten act for the parliament’s consideration later this year. I thank honourable members for their support for the bill and I commend the bill to the House.

286,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (10.14 A.m.),"The New Business Tax System (Imputation) BillThursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3393 Aside from the general principles underpinning the bill, I want to address two important related issues. The first is this government’s contempt for proper parliamentary processes. The first draft of the bill was released in late 2000. Then we heard nothing. The bills were not contained in the forward programs for this winter session of the parliament. Then the bills were introduced last Thursday, 30 May, and here we are debating them today, 6 June, seven days later. The government knew that the bills were to come into effect on 1 July 2002. The government’s inability to manage a program of legislation led to its failure to bring on the legislation during the last six parliamentary sitting weeks. This is an unrealistic timetable for the scrutiny of the legislation. The Labor Party finds it unsatisfactory; nonetheless, and despite the short time available, we are doing our best to make possible the passage of the legislation. I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is in the chamber, and the government to get their tax and economic legislation program together. Yesterday, we had an abuse of the parliament. On a day on which interest rates rose, the Treasurer would not face the MPI in the House of Representatives. He left it to a National Party reject to do so. Billy Hughes always said that he would join any party but the Country Party. The parliamentary secretary was tossed out of the National Party. That is how badly he was doing. And he was left to answer the MPI yesterday: the Treasurer would not face up in the chamber to the vital matter of monetary policy. anything to do with the bill. The member for Werriwa will come back to the bill. level doing nothing for two years was introduced into the parliament last Thursday, and here we are debating it today, just seven days later, without a proper opportunity for honourable members to scrutinise this detailed legislation. I note once more that it is not the Treasurer who is here to carry the legislation; it is a parliamentary secretary who has responsibilities outside the Treasury portfolio. The second issue related to this bill is the revenue neutrality of business tax reform. The explanatory memorandum contains the bland statement that it has no revenue implications. That may well be, although the government’s recent record of costing accuracy is not at all impressive. More broadly, the Labor Party is concerned that the government is walking away from its commitment that business tax reform should be revenue neutral. The Leader of the Opposition made this clear in his letter to the Treasurer agreeing to the business tax reform package. He said: Labor is willing to pass the business tax package if it pays for itself. Labor will hold the Government to its promise on revenue neutrality. We cannot accept a reduction in business taxation at the expense of individuals and families who will bear the brunt of a GST, or the use of a Budget surplus to fund business tax reforms. The opposition’s position has not changed. We will continue to scrutinise the government’s proposals for business tax reform on that basis. Business tax reform should not compromise the revenue of the Commonwealth. This condition does not apply only to the proposals the government chooses to designate as new business tax system measures; the stated purpose of the government’s reform was to achieve greater neutrality of tax treatment between sectors by replacing special concessions",112,Representatives Main Committee

288,Mr Latham,"Now we have the abuse in this process where a bill that sat there at draft3394 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 offered to particular companies and projects with a lower corporate tax rate. I have said before that there is a difference between the opposition being pro market and the way in which the government regards itself as pro business. In this case, the distinction is between the opposition, which wants what is good for all Australian businesses, and the government, which wants what is good for particular business interests, those interests that are close to the Liberal Party for a variety of reasons. The opposition supports Australian businesses which want only to benefit from their own enterprise and the lower corporate tax rate. We do not support particular business interests who want the lower rate and still continue to stroll around the corridors of this place seeking to retain their special concessions and special deals. The bill has four key aspects: a flexible franking and new antistreaming rule, permission for private companies to frank retrospectively, a simpler franking account structure and, finally, consistent treatment of franked dividends received by entities. The proposed new antistreaming rule also involves some simplification as to requirements that all distributions of dividends made within any franking period-that is, generally within six months-be franked to the same extent and that the ATO be notified if the level of franking varies between franking periods by more than an amount of 20 per cent. This notification provision replaces an earlier proposal for penalties to apply automatically to such franking variations. This obviously involves a loosening of the rules, and thereby potentially costs revenue. We are surprised to see that this particular provision is uncosted in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Under the permission for private companies to frank retrospectively, companies will be allowed to frank dividends up to four months after the declaration date so that they can finalise their financial position before finalising their franking amount. This will make compliance with the antistreaming rules easier. Importantly, it also normalises what is a fairly widespread practice at the moment. The simpler franking account structure provisions allow a corporate tax entity to align its franking year with its income year and to maintain its franking account on a tax paid basis. This in turn should reduce the need for complex conversions to accommodate changes in the company tax rate or for the maintenance of different classes of franking accounts. This appears to be a genuine simplification, one that the opposition welcomes. The new consistent treatment of franked dividends received by entities will remove the present distinction between companies that receive an intercorporate dividend rebate for franked dividends and individuals and other entities that apply a gross-up and credit imputation. This is a technical simplification which provides for greater integrity and consistency at law. Again, it is something that the opposition welcomes. Finally, some provisions in the bills are shifted from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, achieving further simplification. The opposition thinks the parliament deserves better than to have complex measures such as this dumped on it at a week’s notice. We deserve better than having a spokesperson on the government side who has no direct responsibility within the Treasury portfolio. That said, and our grievances having been noted by the chamber, we support the principle of revenue neutral changes for a simpler tax system for business, and accordingly we support the bill. stration) (10.21 a.m.)-in reply-At this stage I usually thank honourable members for their contributions.

289,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiThursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3395 the period he has been given to look at these bills has not been adequate. These are bills which are very positive. The opposition did agree for those bills to be brought here to the non-contentious chamber and I do thank the opposition for their support on this occasion. I do think, however, that the government has nothing to apologise for over the time frame because these are important bills. The opposition has had the opportunity to scrutinise them and the scrutiny of those bills has seen the member for Werriwa, representing the opposition, come into the chamber to back these important changes by the government. I would also, of course, like to welcome the honourable member for Werriwa back to the parliament. In the debate on the superannuation legislation yesterday he was supposed to lead the opposition debate but he was elbowed aside by the member for Fraser, who is currently shadow Treasurer-I suspect it will not be too long before we see the honourable member for Werriwa in that position. The member for Werriwa spat the dummy and refused to participate in the debate. So it is nice to see the member for Werriwa return to parliament and return to his responsibilities. We were starting to wonder whether indeed the member for Werriwa was going to run away from debates in relation to financial matters in the parliament. As I pointed out earlier, we are considering three bills: the New Business Tax System (Imputation) Bill 2002, the New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Bill 2002, and the New Business Tax System (Over-franking Tax) Bill 2002. These bills are a package of measures which are designed to introduce a new, simplified imputation system to replace the current imputation system. The first bill, the New Business Tax System (Imputation) Bill 2002, contains the core imputation provisions as they apply to companies and their shareholders. The measures form part of the government response to the review of business tax recommendations to reform the imputation system and simplify the franking process for corporate entities. The measures will apply from 1 July this year and simplify the mechanics of the current system. That said, the new provisions will broadly maintain the same outcome as the current system and will not impact on the tax treatment of dividends received by individuals. Simplification of the franking process will result in reduced compliance costs for all stakeholders as the simpler rules will be easier to understand and apply. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that the measures give more flexibility for entities’ franking dividends and will enable them to provide more certainty to members about their likely franking policies in relation to future dividends. Most importantly, we ought to recognise that this measure has been developed in consultation with representatives of the tax profession, and business has indicated that it also supports these measures. The New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Bill 2002 is another one of the package of three bills, and measures contained in this particular bill provide a mechanism to ensure corporate tax entities make good any over-imputation of franking credits on distributions to members. The third bill, the New Business Tax System (Over-franking Tax) Bill, contains measures which impose over-franking tax where distributions are franked to a greater extent than the maximum allowed. The member for Werriwa referred to revenue implications of these particular bills and I am pleased to reassure the honourable member that the new imputation system will have no impact on government revenue. The member for Werriwa will no doubt be pleased to see that this is in fact the case. The member for Werriwa also referred to the fact that I addressed the 3396 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 matter of public importance on behalf of the government yesterday, as indeed I did on the day before. I pointed out in the MPI debate yesterday that apparently the member for Werriwa submitted the MPI proposal yesterday and on the day before but the member for Fraser, who is feeling quite insecure these days, essentially pushed the member for Werriwa aside and said that he was going to maintain the debate, and the member for Werriwa failed to participate in either of those debates on the matters of public importance. It is a bit, shall we say, facile for the member for Werriwa to criticise the fact that, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, I am addressing these matters on behalf of the government when, as the shadow minister for the opposition, the member for Werriwa simply was nowhere to be seen. He just ran away from parliament. It is reassuring that the Leader of the Opposition or perhaps someone else has spoken to the member for Werriwa and he has now decided that enough is enough and he ought to participate once again. The differences between the member for Werriwa and the honourable member for Fraser go very deeply in relation to a range of economic issues. The issue of the day is, of course, how long the opposition can sustain itself as a viable force. The interesting point is that the Leader of the Opposition might well be replaced by the honourable member for Brand, his predecessor, and the member for Werriwa and the shadow Treasurer are having some important differences on economic policy. rupt a speaker but I would ask that you bring the parliamentary secretary back to the bills at hand, and not let him continue with the discussion about the potential change of roles of the member for Werriwa and the member for Fraser. important bills and it is interesting that the member for Werriwa has decided to participate. It is interesting that on this occasion the member for Fraser has not chopped the member for Werriwa out of this particular debate.

In so doing, I note the presence of the Attorney-General and the fact that invariably he makes an effort, where possible, to attend this chamber-unlike the instance in respect of the previous bills. The Statute Law Revision Bill is accurately described as one which is of a technical nature. It continues the important exercise of correcting errors in the statute book on a regular basis. That was originally begun by the Attorney-General in 1981. The bill rectifies 20 principal acts and 23 amending acts. The government has quite properly undertaken that the bill does not alter the law in a substantive way, and for that the opposition are grateful. We, too, have done our revision of the wording of this bill and are satisfied that it does not make substantive changes but corrects errors-typographical errors and the like. For instance, the bill updates a reference in several acts to the Standards Association of Australia, which changed its name to Standards Australia International Ltd when it incorporated in 1999. Another notable change is to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which incorrectly referred to the Framework Convention on Climate Change as ‘done in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992’. It was of course the Convention on Biological Diversity that was open for signature at Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992. The climate change convention was done in New York on 9 May 1992. We are quite satisfied that that was an innocent mistake, but never let it be said that in terms of the environment all treaties look the same to the Howard government. On the other hand, I must confess that a previous Labor government bears the blame for missing out a relevant ‘l’ at an appropriate time in the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. Hence, the legislation in section 53(2) refers to the ‘Australian Pubic Service’. We must take",116,Representatives Main Committee
295,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.32 A.m.),"I will be quite brief in giving the opposition’s3398 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 responsibility for that. I am advised by my adviser that an electronic search of that term brings up substantially different web sites from the phrase ‘Public Service’. Certainly we do live in an age where there is growing public access to the laws. The development of information technology and the imagination and hard work of organisations such as AustLII have transformed the statute book from a set of dusty volumes strewn around a lawyer’s cramped office to a public database accessible through any computer connected to the Internet. I note that those responsible for maintaining SCALEplus, the web site in the Attorney-General’s Department, have recently said that they hope later this year to achieve legislative backing to make SCALEplus the first authoritative store place of Commonwealth legislation in electronic form. The opposition would support legislation to that effect. These developments make the decision in 1981 to begin a regular process of statute law revision more far-sighted than perhaps the then Attorney-General could have foreseen. As even more people without any legal training consult the statutes, the task of statute law revision becomes more important. It is hard enough to make sense of the law without having to contend with drafting errors. While I suspect many in the community are wondering whether it is too much to hope for any government to be tidy and well constructed, they at least are entitled to expect, as far as possible, that the statute books will be in order. We commend the government for continuing the process which began over two decades ago on a regular basis, and the opposition fully support these measures. by the then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. Peter Durack, in introducing the first bill of this type were these: The Government has decided to introduce Statute Law Revision Bills into the Parliament on a regular basis, at least once in each year and, if required, once in each sitting. This will enable the prompt correction of mistakes and errors and removal from the statute book of expired laws. In the absence of the regular passage of Bills of this kind, the correction of an error in an Act can only be achieved by having a special Bill passed for that purpose or waiting until the Act needs to be amended for some other more important purpose. The then shadow Attorney-General, one Senator Gareth Evans, said: The Statute Law Revision Bill is a fascinating Bill, for the contents of which the Government is to be much congratulated. ... The first innovation is the very existence of the Bill as a vehicle-a compendious vehicle-for tidying up oversights, errors and oddities that creep into even the best laid drafting plans and also to accommodate minor changes that become necessary because of changing circumstances. The Opposition notes that it is the Government’s intention to introduce housekeeping Bills of this kind at least once each year, and perhaps every sitting. I, for one, certainly applaud that as a rational legislative measure aiding in the avoidance of the unnecessary cluttering of the parliamentary process with what are on any view small issues most of the time. The bill that is before us has two schedules. Schedule1 amends errors in 20 principal acts, and schedule 2 amends misdescriptions in 23 amending acts. The commencement date of each item is tied to the commencement of the provision that created the error, and the effect of this process is that the error is taken to have been corrected immediately after it was made. According to the explanatory memorandum, none of the amendments proposed by either schedule will alter the content of the law.

These are the nature of the errors, omissions, misspellings and such things that happen in the passage of legislation. I commend the bill to the House. members for Barton and Mackellar for their contributions to this debate. It seems to have aroused no contention whatever. The Statute Law Revision Bill 2002, as has been pointed out, is to correct minor errors in existing acts. It is the second Statute Law Revision Bill under this government. The first was in 1996. The expectation that there should be an annual bill or a bill every sitting has not been realised, perhaps because the number of errors and mistakes that need to be corrected is not as great as was first thought. The corrections will improve the statute book in a number of ways. Spelling, numbering, lettering and punctuation errors will be corrected. The quality of the text of some acts will be improved, making the law more accessible. With misdescribed amendments corrected, clearer consolidations will be able to be prepared in order to avoid confusion to users. Apart from correcting mistakes, the bill also updates references to organisations. The member for Barton gave the instance of what is now known as Standards Australia International Limited. There are no policy changes. No amendment will result in any change to the substance of the law. The bill should be well received by those with a passion for the correct placement of commas, quotations and parentheses. In fact, there will probably be shouting in the streets and bells will be rung. The managing director of SBS will have particular interest in this bill.

Throsby Electorate: Paid Maternity Leave Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (10.43 a.m.)-I take this opportunity to say a few words about a very important issue for working women in my electorate of Throsby-the long overdue need to enshrine in this country access to paid maternity leave for all working women. Historically, women in the public service areas such as my own, in teaching, in nursing, and in the state and public sectors have had access to paid maternity leave but the overwhelming majority of women have been behind the eight ball. Less than a third of women who currently work have any form of paid maternity leave. When I talk to women in my electorate, particularly younger women who are embarking on home ownership for the first time and are thinking about having families, they often say to me that there is a real problem: the cost of having children is becoming increasingly a burden on working class families. I think the lack of access to paid maternity leave is one of the factors that is reflected in Australia’s declining birth rate.

298,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (10.43 A.m.),"I move:3400 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 cant reason-that there is this decided lack of balance between work and family life. A lot of women who want to be mothers are paying a heavy price in making that judgment about how best to balance their desire to have a family with their need to continue to work to supplement the family income. I want to say something about the declining birth rate because it is an issue for the whole nation. We have now got a birth rate of 1.7 babies born per woman on average in the year 2000-a marked decline from 3½ babies in the early sixties. Looking at the news clips yesterday, I noticed that the ABS in its recent social analysis of the nation projected that the 1.7 figure may well drop very shortly to 1.3. So it is an issue of major national importance and it is an issue that affects the quality of life of many working women. One of the problems we have had is that maternity leave, where it has been introduced as a result of industrial negotiation, has usually been in workplaces that are heavily unionised. But women in my electorate, many of whom work in the retail and hospitality area, in shops, cafes and factories, because they do not have the industrial bargaining power to have paid maternity leave as part of their enterprise agreements, are reliant on people here in Canberra understanding their predicament and forcing the issue onto the national agenda. I commend Pru Goward, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, on her wonderful research. I think her document is well worth studying. She has not come down in favour of one specific form of paid maternity leave-there are a number of options based on overseas experiencebut she clearly says that Australia is really dragging the chain on the international stage. Only Australia and the United States of America currently do not meet the ILO convention provision which is for a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave. We are a very wealthy and affluent nation, yet when you look at the scorecard, a lot of developing countries have done the right thing and, as I say, only Australia and the United States still trail behind the rest of the world. I am very pleased that my party has committed itself to the introduction of paid maternity leave, recognising, of course, that it could potentially be a disincentive to the small business sector. While we have not worked out the details of the model that we would introduce, nevertheless we are saying that it is a national issue of importance; we will do our homework and make sure that we introduce a scheme but one that does not act as a disincentive to the employment of women in the small business sector. In that regard, I express my concern about statements recently made by Senator Minchin, describing paid maternity leave as ‘middle-class welfare’ and my disappointment that in question time on Monday both the Treasurer and the employment minister evaded the question about their views and what they would do. In conclusion, it is an issue of great concern and I am pleased that my party is committed to it. (Time expired) State and Local Government: Cost Shifting year, I raised the issue of cost shifting that has occurred between state and local government. I raised the fact that many councils are facing a financial battle because many of them are being forced to provide services that were previously the responsibility of state government but they have not been compensated for providing that service.

299,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.48 A.m.),"In my first speech to the parliament earlier thisThursday, 6 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 3401 ment has announced an inquiry into the financial position of local governments in this country. It follows an election promise to review the incidence of cost shifting from state to local government and to revisit the issues surrounding constitutional recognition of local government. The evidence of cost shifting has been placed on the public record before. This evidence came to light in the review by the Commonwealth Grants Commission of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. Submissions to that review gave examples of how this cost shifting is occurring and how councils have been hit with increased obligations and compliance costs under state legislation. Take for example the fact that laws have been passed in New South Wales that require councils to take responsibility for reducing pollution in catchments and waterways. When it comes to littering laws, these have been upheld by health officers of councils, but the laws are actually set by the state governments. There are examples of councils paying to keep doctors in their towns, paying for health and welfare services, and paying for extra security on their streets because state governments are not doing their job and opening more 24-hour police stations. This is despite the fact that the state governments still receive substantial funding from the Commonwealth of $50 billion each year. The Commonwealth Grants Commission found that state assistance given to local government had actually decreased from 15 per cent in 1974-75 to seven per cent in 1997-98. In comparison, the Commonwealth has increased funding from 10.5 per cent in 1974-75 to 12 per cent in 1997-98. These are exactly the issues that need to be addressed by this inquiry. It involves the question which I raised in my first speech in this parliament and that is this: do our structures of government provide us with an efficient distribution of services? The duplication and overlapping of responsibilities between governments is a constant frustration to our communities. The bureaucratic red tape that comes with three levels of government leads one to suggest that we need to clearly define the responsibilities of local government under our Constitution. I will also mention that it was a Labor government that undermined the effectiveness of local government by stifling innovation, by seeking to impose new layers of regional bureaucracy. It was Labor that set up the many regional development organisations, in competition with long established local groups, and duplicated the capacity of local government organisations. I took the new Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, to meet with local councils in my electorate, which all gave their support to such an inquiry. These councils are struggling to pay for the roads that are a shared responsibility with state governments-roads such as the Bucketts Way, Lakes Way and Medowie Road-and they included Port Stephens Council, Dungog Council, Gloucester Council and Great Lakes Council. All of them were receptive to the idea of an inquiry such as this, and I will be encouraging those councils to make a submission. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration will examine local government’s current roles and responsibilities; the current funding arrangements for local government; the capacity of local government to meet existing obligations to take on an enhanced role in developing opportunities at a regional level; local government expenditure and the impact on local government financial capacity as a result of changes in powers, functions and responsibilities between state and local governments; and the scope for achieving a rationalisation of roles and responsibilities between the levels of 3402 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 government, better use of resources and better quality services to our local communities. This will make for a very interesting inquiry, and I will be encouraging all of the councils in my area to participate, because they deserve a fair go and a fair distribution of resources and finances. At the end of the day, one of the main responsibilities of government is to provide services to their local communities and so I hope that, as a result of this inquiry, local councils will be given the recognition they truly deserve. I hope that it will help to define the role of local councils and that it will draw attention to the problems in cost shifting from the states, while providing some solutions as to how local government can be better supported. Health: Pharmaceuticals cal technology have been at the forefront of public interest and concern. There is much confusion in the minds of the general public-and, dare I say it, in the minds of the ministers of this government, who seemed generally confounded by the implications of the new technologies. For instance, in the budget, the Treasurer quite ridiculously tried to justify his attack on the disabled, the sick and the elderly by claiming that the overall cost of drugs would grow exponentially. He thereby underlined his failure to understand the nature of the changes that are currently under way in the development of new medicines. It is true that the current prices of these complex drugs are very high. Developing new drugs has been an expensive exercise and, to recover costs, the companies charge higher prices for their products. For example, in the year 2000, while the pharmaceutical industry spent $US30 billion on research and development, only 30 new drugs were approved. The drug development process is expensive, in large measure because of the need to do very extensive tests before a new drug is released. No-one wants a thalidomide disaster. The development of new drugs has until now been a hit and miss affair, with only 10 per cent of candidates reaching the market. While biochemists have a good understanding of the way in which drugs work in the body, even now a scatter-gun approach is often used in searching for substances with useful characteristics. For example, researchers have for years scoured the traditional pharmacopoeias for plant and animal extracts with novel properties. Once a substance is found, the chemical constituents are isolated and tested for activity against a pathogen or for effectiveness in treating a particular disease. Derivatives of the original substance may be produced by chemical modification, and these variants are also tested for activity and side effects. Developing new drugs using these methods is of course very expensive, time consuming and can still occasionally result in a drug being released with serious unintended side effects. The Treasurer is not the only person concerned about these matters. The pharmaceutical companies recognise that unless better methods for identifying new drugs are developed quickly their future looks bleak, not least because people like the Treasurer are restricting their sales by pushing up the price of their products. We have all heard of the human genome project, now virtually complete. The purpose of that project was to read the genetic code that our cells use to construct the proteins that form the structures and run the biochemical machinery of our bodies. While the text of the human genome has now been described, much remains to be done to understand the nature of the instructions that that code contains. Scientists are now elucidating the details of the proteome, the set of protein molecules that our cells produce in response to the operating instructions issued by the genome. The instructions issued by the genome are in turn influenced by various",120,Representatives Main Committee

It is the characterisation of the proteome produced in response to drugs that has the potential to provide relief from the Treasurer’s nightmare of ever growing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme costs. What researchers are now starting to do, using these new methods, is to understand how a drug interacts with the whole system rather than isolated organs or tissues. Side effects are far easier to identify and the effects of the intended target of the drug in question are also much easier to determine. Incidentally, the term ‘proteome’ was coined by an Australian researcher, Marc R. Williams, the head of bioinformatics at Proteome Systems in Sydney in 1994. Finally, perhaps if the Treasurer were to expend more effort on trying to understand these key developments in the pharmaceutical industry, he would be able to produce a budget that did not rely on attacking the benefits of the most disadvantaged members of our community. Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict day. In particular, I wish to express my strongest condemnation for the suicide bombing in Megiddo which occurred overnight Australian time, yesterday morning Israeli time. What occurred was that a suicide bomber drove a car into a bus in Megiddo. Megiddo is on the plains of Armageddon; and the bombing occurred on the 35th anniversary of key events within the Middle East. I wish to express my unequivocal, absolute and total condemnation of suicide bombing in any form in any place. I particularly wish to condemn this bombing which has occurred at a sensitive time in the peace process. More broadly, I want to make a statement condemning two things. The first is the general notion of the use of terror against the population. This has been used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and has occurred with either the consent or the failure to act of certain members of the Palestinian leadership. That, I think, is a critical failure which has to be acknowledged and condemned. A second element I wish to condemn absolutely and outrightly is the systematic training of children, from an early age, in hatred and in disaffection towards those who are simply of another belief, persuasion or tribe. They are trained in such a way as to develop a disregard for their own lives and a disregard for others. That systematic abuse and training of children can only occur with the consent and knowledge of the leadership. SoI call on Chairman Arafat of the Palestinian Authority to stop this systematic training and to take every step in his capacity and within the capacity of the Palestinian Authority to safeguard the people of Israel and to reduce the level of hatred. Not long ago, the then Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, and Chairman Arafat met at Camp David during the later stages of the Clinton presidency. An offer was made, which was a genuine offer, to try to establish peace in the Middle East. That offer was rejected by Chairman Arafat and it has contributed to the subsequent calamity within the Middle East. I and the Australian government believe that there are three key steps which must be taken. The first is for both parties to contribute to a cease-fire. That means actions by Israel and actions by not only the Palestinian Authority but those groups which operate either with tacit support or due to inaction by the Palestinian Authority. The second action is the ending of terrorism, immediately, absolutely and without any equivocation whatsoever. The third action was outlined in an article in the Age on Saturday, 13 April 2002 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs:",122,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.58 A.m.),"I rise in response to events in the Middle East yester3404 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 June 2002 ... the Israelis must withdraw from Palestinian-controlled areas. Only then can the vision endorsed again in recent days by the United Nations Security Council of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secure and recognised borders be realised. That quote comes from the foreign minister and sets out the Australian position. I want to reaffirm my support for the notion that there is a democratic state of Israel which has a right to exist and that at the same time there is a future for the Palestinian people. If there is a cease-fire, there must be continued incentives to create peace, and that means that it has to address the circumstances of people within both countries. That is why the Australian government has a significant aid program to help establish long-term peace. It takes a number of actions, and all up it contributes approximately $11.9 million to Middle East aid, aimed primarily at establishing the conditions for peace and developing a harmonious society for Palestinian people. These activities include preschool. They work towards the elimination of domestic violence and towards development of food security. That is the Australian government position. It is about establishing the conditions for peace, ending the terror, protecting the democratic state of Israel and also providing incentives and hope for the people of Palestine so they can move beyond the cycle of violence to a condition where people on both sides live together in harmony. (Time expired) Tasmania: Settlement Scullin comes from the other chamber. The date of 12 September 1803 is a very special day in Tasmania’s history. It was the day when Lieutenant Collins settled in Risdon Cove. I will resume my speech later. I hand over to the Deputy Speaker. Scullin Electorate: Medicare Office Scullin Electorate: Janefield is one of the dangers of having two chambers going at the same time. The role of members is to be a legislator, representative, advocate, lobbyist and simply a champion for the community he or she represents. In that context I wish to raise two matters of importance to my constituency. The first is the continuing need for a Medicare office in the western area of my electorate in the southern suburbs of the city of Whittlesea. I was first involved in raising this issue back in 1986. Since then, governments of different political hues have not satisfied the community’s aspirations on this issue. The justification for not opening an office in the growth end of my electorate was that there was an office in Reservoir. In 1997, this government’s decision to close the nearest office in Reservoir exacerbated the problem and motivated 3,000 residents to petition the House for the establishment of an office in the suburb of Epping. The government’s justification for closing down the Reservoir Medicare office was that pharmacy based Easyclaim outlets would be established. At the time, no outlet was established, and that remains the position at the moment. Residents are still travelling up to 10 kilometres to the nearest office to lodge their Medicare claim and receive cash refunds. The demand and need expressed by residents for an office closer to their home is greater than that first expressed 15 years ago, and it will only get greater with the forecast population estimated",123,Representatives Main Committee

I call upon the Health Insurance Commission and the government to reconsider that decision and open a Medicare office to properly serve the people living in suburbs such as Epping, Thomastown, Lalor and Mill Park. The second issue which I wish to raise is the future development of the Janefield land. Janefield was a former-in the quaint terms of the time-‘colony’ for people with intellectual disabilities. As part of the Building Better Cities program, that institution was closed and people were put out into the community. This then left the opportunity for the further development of that land. At first it was considered that perhaps it had residential opportunities, but over time it was decided that that land should be considered for the employment opportunities that it represented. I raised this matter earlier in this year and, as a result of my remarks in parliament in March, I have now been informed by RMIT that they have decided to cease efforts and activities to develop and implement RMIT Technology Estate as a separate facility on the Janefield site. They did this late last year. I can only say that this decision was made without fanfare-no consultation with the local community or authorities. This is in sharp contrast to the manner in which the university announced the original decision to commence the development. The development would have allowed for some high technology types of employment in biotechnology, the automotive industry and the like. It was exciting because it would have given a range of employment opportunities that do not exist. Based on this advice now, I will be seeking further discussions with RMIT to emphasise the need for the wide range of employment opportunities in the local region that this project would have enabled. I will also be looking for assistance from the local community in further discussing the possibilities. I will be writing to the ministers for industry at both federal and state level to seek their assistance. The Janefield development is too important an opportunity to be allowed to fail. If RMIT are not going to go through with their commitments, a further developer must be found, preferably public-a developer that can realise the commercial and industrial potential of the project, while at the same time fulfilling the undoubted potential community benefits that the proper development of the Janefield site could achieve. Environment: World Environment Day World Environment Day. World Environment Day on 5 June is a reminder of the shared responsibility we have for helping our environment-and, as the recent state of the environment report says, ‘the environment is everybody’s business’. It is possible to feel overwhelmed by the environmental issues we face, but in many cases we can act as individuals to make a difference. Every positive action, no matter how small it may seem, is very important. In Australia, the focus for World Environment Day 2002 is on what each one of us can do to protect Australia’s unique environment by ensuring the way we live is sustainable. Tens of thousands of Australians are already working in community based groups to protect and conserve their local environment, with the help of the Howard government’s $2.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust. Many businesses and governments are also implementing measures to use resources more efficiently, to reduce waste and to integrate environmental considerations into their operations. The United Nations General Assembly established World Environment Day 20 years ago at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment.

In 2002, the Commonwealth government’s Natural Heritage Trust and Cadbury Yowie are again joining forces to offer primary school children a great opportunity to help Australia’s threatened species. Under the Hands on for Habitat Awards 2002, children research their favourite threatened species, answer questions and draw their chosen species in its native habitat using an array of fact sheets, posters and CD-Roms provided in the free resource kit which has been sent to the various primary schools. I have written to all of the primary schools in my electorate of Makin, encouraging them to get involved in this fantastic event. The Para Hills West Primary School has already established a marvellous record of achievement in relation to environmental awareness and activities. Encouraged by their teacher-librarian Stephanie Spurrier, the students of Para Hills West Primary School have been actively involved in Trees for Life, Murraylinks, Waterwatch and tree planting projects in their community. I had the very great pleasure of meeting Stephanie in May to congratulate her on winning a 2002 Commonwealth government Australian Teachers Prize for Excellence. Stephanie is a fine example not only to the students at Para Hills West Primary School but also to other staff and parents in our community. It is important for young people to realise that they can do something to help protect and improve their environment. Too often we hear the doom and gloom side of the debate, which can sometimes lead young people to believe that all is lost and that nothing can be done. The recent federal budget allocated further vital resources to projects to deal with the serious salinity problems throughout the country, and the mighty Murray is to be rejuvenated as a result. Animal conservation programs within my home state of South Australia, such as the program to protect the Cape Barren geese, have been highly successful and further such programs are achieving equally successful results. To the many thousands of volunteers involved in Natural Heritage Trust projects around the country, I say thank you. Just like the students and teachers at Para Hills West Primary School, you are helping to make Australia the environmental envy of the world. Flinders Electorate: Community Prison the Victorian government’s plans for a community prison in either Carrum Downs or Cranbourne on the boundary of my electorate. This notion of a community prison is, I believe, illfounded, inappropriate, improper and utterly unworkable. I express my absolute opposition to it, and I join with my state colleagues-Gary Rowe, the member for Cranbourne, and Andrea McCall, the member for Frankston-and my federal colleague Bruce Billson, the member for Dunkley, in setting out our clear, absolute and unequivocal opposition to any plan whatsoever for a community prison within the towns of either Carrum Downs or Cranbourne. The local Victorian government representative in the area, Mr Matt Viney, set out a position that it would be acceptable because, if there were an escape, escapees would not stay around in the community. This to me is an extraordinary position and one which shows (a) a contempt for the people and (b) a complete misunderstanding of what is important in terms of security-both actual security and the perception of security.

The time allowed for the debateThe following answers to questions were circulated: Trade: United States (Question No. 345) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) Does the Government accept that whilst the administration of President Bush pays lip service to free trade, the steel tariffs represent the beginning of what seems to be a strategy to protect US jobs to the detriment of Australian workers and their families. (2) Since the decision to impose a 30% tariff on some steel products, is he able to say (a) what the US Administration has done on tariffs with respect to Canadian lumber and (b) whether the Congress is considering a Bill to give US farmers an extra $US172 billion ($A332 billion) over the next decade. (3) If the US Administration grants the extra $US172 million to US farmers, does the Government accept this activity may serve to drive global farm prices lower, which will potentially have a deleterious effect on Australian and other producers. (4) Is he able to say whether US oil refiners have asked President Bush to impose tariffs to protect them from gasoline imported at lower costs. (5) With these developments in mind, does the Government accept that the US Administration may lose the high moral ground needed to prod countries to open their markets. (1) No. (2) (a) The US made final anti-dumping and countervailing duty determinations on imported lumber on 22 May 2002. These orders require Canadian exporters to make cash deposits on shipments of softwood lumber to the US, based on subsidy and dumping margins found in the final determinations of subsidy and dumping. Canada is challenging the US under NAFTA and the WTO (b) The US Congress has set aside an estimated $US182 billion for total farm spending over the next ten years. The new US Farm Bill, signed into law by President Bush on 13 May 2002, is initially for a period of six years and will account for around US$105 billion of the ten year total. (3) Yes. (4) The US Congress is considering an Energy Bill, but I am not able to say whether US oil refiners have asked President Bush to impose tariffs on imported gasoline. (5 Yes. The Government has called on the US to renew its commitment to the Doha Round and demonstrate the necessary leadership for an ambitious outcome to these negotiations, including agriculture. The US Administration has said it remains committed to such outcomes. Rental Assistance (Question No. 370) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 16 May 2002: What is the rationale for people who are sharing accommodation with people who are not their partners, to be paid significantly less Rent Assistance than single people paying the same amount of rent. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: The Government introduced the Sharers Measure in July 1997. The new maximum rate for certain single people who share their accommodation was set at two thirds the maximum rate for singles living alone. This was to address inequities in rates of payment between couples and two singles sharing a dwelling. It also reflects the fact that singles who share accommodation have the opportunity to benefit from economies that are not available to singles who live on their own, ie through sharing expenses and pooling resources.",127,Representatives Main Committee
