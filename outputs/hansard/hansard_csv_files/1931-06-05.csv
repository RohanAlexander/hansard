I ask you Mr Speaker whether in your opinion the notice-paper should be the medium of grossly offensive references to a distinguished servant of the Commonwealth? I recognize that the offensive words are quoted from a newspaper, bui I do not think that that justifies their appearance on the notice-paper. permit any question that is deliberately offensive to appear on the notice-paper. Some distinction must, of course, be drawn between a quotation from a newspaper and a statement by an honourable member, but I would not have allowed this question to appear on the notice paper in its present form had it been Friday, 5 June, 1981.

They may not make remarks that are personally offensive to other honourable members, -but except for that limitation and compliance with the Standing Orders their right of speech is unrestricted; they may indulge in any criticism, however severe, scurrilous, or unjustified of any person outside this Parliament. Questions upon notice are not exempt from the ordinary rights of honourable members. If an honourable member could ask this question without notice surely he could do so upon notice. I could refer to cases in the House of Commons, and indeed decisions by yourself, Mr Speaker, which prove that free criticism is part of the recognized rights and privileges of honourable members. The extent to which we exercise that right must be governed by our own sense of decency, propriety, aud self-respect. ber may rest assured that I shall not attempt to deprive honourable members of their rights. Nevertheless members of this chamber and officers of the Commonwealth arc entitled to protection, and the Chair must exercise its authority to prevent liberty of speech degenerating into licence. If questions of doubtful character are to be asked it would be pretion upon the notice-paper I shall let him ferable to ask them without notice and so permit the Chair and the House to express immediate judgment as to their propriety. FILM CENSORSHIP. the House on Wednesday by the Minister for Trade and Customs in reply to questions asked by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) and myself, regarding the censorship of films, indicated a considerable divergence of opinion between the Censorship Board and the Censorship Appeal Board. Having regard to the strong criticism of the censorship by the Chief Justice of Victoria, a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court, the British press, and representatives of the British Film Industry, I ask the Minister whether he will consider the advisability of asking the two boards to confer with a view to placing the censor ship on the basis recommended by a royal commission of which the Minister was a nounced divergence of opinion between the views expressed by the Chief Censor and Acting Chief Censor, and those of the Censorship Appeal Board; but I was uot surprised at that. At times there are equally marked divergences of opinion amongst judges of the High Court and the Supreme Courts; indeed the extent to which judges differ on points of law is amazing to the layman. However, the suggestion of the honourable member Avill receive sympathetic consideration. the Government has taken no action against owners of industries who have committed numerous offences against the Crimes Act 1928, I ask the Attorney General whether the Government intends to repeal that statute in order to safeguard the workers against the possibility of a future government applying it to their detriment? any crimes, over which the Crown Law Department has jurisdiction, in respect of which no action has been taken. But if the honourable member will place a queshave a considered reply. RE-BROADCASTING OF BRITISH upon notice1.

The. department informed station 2UW and other stations that permission could not be granted for certain broadcasts proposed to be undertaken from tlie British Broadcasting Corporation station. 3. Permission has been given on several occasions. 4. The reasons were as follows:-(«. ) The question of Empire broadcasting formed the subject of much discussion and negotiation at the Imperial Conference, and is not yet settled; (6) If an Empire service is undertaken, it comes more properly within the province of the national stations to re-transmit the programmes in Australia; (c) It is undesirable that class "" B "" stations should be broadcasting similar programme items simultaneously witli those from the national stations. 5. (a) It is reasonable to assume that such a provision should apply generally, otherwise a feeling of resentment might naturally arise on the part of the originating broadcaster if a broadcaster made a practice of obtaining his programme material at the expense of another station, (6) The department has no information indicating that the British Broadcasting Corporation would be glad if all and sundry dominion stations undertook to relay its programmes, but it would seem, in view of the negotiations at tlie Imperial Conference, which gave consideration to a plan for sharing tlie expense for re-broadcast services, that such a procedure would not be welcomed. 6. The department has _ made a practice of re-broadcasting items from the British Broadcasting Corporation programmes, mainly for experimental purposes, when reception conditions have been satisfactory. 7. It is believed that this was the intention. 8.

Are letters delivered as quickly under the system if their ordinary address is clearly set out, as if in addition they have postal numbers ? 4. Why was this unfortunate experiment made in Melbourne and not in Sydney or some other Australian city? MrA . GREEK The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :_ 1. The latest check indicates that, in the city and suburban areas, approximately CO per cent, of the originating correspondence shows the correct postal district number. The correspondence from the rest of Victoria bears the postal district number in about 58 per cent, of the cases, the figures for the remaining States of the Commonwealth beinf 41 per cent., and from overseas, 38 per °cent. Ihere is a progressive improvement in the extent of the use of postal district numbers on mail matter. 2. Yes; but it is preferable that the symbols to be used should conform w i th the relative geographical directions of the areas identified. 3. Correspondence for different portions of The answers to the tlie same municipal district may be delivered from two or more offices, and the liability of incorrect sorting is then obviously greater when a postal district number is not adopted.

These are only a few items taken at random to show the absurdity of the duties that have been imposed.

I can conceive of no other reason. The Minister has not extended to the committee the courtesy of explaining the reason for these duties. He knows, of course, that the Government has a sufficient number of supporters to pass the tariff. mit that this item has not been considered on its merits. These excessive duties are not justified by the facts, or by any stateby all who engage in competitive enterment of the Minister, and they inflict a distinct hardship upon the great middle and working classes. The duties on these important articles of clothing have been increased by multiplying the old figures, not by two, but, apparently, by more than three. British duty on the first sub-item, cotton socks, has been raised from 6s. to 20s. per dozen pairs; in the case of woolleu socks, or socks containing wool, the rate has been increased from 8s. to 17s. 6d. per dozen; and on silk socks the increase is from 7s. to f l per dozen. These duties have been deliberately fixed to prohibit importations. object been achieved? have come in? figures, but I think that the duties have almost put an end to the importation of the cheaper lines of socks, arid even socks of the higher class. The present position of the hosiery industry in Australia has become interesting as the result of these increased imports. The industry is extraordinarily efficient; it has turned out socks and stockings of high quality which are disposed of at reasonable prices. I admit that so far, these duties have conduties. ferred a substantial benefit to the wearers of socks and stockings, and that to that extent they have assisted to reduce the cost of living. There is, however, one dangerous aspect which must not be overlooked. The capital invested and the machinery employed in the industry are capable of producing socks and stockings greatly in excess of the Australian demand for many years to come. ture of these goods in Australia has been overdone. a position in which another monopoly, with all its attendant dangers, is being created. It may be that the present very keen competition between the various manufacturers of hosiery will continue until some of them are forced out of business. Although that would mean a substantial loss to the shareholders in I subthose companies, I am not greatly concerned about that aspect of the matter, for that is a risk which must be taken prises. The other alternative is that the fight will be continued until some of the companies disappear, and that the remaining companies will then come to an agreement, if not to merge into one big company, at least to fix prices which would give a reasonable return on all the The capital invested in the industry. I do not say that that will eventually come to pass; I suggest it as a grave possibility. If what I have suggested does take place, we shall be forced to pay for the hosiery we wear a price sufficient to maintain both capital and plant greatly ih excess of that which should be employed to meet requirements. While I pay the highest tribute to the efficiency of these various establishments, I am strongly opposed to What imports these prohibitive duties. ask for them?

The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) says that he has evidence that these duties were asked for by manufacturers, the inference being that that is the reason for their imposition. of the Government declares, by inference, that the duties have been imposed in order to adjust the balance of trade. the duties. Government is proceeding towards two objectives in this and the subsidiary tariff before the committee. There is, first, the tariff of a protective and revenue-producing nature, which appears in the schedule. That is a true tariff. But, in addition, the Government took emergency measures outside the altogether, to adjust the balance of trade. Honourable members are aware of the existence of a long list of prohibitions against imports, and also of a list of 50 per cent, surcharge duties. We must consider the item before us as a protective duty, and on that basis I submit that the protective policy has been carried to excess. In the long run, it will not benefit the manufacturers, excepting at heavy cost to the consumers, as a result of the existence of a combine tofixprices. find it impossible to understand the reason for the imposition of these heavy duties on cotton socks and stockings. The one commendable feature of these goods is sub-item (A) (1) the following:their cheapness. I call the attention of honourable members to the fact that subitem 1 does not cover expensive silk, or even good woollen goods; it refers only to common cotton hosiery. which are worn only by the poorer persons in the community, have to pay a duty of 20s. a dozen pairs before they are allowed to enter this country. That is Is. 8d. a pair. Such duties are ridiculously in excess of the requirements of the industry. two things go Under this item children's cotton socks invoiced at'4s. 9d. per dozen pairs, are subject to a duty of 20s. per dozen pairs, or over 400 per cent. I wonder whether honourable members opposite really understand what they are asked to agree to. I ask those who support this item whether they consider that such high duties are essential to the building up of Australian industries. The Attorney-General says that we must adjust the balance of trade. That may be so; but surely that does not require us to place in the hands of manufacturers the power to rob the community. It is useless for Labour members to think that Parliament can impose prohibitive duties and then pass legislation to fix wages in correspondence with the price charged for the goods. I point out, moreover, that wages are coming down. Parliament has no constitutional authority to pass legislation aimed at the fixing of wages. That is a matter for arbitration tribunals. No matter how wain crease the duties on imported goods, we cannot give effect to the desire of Labour members that the workers in industry shall participate in the advantages tariff derived by those who charge high prices for the goods manufactured by them. The Minister for Trade and Customs should tell the committee what led the Government to impose these excessive duties. One wonders whether the duties on this item are in any way connected with any Queensland industry. It may be that Queensland cotton yarn will be used in the manufacture in Australia of cotton socks and stockings, and that, therefore, no such goods are to be allowed to enter this country. The Minister may be attempting to force the use of locallyproduced cotton in order to build up a Queensland industry. I move That the item he amended by adding after ""And on and after the 6th June, 1931(1) Cotton-pe r dozen pairs, British, 6s.; intermediate, 8s.; general, 10s., or ad val., British, 30 per cent,; intermediate, 40 per cent., general, These goods, 45 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.""",16,Manufactures Thereof And Any Other Part Of The World Where Is

When it was introduced it was regarded by many as preposterous. I remind the Minister that at one time cotton socks from Britain were admitted duty free. I know that a number of travellers, particularly in the United States of America, rarely, if ever, buy expensive socks. cheap cotton socks and to destroy them when soiled, rather than incur the expense of having more expensive socks laundered. When we reflect that goods valued at 4s. 9d. have to bear a duty of 20s. if imported from Great Britain, or up to 30s. if imported from foreign countries, we can only conclude that the policy of protection has been carried to a degree of madness. The whole item is wickedly preposterous. for Trade and Customs) [11.13] I hope that in a few brief remarks I shall be able to clear away a little of the misunderstanding that appears to exist in the minds of honourable members regarding the duties on this item. ter realizes that an explanation is necesour imports were valued at £54,287,000, sary. sary to switch on the light in order that honourable gentlemen may see these duties in their true perspective. I know that honourable members who oppose these duties have now reached paragraph No. 120 on the document which has been sent to them by importers, setting out that these duties are detrimental to the people of Australia. The fact is that they are detrimental chiefly to importers, who, previously, imported large quantities of endof-season goods from other countries, to the detriment of Australian enterprises. Especially at a time like this, when Australia is faced with an adverse trade balance, there is no justification for the dear to the heart of the right honourable imj>ortation of hosiery. stand that the adverse trade balance has been rectified. partially rectified. I remind the honourable member that not only must we balance our imports and exports, but we must have an excess of exports over imports to the extent of £36,000,000 per annum, because Australia, being a debtor nation, must have that amount to meet its overseas commitments. These duties They prefer to buy will assist in the rectification of the adverse balance of trade. suggest that, because of these duties, Australian manufacturers will be able to export hosiery to England, and thus assist to rectify the adverse trade balance ? lian manufacturers are not exporting hosiery to Great Britain; in the present circumstances that is unpracticable, but there is a very big market in Australia, the requirements of which are being met by the local manufacturers. It is interesting to note that, contrary to the contention of some honourable members opposite, there has been a substantial reduction in the prices of Australian hosiery, particulars of which I shall supply later. For the ten months ended 30th April, 1931, and our exports during the same period in corresponding British currency values, the tables have now been turned, and that we have not now an adverse trade balance. It is, however, necessary to provide more than an excess of £21,000,000 of exports over imports as we have to find at least £36,000,000 in order to meet our interest commitments overseas. The duties under this sub-item have been submitted for the dual purpose of protecting an Australian industry, and of retaining a favorable trade balance. In Australia we have all the necessary plant to manufacture our hosiery requirements. the committee some information with respect to prices charged? with New South Wales, a State naturally member for North Sydney.

I have a letter from the Victorian"" Hosiery and Underwear Manufacturers Association asking for duties substantially the same as those contained in the schedule. the date of that communication? November, 1929, and the duties were imposed on the 22nd November of that year. As an indication of the immediate -effect of the increased duties imposed by the present Government, I may point out that Messrs. Bond and Company, of Sydney, had decided to close their hosiery mills in December, 1929, and thereby throw 930 persons out of employment. After the schedule was tabled, the company decided to continue its operations, consequently 1,000 persons who would otherwise have lost their employment remained at work. This factory was closed down because of the drop in wage price levels which enabled importers to land cheap hosiery in Australia from the Continent and Great Britain. levels drop in Australia? ber for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) had his way, wages would be slashed, but fered with. After the imposition of these duties, Australian manufacturers commenced to extend their buildings and plant. The Holeproof Hosiery Company and the Julius Kayser Company decided to manufacture within our tariff wall. The Kayser product has a worldwide reputation. In Victoria alsne, the additional capital expended in the construction of buildings and in the installahosiery by 25 per cent, since the new tion of machinery since the imposition of these duties amounts to £369,000. In construction work alone, hundreds of persons have been provided with employment. The figures show that in Victoria, despite the existing trade depression, the number of employees engaged in this industry has been increased by 532. Minister; will he now listen to me? to the melodious voice of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) when he gets up to speak. Now, for the benefit of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), I point out that 300 additional employees have been taken on by the manufacturing firms in New South Wales since the new duties were imposed, making a total increase is of employment of 832 in Victoria and New South Wales. This increase has been brought about notwithstanding unemployment and depression in other industries. What tremendous development would have taken place if the price of wool and wheat had kept up, and our national income had been unimpaired! Notwithstanding the increased duty, the price of hosiery has been substantially reduced. A feature of the development of the industry in Australia has been the manufacture in this country of fullfashioned silk hosiery. This type is now being produced in considerable quantities, and of a quality equal to that made in any other part of the world. The varieties being manufactured have led to a demand for silk yarn, and these are now being manufactured in Victoria. The Australian company engaged in the price manufacture of silk yarn imports the raw silk from Japan, and makes it up here. It employs no fewer than 150 persons. The reduction in price of silk hosiery since the imposition of increased duties gives the lie direct to the statement that interest would not be interincreased prices are a natural corollary of increased duties. Let us consider what has been done by the Prestige Hosiery Company of Victoria. The product of this company has a great name throughout Australia. The company employs 1,000 persons in its factory, which I visited a few weeks ago. It has reduced the price of full-fashioned silk hosiery by 35 per cent., and that of circular duties have been in operation.

79,Mr Forde,"I shall be glad to listenknow what they are talking about. If they took the trouble to inspect the factories, and learn something of the industry as I have done, they would be ashamed to make free trade speeches such as they have recently been delivering here. The Minister finished his speech with a eulogy of the Prestige Hosiery Company. It will be interesting, therefore, to mention the profits which this company has been making, assisted, no doubt, by the duties which the Minister has imposed. posed the company has been more busily engaged than ever. profits, and the action of the Minister has put those profits into the pockets of the company's shareholders. At this time, when the leaders of the Government are making an arrangement to cut down pensions, the Minister for Customs is asking Parliament to sanction duties which will enable a company to keep its dividends up to 10 per cent., and the Minister is actually bragging about it. sioner will get his share of the profits. report of the affairs of the company:Profits earned by Prestige Limited, manufacturers of hosiery, in the year ended March 31, 1931, amounted to £21,300, a reduction of £15,550 in. comparison with profits in the previous year. . . . W it h £1,525 brought forward, £22,825 was available for distribution, out of which preference dividend of 8 per cent, required £4,580. Transfer of £4,000 to general reserve was made, and £6,250 was allotted to taxation reserve. An interim dividend of 24 per cent, for the half-year was paid on ordinary shares in November, and a final dividend of 5 per cent., with bonus of 24 per cent., is recommended, making a distribution for the year of 10 per cent, on ordinary shares, compared with dividends amounting to 15 per cent., paid in the previous year. Gross trading profit earned in the year, was £107,286. I do not object to an efficient company making profits if the Minister puts the means of making them into its hands, but I do object to the Minister bestowing his favours upon certain industries while there are hundreds of thousands of persons unemployed, and while the farmers in the Mallee are receiving no return am sure that all honourable members are from their properties, and are sheltering most interested in this item. I do not themselves and their families in bag huts. think that there can be any honourable 1,000 persons, and is it not better that work should be provided for these people here than that we should be buying what we need from Germany? those employees would in any case have found employment elsewhere. up the prosperity of these favoured industries, undue hardship has been placed upon those engaged in other occupations, with the result that they are, in many cases, denied even a decent standard of living. The Minister said that employment had been provided for 832 additional employees in Victoria and New South Wales as a result of the increased duties. If he had said in the cities of .Sydney and Melbourne he would have been more accurate. He did not say how many men had been put out of work in other parts of Australia, or how many farmers had been forced into bankruptcy as a result of this Government's policy. It is estimated that the area under wheat this year will be less by 4,500,000 acres than last year, and it is inevitable that not so much employment will be provided in harvesting and transporting the crop as was the case iD previous years. These duties show the partiality of the Government, and demonstrate how it is prepared to bow the knee to the manufacturers who are in league with the organized unions in the city. For the workers in other parts of the country, the Government can spare nothing but an economic tear. The Minister is quite prepared to give the manufacturers any degree of protection up to 100 per cent, and more, and the fact that the manufacturers do not always take full advantage of this protection to exploit the public merely shows that some of them have a conscience even if the Minister has not. I trust that the amendment of the ""honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) will be carried, but I should really prefer that the whole item be rejected.

The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) described the Government's action as bare-faced. According io one section of the item, however, the duty refers to stockings which do not cover the knee, but whether it is barefaced or bare-kneed, the fact remains that the Minister resolutely declined to furnish the information for which the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) persistently asked him. The honourable member for Fawkner inquired of the Minister what duty the manufacturers had asked the Minister for, seeing that the Minister had actually granted increased protection to the extent of 300 per cent., and 400 per cent. I do not want honourable members to think that I am not in favour of granting protection to this industry. When I was in Chicago, I inspected the hosiery factories there, which are among the largest in the world, and at that time most of the money which the Australian public spent on hosiery found its way to the American manufacturers. I have here a letter from the Lustre Hosiery Company, which bears out what the Minister said in regard to the reduction in prices since the higher duties were imposed. It says that the price of certain grades of hosiery has been reduced from 24s. a dozen to 18s. a dozen.

The articles of wear affected by this item-socks , stockings, singlets, &c, are used by everybody in Australia. There is an immense market for their sale, and it should be possible, by mass production methods, to manufacture them as cheaply as they are being produced in any other' country. I agree that this industry should have absolutely full protection, and have the whole of the Australian market, if it can produce the required articles at the right price. We have been told that substantial reductions have been made by all manufacturers recently. Therefore, these goods should be made available to the people at reduced prices. Quite recently I inquired if there had been any reduction in retail prices in Sydney, and having been assured that prices had been marked down, I asked manufacturers why business was not thriving. I was informed that business with them was bad, because certain of Consequently, astute storekeepers, if they look around, can pick up attractive bargains.

Actually, they are what we would term Kanaka socks-the class of goods that used to be on sale in the Kanaka shops in the sugar districts many years ago.

The committee has been extremely generous towards the Minister, who, with the aid of Government supporters, has succeeded in carrying every item except one in the schedule that has so far been discussed. We, who sit on this side, know quite well that it is useless to protest against any item, because he has the necessary support to enforce his will. He is making a farce of the matter when he declines to agree to its being considered on a non-party basis, which would ensure that the opinions of the majority of the representatives of the people would decide the amount of the duties to be imposed through the customs. I have felt for a considerable time that it is useless for honourable members on this side to endeavour to have the tariff amended, because the Minister is able to carry every proposal that he places before the committee. In the long statement that he made on this item, he placed before the committee his own point of view, but did not answer a number of relevant questions. He has asked the committee to agree to duties of 20s., 25s., and 30s. a dozen on cotton socks. How can he justify such an extraordinary impost in the light of the following expression of opinion by the Tariff Board? :The Tariff Board considers that the position should be amply provided for by fixed rates of duty, as under, to operate alternatively with Francis, J. the existing ad valorem rates:-Pe r dozen pairs. British, 6s.; intermediate, 8s.; and general, 10s. I am under the impression that the honourable gentleman has hearkened to the plea of the small and inefficient manufacturers, who are of no value to Australia. This action will not have the effect of placing a cheaper article in the hands of the people, but on the contrary, will penalize that section of the community for which Labour supporters should have the greatest consideration, namely, those who have to wear the lowest grade of socks and stockings. At one time, bush workers, who had to camp long distances from their homes, were able to take with them a bundle of cheap socks which, having worn for a time, they threw away. It is impossible under present conditions to purchase such an article. I protest against the item, and shall support the amendment. Question-That the amendment ( Mr mittee divided. (CHAntMAM-MB .

Absorbent cotton wool is not at present being manufactured in Australia. The Tariff Board has already inquired into the industry and has recommended the duty that is now proposed.

The Australian industry has developed mainly in the manufacture of linters wadding for the upholstering of motor bodies, and the Commonwealth requirements of this line are manufactured in Australia.

In regard to manufactures imported solely for use of public hospitals and which are of a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia, provision already exists for the admission of such goods at concessional rates under tariff item 415, as prescribed by departmental by-laws.

The Minister quoted exhaustively to-day from a Tariff Board's report dealing with the cotton industry which is two years' old. When within the past fortnight I invited the Minister to table another report on the cotton industry presented by the Tariff Board about three months ago, he gave the committee the assurance that he would do so when the cotton items were under discussion. I ask him for it now. It is scandalous for him to have in his possession a report bearing definitely on many phases of the cotton-growing and cotton-spinning industries and to refuse point blank to disclose it when honorI am agreeable to the sugable members are dealing with various duties bearing on those industries. ber was Minister he withheld a report on the cotton industry for eight months. was nothing before the House dealing with the cotton industry. Why is the Minister suppressing this particular report when he is imposing additional duties? I leave it to honourable members' imaginations to furnish the reply. But there is an even worse feature about these duties. The other day I said that the cotton-growing industry was confined almost exclusively to the Minister's own electorate. To-day' the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has made a most eloquent appeal on behalf of our over-taxed hospitals, which would move most Ministers and most honourable members in normal circumstances. But for the Minister to resist it in favour of his own cotton-growers is an exceedingly serious matter. All of these cotton duties are an attempt to bolster up in rate, we all every possible way an industry located in the Minister's own electorate. I should like to contrast the situation of the cotton-growers with those of the unfortunate poor, who ai'e dependent on public hospitals for relief in time of sickness. I have previously said in this chamber that the cotton-farmers in Queensland are the most favoured section of pioneer farmers in Australia.

They have a well established butter industry, with a large butter factory in the heart of the district, and other factories at each end. But with cotton-growing they are also in receipt of a big bounty, and already they are on the way to becoming extraordinarily prosperous. They are in possession of singularly cheap land. If it is still on workers, and having regard to the extenthe leasehold system, their rental is a peppercorn one. into freehold for a few pounds per acre. I know of no similar conditions in any other rural district of Australia. Yet the Minister proposes further to enrich these cotton-growers at the expense of the inmates of our great public hospitals. It is positively a public scandal. That a Minister of the Crown should ever attempt to do such a thing for the benefit of his own constituents is a grave reflection upon the office he holds. As the honourable member for Gippsland has said, our great public hospitals are in a state of distress; yet a straight-out tax of several thousand pounds a year is to be imposed upon them. Because of the depression the applications for hospital treatment to-day are abnormal. Hospital treasuries are depleted and to replenish them public lotteries and other devices are being resorted to. Yet the Minister proposes this additional tax exclusively in aid of the growers in his own electorate. the mean, dirty, and despicable suggestions of the Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition. with a scandal of this sort. of the Opposition seem unable to consider these items in a national spirit. They take a petty, paltry, parochial view. The present Minister for Trade and Customs has displayed greater ability and industry in the administration of his department than any of his predecessors; yet he cannot bring forward an item without the suggestion being made that he is forwarding his own interests as representative of The fanners in the the constituency of Capricornia. Any action taken by the Minister in respect of the items appearing in this schedule ha9 They would bo been taken without regard to the particular interests of any electorate or State. I , as a representative of New South ""Wales, welcome the proposed deferred duty on absorbent cotton wool.

If the contentions of honourable members opposite are right that the proposed duty on absorbent cotton wooi should not be imposed on the cotton wool used by hospitals they might, with equal justification, urge that the towels, blankets and. other requisites used by public hospitals should be admitted free of duty. If such a concession be given to public hospitals, why should it not be extended to private institutions? Indeed, why should housewives hp penalized and patients in hospitals be allowed to escape? The financial worries of public hospitals are largely due to the short-sighted policy of honourable members opposite who, while they occupied the treasury bench, admitted shiploads of manufactures from cheap-labour countries. As a result of that deliberate policy many of our industries are languishing and hundreds of thousands of workers art unemployed. When, through illness they are obliged to enter hospitals, they are not able to make any contribution towards the cost of their treatment and maintenance. For that I place the whole blame on honourable members opposite. I hope, however, that through the far-sighted policy of the present Government the hospital patients will shortly be able to pay for their treatment, and then the financial difficulties of these institutions will disappear.

The Minister is not actuated by a desire to put money into the pockets of any set of individuals; he is merely seeking to provide an outlet for one of our important primary products. The members of the Country party should approach this item in the same spirit as they exhibited when supporting earlier items which, like this, were designed to help the man on the land. [2.53] I do not agree with the statement of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) that the cotton industry is pampered or is imposing upon the Australian people a load disproportionate to the benefits they will derive. The cotton growers are blazing the track of a big and useful industry. Whilst the tract of country they are planting with cotton has all the good qualities stated by the honorhave killed it in its infancy have been able member for Henty, no one can rightly claim that in asking for the protection of the various phases of their industry they are seeking more than their due. In the initial stages of this primary industry, mental to its best interests. Many many difficulties have to be overcome by the settlers. If they are in such a happy position, as the honourable member for Henty suggests, I am surprised that more people have not rushed to Queensland to participate in the benefits; there is room for cause the production of raw cotton is still considerably below the requirements of the Australian market. I can say that all the initial difficulties are not yet overcome, and we must stand by the industry. assisted by a bounty? bounty was granted by the late Government; but the present bounty is low and disappears gradually. In the first place, they were assisted by the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government. The cotton-growers of Queensland do not wish to make themselves a burden on the community, nor do they desire to do anything that would I cannot state the be detrimental to the inmates of hospitals. In considering medicated cotton wool, it should be realized that a long time must elapse before the cotton industry can supply all the raw material for the commodities, the manufacture of tralia by the tariff. Protection has been granted in many avenues of industry in which there is scope for the use of Australian cotton, but it will take years to produce sufficient for all such requirements. Though linters will be available, there are other protected avenues in which linters could be used. I have always been a keen advocate of the cotton industry, and, perhaps, have been more closely associated with it than any member of any Parliament in Australia. The districts in which, cotton is produced were represented by me when I was the member for Burnett in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The full requirements of the industry in every detail received my personal attention in its pioneering stages, and I am glad to know that the prejudices of those who would overcome. I have the fullest hope of the ultimate success of the industry, and it would be nothing short of a catastrophe if this committee took any action detrifamilies have invested all their savings in cotton lands, and have borrowed money on the security of their holdings. At the present time, the industry does not desire to supply the material required for the manufacture of cotton wool, if it would thousands more growers, bebe detrimental to any section of the community, and if the Minister, in his wisdom, would accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D.

If he had, he would readily appreciate the large quantity of this article that is used in hospitals. To the credit of the management of our public hospitals, let it be said that the patients who have to undergo major operations are treated as well in those institutions as they are in private hospitals. extensively that I am surprised that any honourable member should suggest increasing its cost. I believe that the cotton growers of Queensland are big enough Australians not to desire to advance their own interests by forcing an increased duty upon the hospitals.

I have no doubt that blankets could be reduced in price if they were admitted free of duty, but I am not in favour of the duties on them being removed. Although both blankets and cotton wool are used in hospitals, their uses are entirely different. A blanket could not be used to bind a raw wound, whereas cotton wool is ideal Cotton wool is used so for the purpose. Indeed, so useful is cotton wool that I always carry some of it in my pocket in case of emergency. If the Minister would introduce a proposal for a bounty for the production of cotton wool it would have my hearty support. The Government would do well to grant to hospitals and dispensaries a rebate equal to the duty charged upon all articles used by such institutions and not manufactured in Australia. It may be said that in these times of stress those rebates would amount to a sum more than the country can afford.

Honourable members know the deep interest taken by him in the hospitals throughout Australia. Probably there is no man in this country who knows more about hospitals, or has a deeper concern for the poor and needy than he has. Knowing his concern for the sick and suffering, I find an appeal by him on their behalf almost irresistible. It was because I realized that this was a subject upon which the full light of day should be thrown that I referred it to the Tariff Board. During the course of the tariff debates I have been subjected to a good deal of criticism for not having followed the recommendations of the Tariff Board. In this case I have accepted the board's advice; and yet, apparently, I have done wrong. about that. Tariff Board's report of the 26th March. 1929, the board statedWhile of the opinion that the imposition of increased duties is not justifiable under existtection of the tariff notwithstanding that ing circumstances That statement was made when there was no factory in Australia for the manufacture of absorbent cotton wool. The board went on to saythe board is satisfied that there should be provided some inducement to Australian manufacturers to undertake the manufacture of the waddings and cotton wool which are at present being imported. The Tariff Board recommended that on and after 1st January, 1930-ove r a year ago-thi s deferred duty should become operative. The Government, however, stayed its hand until a further investigation had been made. The result of that investigation was that the Government decided that the deferred duty should operate from the 1st October of this year. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr enjoy sufficient protection to enable them Keane) knows that when a deferred duty is put on, as, for instance, in the case of sewing machines, it does not become operative until the matter has been referred to the Tariff Board for report as to whether the article in question is being manufactured in Australia in sufficient quantities to satisfy the Australian demand. Just as the Tariff Board recommended that the deferred duties on sewing machines should not become operative, so, in the case of cotton wool, should it recommend that the deferred duty should not become operative, its recommendation will be given effect to. A special plea has been made for a reduction of the duties on absorbent cotton wool on the ground that it is of such importance for surgical purposes that it should enter free, irrespective of the country of origin. All honourable members have a great admiration for our hospitals, both public and private. They compare favourably with hospitals in any part of the world, and are, indeed, performing a wonderful service to mankind. But the same argument that applies in the case of cotton wool could, with equal force, apply to other articles used in hospitals. A good case could be made out for allowing blankets, soap, drugs, and other hospital requisites to enter this country free. . Honourable members are aware, however, that Messrs. Elliott Brothers, and other makers of drugs, as well as the manufacturers of many other hospital requisites, are granted the prothey sell their wares to the hospitals of Australia. If we were to allow free trade principles to operate in regard to all those articles well. our fiscal policy. would be a good thing. only article manufactured in Australia and used by hospitals on which there is an import duty.

196,Mr Forde,"Cotton wool is not thecotton wool. There is a mistaken idea that the manufacture of cotton wool in Australia will necessarily increase the price of that commodity. AlthoughI have been informed that there will be no increase in the price of cotton wool because of the imposition of these duties, I suggest that, as the manufacturer has not yet started to manufacture that commodity it would be somewhat premature for him to give a guarantee that the price will not be increased. I understand that over £20,000 is to be spent on machinery for the manufacture of absorbent cotton wool. sumption of cotton wool in Australia? 800,000 lb., valued at £63,000. I remind honourable members that if the raw cotton or the lint used in the manufacture of absorbent cotton wool cannot be made in Australia, the Minister is empowered to allow the raw product required for its manufacture to enter free from any country in the world. While I havo the greatest sympathy with the hospitals of Australia, and appreciate the advantage they would gain from the striking out of these duties, I suggest that an even better case could be made out than has been advanced. Were a complete free trade policy to be put into operation, the hospitals would benefit more than they would by the reduction of these duties. Cotton wool is only one of the many requisites of a modern hospital, yet honourable members have shut their eyes to the duties which have been imposed on those other articles. Why should we exempt this commodity and at the same time afford protection. to those producing other commodities used extensively in our hospitals? In this instance I trust that the committee will be consistent and agree to the deferred duties proposed under this sub-item which are in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board. Minister( Mr Forde) has informed the committee that the duties imposed under this sub-item have been adopted on the recommendation of the Tariff Board; but t remind him that representatives of our public hospitals did not appear before that body and express the views that have been expressed here this afternoon. Had they done so, I . feel sure that the board would have made a different recommendation. matter debated here this afternoon is not one for the Tariff Board to consider. It considers only the imposition of duties from an economic stand-point. does not consider duties from a humanitarian view-point. matter into consideration. considers the imposition of duties from an industrial and economic and not from a humanitarian stand-point. It is the responsibility of this committee to decide to what extent the recommendations of the Tariff Board shall be departed from. I believe that a majority of members of the committee strongly favour consideration being extended to public hospitals. The total quantity of absorbent cotton wool required annually in Australia is between 600,000 and 700,000 lb., and that used by hospitals is valued at only £7,000. If an attempt were being made to protect an established industry, I could understand the attitude of the Minister, but this commodity is not at present being manufactured in Australia. is not yet operative. persons investing capital in a new industry should understand from the ouset that hospitals are to receive preferential treatment. How long would it take a modern factory to produce the 600,000 or 700,000 lb. of cotton wool required annually in Australia? I am at a loss to understand why the Minister has permitted the debate to continue so long when it could be terminated at once by adopting the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D.

I have attended many hospital functions in my electorate and have first-hand knowledge of the manner in which these institutions are conducted. Most of them find it exceedingly difficult to render effective service with the funds available. The costs are on the increase, and the figures given in the last annual report of the Charities Board, disclose the difficulties under which they are operating. The honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley) said that if supplies of cotton wool for public hospitals were to be admitted free, supplies for private hospitals should be admitted on the same basis. I cannot agree with that contention, because patients in private hospitals are able to pay for treatment, whereas those in public hospitals are not able to do so. When the timber duties were under consideration some time ago, we were informed that Oregon timber used for mining purposes was to be admitted free under departmental by-laws. reached, although we have forests of suitnot operate until the 1st October. Some able timber, ready for felling, which could be used for mining purposes. If Oregon timber for mining purposes can be admitted free of duty when we have ample supplies of suitable timber available, there is every reason why absorbent cotton wool for use in public hospitals, the manufacture of which has not even been commenced here, should be admitted free of duty. already passed many items under which effective protection has been afforded to the cotton industry, I trust that a majority of the committee will support the amendment of the honourable member for Brisbane. In speaking at Hospital llr. Jones. Sunday functions, I have found that the people generally, irrespective of class, colour or creed, are always willing to subscribe to the best of their ability to meet the expenditure of our public The hospitals. If the cotton industry in Australia should experience any trifling disadvantage as a result of the free admission of absorbent wool for the purpose mentioned, it will be more than compensated for by the benefits which will accrue to our public hospitals. support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). Apparently, the Minister has allowed his enthusiasm for the cotton industry to run away with him. Some pertinacious manufacturers have realized that with such a versatile Minister for Trade and Customs, they have only to ask for the imposition of high duties and they will be granted. The Minister is aware that our public hospitals are carrying on their important work with the assistance of a generous public and a large body of surgeons and physicians, who are rendering valuable voluntary work. Many hospitals are working on a big overdraft, and, owing to lack of funds and space, find it impossible to accommodate all the patients requiring attention. What is the use of the Minister saying that he is filled with admiration and sympathy for the hospitals ? Let him show it by deeds, not words. We cannot be satisfied with the Minister's assurance That decision was that the duty is a deferred one, and will of us know what happened in the past in connection with deferred duties. They were supposed to operate at a certain time, but the Minister blithely altered the date to suit himself, and they came into operation considerably earlier. This has happened in regard to certain machinery items on which I shall have more to say when we come to them. Just As we have before the return of the ex-Minister for Customs from England, the present Minister altered the date, and made the duty operate from the time which suited him. We can have no faith in the Minister's assurances after an occurrence of that kind. I sup-",39,Maloney Fro M A Long Culties I N The Majority Of The Hospitals

It would not be so bad if the industry had previously been in existence; but it is shamef u l that the hospitals, which exist for the benefit of the sick and needy, should be exploited in this fashion. This is far worse than the ordinary exploitation against which honourable members on this side have been objecting for weeks. I am sure that the Minister would not have countenanced the proposal for a minute were it not for the fact that cotton enters into the manufacture of this material. not weigh with me one iota. ThenI have been mistaken. It will be interesting for the Minister's constituents to know that the cotton industry is of no importance to him. judged on their merits. Minister has not yet answered the objections which have been raised regarding the Tariff Board's report which he will not produce. port before me, and it is available to honourable members. The board recommended that a duty be placed' on this article. Minister made a great play about the fact that the duty is deferred, and that it will not be collected unless the board makes a recommendation to that effect. the duty would not be collected if the hoard recommended that it should not be. But there is no guarantee that the board will ever be asked to consider the matter again. [88] ance that it will be. Minister does not always accept the recommendations of the Tariff Board. lowing the board's recommendations, and will continue to follow them. regard to cased petrol a deferred duty was imposed, which was not to be collected until the 1st June. In spite of this provision, however, the Minister altered the date, and the duty became operative on the 1st May. recommended that the duty come into operation months previously. I deferred it until the 1st May. have no guarantee that the Minister may not alter the date in respect of the duty we are now considering. We have it on the authority of the superintendent of the Brisbane and South Coast Hospital that the Customs Department has created a precedent by permitting public hospitals to purchase free of duty rectified spirit for the manufacture of drugs. The Minister is not prepared, however, to permit hospitals to obtain without payment of duty supplies of absorbent cotton wool. It will be impossible to convince any one in Australia that the Minister's opposition to our proposal is unconnected with his association with the cotton industry in his own electorate. am surprised that the Minister is not prepared to accent this amendment. I understand that when the honourable member for Corangamite ("" Mr Crouch) was speaking, he nodded his head to the honourable member, intimating that he would accept the proposal. Now he refuses to accept it. Are we to understand that the Minister at that time intimated his readiness to accept the proposal, or that he simply nodded his head because a nod is not recorded in Hansard? If he had said "" Yes "" or "" No"" it would have been recorded, but he can nod now and say what he likes afterwards. for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) does not usually say offensive things, but I regard",40,Maloney Fro M A Long Culties I N The Majority Of The Hospitals

At any rate, the Minister did not at that time say "" No although he says it now. I cannot agree that this duty has been imposed for the benefit of the cotton-growers. other uses for which Australian-grown cotton can be put besides making absorbent wool and cotton. In fact, linters, the bi-product employed in making this article, was so little valued that the late Queensland Labour Government-whic h was supported by the present Minister for Trade and Customs-mad e an agreement with the British and Australian Cotton Association allowing it the free use of this commodity. It is only the fluff or rubbish which is left after the cotton has been used for other purposes. When really good grades of cotton wool are required it is necessary to use pure lint itself. ber for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) pointed out that if Queensland cotton is used for the manufacture of cotton wool, that much less cotton will be available for the manufacture of other articles, which will necessitate the importation of cotton. Why, then, prevent the importation of cotton wool ? One of the arguments used in favour of this duty was that the Queensland Cotton Board was in favour of it. I have not heard that. Perhaps the secretary of the Cotton Board was in favour of the proposal, but anything of which the secretary is in favour is suspect to me, because he is a twicedefeated Labour candidate for a Queensland constituency. I would regard his opinion upon this matter as biased. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). for Trade and Customs) [3.35] ably it will suit the convenience of honourable members if I intimate that I am prepared to give further consideration to the representations that have been made. I , therefore, suggest that consideration of the item be postponed until next week. This will give me an opportunity to look into the matter before the House resumes on Wednesday. However, we have the Item postponed. Item 126 (Saddlers' webs, collar check, &c). I protest very strongly against the fixed duty on saddlers' collar cloth, saddlers' kersey and saddlers' serge. The increased duty is equivalent to 92J per cent, on the cheaper class of checks which is There are plenty of largely used for the manufacture of horse collars and repair work and, as such, it represents an additional charge upon the farming community. I shall not occupy the time of the committee by enlarging upon this matter. I content myself with expressing astonishment that such a high rate of duty should be imposed. I intend to vote against the item. protest against this increase in the duty on material required for the lining of horse collars and other equipment required by our farmers. These increased duties of 10 per cent, are ill-timed, because our primary producers are passing The honourable memthrough a period of great distress. pay these increased charges. able member. A few days ago I received a communication from the Secretary of the Australian Wheat-growers Federation, from which I extract the following statement:Distressing eases of impoverishment are prevalent. Numerous cases of forced sales have been reported as well as countless farmers being forced to assign their estates. Such a state of affairs should not be tolerated for one moment by any competent legislature. Any person who holds a seat in that House should not rest' until some measure of assistance has been made effective by Parliament. It is extraordinary that at a time like this the Minister should continue piling these burdens upon our primary producers.

Details of the Government's policy were more fully explained under sub-item 105 F.

One condemand for horse and cattle rugs. I think we all agree that the best market for our primary producers is the Australian market. scheme and the sugar industry would have failed but for the Australian market. Under other tariff items we give protection to primary producers whose business it is to grow potatoes, onions, bananas, peanuts, &c. Why, then, should honourable members of the Country party oppose the duties under this item? It is to the advantage of our primary producers that our secondary industries should be encouraged in order that employees in them may be in a position Neverto purchase more largely of our primary products. The duties under this item affect,chiefly our primary producers, and will increase their costs, though, possibly, to a minor degree. Nevertheless, the accumulated effect of these tariff increases is such as to make the position of our farmers more and more difficult. This tariff increase is inopportune. It comes at a time when our primary producers, and particularly our wheat-growers, are straining every nerve to cut their costs, and it follows an appeal from the Government to them to grow more wheat. Many promises have been made by this Government to assist our farmers, but to the present Since time those promises have not materialized. . Our wheat-growers have not received one penny as a result of legislation passed by this Government. This is one of the minor items that has the effect of increasing costs. Being a wheat-grower, I know the difficulties that those primary producers have to face on account of the increases in prices that have occurred since pre-war days. There was a time when a farm-hor3e collar could be stuffed and check lined for 6s. To-day the price is nearer 16s..

It is ascandal. The Government ought to have the decency, even at this late stage, in view of the parlous'condition of the wheat industry, and of its inability to help that horse is practically 50 per cent, more than industry in any other, way, to withdraw this and similar items from the tariff schedule, so that the wheat-growers will have a fair chance to market their produce. Minister for Customs should seriously consider the withdrawal of this duty, which affects very harshly those who are struggling to maintain an industry, but who are receiving no protection or any other form of assistance. Many of the items upon which the duties have been increased will have to be used extensively if these men are to carry on. In a number of cases those who have previously used tractors and other farm implements will be compelled to abandon their use, because of the high capital cost, and the lack of the necessary funds to purchase even kerosene for them. Thus they will be more and more obliged to use horses while wheat remains at its present price. By increasing these duties we shall compel those men to pay. a great deal more than they otherwise would be called upon to pay. Their position is a desperate one. Many of them, even though they have prepared their land, have had to abandon their operations, simply because they cannot raise the money to procure the seed and the fertilizers that they require. It is of no use for those honourable members whose electorates are purely industrial to view this matter only from the point of view of their constituents. With the extinction of our primary industries, those centres of population would not be able to exist for 24 hours. This matter should be regarded from a national standpoint. I appeal to the Minister not to impose duties that will increase costs to the men who are trying to grow wheat and to those who are engaged in the dairying and grazing industries. A committee of experts should be appointed to bring to bear upon these questions some practical knowledge. This and similar items embody a principle against which T emphatically protest, and if we give our approval to it we shall prove that we have no regard for the predicament of those who are struggling against overwhelming odds to maintain a primary industry and tor uphold the credit of our country. At the present time the cost of dressing a it was five years ago. Any proposal that will still further increase costs to men who even now have not sufficient to purchase what is necessary to continue their operations, is nothing short of ridiculous, and should not receive serious consideration. I say quite definitely that no vote will be given by me to increase the duties on those items which affect the costs of the men who are trying to grow wheat. will not insist in bludgeoning this item through to-day.

I merely wish to make clear a few facts as I see them. Considerable controversy took place in this House as to the nature and the firmness of the guarantee. The undertaking of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to that guarantee was, as far as I can discover, mentioned in this House by the Minister for Markets on the 8th of April last year in his second-reading speech upon the Marketing Bill, and the reference is to be found on page 918 of Hansard. The Minister then saidBeforeI called the conference together at Canberra, I had the definite assurance of both tbe Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank that there would be no had the right to withdraw from the difficulty in financing the scheme. The Minister's statement that he had that Parkhill, Archdale. assurance was challenged at that time, Marr, C. W. C. and on numerous occasions afterwards. Francis, J. The Minister yesterday, when tabling Killen, W. W. these papers, saidThe memorandum in effect shows, inter alia, that the Commonwealth Bank offered to advance 4s. per bushel for f.a.q. wheat of the 1930-31 season, delivered at the railway station, plus transport charges, & c , the latter not to exceed an average of 8d. per bushel f.o.b. The Minister definitely stated that the bank offered to advance 4s. a bushel. I have to-day read carefully the memorandum, and the other correspondence, and I disagree entirely with the Minister that there ever was a firm and tangible offer from the bank in connection with this guarantee. In support of my contention that the bank gave no real undertaking, and that the money to finance the scheme would never have been found, I shall quote a few extracts from the memorandum forwarded with the letter of the 1st of April, 1930, from Sir Robert Gibson, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, to the Prime Minister. Paragraph 4 of the memorandum readsThat in the event of any deficit accruing through the operation of the pool, such deficit has to be made good by the Government; the amount payable in such connection shall be ascertained from month to month, and the Government shall undertake to pay the Commonwealtli Bank such deficit from time to time as required by the bank. Although, in the first place, the bank, in a sense, gave an undertaking subject to other conditions which I shall enumerate, but which were not mentioned by the Minister at the time-althoug h the bank gave the Minister strong reason to believe that the money might be foundall losses were to be refunded by the Commonwealth to the bank. I contend that the Government could not possibly have made good any deficit, that that fact would have become apparent to the bank very early in the transaction, and that the bank even had it begun to finance the scheme, would soon have ceased to do so. ber suggesting that the bank would have gone back on its word ? advance was conditional, and the bank scheme at any time.

It is as follows:wealth Government and State Governments to meet their obligations. This is also made clear by other occurrences. ""Well before the harvest was garnered, the Commonwealth Government applied, on a number of occasions, to the Commonwealth Bank for financial assistance to provide for the relief of unemployment and for the payment of a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel f.o.b. for wheat. But the bank absolutely refused to find the money to pay this price. In these circumstances was there ever a ghost of a chance that the bank would have continued to find the money throughout the harvest for the payment of 4s. per bushel for wheat? Then there was a condition which I the statement made by Sir Robert Gibson mentioned yesterday when speaking on when he was examined in another place this subject, namely, that any underrecently.

This has particular reference to Clause0 of the memorandum submitted herewith, and is offered as further explanation of the board's attitude to this aspect of finance. That statement effectively closed the door against the use of the note issue in order to meet any losses that might have beeD sustained. I shall now quote a paragraph from bank agreed to find under its alleged unconditional promisu to pay 4s. per bushel at sidings for wheat under the Wheat Marketing Bill. In tbe course of bis reply, Sir Robert Gibson saidI am glad that the honourable senator referred to an "" alleged unconditional promise."" I am not aware of it myself. So far as I am aware, no unconditional promise or arrangement was ever suggested by the Commonwealth Banki n regard to rinding £20,000,000. unconditional promise ""was made. Trade and Customs has actually admitted that no unconditional promise was made. That is my whole point, and it is the point at issue between those who support the views that I hold on this subject and those who support the contention of the Government. There was no tangible, unconditional promise made by the bank that it would provide the money to pay 4s. per bushel for the wheat. clusion, I assert, first, that the bank never gave an unconditional guarantee to find the money necessary to pay 4s. per bushel for wheat at railway sidings; secondly, that the conditions imposed could not have been fulfilled by the Commonwealth and State Governments, or by the Commonwealth Government alone; and, finally, that on the evidence available it is abundantly apparent that the necessary finance was not available, and that the Minister for Markets has, wittingly or unwittingly, misled the country on this subject. Health) Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), in speaking on this subject, made it clear that the Commonwealth Bank was prepared, prior to the beginning of the wheat harvest, to find the money to pay a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel for wheat. Any one who reads the memorandum of the Commonwealth Bank on this subject, which I have done, must admit that tbere is abundant evidence to justify the making of that statement. honourable member for Henty( Mr ber for He n t y ( Mr Gullett) to shake Gullett) has said that no promise was given by the Commonwealth Bank to finance the proposed wheat pool up to 4s. per bushel. unconditional promise had been given. promise was given, as the honourable member will see if he will read the memorandum carefully. He has suggested that the Minister for Markets has, from the very commencement of the negotiations, misled the House and the public. The vital parts of the memorandum are paragraphs 8 to 12. graph 6 ? ber may quote it if he so desires. The vital paragraphs of the memorandum, which prove beyond a doubt that the Commonwealth Bank did undertake to provide the money to pay 4s. a bushel for the wheat, are paragraphs 8 to 12. The y read as f o l l o w s : (8) That the total to be provided by the bank is based upon 4s. per bushel for f.a.q. wheat delivered at the railway station, plus In contransport charges, &c, which latter shall not exceed an average of 8d. per bushel f.o.b.

I did my utmost for them, and had it not been for the action of Senator Johnston and certain' Nationalists in another place, the Wheat Marketing Bill would have been passed. Now those gentlemen are retreating from trench to trench in an endeavour to defend themselves from the wrath of the wheat-growers, whom they deserted for the sake of the merchants. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) who, when I was in charge of the Department of Markets, was most helpful with advice in regard to the adoption of an orderly marketing scheme, said in the course of a very fair speech this afternoon that the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Wheat Marketing Bill, and that the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) supported it. The latter denied that statement and said he was not in the chamber when the amendment was moved. one of the monumental speeches which are characteristic of him, he supported his leader in unmeasured terms. The amendment by the Leader of the Opposition wasThis House is of opinion tliat, while present circumstances justif y a guarantee by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of a minimum price of 4s. per bushel for f.a,q. wheat, season 1930-31, delivered at railway sidings, legislation providing for such a guarantee should be introduced separately from any legislation providing for the establishment of a monopoly in the marketing of Australian wheat by means of a compulsory pool.

He saidI marvel that the Government should persevere with this bill, and persist in its p r e posal to have a compulsory pool; because it must be perfectly obvious to every honorable member that the Government must pay the guarantee for the coming harvest, Avhether the wheat-growers enter or remain out of the compulsory pool. The members of all parties, and of all State Governments who have been participating in the urge to "" Grow more wheat"", are committed up to the hilt to the guarantee of 4s. a bushel.

The schedule promise to provide the money for. the made the following provision for the guarantee. Would any bank be stupid State Governments to participate in the enough to make an unconditional promise guarantee:of that kind? The Minister for Markets said in effect that there was a promise to or outside Australia of wheat of the season provide a 4s. guarantee subject to the 1930-1931 grown in any State and delivered to adoption of a scheme of orderly marketState ing. Such a scheme was provided for in Bank and should such proceeds be less than the the bill that was rejected by the Senate. dition ? Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board in a memorandum to the Government on this matter saidThat nnance is undertaken on the understanding tliat the realization of the wheat shall he a continuous operation and to such an extent as is necessary to meet the approxifor Henty has admitted that all parties mate requirements of the bank as set out in the formula contained herein . . . That formula provided for certain sales <to be made in each month from December, 1930, to September, 1931, and for the payments to the growers to be spread over the months November to Eebruary. The orderly marketing scheme had to be approved by both Houses of this Parliament. Another condition wasThat should the trading banks not be prepared to join in with the Commonwealth Bank on the proposed nuance, the Government will issue such treasury-bills as may be required by the bank from time to time, to such extent as may be necessary to supplement the funds of the bank. Provision for. the issue of these treasury bills was made in clause 8 of the bill as follows:(1.) The Treasurer may, from time to time, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1927, or under the provisions of any Act authorizing the issue of Treasury Bills, borrow such moneys as are necessary for supplementing the funds of the Commonwealth Bank for the purposes of making payments by the Bank in pursuance oi the agreements executed by or on behalf of the Commonwealth in pursuance of this Act. (2.) The amounts borrowed shall be issued and applied only for the expenses of borrowing and for supplementing the funds of the Commonwealth Bank for the purposes of making payments by the Bank in pursuance of the agreement so executed. (3.) Payments made to the Bank under the last preceding sub-section shall be at such rate of interest and be subject to such terms and conditions as to repayment as are agreed upon between the Treasurer and the Bank. 13. All proceeds of sales either in Australia, Wheat Boards pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid into the Commonwealth amount of the payments to the wheat-growers and the freight and other expenses advanced by the Commonwealth Bank as aforesaid in respect of such wheat, together with interest on such amount, the Commonwealth will pay to the Commonwealth Bank half of the deficiency and that State will pay to the Commonwealth Bank the remaining half of the deficiency. No member of the Government ever suggested that the .promise of the bank was unconditional. The honourable member were committed to the guarantee up to the hilt. The Commonwealth Bank was committed subject to certain conditions, and had the Senate passed the Wheat Marketing Bill, the bank would have honoured its promise, and the whole of the people would have been asked to bear a fair share of the burden, instead of the whole of it being placed on the wheat growers, thousands of whom are now being driven off the land. The Minister for Trade and Customs and others who quoted extracts from the memorandum submitted to the Government by the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, omitted reference to one of the most material clauses, and I consider it my duty to place it on record. I do not for a moment suggest the least lack of sincerity on the part of the the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) when they say that, having read the correspondence, they consider that the bank had guaranteed to find the money. I believe they have overlooked the conditions in paragraph 6 of the memorandum. I am not sure, however, that I can say the same of the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney). Paragraph 6 practically amounts to a condition in the undertaking of the bank that it would find the money, provided there was no loss, or provided",51,Adjournment Wheat Guarantee

That clause statesThati t is to be clearly understood that the bank cannot undertake to be responsible for financing the Government and/or any State Government concerned in respect of any loss it may have to make good, but the bank will consider any. application for nnance for this purpose in the light of such total obligathe susceptibilities of members of the tions as any government may be under to the bank at any given time. That makes it quite clear that the bank was prepared to find the necessary finance to pay out the whole cheque for the wheat during the first few weeks of the season, but was not prepared to unconditionally finance the Commonwealth or any State Government to make up any loss. to accept treasury-bills. required the further safeguard of treasury-bills under certain eventualities. I certainly make no apology for having supported the amendment submitted by the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) that the question of the guarantee should ho treated separately from, that of the compulsory pool. The Opposition made a mistake when the bill was going through, and accepted the assurance of the Minister for Markets, and other members of the Government, that matters in connection with the financing of the scheme were satisfactory. We considered then that, if the necessary nnance was available, the farmers should have the benefit of it, without being forced into a compulsory pool, which was odious to a great many of them. Honourable members on this side, and a great many farmers, have been taken in over this matter. member say that the Commonwealth Bank would not have found the money if the bill had been passed? . undertake to finance any government in making up losses. The agreement provided that the losses were to be computed monthly, and the Government had to pay the money on demand. If that did not impose a condition that the Government should undertake the responsibility for making up any loss, I cannot imagine a clearer provision for doing so. I find it almost painful to differ from the' Minister for Health in his interpretation of the memorandum, because I am absolutely satisfied that he is 100 per cent, sincere in what he has said concerning it. YetI feel sure that he overlooked paragraph 6, which is framed in very tactful language, so as not to offend Government. It is clear that the Opposition was fully justified in raising this question, and honourable members in this House, as well as those in another place, who expressed doubt as to whether the farmers ever would receive the 4s., were fully justified in those doubts. I hope that, without recriminations regarding what has happened in the past, all honourable members will work together in this matter henceforth, so that next year the best interests of the wheat-growers will be consGrvcid honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) gave certain honourable members credit for sincerity in regard to the wheat guarantee, but declined to admit honesty of purpose on the part of the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), though no member of this Parliament has shown greater sincerity than he has in connection with the wheat problem. It would appear to me that members of the Opposition, who have always opposed the Wheat Marketing Bill, are grasping at a straw in their effort to find an excuse for their attitude in the past to the proposals of the Government. This afternoon the Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has declared that the Government could not find the 4s. a bushel, and that, therefore, the Opposition voted against the measure. That statement has honourable been ably disposed of by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). Honourable members opposite _ are now trying to justify their attitude by an allegation of insincerity regarding this measure on the part of the Minister for Markets. If those honourable members, and their fellow members of another place, had been as sincere in this matter as the Minister has been, the farmers would have had the 4s. guarantee, and the people generally would havo been saved a great deal of the hardship under which they are now labouring.

Nobody with the slightest knowledge of the position could come to any other conclusion. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) made an appeal to the Government to overcome the difficult situation that has arisen. Too much has been said about insincerity. If there has been any insincerity, it has been shown by honourable members opposite. An attempt to pass a bill providing for a compulsory wheat pool failed. Then, in December, the Government introduced a measure providing for a guarantee of 3s. a bushel f.o.b., or 2s. 3d. u bushel at sidings. That bill passed through both Houses. If the Government was sincere in its desire to help the farmers, why did it not have that legislation proclaimed? If some portion of it was found to be not constitutional, it could have been amended later. And even if the farmers could not have been paid 3s. per bushel in cash, they could have been given something in the nature of a voucher to the effect that they would bo paid later. Traders would have been prepared to accept such vouchers. Honourable members did not know for some time after the House rose for the Christmas vacation that the measure bad not been proclaimed. mend.
