The only fault I have to find with the distribution proposed is that Queensland is not divided into ten electorates instead of nine. If the population in that State was counted according to tlie method that has been adopted in Victoria, Queensland would be entitled to an additional member; but I understand that this is not the proper time at which to discuss that question. I intend to oppose the motion, and I hope that other representatives of Queensland will do the same, because I believe that the electors of that State are looking forward to being able to exercise tlie franchise under the proposed distribution at the next election. that the motion proposed by the Minister would be earned on the voices, because it seems to me that the action of the Commissioner for Queensland is practically indefensible. The honourable member for North Sydney referred last night to the fact that no objections had been raised ; but every one who has had anything to do with politics knows very well that in matters of this kind theelectorsare particularly apathetic Under the conditions of the Electoral Act, copies of the Commissioner's recommendation had to be exhibited for thirty days, and certain forms had to be complied with, and very few men indeed, beyond those intimately concerned, are willing to take any trouble in these matters. difficult even to induce men to go to the poll and lecord their votes, and it is a ever was taken.' Only two objections were lodged-on e from myself, and one from a Cairns political organization. should like to point out to those honourable members who are exclaiming against the existing divisions, as compared with those proposed by the Commissioner, that, out of really interested in the proposed change. The honourable member for Oxley told us .that when he was last in Brisbanehe met a number of people from the country. It is the residents in the' country districts who are most interested.in this proposal, and I feel sure that they will not object to our adhering to the old d i v i sions for the present. The electors of Maranoa and Kennedy are particularly well represented at present, seeing that they areaccorded more than the ful l value of theirvotes. Some complaint might be made by the electors in the district represented by the honourable member for Oxley, and in the Brisbane electorate represented, district has 3,443 electors in excess of the quota, whereas in Oxley there are only 1,583 in excess. Of the whole of the electorates there are only three which do not comeeither within the maximum or the minimum. The electors in the Moreton division come within the maximum, and there areonly three electorates which would be really affected by our adhering to the present divisions instead of adopting those proposed by affected are Wide Bay, Herbert, Capricornia, Moreton, Darling Downs, and Kennedy. In the Maranoa district the number of voters is below the minimum but the electors there have no reason to complain, because their votes possess their f u l l value. It is. significant that when the later divisions most of the northern public journals werein favour of them. It is true they declared that the divisions might have been improved upon; but no very serious complaints were urged, and it was thought that under thecircumstances'they might well be accepted. For instance, a leading newspaper in the.electorate of Capricornia was in favour of them, and so also were several journals in my own electorate. The great outcry It is which is alleged to have been made was confined to a few , persons who were particularly interested in the matter, wonder that any action whatand who desired the electorates to beso arranged that they could "" d is h "" the Labour party. That was their expressed I desire. But the most significant feature of the whole proceedings was the change , of map was certainly an improvement upon the present one, although the divisions then 22.2,100 electors, only 5,026 are prepared could not be highly commended.

Possibly the Minister' can inform us. that the Commissioner was interfered with. House what I have heard, upon very good authority,although myauthorityis not a Minister. Fortunately, there are other avenues of information open to honourable members, otherwise we might sometimes be kept completely in the dark upon most important matters. I have been informed, upon good authority, that on the morning after the original map was published, the Premier of Queensland aud the Minister for Railways bounced him into withdrawing it, and substituting for it the electoral boundaries which he now proposes. much for the Commissioner. for that officer. I challenge the Minister to inform the House whether my statement is accurate. I believe that he has the information which will confirm what I say. If that be so, I ask him to lay it upon the table of the House. If my information is accurate, every honourable member ought to vote in favour of the rejection of the Commissioner's recommendations, if only to evidence their disapprobation of the action of certain State Ministers. be substantiated every honourable member will. pass what is practically a vote of censure upon the Commissioner for having allowed himself to be dominated by State Ministers in that way. protect his officer ? the Minister to answer. I trust that the information for which I have asked will be forthcoming. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I intend to support the proposal submitted by the Government. I do so, because I believe that the Electoral Act was intended to confer upon this House a true revising power. It was never meant that that power should be used for party or political purposes by either side of the House. power which we are asked to exercise ? MrL . E. GROOM -It is a power of rejection which we should exercise. Regarding the proposed new electorates in I wish to tell the Queensland, I do not think it can be said that the Ministry desire their rejection upon any personal grounds whatever. To my mind there is ample justification for rejecting the whole of the electoral divisions proposed in that State, because they do not constitute the best scheme that has been submitted to the people. If we take into consideration the conditions laid down in the Act in reference to community or diversity.of interest, means of communication, geographical position, and existing boundaries, I hold that the second scheme proposed by the Commissioner is not the best one possible. I have in my hand the first map of the new Federal electorateswhich was published in the Brisbane Courier upon It says nothing at all the 11th of Junelast. If honourable members will look at it they will at once realize the tremendous changes that have been effected in it, especially in the electorates of Kennedy, Herbert, Maranoa, Capricornia, and Darling Downs. The boundaries recommended in the electorates of Brisbane, Oxley, and Moreton are practically unaltered. The remaining districts, however, have been completely changed for some reason oi' other which is not patent upon the face of this report. W it h a view to ascertain what had brought about this change, I consulted the files of the Brisbane Courier. From'these I gather that the original scheme recommended I think that we should by the Commissioner was published in that newspaper upon the 11th of June of the report was printed, and that officer declared that his desire was to place the scheme before the public at the earliest possible moment. Upon the very next morning however, and before the scheme could possibly have reached the electorates of Kennedy, Maranoa, and Darling Downs, a paragraph was published in the journal to which I have referred stating that there was sharp criticism in political circles of",15,Avilliam Lyne I T Is A Pity That The Existing Boundaries Of The Divisions

If the House rejects the scheme submitted by. the Commissioner, and we are compelled to adopt the electoral divisions made by the State Legislature some three years ago, we shall revert to conditions under which, according to the Courier, the party which is opposed to labour will be given a distinct advantage. learned member himself believe that statement ? MrL . E. GROOM I will express my own belief presently. I am now dealing with the historical aspect of this matter. The Courier paragraph declares that, according to the divisions made by the State Legislature, the Labour party will lose some seats, and complains that the divisions originally subthey .gave such an excellent chance of success to the candidates of the Labour party, It continuesMoreover, whatever strength there was at Townsville will now be counter-balanced by the strong Labour vote at Charters Towers in the case of the Kennedy division, into which it has been thrown. The same newspaper finds fault with the inclusion of Mount Morgani n the Maranoa division, but of the other divisions it says that "" l it t l e criticism is offered."" Upon the very day succeeding the publication of the Commissioner's original map this criticism appeared in a public journal which is published in the capital of Queensland. MrL . E. GROOM -That statement was published on tlie 12th June. The next statement appeared in the Courier on the 18th June. On that date this newspaper published an interview with Mr event placed in their order before us, soMcDowall, in which the Commissioner explained the jnosition taken up by him. He justified his division, and pointed out the reasons why it should be retained. On .the 19th June the Courier published a leader in which it found fault with tlie scheme, on the ground that it showed a want of regard for the community of interest. It then went on to say that the matter of means of communicationis no doubt important, but affords no justification for the wholesale amalgamation of interests such as is to be found iu the new electorate of Herbert. It considered that a neglect of the sugar, mining, pastoral, and other industries was shown, and urged that special representation should be given to the tropical agricultural interests. It saidWhile the sugar industry itself may be voiceless unless we insure a victory in the Wide Bay electorate. I am not aware that it is voiceless at the present time, but the Cou/rier maintains, that it is. It went on to say thatThe present division of Herbert would be a. disfranchisement of the old electorate as originally defined for the purposes of the first Federal election. It then proceeded to raise objection to the Kennedy and Maranoa divisions, and stated thatThe directions plainly given by the Federal. Electoral Act and the electoral divisions, clearly marked out by tlie State Government, have been, alike repudiated, with the result of creating dissatisfaction everywhere outside of the SouthEastern electorates. It is therefore gratifying to learn that the Commissioner has stayed hishand, and that there is apparently some prospect of amended boundaries being devised before the electoral maps are exhibited in the various, divisions as required b} law. 7 Immediately after the publication of this out, and, on the 25th June, the Courier published an article expressing its appreciation of the changes that had been made is taking an active interest in this matter. MrL . E. GROOM-The Couriersimply recorded the historical sequence of events. It is well able to take care of itself. It has a right to fight as it thinks fit, and I am not making any suggestions in regard to it . But when we come as a judicial body to consider this matter, and to determine whether we should or should not accept this distribution, I contend that we should have the various stages of each that we may justly appreciate the significance of the work which we are called upon to perform.

64,Sir William Lyne,"So far as thewas defending his position, he said, in the course of an interview with the Courier reporter, thatAs previously explained, the deficiency in Maranoa might have been supplied by lopping Dalby and Carnarvon off the Darling Downs and adding them to Maranoa; but these two districts, Dalby and Carnarvon, include centres of population which it was thought unwise to separate from the Downs, and which could have little or no community of interests with such places as Betoota, Boulia, and the areas lying along our western border. He practically makes this admission again in his own report. He saysThis excision of Dalby and Carnarvon from Darling Downs was very distasteful to me, aud I endeavoured to avoid it ; and it was only to avoid posed scheme,while the Dalby Leader, a worse combination that I was compelled to adopt it. I know that the fruit-growers of Stanthorpe, the tobacco-growers of Texas, and the farmers of Inglewood arid Goondiwindi, not to mention the Dalby people, will feel themselves badly mated with the immense but sparsely populated grazing country extending to the South Australian border, but with a margin of only one-fifth allowable, some of the more populous districts nearer the coast had to assist in bringing up the Commissioner's report, they will see that the numbers to the minimum permissible under the Act. In his previous report he pointed out that, through lack of community of interest, he had excluded Dalby and Carnarvon from the Maranoa electorate. The Brisbane Courier, in its article of appreciation, saysIt is rightly enough argued that the lastmentioned (Darling Downs) electorate, which is a well-defined geograpical and agricultural unity, has been somewhat mutilated in the new division. But because representation is given, as it believes, to the opponents of a certain political party, it is quite prepared to support the mutilation. Oxley has stated that he has heard no complaint as to the way in which the divisions have been laid out. I am afraid that he has heard only the felicitations of those who admire his representation of certain interests, or the expression of views in regard to the demarcation of his own electorate; I doubt if he came into contact with representative men from the other electorates, and got their opinions upon the position. many. MrL . E. GROOM I am afraid that the honourable member did not meet the Courier representative at Carnarvon, who writes* from Stanthorpe to that journal to say that Much dissatisfaction is expressed with the inclusion of Carnarvon in the Federal division of Maranoa. It is felt that Carnarvon has much more in common with the Darling Downs than the western districts of which Maranoa is chiefly composed. It is also thought that the Carnavon electorate would not be represented so well in Maranoa as they have been in the Darling Downs, and that it is unfair to isolate this electorate from the adjacent district, where the community of interests is much greater than can be hoped for in the case of the western electorate. If honourable members read the newspapers published in that part of Queensland, they will see that much dissatisfaction has been expressed with the Commissioner's distribution. The Border Post, published at Stanthorpe, protests strongly against the position of that district in the proa newspaper published at the other end of the electorate, takes a similar position, pointing out that Dalby is really a part of Darling Downs, and should not be placed in another electorate. Similar dissatisfaction has been expressed in other divisions. If honourable members turn to very strong objections were raised by the people of Herbert to his proposals, and strong objections have been urged against them by newspapers circulating in other parts of the State. I believe that the first scheme proposed was, except for a flaw in . regard to the demarcation of the Capricornia division, and which I think might have been altered to meet the requirements of the Electoral Act, the best that could have been put forward, and if submitted to Parliament would have been adopted. I regret the agitation which has been started, not for the good of QueensThe honourable member for land, to obtain the due representation of its various interests, but purely for political purposes. We should show our disapproval of it by the rejection of the Commissioner's scheme in tolo. In exercising our powers as a revising body, we are justified in trying to get at the true state of affairs, and to do justice to the ' whole State. I saw a good only a few words to say on this motion, because I think that its discussion should be left largely to the members of the State. I shall vote against the Government because, among other reasons, I think that the Electoral Act requires that, where either House does not approve of a proposed distribution, the Executive must send it back to the Commissioner for '",18,Avilliam Lyne I T Is A Pity That The Existing Boundaries Of The Divisions

Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution of the State into divisions. I say that that provision is imperative. If honourable members look at section 21, they w'll see that the word "" may "" is used in regard to the issue of a proclamation by the Governor General when both Houses of Parliament have passed a resolution approving of any proposed distribution. It cannot be argued that any option is given in regard to the issue of that proclamation. Similarly the word "" m a y "" must be regarded as imperative in section 22. Therefore, if either House rejects a proposed distribution, the Minister must send it back to the Commissioner with instructions to him to propose a fresh distribution. may be said that it is now too late to do that. our only alternative is to accept the distribution proposed. it likes by passing a Bill. violate the provisions of. the Electoral Act. ment intend to introduce a Bill. the introduction of a B ill to vary the terms of an Act which contemplates the securing of uniformity in regard to Federal elections. Unless a Bill is introduced to apply to all the States, and the distribution of South Australia is repudiated, tlie essential principle of Federal legislation, which is the securing of uniformity, will be violated. Althoughi t is not prescribed hy the express words of the Constitution that there shall be uniformity in regard to legislation on any of the matters set out in section 51 of that Act, it is evident that the object of all Federal legislation should be to promote uniformity : but if the Government pass such a Bill as is spoken of there will not be uniformity, unless the South Australian division is repudiated, and that is not contemplated. by dividing the hitherto undivided States1 not all be divided under the same Act. They will be divided under two Acts, the 8 T 2 Section 22 of the Act provisions of which will not be the same. Anything we do in this matter should be done by one Act. We should not have two Acts, one of which provides for a method of distribution inconsistent with that provided for by the other. For instance, while section 16 of the Electoral Act provides that in the making of any distribution regard shall be had to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, and existing boundaries, it is not certain that due consideration was given to those matters in . the original division of the States by the States Parliaments. Nor is it certain that the States Acts contain the provision that the number of electors in any division shall not exceed or be below the quota by a difference of more than one-fifth. The provisions in the Electoral Act in regard to that and other matters are imperative, and they should apply to the distribution of all It the States. If we provide for the distribution of South Australia and Western AusI f so, the Minister is to blame, and tralia by one Act, and that of Queensland, New Soubh Wales, and Victoria by another, in which the States divisions are re-adopted, we shall violate the essential principle of federation, because we shall allow the existence of different conditions in the various States. the Commissioners are based on different quotas. the details of the distributions, because they have already been fully dealt with. All the Commissioners were bound by the terms of the Electoral Act, and I do not think that the provisions of that measure have been violated by any of them. If we allow the State electorates to stand, in a great many insbances we should violate the principle of division prescribed, the ground of electoral uniformity. renewing the old electorates be a Federal Act? of the existing divisions were made under State Electoral Acts, some of which adopted different principles from those laid down in obtained the Commonwealth Act, under which Soubh Ausbralia and obher States will be divided.

76,Mr Guvnn,"No doubt; but the wholeand these diverse principles will be repugnant to the spirit of Federal legislation. This consideration will compel me to vote against the proposal of. the Government. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN (Wentworth) I recognise that the details of the matter under debate should be undertaken by the representatives of Queensland. Buti t does seem to me that in a general way there is nothing before us, either on the surface of the Commissioner's report or in the representations of the Minister, or, allowing for everything that has been said by one or two of the Queensland members, to justify the absolute dismissal of the procedure prescribed for the protection of the Queensland people. Only two notices of objection to the proposed divisions were received by the Commissioner, and those have been dealt with by him. I should like to know how we could possibly expect any kind of unanimity of feeling with regard to the distribution of electorates in a State like Queensland. AVe have there a handful of members representing an area in which it must be almost impossible to comply with the conditions set forth in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. apply only to two electorates. Sir AVILLI AM M c MILLAN is that the division, has been carefully done, presumably after much consideration ; but Queensland is a State which has such an enormous territory that it would be impossible'to please everybody, and impossible to comply with the ordinary conditions laid down in the Electoral Act. Therefore, if we postpone the distribution until after the next election there is no reason to believe -as far as any evidence before us goesthat we shall obtain a better result than is before us today. In view of all the circumstances, in view of the speeches made by some of the representatives of Queensland, in the face of the evidence itself, and of the absolutely meagre information which we have obtained from the Government, we must attribute the tactics adopted in this case to the same motives as induced the tactics which prevailed in dealing with New South Wales. AVe must assume that for certain political reasons, more with a view of safeguarding themselves in their opinion at the next general election than from any other consideration, the Government have sacrificed the whole of the principles of the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth. AVe must assume that they have done this in order to suit their own purposes. been particularly interested in the proposals for the distribution of seats for the Federal Parliament, because in the State from which I have come we have had for many years a very bitter experiencein that connection with regard to the State Parliament. In Western Australia the distribution of seats was so disproportionate that for years and years it was a source of continual agitation. Therefore the people of AVestern Australia are particularly well educated on the question. They know how the principles of representative government may be defeated by a method of distribution. In that State we had as many as a dozen electorates at one time, each one of which returned a member to the State Parliament, whilst the sum total of the electors in those constituencies was not so great as the number in one other district. For instance, we had a district which had forty-six electors on the roll, but which returned a member to Parliament; and there was another district with close upon 6,000 electors which also returned only one member. small enough for the honourable member ? of difficulty about reconciling that system of representation with any. democratic ideas. I am much surprised that any honourable member holding democratic opinions should seem to favor such a state of things. I must assume that the honourable member for Maranoa is not in earnest in his interjection, because I am perfectly sure that he favors the principle of equal electorates, and recognises as fully as I do that that principle is the only one by means of which we can secure a fair representation of the people. For the reason I have given, I . am particularly interested in the system of distribution. AVhilst the proposal of the Government is not in the matter of discrepancies so bad as the system which existed for so long in AVestern Australia-and which to a certain extent still exists therenevertheless the discrepancies which may be found in these proposals are very great indeed. They are so great that I am surprised that so many honourable members holding liberal views should support them.",20,Avilliam Lyne I T Is A Pity That The Existing Boundaries Of The Divisions

80,Mr Kirwan,"I can see a great dealA statement has been made by the honourable member for Herbert that certainly was 6f a very surprising character indeed. He asserted that the Premier and the Minister of Railways in Queensland interfered with the Commissioner in the distribution of electorates for the State. According to what the honourable member said, a distribution had .been arranged by -the Commissioner, and the scheme had been -published in the press of Brisbane, but subsequent to its publication the Commissioner, owing to the representations of the gentlemen mentioned, was induced to entirely alter the boundaries. Of course, as a private individual, the Premier of Queensland, just like any other individual, was entitled to make objections. interfere with the Commissioner. MrL . E. GROOM -A t that time the first scheme had not been published and advertised. titled to make an objection subsequent to the'official announcement as any private individual, might do. But the-method he adopted was reprehensible in the. extreme. If the statement of the honourable member for Herbert be correct and I presume he would not have made it unless -he had very good authority for it it is not to the credit of the Premier and the Minister of Railways of that State. .Nor is it creditable to the Commissioner that he allowed himself to be influenced by any such representations. But the way in which we ought to-view the proposals of the Government is as follows :-We have now before us, irrespective of the representations which may have been brought to bear upon the Commissioner, the old scheme which was made three years ago under a different franchise, and when the conditions were altogether different from what they are now, and the new scheme arranged by the -Commissioner appointed for the purpose. I gather from the report that there are great discrepancies in the numbers of electors in the present divisions. In the Brisbane -electorate there are 33,057 electors, and in the district of Oxley 31,197. On the other -hand, the district of Kennedy has 18,897 -electors, and Maranoa only 16,484. It will therefore be seen that there are in .Brisbane twice as many electors as in Maranoa. Under these circumstances, I -fail to see how any honourable members holding liberal views can do other than approve of the distribution proposed by the Commissioner in preference to that made three years ago. noted with interest what was said by the Minister in introducing this resolution. He put it that the very sudden alteration of the divisions first proposed to tlie distribution now before us was of an extraordinary character. The matter has been gone into more closely to-day, and some honourable members have stated that the Premier of Queensland and the Minister of Railways interviewed the Commissioner and brought pressure to bear which occasioned the change. We ought to know exactly what are the facts in this connection. My own notion is that no one has a right to pri.vately interview the Commissioner on the subject. He is in the position of a judge, and in order that he shall not make any mistake for want of information, there is a The Premier was enprocedure prescribed by which he may be enlightened. TheA ct provides thatObjections or suggestions in writing may be lodged with the Commissioner not later that thirty (lays after the first publication of the proposed distribution, and tbe Commissioner shall consider all objections and suggestions so lodged before making bis report. That is a safe and proper mode of procedure, and no private "" ear-wigging"" of. the Commissioner, and no private proceedings which cannot be examined afterwards, should be permitted. If anything has to be represented to the Commissioner, it should be put in writing, so that in the ordinary course it might be regularly 'placed before the House. ' I strongly object to anything in the shape of swaying a judge-and the Commissioner is in the position of a judge -wh o holds, to some extent, the future political existence of honourable members in his hands. The mode in which information can be brought under his notice is prescribed in the Act, and nothing else thould be permitted. If there has been any attempt of the character referred to by a member of this Parliament, or of any other Parliament, the fact ought to be known, and I ask the Minister straight, in the interests of right, whether he knows of anything which warrants the suggestion that there has been any conduct of the kind attributed to the gentlemen named?",21,Avilliam Lyne I T Is A Pity That The Existing Boundaries Of The Divisions

From section. 13 onwards there are a series of provisions which deal with matters from the appointment of a Commissioner down to the submission of his report and map to Parliament.

I am unable to -understand the argument that although we -cannot search the mind of the Commissioner we are to swallow everything he does unless we can bring evidence that would be sufficient to convict him in a court of justice of doing something morally or monstrously wrong.

Buti t does seem to me that if, iipon material such as the Minister brings before us, or that we may gather from our -fellow membei-s, we arrive at the conclusion that bhe distribution would be wrong, it is our bounden duty, irrespective of any feeling in regard to the Commissioner, and, while thinking that he has honestly en-deavoured to do his duty, to say bhat we -disapprove of it and bhab it shall not be law. -I suggest that the honourable and learned member for Indi has been chasing a shadow? No one has ever set up 'the contention that we must perforce accept the dictum of the -Commissioner. No one has put forward an absurd proposition of that k in d ; nor has Any one said that we should surrender ourselves politically body and soul inbo the hands of the Commissioner. All that is -contended is that it is wise and prudent for the House to accept the verdict of the Com-missioner, unless it can show good reasons for the adoption of an opposite course. ' That is the only suggestion that has been indicated throughout the debate, and it is the position which the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, sets up. He says that we are bound under the Electoral Act to do cerbain things, and that, in his opinion, it would be better for honourable members to keep away from the Commissioner He never suggested, as the honourable and learned member appears to think he did, that it would be improper or illegal for any honourable member to ment was that in his opinion it would be better for us ' to keep away from the officer, and that is our contention. While the honourable and learned member for Indi has been chasing these legal subtleties, he has not given a single reason why we should vote against the determination of the Commissioner for Queensland ; nor have I heard any given during bhe whole debate, save one, which reflects most seriously upon the integrity and ability of that officer. The honourable member for Herbert charged the Commissioner with having been manipulated by certain people in Queensland, and the Minister for Trade and Customs, in substantiating that sbatment in an interjection, said that it would have been better if certain persons had kept away from him. That is the way in which the Minister puts the position, clearly leaving it to be inferred that bhe Commissioner has been led by theinterference of Queensland Ministers to do somebhingwhich heotherwise wouldnobhavedone. That is practically an allegation of a corrupt action on the part of the Commissioner. It is a serious statement to make, especially when we remember that the man againsb whom it is levelled is not here to reply for himself. Surely the least that we can do is to probe these allegations to the bottom and to see whether there is a substantial basis for them. We owe it to bhe Commissioner bo clear bhe suspicion sought to be woven about him in this Chamber. We obtain the services of a State officer to do this work, and then we turn round and accuse him of having been corruptly manipulated by the Ministry he has served in the State. If the Minister for Trade and Customs knew that the Commissioner had been improperly influenced by Queensland Ministers it was his bounden duty not to submit this scheme to the House. On making the discovery, he should have insbantly discharged him and appointed another man in his place. It is an insult bo the House to bring down for",25,William Lyne I Am Compelled

Our indictment of the Government is that they are departing from the spirit of the Electoral Act. They may be saved upon the' letter of some miserable clause; but if they cannot rely upon their Ministers to defendare to be saved in that way, let us exactly understand the position. So far as the spirit of the electoral law is concerned, everyone must admit that the idea running right through the Act is that we must leave the work of distributing the electoral areas to impartial Commissioners, with no political ideas to sway them one way orthe other. I admit that Parliament has the reserve power to accept or reject the recomMinister to support him, and yet the Minismendations of the Commissioners, and I have never contended that we should give up our final right in that respect. But beto say a word ? fore the work of a Commissioner is rejected, it should be shown that upon high public grounds it is bad, and has been done in such a way as to imperil the principle laid down in the Act.

Mr F. E. M c LEAN already ruled that I cannot refer to what was said during the previous debate, and, therefore, I shall not refer to what was stated 3'esterday. We are confronted with the report of the Commissioner for Queensland, who has acted according to law.' He had instructions from the Minister to divide the State into electorates on the basis of proportional representation. that he has established a quota and divided the State on the basis of that quota, that he has used the margin allowed, and that he has exhibited his maps in accordance with law ; and, finally, he has submitted his report. Now we are called upon to say whether we approve or disapprove of the divisions made by him. It has not been suggested that the distribution has not been made upon the principle of proportional representation. which ho was called upon to give due consideration when making the distribution. He says' In making the distribution I gave due consideration to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of divisions he did not do. Mr F. E. M c LEAN I should like the honourable member to take the opportunity which will be afforded him to show in what due consideration to these matters. The Minister has not satisfied the House upon that point. honourable and learned member for Darling Downs show that the Commissioner had failed in that respect 1 Mr F. E. M c LEAN ' and learned member showed that there had been departures to some extent from these principles; but it must be recognised that the boundaries of existing electorates cannot be preserved if effect is to be given to the principle of proportional representation. All that is required is that the Commissioner should give due consideration to the matters I have mentioned so far as may be consistent with securing proportional representation. He. can only depart from the quota by one-fifth over or under. He cannot preserve existing boundaries absolutely. There must be a variation of boundaries from time to time if the population basis as laid down by the Act Mr Speaker has is to be adhered to. In Queensland there are at present the same anomalies as to population that have been pointed out in New South Wales and Victoria. If the existing boundaries are preserved, the electorate of Brisbane will have 33,000 voters, which honourable members will notice is nearly 50 per cent, in advance of the quota., whereas the electorate of Maranoa would have He tells us only 16,000 electors. Is it fair that .because a man lives in Brisbane he shall vote only as' one of 33,000, whilst an elector in Maranoa is permitted to vote as one of 16,000. In the proposed division of Maranoa there are 26,607 electors. The number within the present boundaries of that electorate is 16,4S4, whereas in the division of Brisbane under the existing boundaries there are 33,057 voters. This brings us back to the old trouble which was brought forward so prominently in the case of the other States, namely, that an elector in the country possessed twice the voting power of an elector in the metropolitan district. Is that a state of things which was contemplated by the Electoral Act1 Does it fit in with the principle of proportional representation which is embodied in the Constitution 1 learned member for Indi. MrF E. M c LEAN I shall not ask the honourable and learned member, because he would probably evade giving a direct answer by means of some technicality. No doubt he would point out that honourable members are labouring under a misconcepprovisions of the Electoral Act. The fact, however, is patent that in the district of Brisbane 33,000 electors are required to -The honourable return a representative to this House, whilst in the district of Mai'anoa only 16,484 are necessary.

216,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay),"It is notdesired to do the very thing against is an ex-Surveyor-General of Queensland, who knows what he is talking about. He was particularly desirous of giving a larger measure of representation to the country districts than to the metropolitan divisions. Such a proposal is entirely' in opposition to the whole trend of the discussion upon this motion. Concerning the arguments which have been used in support of the principle of one vote one value, I merely desire to say that they are very good in their way. But with the exception of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, not a single honourable member has contended that the principle . should be adhered to under all . conceivable circumstances. We have provided in our Electoral Act that it may be departed from to the extent of 40 per cent. I believe in that principle as much as does any one, although it is not incorporated in the platform of the Queensland Labour party. I admit that it is a good principle, but a*; the same time, we ought not to take extreme views upon this matter. There is one aspect of the question as regards Queensland which should be carefully kept in view. It is a mind which is so evenly adjusted that it is susceptible to representations by any party. That is patent from the fact that in his first report he set out in the most precise way the reasons which influenced him in arriving at the divisions which he recommended. In his second report, however, he controverts some of the arguments which he had previously used. Therefore, I hold that it is not necessary to prove that undue influence was brought to bear in order to warrant us in rejecting his recommendations. There is still another aspect of this matter, which I think should be put by a Queensland representative; and, perhaps, I can put it with more grace, because the district of Wide Bay, which I represent, would not be affected under either of the schemes recommended by the Commissioner. MrA . PATERSON -Neithe r would Capriin question statescornia. under the scheme originally recommended yesterday, was Senator Ferguson, of Queensland, is to be carried further, it will be necessary Owing to it being his intention to make a proto embody all these reports in Hansard, so tracted stay in Britain, he will not stand for rethat we may be thoroughly protected.

MrA . PATERSON I referred to the second division. Bay would not be disturbed under either of the divisions recommended, so that I cannot be accused of having any personal interest in this matter. It is only fair, however, that I should statein the plainestpossible terms that Queensland standsalone in one particular respect. The.State Government there have avowedly set themselves the task of defeating the Labour party at the next Federal elections. Immediately the first divisions recommended by the Commissioner were published in the Queensland press, the State Premier, according to a wire which was despatched here, denounced them, and declared that he was. preparing a map of his own, which would set out a better distribution. I do not deny his right, to do anything that he haspower to do. Knowing him and his political associates, I am convinced that they will not fight shy of us for want of weaponswith which to achieve their purpose. WhilstI am dealing with this phase of the question, it might be as well if I quoted someevidence which ' comes from Western Australia. One of the representatives of Queensland in the Senate also holds aseat in the Legislative Council of that State at the present time.

At the next Federal election there would be a clear-cut issue between the Queensland Government and the Labour party in regard to the Senate seats, and he did not think'that one labour man would be returned. Each party would have three nominees, and the members of each were pledged to support the chosen candidates. He thought that Mr T. Glassey, undoubtedly the greatest democrat in the State, would not be re-elected, as he had not been chosen by either party, and if either supported him it would be endangering the position of its direct nominees.

I was not referring to any pressure being brought to bear on the Commissioner. I said at the outset of my speech that that I do not believe that question did not arise. I shall not discuss the question of whether or not undue influence has been brought to bear on .the Commissioner, and I should be very sorry to hear that it had. I venture to say that every Commissioner is more or less influenced, and I differ from the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, who appears to think that we are not competent to deal with the ' redistribution of seats. In my opinion, we are quite competent to do so, and any body of members constituting ihis House that was incapable of dealing with them would be unfit to represent the people. The final deci-r sion in the matter of the distribution should rest with the House, and I regret that we have not the power to revise these schemes. The suggestion has been made that the original distribution made by the Commissioner should be adopted. But, unfortunately, it is not before us, and I understand that it would be impossible to have it No . brought before the House. in the Bill. matter. I think, speaking generally, that the first distribution would be more satisfactory to the great majority of Queenslanders than is the one now before us. better to adopt it than to return this scheme to the Commissioner 1 ' ally concerned the difference between the two schemes is not very great.

The people, especially -the wives of settlers-and good settlers too been accepted, but we have rejected -hav e undoubtedly migrated to Brisbane. When the police collections were made, the state of affairs was not in anything like a normal condition. Much as I like the principle of one vote one value, I have a still greater regard for the proposition that we should endeavour to induce the people to settle in the back portions of Australia, and particularly in the State' of Queensland. There has been far too much centralization, And any little encouragement of a political character towards the settlement of the land shall not be wanting so far as I am concerned, even if it violates the great principle of one . vote one value. There must of course be some limit, but had this House fixed the margin at 50 instead of 40 per cent., that would cover the the other States. In dealing with the whole difference between the distribution made by the Commissioner and the old divisions. I regret that so much time has been occupied in dealing with the question, and that so much acrimony has been -imported into the debate; but I believe that some good result will follow from the discussion, and that, in any event, we shall all admit the good faith of those who take a certain course of action in regard to the matter. member for Wide Bay is to be congratulated upon the calm judicial way in which he has dealt with this question. But some of the reasons advanced by him in support of -the rejection of this scheme do not appeal to my mind, aud I shall endeavour to refute them. The honourable member asserts that the electorate of Maranoa is practically equal in size to the State of New South Wales, and is therefore entitled to special consideration. If theenormousareaof some of the Queensland electoratesis tobeconsidered, .why did the honourable member fail to. have regard to the extent of some of the divisions of South Australia when the distribution of that State was before us ? The South Australian electorate of Grey, for example, covers an area larger than Queensland itself. If it is right that special consideration should be given to people living in such extensive divisions, why did not the honourable member for Wide Bay, together with the supporters of the Government, fight for tha interests of that electorate? We have had several propositions put before us. The scheme of distribution for South Australia has the Victorian and New South Wales distributions, and it appears that a similar course is to be followed in regard to Queensland. Each. Commissioner, as his report has come before us, has been spoken of as the most able man who could be obtained for tlie work. Honourable members have praised the Queensland Commissioner, who was the Surveyor-General of the State, as they have praised the other Commissioners ; but in every case, with the exception of South Australia, they have disapproved of the proposed distribution. It is a remarkable thing that it was possible to observe the principle of one vote one value in South Australia with almost mathematical precision, but that it is impossible to do so in New South Wales and Victorian distributions we have had what I may call .the "" drought "" argument and the "" gum-tree "" argument advanced in support of the proposals of the Government, and now we have the worse argument of all, the "" gota t "" argument; honourable members imputing wrong-doing to the Queensland Commissioner in order to lead the House to disapprove of his proposed distribution. ber has been imputing motives to me from the very beginning of these discussions. in this Parliament or in the State Parliament, have I imputed motives to the honourable member.

It -cannot be argued that there are particular interests in Maranoa, or Kennedy, or Capricornia representation in this Parliament. The matters with which we can deal under the -Constitution are matters in which the people of Brisbane, and of the other cities -of the Commonwealth, are as much concerned -as are the people residing in the country -constituencies. If the administration of the Lands or the Mines or other similar Departments had been referred to the -Commonwealth, the position would be different. We are concerned with the people, not as electors in New South Wales or Queensland, or of any other State, but as electors of the Commonwealth.

The Minister has been asked, to inform the House as to the basis of the LYNE I have not said charge made against the Commissioner. If he had reason, before the report was laid upon the table of this House, to believe that the Commissioner had acted improperly, he should not have presented his recommendation. A Bil l will have to be brought in to give effect to the resolutions of Maranoa, for the House with regard to the electoral divisions, and it will then be possible to adopt the original recommendations of the Commissioner in regard to Queensland instead of retaining. the present unsatiswhich require particular factory divisions. The honourable member for Wide Bay said that it was right that it should be left to Parliament to deal with the distribution of the electorates, but I do not agree with him, because Commissioners, free from political influence, would not be likely to make such grave mistakes as would honourable members actuated by regard for their own interests. The Commissioners were chosen because they were practical and independent men, and their reports should not be set aside without the strongest reason. If it can be shown that the Commissioner* for Queensland has made a mistake his report should be referred back to him for reconsideration. personal explanation. I understood the honourable member for Dalley to infer that I had acted in collusion with a political association in Cairnsi n raising objections to the recommendations of the Commissionei.

Any remarks I may have to make will not be antagonistic to the honourable member, although I may have something to say with regard to the electorate which he represents. I do not think we should be called upon to set on one side the report of an officer of the strongest reasons aan be adduced. The honourable member for Kennedy was fair and honourable enough to admit that Mr gone carefully into the numbers of voters in the McDowall was held in high estimation in Queensland. is the ex-Surveyor-General of Queensland, and knows that State thoroughly.

Insinuations have been made thing is to be urged against his conduct or his report it should be done openly. The honourable member for Herbert took a thoroughly straightforward course in communicating with the Commissioner with respect to his proposed distribution of the electorates. He made certain suggestions, which were fully considered by that officer. We may gather something as to the nature of these suggestions from the replies given, McDowall wrote as follows :I have to thank you for your communication of the 9th inst., received this morning, suggestingcertain alterations in the boundaries of Herbert and Kennedy, and protesting against the inclusion of the pearl shellers of Thursday Island with the graziers of Western Queensland. As far as memory serves me, I tried the combinations 3'ou mention among the numerous otherarrangements of boundaries that I sketched out I haA'e not seen before deciding, mid as far as I recollect, there were objections as far as numbers were concerned, to say nothing of the separation of Mackay from the other snear districts I will give your suggestions careful consideration, and send you a lurther reply in a few days.

In reply to the objection urged by the honourable member for Herbert, the Commissioner states that it was quite impossible that the suggestions of the honourable member could be carried out. In perusing this document I find that ample evidence is forthcoming why the State could not be divided in the manner outlined by those who took the trouble to make suggestions to Mr. McDowall.

On The 13th July, Mr .","No doubt in the course of a few years we shall be able to secure a much more satisfactory distribution than it was possible for the Commissioner to make under tlie .mandatory directions which he received. Those directions are incorporated in theElectoral Act, which declares that in effecting the divisions the Commissioner shall give due consideration to community or diversity of interest; to means of communication; to physical features; and also to existing boundaries of divisions. As the officer in question had to comply with the terms of the Act in the particulars enumerated, he was unable to make any other division consistently with the faithful discharge of his duty. forgets that he previously made a different division. bility an officer charged with the task of dividing such a large State as that of Queensland, which embraces an area greater than that of Victoria and New South Wales combined Sir WILLIAM.LYJTE -It is twice as large as those two States combined. MrH ENRY WILLIS I can quite con-. '-ceive that an officer intrusted with that work jnight make several divisions before arriving at one which was satisfactory to himself. Of course, if the Commissioner submitted a plan of distribution to some person other than the Minister, it is for the latter to say whether such action was in the interests of the community. A t the same time it is incumbent upon any honourable member making such a covert charge against an officer to put it forward in the most definite and set terms possible so that the accused may be afforded an opportunity of replying. I have no sympathy with an officer who would go behind the back of his Minister and perform work to the satisfaction of State officials rather than of the Minister who engaged him on saysA study of tlie subject reveals the fact that the population of Queensland is very unevenly distributed, the bulk of the population being on or near the eastern sea-board. Settlement in Queensland is similar to that which has taken place in the other States, so that while it is impossible for the Commissioner to divide that State into electorates to the satisfaction of the representatives concerned, it is possible for him to cut it up to thesatisfaction of Parliament. I trust that when the good of the country is at stake we shall rise superior to personal interests. From the Commissioner's report, J conclude that Mr McDowall has discharged his duty faithfully, and to my mind it is incumbent upon the Minister to advance reasons why the scheme recommended by him should not be accepted. It is not right upon a mere ex parte statement to conclude that undue influence has been brought to bear upon the Commissioner in the performance of his duty. Before arriving at such an opinion, the Minister should be satisfied from unbeen unfaithful to his trust. Should he be so satisfied, it seems to me that a very serious situation would arise, inasmuch as In all probapossibly the officer in question would have to be retired from his position. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I assume that a good division has been effected-certainl y it constitutes a decided improvement upon the presentdivision. Under the electoral boundaries, as they now exist, there are 33,057 electors in the district of Brisbane, and only 16,484 in that of Maranoa. In the southern part of that State, therefore, an elector has more than twice the voting power of an elector in Brisbane. Surely no one can seriously urge that such a distribution is just, seeing that under our own electoral law we prescribe a margin of only 5,000 above or 5,000 below the quota. I understand that the Minister intends to introduce a B ill for tlie purpose of legalizing the action which he has taken. That, however, will scarcely condone the offence which he wishes us to commit upon the eve of a general election, by effecting, in the interests of the sitting members, an alteration in the provisions of an Act which was deliberately' passed when the representatives in this House desired to be faithf u l to their trust. It is a most improper course to pursue. I trust that the House will reject the proposal of the Minister and adhere to the scheme which has been recommended by the Commissioner.

When the Government felt that these distributions were not in the best interests of the electors of town and country alike, it would have been cowardly for them to submit a motion for their approval with the knowledge that it would probably be defeated. Honourable members will readily concede that a Minister adopts a much more manly attitude when, instead of resorting to a subterfuge, he submits a motion in accordance with the law, and takes a course which he -and his colleagues believe to be a proper one.

That has in those two States. Honourable members opposite blame the Department for Home Affaiis for failing to rush this thing and that thing through, and for neglecting to have everything up to time. But in the establishment of that new and great Department, and the creation of a highly important branch of it, greater activity has been shown and more punctuality has been observed than might reasonably have been expected. The officer who has been so much maligned and so maliciously attacked by certain honorable members of tlie Opposition deserves thanks and praise rather than abuse for his work. If it were necessary to refer these -distributions back to the Commissioners, and if I had before me data that would satisfy me that it would be anything but a farce to adopt that course, I should be prepared to return them for reconsideration. I repeat the assertion that there would be -ample time to return the distributions to the Commissioners, and as long as I could see that I should be able to submit the schemes in time to permit them to be returned and adopted before the next -elections, I felt satisfied that I was properly discharging the duty intrusted to me. There has been no failure in any degree in dealing with this most exceptional matter. An attack has been made upon the Queensland Commissioner.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I instructed my secretary that, if he obtained the confirmation of the statements anticipated, he should, before either he or I said anything on the subject, communicate the charge and the' documents supporting it to the Commissioner, so that we might have his answer before making anything public, and let it go forth side by side with the statements which have been made. .That is the course I have taken, and I venture to think that it is fairer to the Commissioner than it would have been to come here with a statement which I might or might not have beenable to substantiate, without giving him an opportunity to deny and disprove the charges made against him.

That was done. Although clause 31 was, in the first instance, practically struck out, a slight concession was afterwards made to the Attorney-General by conferring upon the Court original jurisdiction in all matters involving any question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional which deals with matters arising under the powers of the States, and those of any State or States, or of any two or more States. late to that point ? wider than the provision for which it is proposed to substitute it . If the amendment is agreed to, the two paragraphs will disappear, because they will be included in the more general wording adopted. I ask honourable members not to go back upon the emphatic direction given by the Committee to the Government, that there should be no enlargement of the original jurisdiction of the High Court beyond the two matters provided for in clause 31 as it left this Chamber. The Prime Minister indicated, when the clause was being recommitted, that perhaps the Government might seek in another place to enlarge the jurisdiction. Objection was at once taken to any action on the part of the Government to upset the emphatic decision of the Committee. But still that course was eventually adopted. If honourable members will refer to the debates they will find that the Vice-President of the Executive Council moved the amendment, which was accepted without any discussion by honourable members in another place, who do not appear to have been very attentive to what was going on. I think that honourable members will agree that practically the whole of the original jurisdiction that could be conferred upon the High Court would be embraced in the words which it is proposed Â±o insert. those which have arisen have involved the interpretation of the Constitution t sent the majority of the cases which have come before the courts have turned upon the The proposal to confer original jurisconstruction of particular Acts of Parliament ; but at the same time. I contend that if there were no provision other than that which it is now proposed to insert, regarding the original jurisdiction of the High Court, it would be sufficient to cover the cases which have been heard up to the present. Section 76, sub-section 2, of the Constitution refers to matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament, and that provision appears to me to have been inserted for greater caution rather than as being necessary, because matters arising under Acts of Parliament come within the comprehension of the words of sub-section 1, Constitution or involving its interpretation. under a Federal law one arising under the Constitution 1 worded I know that a distinction is drawn between the two classes of cases, but honourable members know that where doubt exists as to the exact connotation of words, or the express meaning of terms, an additional provision is often inserted to make everything secure. I regard sub-section 2 in that light, and as not being necessary to bring matters arising under the laws passed by Parliament within the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court. Supposing, however, that I am wrong with regard to that, we are still being, asked to revise our wellconsidered judgment upon the mere initiative of the representative of the Government in the other Chamber; and I object to that. There is no necessity to confer original jurisdiction in cases such as have been referred to. Supposing that the words, ""arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation,"" are so limited as to apply only to the Constitution as an Act, the cases mentioned ought not to be decided in the first instance by the Federal Judges. They are matters of such great importance that, in regard to them, the Federal jurisdiction ought to be appellate only.

General think that the Court at its inception will possess all the jurisdiction that can be oonferrecl upon it under the Constition? Constitution we have made provision for conferring upon this tribunal greater powers of original jurisdiction when the increase of our population warrants us in adopting that course. Surely there is no necessity for the High Court to overlap the States Courts by conferring all this original jurisdiction upon it. Honourable members in another place desire us to partially cancel a well-considered decision. There is absolutely no necessity under the Constitution to confer upon the High Court original jurisdiction in these matters. If that jurisdiction is withheld the Court will give judgment only in its appellate jurisdiction. As a matter of expediency and convenience this jurisdiction ought not to be immediately vested in the High Court. Shouldi t be subsequently required, it is an easy matter to amend an Act of Parliament.

I desire to prevent the clause from being drawn in such an elastic way. In the form in which it left this Chamber, its. meaning was perfectly clear, and no reason has been assigned, why a departure should In section 75 of the be made from the decision of the Committee. Upon looking up MansardI find that the debate upon this question extended over two days, and that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, advanced strong reasons against any alteration of the character proposed by the other Chamber. It is true that he spoke upon the clause in the form in which it was then submitted, but he dealt specifically with tlie same objections that were advanced by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. After a long discussion, the Committee unanimously determined to limit the jurisdiction. As the High Court Bench will consist of only three JusticesI would point out that if a case involving the original jurisdiction of the Court is heard by one Justice and an appeal be made from his judgment, the other two Justices must constitute the Court of Appeal. Such a state of affairs would soon be urged as a reason for the appointment of an additional Justice. I did not object very strongly to the appointment of five Justices, but seeing that the Committee have determined that the High Court Bench shall .consist of only three, I protest against the creation of difficulties which must necessitate the appointment of a fourth.

My colleague simply moved it in order to avoid delay. -The question of jurisdiction had been discussed at some length upon the second ""reading of the Bill, and the Senate was so unanimous in desiring to enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Court that the -difficulty which my colleague experienced *was not in making amendments in the Bill, but in inducing the Senate to make as few as possible. I believe that Senator Symon and others held that this amendment represented so small an extension of the constitutional powers conferred upon the Court that they doubted whether it was worthwhile making the addition. Nevertheless, they all approved of it as an addition, and the bulk of them were prepared to go further. o i the Bill, Senator Symon approved of the -powers of the Court being limited to those of appellate jurisdiction. mot involve an extension of the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court. It merely lessens the exclusive jurisdiction which the States. Courts would possess in these matters. The margin between the form in -mitted, and that in which bhis Committee .agreed to it, is relatively small, and represents only a difference in optional jurisdiction. Thus the parties who prefer to' go to the States Courts will still have those tribunals open to them, whilst those who prefer the High Court will be able to come before it. I think that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, will find that the distinction between the area which this clause covers and that which is covered by sub-section 2 of section 76 of the Constitution is much more No ; by the Vice-President definitely drawn than he apprehends. Under no circumstances could it be held that the second sub-section is included in the first. In Quick and Garran's work, The Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth, page 790, a quotation is made from Storey's Commentary, in which Storey points out thatCases arising under the Constitution, as contradistinguished for those arising under the laws of the United States, are such as arise from the powers conferred, or privileges granted, or rights claimed, or protection secured, or prohibitions contained in the Constitution itself, independent of any particular statute enactment. Therefore I take it that the authoratative and undisputed interpretation of the United States tribunals upon this point would be followed by our own Courts. all analogous. this respect, that with us a distinction is drawn in our Constitution between matters arising under the laws made by this Parliament and matters arising under the Constitution. In the absence of that specific provision a similar distinction has been made in the United States in the clearest possible manner. If that distinction were made in the United States, in the absence of express enactments to that effect, how much more clearly will it be drawn when it is set out upon the face of our Constitution? Under the circumstances, honourable members will see that this is merely an optional jurisdiction. It is only opening a door through which no one will enter except those who desire to do so. tiff has the choice. He takes his case into the State Courti f he pleases.

The effect of this amendment will be that a litigant in Queensland, for example, who has the choice according to the time of the sitting of the Court and so forth, will take the advice of his legal adviser, and adopt that course which it will be more convenient and more economical for him to follow. If his case involves a number of findings of fact as well as questions of law, counsel will probably say, ""Let us go to the State Court and get the law and the facts decided. We can then go to the High Court."" If the facts are not in dispute and the parties can agree to state a case they will at once say, ""Why should we not go to the highest tribunal instead of taking all these intermediate steps which must involve us in expense ? Why should we not have the case decided at once?"" Merchants would gladly embrace such an opportunity.

Most of us have had some experience in advising members of the mercantile community, and we know that their desire is to secure a speedy settlement of disputes. They desire that their cases should be settled as speedily and as cheaply as possible. A litigant may choose his Court according to the nature of his case. If he resides in Queensland and the case is likely to be one involving a long investigation of facts and requiring the examination of a number of witnesses, he will go to the State Court.

Mr IS AACS I do not think that a High Court consisting of three Judges could deal with all cases. It is not proposed to invest the Court with original jurisdiction in relation to all cases arising under the laws made by the Parliament. If that were the case the objection would be a solid one. But where this proposal is limited to questions relating to the Constitution no such objection can be taken. I cannot say exactly how many cases have occurred in Australia: but doubtless a large number have arisen in some shape or form.

Is he prepared to place it on record now that, in his opinion, this extension would go no further than that ? my recollection of the past. It is not a question of legal opinion, but of fact. Take the case of a question relating to the taxation of State imports, such as the action of the Attorney-General of New South Wales v. the Collector of Customs. That would come under the present clause, and would be judiciable in the first instance by the High Court. The case of Kingston v. Gadd would not. wealth legislation. ties could agree upon the facts, would it not would not venture to do so. Did not that be a very proper thing to allow the case to go straight to the High Court? When the matter was before us in the first instance, and had still to go to the Senate, I could well understand the anxiety of honourable members not to increase the original jurisdiction of the Court, lest the Senate might be tempted to increase the number of Judges proposed to be appointed. But there is now no risk in that direction. Therefore, it seems to me that all that we have to look at is the benefit to be given to the community. I can see, for instance, that if the Arbitration Bill be passed, as I hope it will, a question might easily arise which should not be dragged before a State Court and then to the High Court. Why should not the parties, if they want to know if a matter is or is not within the Constitution, have a right to go direct to the High Court without any extra expense 1 .the Attorney-General will give the Committee a better reason for agreeing to the amendment than the statement that it would be an act of friendliness to the Senate to do so. There is no escape from the position that if we agree to the amendment we give the High Court original jurisdiction in regard to all matters arising under the Constitution. A certain original jurisdiction is given to the Court by the Constitution, though for my part I think it is a pity that any such jurisdiction was given to it. The Attorney-General, when the measure was last before us, urged that this original jurisdiction should be extended, but the feeling of the Committee was so decidedly against him that he would not even call for a division in support of his proposal. Now, however, we are asked to go back upon our opinons, and to do what we have already decided not to do. Does not the honourable and learned member for In d i admit that the amendment will enlarge the powers of the Court beyond what was originally intended? We originally provided that the Court should be, as far as we were able to make it so, merely an Appellate Court. Buti f we agree to the amendment, we shall open its doors so wide that we. shall require to appoint to the Federal Bench not three Judges, but half-adozen. I challenged the honourable and It relates to Commonlearned member to place on record his legal opinion upon the point, so that it might afterwards be quoted against him, but he show that he was speaking with a reservation, and that the powers conferred upon the Court by the amendment are much wider than any layman would imagine ? I trust that all those who are in favour of making the High Court as much as possible merely an Appellate Court will vote against the amendment.

I have twice explained at some length the meaning of the amendment, and am sure that no other honourable and learned member will be found to endorse the assertion that the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has made. I pointed out that in the Bill as it was sent to the Senate power was given to the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus against all persons holding office under the Commonwealth. further, that under the new paragraph now proposed the Court would have conferred upon it the remainder of the ordinary jurisdiction of Courtsi n regard to the issue of writs of mandamus, and am sure that no member of the profession on either side of the Chamber who heard my explanation would find any such divergence between it and the facts as the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has sought to establish. I do not dispute the right of the honourable and learned member to express his opinion, or to believe that he is right, but I claim to be perfectly entitled to declare that his view is utterly wrong. haps the honourable and learned member for Werriwa was under some slight misapprehension as to the effect of the amendment, and therefore the heat which he has displayed may be to that extent pardonable. Personally, I think that the amendment is The honourable memnecessary. It will not extend the jurisdiction of the Court, but will confer upon it that ancillary power which it ought to have. Under the clause as it stood, the Court would have power to issue a mandamus against an officer of the Commonwealth but not against the Attorney-General to inform us why it is proposed that the High Court should have power to issue writs against the Supreme The honourable Courts1 Courtsi n their Federal jurisdiction only, and the power is necessary. -The amendment appears to me to involve a very grave change, and to carry out a designI do not say a nefarious designto compel Supreme Courts to "" knuckle under"" to any}?a< of the High Court. The idea in the first instance was that the I must say that the Supreme Courts should judge as to their duty, and the High Court as to its duty, but now the proposal is to permit all kinds of writs-by way of mandamus or otherwise-to be issued to force the Supreme Courts to adopt the view of the High Court, even before they have given their decisions. Supreme Courts in their Federal jurisdiction only. a difference between the Federal Court and I explained, the Supreme Courts as to the meaning of an Act or of the Consitution, and before the Supreme Court had fulfilled its functions the High Court might issue a mandamus directing it to do this or that. I do not think that that is desirable, even though the power relates to the Supreme Courtsi n their Federal jurisdiction only. It might lead to great expense, because the High Court would be able to issue writs of certiorari and writs of mandamus to compel a Supreme Court, before it had performed its functions, to carry out the view of the High Court. Grave differences may arise as to the constitutionalty of this particular Bill-as to the validity of Clause 40, which forc,es all appeals to the High Court and voids appeals to the Privy Council. Suppose that a Supreme Court assumes that such a provision is invalid, and that it is arranging for an appeal to be carried on as of right, to the Privy Council.

397,Mr Higgins,"Yes, but there might be the appeal to go, the High Court might, under the provision now proposed, interpose with a mandamus to compel the Supreme Court to take a certain course, or might, by other means, cause the removal of the suit from the Supreme Court, and thus prevent it from giving a decision. I shall vote against the amendment, and I think that the proposed new sub-clause should also be rejected. We should allow the Supreme Courts to take the view that an appeal lies to the Privy Council, notwithstanding the faot that the Bill provides that it shall not so lie. Under the amendment proposed, if the Supreme Court of a State had not actually decided a case, the High Court could intervene with a direction. Of course, I urge these views very respectfully; but if the amendment be pressed to a division, as I hope it will be, I shall vote against it . I was net listening at the time the last amendment was being put from the Chair, otherwise I should have objected to it . Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -Prom the very introduction of this BillI have consistently endeavoured to restrict the original jurisdiction of the High Court, and my last vote was cast in the same direction. A t the same time. I cannot see that the proposed amendment tends to enlarge the original jurisdiction. It simply regulates the mode in which the jurisdiction shall be exercised. It is practically a pare of the appellate jurisdiction, and merely indicates the way in which the power of revision shall be exercised. Inasmuch as the amendment does not enlarge the powers of original jurisdiction, I shall support it . High Court power to grant a mandamus we do not permit t h a t . body to supersede the Supreme Court of a Statei n any way whatever. learned member iswrong. able and learned member will agree with me that no Court ever says to another tribunal, "" Before you enter upon the decision of a certain case, we will tell you how you must decide it."" The only occasions upon which the High Court would issue a mandamus, would be when the lower Court, by reason of some mistaken view of the law, failed in its Federal jurisdiction to hear and determine the insertion after the word ""mandamus"" of the cases. For example, let us suppose that the words "" in matters of Federal jurisdiction."" Supreme Court of a State declares that it has not the power to hear and determine a honourable and learned member might go particular case throughout. A litigant may hold that the Court possesses the necessary power, and may apply to the High Court for the issue of a mandamus. If the High Court considers that the State Supreme Court is endowed with the necessary jurisdiction, it will issue a mandamus compelling that tribunal to hear and determine the case. The procedure followed is exactly the same as that which is adopted by the States Supreme Courts when inferior tribunals mistake their powers. It is only when the lower Court, in its mistaken view of the law, declares that it has not jurisdiction that the higher tribunal will step in and issue a mandamus, which, after all, is a mere matter of machinery. I would direct attention to the fact that in paragraphs a, b, c, and d of clause 34 the power of the High Court is limited to matters which relate to the exercise of its Federal jurisdiction. Paragraphs e and / o i the Bill in its original form, however, were not so limited. The mistake which has been made is in supposing that the power to issue a mandamus is confined tomatters of Federal jurisdiction. It is not. It is absolute, and it is all the more expressive because in the preceding provision? the power is confined to Federal jurisdiction. Further, can we confer power to issue a mandamus in cases where the matter involved is not one of Federal jurisdiction ? Suppose, for example, that a Court is called upon to deal with one point in perhaps twenty, which involves a question of Federal law, The other nineteen points may relate to. In giving the matters of ordinary law. WhatI mean is that the Court may issue a mandamus upon ordinary matters of law. I have said that it was unfortunate that issue should have been joined on this particular writ of mandamus. The very first amendment which was carried in the infcerpz-etation clause clearly indicated what was the intention of the Senate. Right throughout these amendments the intention evidently is to allow the High Court to interfere before a decision has been given by the Supreme Court of a State, and to direct that Court as to its business and as to how it is to perform it .

I strongly suggest that it is highly desirable to omit the words which have just been inserted. As to the power of the High Court to issue writs of mandamus, the contention is that, unless we confine them to matters of Federal jurisdiction, they will be applicable to other cases ; but I take it that the power to issue the writ will not give jurisdiction where it does not exist. habeas corpus ought to be similarity limited. anxiety of the Attorney-General appears the Attorney-General that he would do well to stick to his Bill.

It was included originally in clause 35, but it is thought that from the point of view of better draftmanship it would be better to restrict that clause to appeals from Justices of the High Court and to place paragraph c in clause 36, which deals with appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States, although in this case the Supreme Court of a State is acting in Chambers for the High Court in"" a matter pending in the High Court.

These words were formerly in the Bill, but the honourable and learned member for Bendigo had a doubt as to whether they were within the constitutional power of this Parliament, and they were accordingly omitted. Upon consideration, it appears to me that they are within the power of this Parliament, and I think it very desirable to reintroduce them.

We go only to the Full Court, as it were, to obtain leave to appeal, and that involves the expense of an application. There is a good deal of trouble saved if the Judge who makes the order is able to say in answer to a request for leave to appeal"" You can appeal if you choose to do so,"" whenhebelievesthereissufficientdoubt about the matter to warrant the adoption of that course.

440,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"the only alteration necessary would be to say thatAn appeal may not be brought trom an interlocutory judgment, except by the leave of the Supreme Court or of the High Court. that the suggestion is a good one, but I have a slight doubt as to whether we can make this limitation. In a recent divorce case an interlocutory order was made by the Supreme Court of a State, and an appeal was allowed to the Privy Council. If such a matter is appealable to the Privy Council, it must be appealable to the High Court, and this limitation cannot cut down the right. The suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would get over the difficulty. and learned member put it ? That the Senate's amendment be amended by the insertion of the words "" Of the Supreme Court .or "" after the word "" of,"" line 4. In order to prevent a multiplication of appeals, it is said that an appeal from an interlocutory order shall be only by leave. That would, perhaps, involve a special application, but expense would be saved if when a man said to a Judge who had made a certain order"" The question involved in this case is an important one, and there is likely to be an appeal. your Honour grant leave to appeal ?"" the Judge were able-to accede to the request. I think there can be no harm in allowing that course to be adopted. Amendment of the Senate's amendment agreed to.
