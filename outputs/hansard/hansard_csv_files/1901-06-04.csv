3,Mr Mccay,"We shall probably havethey get, and tliat they will not get very much. It seems to me that the Government nre in rather an awkward position in regard .to this veiy important question. To use an old phrase, they appear to be ""between "" the devil and the deep sea."" Honourable members on the opposition side of the chamber urge the adoption of a free-trade policy, while honourable members who sit behind the Government are, we know, in favour of the imposition of high protective duties. If we are to take the speeches delivered by these honourable members during'the elections as a guide to what they require, it seems to me that the Goveniment must depend, to a very large extent, upon the assistance which they will get from honourable members sitting upon the cross benches who are in favour of moderate and reasonable duties, and of honourable members sitting on the opposition side of the chamber, who will vote for moderate protection rather than have a high Tariff. I wish to make my position in regard to the Tariff question as plain as possible. I tun in favour of the imposition of moderate and reasonable duties, and I think that tlie Government should carry into effect the language used in the Governor General's speech, making revenue the first consideration. If we can, in providing for revenue, give our industries fair and reasonable protection, we should by all means do so; but when I consider the composition of the Ministry, and remember tliat all its members, except one, are pronounced protectionists, I begin to have doubts as to whetiier the expressions contained in the speech are. really genuine, and I feel inclined to say, like the patriarch of oldThe voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are duty to which I would consent on .any single the hands of Esau. good fellow. MrA . C. GROOM I hope that events will prove that I am mistaken, and that the Government will stand by the language used in the speech. If they do, I am sure that they will receive the hearty support of the majority member call that a revenue duty 1 of honourable members in this Chamber.

MrA . C. GROOM I shall define it in a minute or two. It is a most astonishing thing that nearly every honourable member on this side of the House is now a moderate protectionist. If we had judged by the lion-like expressions hr favour of high protective duties which were launched forth by a large number of those honourable members on their various electioneering, platforms, we should have been led to understand that nothing but a policy of the veiy highest protection would satisfy them. But I suppose it is because the conviction has been forced upon them that a high protective policy is now impossible, that they are lying on their oars, as the saying is, and recognise that it is not wise to be rash at this juncture, that it is not wise to say too much, and that they had better wait to see how the proverbial cat is going to jump. less than I said the very night we opened the campaign. MrA . C. GROOM' I am very glad to hear that, and I hope that the Government will stick to their guns. If tliey do they will have my hearty support. I wish to define my position most particularly and exactly, and to lay it down, as I said on every election platform throughout tlie length and breadth of my constituency, that I am in favour of moderate duties-dutie s as low as we can possibly impose, in order to obtain our revenue; but I desire these duties, as far as possible, to be protective, and the highest article coming into the Commonwealth would SirW .

7,Mr Babton,"Eree-trader s impose dutiesMrA . C. GROOM A large number of honourable members apparently have been led away by the idea that we can have a uniform duty of about 15 per cent. I have studied the question very carefully, and I do not see ho w we can have it. In the first place, we require a revenue, I understand, of about £8,500,000. How are we going to obtain it ? It is acknowledged on all sides that we cannot touch direct taxation in any form. .'Direct taxation, as we know it, belongs to the States, and to the States only. Any new income tax or any new land taxation would necessarily have to be altogether different from the direct taxation obtaining in tlie States; it would have to be extia taxation. Therefore, tlie Government have necessarily to fall back on the Customs for their revenue. If we are to believe our statisticians, our imports from foreign sources in 1899 were, as nearly as possible, £33,000,000. Of that amount between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000 came u rider the head of spirits, narcotics, and tobacco. Mir. McCAY -More than that. Mr A. C. GROOM -No ; if the honourable member can take Coghlan, he will find it Mr AC. GROOM -The honourable member is wrong. The revenue we derived from the imports was £3,118,000, but the total amount £3,000,000. Sir W. McMILLAN counting excise : that is only imports. MrA . C. GROOM I am coming to that in a moment. I desire to see the free list, in regard to the balance of tlie imports, maintained in the same ratio as it is in Victoria, where as nearly as possible about a third of tlie imports come in free, the rest being dutiable. able member means. MrA . C. GROOM -With all due respect to the right honourable gentleman, I desire to say that they do nothing of the kind. MrA . McLKAX -The honourable member is including the intercolonial imports. MrA . C. GROOM I referred just now to all the imports which come from foreign sources only, and I stated that tlie imports which came in from those sources amounted to £33,000,000, or thereabouts. with the imports, and we have nothing to do with the imports whioh come from the various States and 'are not dutiable. Therefore we discard that altogether, and we take the actual amount of imports from foreign sources at £33,000,000 The whole amount which comes in under the heads of wines, spirits, tobacco, cigars, and narcotics is between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000. The amount of duty that was collected on those imports was £3,118,.000. We know that we have that revenue certain. That leaves us £30,000,000, less the amount of the free list, on which to calculate our duties. When we take off one-third, it leaves us £20,000,000 of imports on which to pay duties . which will give us the revenue we require in addition to the excise. If we have an average duty of 20 per cent., it will give us £4,000,000. A dd that to the £3,118 000 on the imports of wines, spirits, and narcotics, and we have £7,000,000, leaving about £1,500,000 to be collected by excise duties in the various States on the manufacture of wines, spirits, tobacco and cigars, and on the manufacture of sugar. It seems to me these duties will have to be raised somewhat in that ratio. the present. The present rate is 23 per cent, on 26 per cent, of the imports, less stimulants and narcotics. of the imports was under Mr A. C. GROOM -That may be; but still, when we have to raise a certain revenue But that is not and we have only a certain amount of imports on which to raise it, it means that if the free list is going to be any larger than a third of the dutiable imports, the average rate will be over 20 per cent., but I am taking the ratio as it now exists in regard to imports from foreign sources. That is, as I make it, as nearly as possible a third, and that will give us an average of about 20 per cent., because from the information I have been able to gather from the various statistics I think we shall be able to raise about £1,500,000 from the excise duties on the various articles manufactured in the States and on the manufacture of sugar. The Minister for Trade and Customs will correct me if I am wrong. WhatI am in favour of is a discriminating Tariff. First of all, we should have a third of our imports free.

10,Mr Glynn,"That will be as heavy as a third of the imports. But I am i\ofc in favour of an all-round duty on everykets, and also the markets of the adjointhing else, for the simple reason that I think we should have a discriminating Tariffa Tariff which commences at possibly as low as 10 per cent, even, perhaps a little lower on a certain class of goods coining into the States, and which gradually rises to 12 per cent., to 12£ per cent., 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 22^per cent.; but in no case, in my opinion, should it be over 25 per cent. That is my definition of moderate protection. either. Mr A. C. GROOM -In my opinion, if our industries cannot maintain themselves on the protection I have named, then the sooner they die a natural death the better. I have never been in favour of high protective duties. I have always considered that the high protective duties which have existed in A ictoria, especially during the last few r years, have been far more to our detriment than to our gain. If we go back thirty or thirty-five years-to the time when Victoria first adopted protection-n o doubt some of the honourable members here will remember that the great arguments which were used in favour of protection in those days were as follow :-First it was claimed that as our mines were failing, a protective Tariff would cause industries to spring up around us, which would afford a large amount of employment to the miners, to their sons, and to their daughters, at highly remunerative rates, the result being that Victoria would go ahead by leaps and bounds, that her manufacturers would necessarily prosper, and that she would become the great manufacturing centre of Australia, and the most attractive colony of the group. thut, after the inauguration of that policy, a large number of important manufacturing industries did spring up around us in various parts of the State, and that they did afford a very large amount of employment to our sons and daughters, and that the wages which were paid in those days were good. Andi t really looked as if protection was going to do for Victoria everything that had been promised. In fact, protection in those days became very popular, and I remember the time when we used to point with a finger to our important industries, and say, ""Look at what protection has done for Victoria."" But a change came about in this way. Uncier protection, we had our own maring States for which to manufacture. The result was that tliere was a greater demand than we could supply, at highly remunerative rates. The States comprising the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, Soutli Australia, and I may add, New Zealand, woke up to the great advantages Victoria enjoyed in consequence of her protective duties. Consequently they started exactly the same policy themselves. The result was that a bad definition our valuable export markets in the various States were, to a large extent, closed to us, the demand for our manufactures fell off, and we produced more than we required in our own markets. The consequence was that prices came down. Manufacturers were not satisfied with the prices thej were obtainr ing, and the workers were thereupon paid less wages than they were accustomed to. Then Parliament was appealed to, and asked for still further protection, the reason given being that the manufao' turers desired to be still further protected from the cheap commodities that came into the State from Europe and America. Parliament granted them further protection. Things remained in that condition for a few years until commodities were once more overproduced. Then the manufacturers came for the third time to Parliament, and asked for still further protection. They got it again, and, strange to say, witli this result: that the higher protection was Jess beneficial. Our manufacturers seemed to prosper less, ancl wages were lower than the workmen formerly received. I am sorry to say that matters did not turn out as we had hoped when protection was inaugurated. We must admit take place 1 MrA . C. GROOM -In every industry, more or less. It was felt that the higher duties were not giving the advantages for which we had hoped. I , myself, in those days, believed that the higher duties would benefit us to a large extent. I believed that our manufactures would prosper to a greater extent than they had done, but, owing to our high protective policy, more manufacturers entered into the various industries than the demand warranted. The result was that there was an over supply in the market, and prices came clown. I have learned the lesson that high protective duties, such as we have known in the",16,Address In Reply

13,Sir John Eorrest,"It is being examinedexceedingly regret that Queensland was not represented at the various Conventions which were practically the means of bringing about our sitting here to-day, but my regret is for totally different reasons from those advancedbythathonorablemernber. able member for Brisbane said the reason he was sorry Queensland was not represented at those Conventions was because the black labour question and that of the sugarindustry could have been dealt with by the delegates sent there. While to a degree I recognise that it would have been wise for the question to be thus dealt with, I at the same time would like to have seen Queensland represented, for another reason-namely, that the State at the time would probably have sent to the Convention ten labour delegates, who would have assisted the democratic delegates to make tlie Federal stitution sible, than it is. Tliat is my reason for desiring that Queensland had been represented at the various Conventions. it well the position of Queensland should be placed before the House, and the reason shown why that State was not represented at the various Conventions. remembered that at the Premiers' Conference it was agreed that the delegates to the Convention should be elected by the votes of the people. The understanding was, I believe, arrived at among the Premiers, with the exception of the Premier of Western Australia, now the member for Swan in this House. However that may be, tliere was one State in which the compact then made was broken; the Premier of Queensland desired that, while any man in Queensland-at they numbered somewhere about 80,000whose name was on the rolls, could be nominated as a delegate, the electoral college for the delegates should be the Legislative Assembly. We maintained tliat that was unjust and wrong, and that it was breaking the compact entered into by the various Premiers; and with the aid of the democratic portion of the Queensland we were enabled to prevent the Government from carrying out. their plan on that occasion. It was a well-known fact tliat the Government could not then have carried any seat for the Convention, and that was the reason Queensland was not represented in the body which drafted the Constitution. make this statement members, who are probably not acquainted with the politics of Queensland, may know exactly the position tliat State was placed in so far as the Convention was concerned. I should not have spoken in this debate, had it not been that one or Thehonortwo Queensland members from the tenor of their speeches, seem to have desired to leave the impression-or , at all events, left that impression on my mind-that tliey were speaking for the whole of that State. There was a time when some of those gentlemen could probably get up and talk on behalf of Queensland, because they usually got their politics from the Government of the day, aud naturally thought that they were speaking on behalf of the whole of the people of Queensland. There is another section in Queensland who generally think Conthat Queen-street is Brisbane, and that more democratic, if posBrisbane is Queensland ; but this view is totally wrong. Those honourable members. I refer to the honourable member for I think Oxley and tlie honourable member for Brisbane-were elected to this Parliament only after a very hard struggle, and I notice tliat in their It will be platform speeches throughout the campaign, they were very careful to keep the question of black labour in the background, never bringing it forward prominently. spite of what is said by the member for Brisbane to the effect that tlie black labour cry was merely got up by tlie Opposition to because catch votes, I can say that nothing of the kind was tlie case. The cry originated that time with the press whicli supported the two honourable members who have spoken in favour of black labour, and it was through tlie press that the labour question became prominent, so tliat we could not have made it so at the last election. We have had some most extraordinary statements. One honourable member has told us that there are 22,500 white men dependent on the inAssembly, dustry. I have repeatedly asked where this information was obtained.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN the honourable member make those he mentions represent? Government statistics, on page 415, show that for the year 1899 there were 3,665 white men employed in .69 sugar mills throughout the country. Sir honourable member multiplied that number by five ? number, according to the version of the honourable member for Wentworth ; but the honourable member for Oxley distinctly stated there were 50,000 men, women, and children dependent on the industry, after the statement had been made as to tlie 22,500.

Again, the honourable member made a statement which I take as a direct insult to the white workers of Queensland. The honourable member distinctly stated that the reason Kanakas were employed was not because Kanakas could be obtained more cheaply, but simply because they were more reliable -that ' if the white man were employed in the various occupations in which Kanakas W l i y criticise are employed the white man would go on strike and leave his employer in a hole> and would be able to obtain higher I merely mention wages through taking that mean advantage.

MrM c DONALD I apologize, Mr Speaker. I quite understand it is not parliamentary to say that any statement made by another honourable member is not true, but still we cannot get over the fact that the workers of Queensland are just as reliable as are the workers in any part of the civilized world. There are many occupations in which the white man is engaged, I do not think it and he can be relied upon to carry out his Honourable members contracts just as accurately and honestly as he can in any other community.

25,Mr Spe Aker,"The honourable memberemployment of Kanakas is merely one of £ s. cl. The Kanaka can be obtained a great deal cheaper than can the white labourer, and that is the whole explanation. That fact underlies the whole question of the employment of Kanaka labour in Queensland. white man cannot work in tropical Queensland, and yet two-thirds of the Kanakas employed in that State are employed a long way below the tropical line, so that that argument also falls to the ground. ""When we start to get at the actual work which we are told the white man cannot do, what does it narrow itself down to ? The advocates of coloured labour admit that the white man can do almost every kind of work, even including the cutting of the cane-and no one will dispute thatbecause he is working in the open field, and not under such severe conditions as are imposed even on a man working in a cutting on a railway, but they say that the part of the in which white men are employed where far work which the white man cannot do is the trashing of the cane. Now, I have not heard an honourable gentleman or any one in connection with the sugar industry argue that the trashing of the cane is absolutely necessary. Even the cane growers themselves differ on that question. One man will say-"" I do not trash my cane,"" and another will say-"" I trash my cane because I believe there is money in it . "" An that the cane is worth two shillings a ton more. the question arises-""Does the extra amount thus received compensate for the trashing of the cane?"" and onthispoint alargenumber of farmers who grow cane, in Queensland say that it does not. on this most important point, we find that the planters themselves differ. I was very pleased when I saw in one of the Queensland papers that the head of the Government had given instructions to Dr. Maxwell to get him some data upon the management of the sugar plantations. I hope that this important point will be impressed on Dr. Maxwell, and that the Government will t i y and obtain from that gentleman, who has vast experience and knowledge of the growing of sugar cane, an answer as to whether it is absolutely necessary to have the cane trashed. If it is not necessary, then there is no need for the employment of the Kanaka The whole argument advanced for the employment of the Kanaka would then fall to the ground. opinion now that the trashing is only necessary when there has been heavy rain, Again, we are told that the likely to lead to a soakage between the leaf and the stalk ? others say"" No, we never trash our cane at all."" Some go so far as to burn it. An HONOBABLE MEMBER -Some trash it when they are cutting it . point it appears to me that there is good. ground to consider whether it is necessary to perform this particular work, which the advocates of black labour say the white man cannot do, although I do not for a moment admit that the white man cannot do it . I believe there are occupations in the nortliern portions of Queensland heavier work is imposed on them, not only in regard to heat, but in regard also to the laborious nature of the work. Take the sinking of a winze in a mine. I have seen men go down into places where they could not remain for more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time. The only air they could possibly get was, of course, that given to them by artificial means. Yet those men do their work effectually ancl being unable to do it, or any complaint tliat they are unreliable. I say that white But then men are just as able to perform any sort of work in the cane-fields as are black men or Kanakas. Of course, we are told that if an immediate stop be put to the importation of Kanakas the sugar industry So that even in Queensland is ruined. A good deal of this feeling has grown up through the planters themselves. They have used every effort to discourage the employment of white men in. the sugar-fields of Queensland. They have tried to create the impression that tropical agriculture should be looked upon as "" degrading, and as fit only for black men. This is why many white men have looked upon it as an occupation in which they should -not seek employment, and it is this fact, together with the low rate of wages paid to white men who seek the work that has produced the present state of things. We hear men say sometimes-""It is of no use my going to the plantations because they pay such small wages, and",20,William Mcmillan Ho W Many Honourable Member Must Withdraw His Re

Having these ideas, white men. strongly object to seeking employment amongst the sugar plantations, and the sugar planters themselves are therefore to blame for not having sufficient white labour with which to carry on the industry in different parts of Queensland. tion was enacted to prevent the introduction of the Kanaka into Queensland after the year 1892. During that nine years nothing was done by the planters themselves to provide for the employment of labour other thau coloured labour, and thus when the time came for the introduction of coloured labour to cease, it was found that the planters had not the necessary labour available to cany on the industry, and that there was nothing but Already we find that, owing to a large' number of the sugar planters in Queensland being in the hands of the financial institutions, some of those institutions have been trying to bring pressure to bear upon the farmers by refusing to advance money, and when the farmers ask the reason they are told the present Pederal Government is going to stop the introduction of Kanakas, the result being that the industry will be ruined. The financial institutions, together with the planters, have created the impression that in the north, centre, and south of Queensland the stoppage of the importation of Kanakas is going to have the result of ruining the industry. vance money to the sugar planters now 1 in spite of that fact, that the Government knew that when federation took place it was more than probable that the stoppage of Kanaka immigration would be brought about, they were prepared to introduce a Bill last session making a further advance to the extent of £150,000 in connection with the central mills system. As far as the Government of Queensland was concerned, tliey apparently were not afraid of the stoppage of the introduction of Kanakas. Regarding the Kanakas working in the sugar-fields, there is a word or two to be said on their behalf. I think the introduction of' Kanakas into Australia, and particularly into Queensland, is one of tlie .most disgraceful pages of our history. I [37] think it has been the most inhuman traffic, that has ever taken place, or is ever likely to take place, in the history of Australia. I do not think, as other members think, that it is necessary to introduce Kanakas in order that the sugar industry may live, and I say that, rather than continue tlie inhuman conduct that has'taken place in connection with the traffic in South Sea As far back as 1883 legislaIslanders, I would sacrifice not only £7,000,000, but £47,000,000 if necessary, and let the industry go to the wall. It is a disgrace to us, and a thing that ought never to have taken place. We are told by some that the Kanakas are gradually dying out, and we certainly cannot wonder at it . In a great many cases, they are introduced at the ages of from 15 to 30 years to work in the sugar-cane fields of Queensland. What has been the result 1 We have found that in the first six months these ruin staring them in tlie face. unfortunate wretches have been afflicted with a death rate as high as 200 per 1,000, while the death rate among the white population has been only about 11 or 12 per 1,000. and 5 per cent, for Kanakas, but it is much less for the whites. MrM c DONALD I am .talking about the time when they were first introduced-durin g ,the first six months. ber's pardon. admit, within the last year have somewhat improved, but at the present time there are 47 or 48 per 1,000 of the Kanakas dying, not the State adand that has given rise to the saying that the planters of Queensland are practically manuring their soil with the carcasses of Kanakas. If we take into consideration the enormous death rate amongst these people, I think there are grounds for making the statement. When these people are brought to Queensland their lives are anything but what they should be, and in spite of the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, that they are harmless, docile creatures, I wish to draw attention to some of the outrages that have been committed in Queensland from time to time. There is no need to go over the long list, but we know that outrages have taken place, and tliat in Bundaberg and Mackay a woman is hardly safe in leaving her home after dark owing to the presence of liberated Kanakas.

I do not wish to place the whole of them to the credit of the Kanakas, but they are generally attributed to them. I think, apart altogether from the sugar industry, that the traffic in Kanakas is an inhuman traffic, and the sooner it is stopped the better in the interests of Australia generally. "" It has been said by one speaker that tlie fact that the Queensland Government have not passed an enactment prohibiting the traffic is a reason why this Parliament should permit the employment of Kanakas in the sugar-field, but it is a well-known fact that the Parliament of Queensland to-day is elected on the plural vote, and the first time the people had an opportunity of saying whether the Kanaka should remain in Queensland or not, they,by an overwhelming majority, decided that they did not want the Kanaka brought into the State. On that occasion the only two seats out of the nine the Government secured, were the seats held by the two honourable members for Oxley and Brisbane. Under such circumstances, I tliink this House has an emphatic decision from the people of Queensland in. regard to the ment of Kanakas in the cane-fields. do not intend to take up a very great deal bf the time of the House, because I understand there are quite a large number of honourable members who desire to speak. However, there is one matter I would like to mention in connection with the black labour question, and it is this. There has been a general impression that there should be a Commission of Inquiry into the industry. I do not think there should be any such commission. of tbe people of Queensland at the last election was the best decision we could possibly have, and I am pleased to learn that the Government themselves are not favorable to the idea of a commission. think it was the leader of the Government in another place whom I heard say distinctly, that as far as the Government were concerned, they did not intend to have a Royal commission of Inquiry into the black labour question. very pleased to hear the statement, because there is an effort being made at the present. time through the Chamber of CommerceA very large and other bodies to bring pressure on the Government to appoint a commission. Let me remind the Government that they have already had a very strong opinion expressed by the people of Queensland. I do not think any Government could earn the respect of the people of the State more certainly than by stopping the traffic in connection witli islanders from the Pacific. As there is a desire to get this debate finished, it is not my intention to say much more. I have been exceedingly pleased to hear the speeches from both sides of the House during the few days that it has proceeded. I certainly think they were good speeches and were worth listening to, 'more especially the speeches, if I am not going too far in saying it, of the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Bendigo. They were two fine speeches, worthy of the gentlemen who made them, and certainly worth listening to. What struck me most has been that all through the debate the question discussed has been purely one question of free-trade and protection. The whole debate has developed into a controversy between New South Wales and Victoria. South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland have not been in it ; they employhave hardly been mentioned. I believe I Western Australia was mentioned in connection with some transcontinental railway, which I understand has already been promised to the people of that State. An Honorable MEMBEB -No, no. no such promise. MrM c DONALD I hope the Right Honourable the Prime Minister will not think for one moment that I imagined the Government had made such a promise. I I think the decision certainly thought, however, from the tone of the speech made by the Minister of Defence the other evening, that that right honourable gentleman made a very distinct promise. When the matter comes up, I trust that the I fullest possible inquiry will be made; and that the House will view the question purely on its merits; if it then appears desirable to construct the line I hope tlie House will have the courage to sanction it . During the whole of this debate, the quesI was tion of free-trade and protection has been practically the only one which has been discussed.

39,Mr Mcdonald,"We know all aboutQueensland than he could do by any other means I know of at the present time.. I hope he will take that matter seriously into consideration. We know that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are paying enormous dividends year after year, and while among the sugar planters there is, roughly, between the planter and producer of raw sugar only a margin of profit of 8s., 10s., or 12s., we find up more than a few minutes in doing so, that in the manufacture of the refined sugar from the raw sugar there is a margin of profit of somewhere about £i. cumstances I certainly think tliere is room to cut down this particular profit and let the planter have some of it. I merely mention these matters because in these discussions I'would like to see those honourable members who at election are always desirous, or say that they are, of assisting the working classes as far as possible, do something to assist them. I think that the least they ean do, after obtaining their votes, is to say a word or two for those who have helped to send them here. Now, I think there is nothing of the kind. Personally, I do not believe that the adoption of either free-trade or protection will benefit the working classes very largely, but, in dealing with the Tariff, I shall cast my vote so as to lighten the burden of taxation, wherever that can be done. I am a free-trader, but I do not attach any special importance to my fiscal belief. I am prepared to support a protectionist if they will give us labour reforms, just as I would in turn support a free-trade Government if I could get similar reforms from them; so that I have a very easy conscience on the question of free-trade and protection. I am going to vote against the amendment. Notice of motion for the introduction of a BilL to prevent the further importation of Kanakas has been given, and as soon as the debate on the Address in Reply is finished we shall be able to see that Bill. If we find tliat it contains all we desire, we shall give it our hearty support, and, if we think its provisions do not go far enough, we shall use every constitutional means to have it altered as we desire. I think that it .was injudicious to move the amendment at this time, because we do not know what are the contents of the proposed Bill. we see the Bill, we cannot say whether we should or should'not vote for it. I hope that the Government will cany out the various measures which are mentioned in the GovernOr-General's speech. If they do so, they will earn the thanks and the gratitude of the working classes of the continent. tlie only Victorian representative who sits on the opposition side of the chamber, it is perhaps desirable that. I should explain my position, although I do not intend to take because I recognise that it is incumbent upon us to bring this debate to a conclusion In the ciras soon as possible. I am sitting on the opposition side of the chamber because I am a free-trader, and I shall try to make clear to honourable members opposite what I mean by "" free-trade,"" because they seem to be somewhat in. the dark as to the meaning times of that word. In tlie first place, however, I will give my reasons for being where I am. Last year the present Attorney-General wrote an article in a magazine called United Australia, in which he stated that the first duty of the Commonwealth Parliament would be to draw up an Australian Tariff, and that the one clear-cut issue would be whether free-trade or protection should be . adopted. That honourable gentleman is a member of the present Government, and we find him associated with the Prime Minister, who is an advocate > of what is called moderate protection, and the leader of the protectionist party of New South Wales, and with the lYeasurer Government and the Minister for Trade and Customs who are both protectionists. But one who believes that free-trade is a good thing for a community should at the veiy inception of the Commonwealtli endeavour to see that our fiscal legislation is founded upon right principles, and is it to be supposed that a Ministry constituted as this Ministry is constituted would, if left to themselves, adopt any other policy tlian that of protection ? It is true that under existing circumstances, they will not be able to impose a really high Tariff; but we free traders may be quite certain that whenever they get the opportunity they will endeavour to introduce the cloven foot of protection. It is therefore incumbent upon us to make it clear that we cannot support this Ministry. The definition which I would give of Until free-trade is one which is given in most of the text-books that treat of the subject in its controversial and political sense-the levying of customs duties for revenue pm'poses only, and with no ulterior object of securing protection. The imposition of",24,Honourable Membeb I T Means Well We Do Not Hear Any Talk About Their

41,Mr Winter Coo0le (Wannon),"A srevenue duties may incidentally give protection, but the object aimed at in imposing tliem is not to give protection. member get that definition ? describing a revenue Tariff. ference between a revenue Tariff and free trade. If honourable members spoke of a revenue-cum-protection TariffI could understand their position. A revenue Tariff is the same as a free-trade Tariff. If honourable members insist that free-trade means a policy under which no customs duties are levied, I say that no country has ever had free-trade, though I believe that the Hanseatic towns of North Germany once had it . When we speak of free-trade England, we do not mean that England levies no customs duties at all. A free trade Tariff is a Tariff for revenue purposes only-it does not matter whether the amount of revenue obtained is small, or so great an amount as £8,500,000. Unfortunately, at the present time there are in existence industries which are said to have been built up under protection, and I believe that some industries have been so built up ; and the question arises-wha t is to be clone with them ? If I were tlie head of the Government, and had a good majority at my back, I would remove all duties upon imported articles where I found that the local manufacture of those articles was a thriving industiy, ancl tliat the locally-manufactured goods were being sold in other States of Australia besides that in which they were manufactured. gradually remove all protective duties, except so far as revenue duties might incidentally be protective, and bring into existence a purely revenue Tariff. That, I hope, is a clear definition of the policy I favour. Honourable members may ask why it is that I am a free-trader. In reply to that question I am almost afraid to quote authorities, because they have been spoken of with such contempt by some honourable members. The honourable member for Echuba seemed to think that education in political economy is of no value at all, and that no professor of that science could hold a Ifc is strange that, while in regard to other sciences the educated man is regarded as somewhat of an expert when he gives an opinion upon a question which he has studied, the student of poUtical economy should be looked upon as one whose views are outside, the range of practical life. "" L e t us go to the practical man; do not let us go to the man who wears a black coat,"" said the hon r orable member for Echuca. That seems a strange thing to say. On all sides we hear a cry for more education; bnt when educated men tell us that protection is wrong, and free-trade right-and I hold that the majority of educated men who write on the subject do tell is that-w e are told that their conclusions cannot be accepted. preached that the sun goes round the earth. of political economy were sought for, either in the Melbourne or the Sydney University, not a man of any distinction would be found, capable of filling tlie position, who would be prepared to tell his students that free-trade was wrong and protection right.

That, I hope, will show why I feel it incumbent upon me to sit on this side of the House. There is one other question on which I differ from Ministers, and from some honourable members also on this side of the House, and that is the question of adult suffrage. I do not believe in womanhood suffrage, and when the time comes to speak I hope to give reasons -which, though not satisfying to the House generally, will, at all events, be sufficient justification for tlie faith that is in me. In all other questions I shall wait for details, but I tliink I am at one with the Government. W it l i regard to a white Australia, my reading and my converse with men has taught me long ago that it is not good for any community that there should be large bodies of whites and large bodies of blacks. That has been proved to be the case in the United States of America. It has been proved to be the case, I believe, in South Africa. I do not believe it is good for even our white race in India, small though the number of white people may be there I believe it is not good for the dark race or the white race. Therefore, I shall give my hearty support to the proposition to eventually get rid of both Asiatics-if that can be done with the consent of the ""Imperial Government-and Kanaka labour. We must do our best to see tliat Australia remains as a possession for the white man, and the white man only. On other questions, such as railways and so on, I shall wait for further information. I can assure the Government that I shall give no fractious opposition to their proposals. I have mentioned the only two questions on which I differ from them-al l important ones to my mind. As to what is a proper fiscal policy for tlie country, I want free-trade started from the commencement. My objection to protection is not so much on economic grounds. It rests on far more important grounds than tliat. I think that the social and political evils that. arise from people having to depend so directly on the action of the Legislature for their means of living is bad both for the people and the Legislature. There is a pasSagei n a very good little book which I will commend to honourable members on the other side of the House. The book is The Commerce of Nations, by Professor BasI do not tliink table, Professor of Political Economyi n tlie University of'Dublin. The passage to which I allude is as follows :To these economical difficulties in the operation of protection we ought to add the social and political results of placing industry in such direct dependence on legislation. Where the imposition of a duty may make the fortune of a producer or owner of some natural resource, and its withdrawal mean lowered profit or rent, the employer becomes perforce involved in ""politics,"" in the vulgar sense. The English corn laws, the Erench protective systems, and the various American Tariffs have all been in part the outcome of the exertions of interested parties. Such relations are evil both for industrial and political life, and have a disastrous tendency to demoralize those concerned. It is not well that a measure so vital as the conduct of industry should depend on political contingencies, nor that the work of legislation should be mixed up with questions of. commercial loss or gain. their conclusions on the statistics the honourable member has just condemned ? tical and social side of the question that I condemn protection. Mr Bryce, on his chapter on corruption in America, points out the very great evil which has resulted from the great pressure brought to bear by those interested in those matters upon the Congress of the United States. MR . KENNEDY -Does not that argument apply to railway construction and land legislation ? does, but we should not extend the area more tlian is necessary. All legislation affects some interest or otlier to some extent, but the farther away from Parliament we keep business the better. Undoubtedly privately owned railways in the United States have added greatly to the evils, of corruption, but I believe it is incumbent on those who are in favour of protection to prove its advantages over free-trade, when we know that by protection we bring about those evils I have referred to. Mr Bryce, in his American Commonwealth, touches on this question, and says that, though he cannot, get at the actual figures, he estimates that 5 per cent, of the members",27,Honourable Membeb I T Means Well We Do Not Hear Any Talk About Their

I have touched on rather a delicate side of the question. Perhapsi t is somewhat improper even to hint that, at some future time, any member of this House could be either directly or indirectly interested by bribes; but, inasmuch as history points to the fact of this having been the effect of protection in countries that have adopted it, I thought it not unwise or improper to touch on this aspect of the question. ber never hear of anything of the kind in England ""i for a moment that any legislation is free from this evil, but we should keep temptation away as much as possible. BeforeI sit down, I ask to be allowed to say, if I may do so without presumption, that while regretting that we have lost you, Mr Speaker, from this side of the House, I congratulate you sincerely on having received such a high honour. I trust you will long retain your seat in the Chair, to the advantage of this House, and consequently to the advantage of Australia. the first place, to congratulate those with whom I have laboured in the cause of union upon the successful consummation of our efforts. I trust this Parliament will be a model to others that will follow us. I . deplore the fact that we have had introduced into this debate the old arguments with which we have been familiar in the States, setting one State against the other. Being a member from New South Wales, some remarks are called for on my part in answer to many things which have been said in this debate. It is not my duty to sit here -and hear statements from honorabe members opposite, many of whom are colleagues from my own State, which will not bear the interpretation put upon them. I trust that the .same good humour which has been evinced throughout this debate will be continued during the present Parliament, and that we shall be able to discuss measures from time to time without any indulgence in personalities or any conduct tending to cause ill-feeling or ill-will. should like first to address myself to the fact that during the recent campaign and during the last few years of my parliamentary life in New South WalesI have been sitting in opposition to a party who call themselves free-traders. Now there are no free-traders, in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN O h , yes there-. none. The honourable member who has. just resumed his seat is not a free-trader;' he calls himself a revenue tariffist. Many authorities have been quoted from time to time in the course of this debate, and now I am going to quote from one of the greatest free-traders of whom I know. He is the only writer I have read who has clearly pointed out what that class of politicians are who call themselves revenue tariffists, and what justification there can be for a revenue Tariff. I am going to quote a writer whom no one will deny is a genuine free-trader, Henry George. This is what he says :Those protectionists are right who declare that protection is the only justification for a Tariff, and the advocates of a Tariff for revenue only, have no case. If we do not need a Tariff for protection, we need no Tariff at all. clause in his mind when he wrote. does not affect the argument. keeping clause and the Braddon clause both sit on the opposition side of the House. been termed ""The Blot."" Never by me, however; I do not consider it is a blot. As one who has always adopted the principles of protection, believing them to be for the good of the many, and who has felt that we can only give that protection which is needed through the Customs houses of the country, I am of opinion that the Braddon clause, so called, does insure for a time at least that the revenue raised through the Commonwealth Parliament shall be obtained by means of the Customs house. That is a guarantee at least that the industries and the welfare of the people will be studied under the clause. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN It does not do anything of the kind. I will paidon me for taking a different view of this matter from himself.

Now, let me deal with the comparisons which have been made between the two States of New South Wales and Victoria, and 1 wish to follow them as shortly as possible. Let me say that, in my opinion, any such comparisons are very unfair. In the first place, New South Wales is the mother State, find is twice the age of Victoria. mother State, and I will give my honourable friend, who will have every opportunity of replying, some figures from his own statist, Coghlan, and if he can break those figures down I shall be veiy glad. member for Werriwa is trying to appeal, to New South Wales, whilst there is a duty the honourable member's sense of humour. of humour is not very greatly developed. In ' the honourable member for AVentworth who the second place, New South Wales is four asked the question-""AVhat benefit can times the size of Victoria : and, therefore, tlie fanner receive from a policy of comparisons between the two States are not protection?"" I ask the honourable gentlefair. In New South AValesI have never man to take up the Argus newspaper and known a free-trade policy-ther e is not one he will there get a far better answer than there now, and there never has beeu one : I could give him. but if this policy of free-trade, as predicted, is to do so much for the people, why has here. New South Wales not gone by leaps and bounds ahead of every other State which members opposite what their own paper says, has a different policy ? Why has she lagged in order to be quite fair.

Mayi t ever be so, bearea, but in fertility, why is it that State cause it has advanced the interests of Vichas never developed ? In fact, it is only in toria to a very large extent. I repeat that recent years the industry of agriculture there is no duty upon wheat in New South has been started in a systematic way in New South Wales. Permit me to say also in answer to a previous interjection, and to the speech of an honourable member on the other side, that it was not the Reid policy of so-called ""free-trade"" that developed agriculture in New South Wales, but it was the only protective policy New South Wales ever had, under. the leadership of the then Premier, Sir George Dibbs, with Sir AYilliam Lyne as one of his colleagues, which encouraged agriculture by the small duty imposed on the importation of wheat. Erom that moment the figures showing the advance of agriculture rose very rapidly. As my honourable friends who have struggled with me in the State Parliament of New South Wales know, the balance was so keen between one policy and the other, that those who had been put on the land in consequence of that assistance, stayed there in the hope that the Dibbs Government would come back, to enable them to keep the position the Tariff had placed them in. An Honorable MEMBER -The Tariff stood six years. stand six years. It stood only as long as the Dibbs Government were in power, but the Reid Government-the so-called free-trade party-too k off the duty on cereals, and the positron was very much altered.

98,Mr Chanter,"I will tell honorableWales. There is a duty on the importation of wheat into Victoria. The honourable member for Wentworth tells the farmers of the Commonwealtli that they have nothing to gain whatever from the imposition of a duty, because now prices are ruled by the markets of the world-by Mark-lane, in London. If that is so, I ask why is it-as the freight is practically the same from the ports of Melbourne and Sydney to London-that the export price of wheat is not as great in the city of Sydney as it is in the city of Melbourne? rings or trusts in Sydney. are no rings or trusts. Sydney as in Adelaide? friend will find -that is the reason. one who knows anything about agriculture will admit, that the quality of the wheat grown in South Australia is first class.

Bran is l i d . per bushel in Victoria as against 8|d. in New South Wales, and pollard l l ^ d . in this State as against 8-fd. in New South Wales. That applies also to the other protected States. Every one of them without exception gives its farmers a higher price for their wheat at the port of export than does the State of New South Wales. "" It is a veiy good thing"" the free traders say. "" Now there is a demonstration of our policy. We want to give to the consumer the articles of food as cheaply as we possibly can. Free-trade is cheapness."" But is it so in this case ?

It is a veiy easy matter at all times for two or three importers to agree to form a ring or trust and to fix prices, as they have done in many instances that I could cite. Buti t is very much more difficult for 40 or 50 manufacturers to form a ring. such combinations. honourable friend goes to his bedside to-night and recollects all that he has uttered to-day, he will remember that what he has said in this connection is not correct.

On this point, I happen to know that in my.own electorate, in order to break down this ring, seventeen farmers determined fco put the profit represented between the cost of tlie article in America and its cost to them in Australia in their own pockets. Therefore, they said-""AV e will go outside of the New South Wales ring, we will send to America and get the articles out for ourselves.""

During the ten years previous to 1899, the territorial revenue of Victoria was £4,000,000 odd, and of New South Wales £19,00.0,000; that is, New South Wales had to expend £15,000,000 whicli she did not put into a sinking fund or into a fund for the reduction of her loans.

Victoria has ever since beeu living within her means and on her own resources. She has attained her present position by the activity and industry of her own people. population. number to Western Australia. of the male population who have left Victoria during that period have gone into New South Wales, and the portion of New South Wales they have gone to is the Riverina district, which belongs commercially to Victoria. by Victoria, although it is a portion of the State of New South Wales. And why should the Victorian people not go to one of the sister States? Are they not all Englishmen, or the descendants of Englishmen? Isi t a crime to go from one State to another ? I hope that healthy spirit of rivalry between the States will always prevail, but where ever the people go I hope their emigration will not be reckoned against the State from which they have come. Why did our fathers leave England and come here? If that argument were to prevail at all times many of us would not be here. Our ancestors would be in England, treading I think there is no on one another's toes, instead of enjoying freedom in a God-given land such as this. When Victoria wanted more room, what more natural than that her sons should go to some other part of the Commonwealth of Australia. But what is her position in that respect ? To every square mile of her territory she has thirteen persons, whereas New South Wales has only four. When the State of New South Wales, which is four timesthe size of Victoria, can get into that position, there may be less justification for challenging same period was its policy. Wales does not contain 20,000 people. crime and shame to New South Wales, I know, perhaps, as because the territory of that State should Carry a much larger population.

Every tax levied by one State against another is a tax against our brothers, our fathers, or our sons. We are now in quite a different position. Our constitutional right will be exercised shortly, and we shall throw down the barriers which exist against ourselves. But are we to throw them down against those who are aliens and who have nothing in common with us ? That territory has been developed she is, although not in any other respect. There is no doubt about that. Now, Mr Speaker, another advantage which the State of New South Wales enjoys over Victoria is in wool production. The value of the wool production in Victoria for the nine years previous to 1899 was £24,140,544, against £82,062,602 for New South Wales.

Soutli Wales has always laid down, and still lays down, this doctrine-""We to produce anything here but natural productions-wool, of that kind."" policy. in relation to her forests has been to charge a royalty of 12s. 6d. per 1,000 feet for her timber in the log, because she never expected to get any more out of it. charge a royalty of os. per 1,000 feet. policy of New South Wales, in addition, has been to compel the labourers who go into the forests to fall the logs to pay £3 per month in licence fees. toria has been to cliarge no licence fees at all. The policy of New South, Wales has been to get as much as possible out of natural production aud to care little for labour. policy of Victoria has been to get as little us possible out of the worker, to give him the raw material as cheaply as possible, to protect him and assist him in converting the logs into articles of commerce required by the people. As an object lesson let honourable members go to the River Murray-I gladly take them there-and ceptions, from Albury down to the Murray mouth, they will find the whole of the saw-1 mills, the whole of the timber industries, and \ Mr Chanter. £26,303,222, the whole of the workers employed on the Victorian side. Why? Why are the men not tariffist-free-traders employed where the trees grow, where the for one moment forests are? The greater portion of the trees are in New South Wales. Why is it that the timber is taken from New South Wales, brought into the State of Victoria, They are the result of natural and put into industries there instead of into territory the industries of New South Wales? Eor this reason. New South Wales has said"" We will not protect you in the industry that you start here;."" while Victoria has said-""We will protect you if you start It is the same in regard to here."" Victoria has protected the industiy, Let me and has gained the advantage of creating for hundreds of its workersa means of making a permanent livelihood for themThe honourable selves and their families. The same rule would apply to minerals. Did free-trade give New Soutli Wales her great coal beds ? Could protection have done it ? tlieir best customer. coming to that. Nature made New South Wales tliat gift, and the only value that New New South Wales is getting out of it at the present time is by delving for the coal and do not want in that way giving employment to the people; but her greatest customer has been wheat, meat, or something the State of Victoria, who purchases the Victoria has had a different coal for the purpose of putting it into her The policy of New South Wales furnaces and finding work for her people in manufactories. The industries of Victoria,the manufacturesI find are £10,052,000 in value. In New South Wales the manufactures are of the value of £9,207,000. Agricultural The policy of Victoria has been to produce in Victoria is valued at £6,435,000, The as against £5,5S2,000 in New South Wales. The produce of dairying, poultry-keeping, and bee-farming in Victoria is valued at £3,384,000, as against £2,543,000 in the The policy of VicState of New South Wales. Therefore, the policy has justified itself. We find that in manufactures, in agriculture, and in dairying at the present time, notwithstanding the The smallness of her area, and her youth in comparison with New South Wales, Victoria is far ahead of the whole community of Australia in industrial life. The advantage, of course, in natural productions is with New South Wales. The pastoral products of New South Wales are valued at £14,527,000, as will against £7,219,000 in Victoria.

137,"Mr Chanter,","Quite so; I wasonly twice the value tliat is reached in the younger State1 This is the reason. Go from one end of Victoria to the other, and you will find that, in their policy of putting the people on the land, the Victorians have put tlie land in good condition by improAdng it, that whereas New South Wales is trusting to nature, and is taking the grass-wha t little of it grows-as nature left it, the Vicnot been for tlie strength of the then Premier torian land-holders are able-as the result of the land policy of the State-to make three blades of grass grow where only one grew before. The figure.s in regard to the stock which the land can carry can be quoted from Coghlan, who says that, in that respect Victoria is far ahead of New South Wales. Yet none of my friends will deny that New South Wales, as far as the fertility of her soil is concerned, is quite equal to Victoria. To any one of experience the cause is easy to determine. First, this State started by limiting the area that any man should hold to 320 acres, and the holder improved every acre of it . The policy of New South Wales has been to keep small holders oil' the land and to keep large land-holders on it . There is territory in New South Wales which is in no better condition to-day than it was when the State was first founded by Captain Cqok. Let me take one or two other tests, and then I shall have finished in regard to the comparisons of honourable gentlemen. The holding of a territory, large or small, is not the basis upon which we can judge which is the more prosperous State. The basis of comparison is the use to which we put our territory. It is of no use having a paddock or station if you do not use it properly. You want to get as much out of the land as you can, and in that way the whole community will benefit. The value of production to the square mile in Victoria is, according to Coghlan, £ 2 1 7 3s. 8d., while in New South Walesi t is only £ 8 5 14s. 6d. Take the value of the manufactured products for the two States. The value in New South Wales is ±""16,625,258 and the value in A icr toria £22,390,351 . Take the savings banks deposits. I think it will be admitted that the greatest contributors to deposits in savings banks are the working classes. By this means you will find out whether the working classes are more prosperous in one State than in another, or in one nation than in another. The amount per inhabitant of savings banks deposits in Victoria is £ 7 16s. 8d., and in New South Wales£ 7 9s. 4d. There, again, Victoria has the advantage. banks here. statement of that kind. We all know when the bank disaster occurred in New South Wales, and we know, sir, that had it of the day, Sir George Dibbs, no bank in New Soutli Wales would have stood up against the wave. We know what the Treasurer d i d ; that a legislative enactment made the tender of the bank notes legid, and in that way stopped a crisis which overtook not one, but every State. I have given the population statistics. I will take another test. Having dealt with the question of savings bank deposits, let me make a comparison between the life assurance business of the two States. The depositors in the savings banks belong, for the most part, to the poorer classes, while those who insure their lives are, for the most part, members of what might be termed the middle class. In making this comparison I w ill ' quote the figures given by one of the soundest life assurance offices in Australia, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which has its head office in Sydney. In the most recent returns issued by the society, it is stated that in their books for tlie State of New South Wales they have 39,987 persons insured, while for this miserable State of Victoria they have 42,218 persons insured ; so that the State with the smaller population has the larger number of persons assured, and that notwithstandr ing the fact that the head office of the society is in New South Wales. test. very grand position if I had a number of friends who would lend me the necessary money, and would be willing to trust to posterity for its repayment; and it is a very easy thing for a community to do the same. New South Wales has lived upon that principle so long that, on the 30th of June of last year, her indebtedness was£65,332,903, and her total debt is now nearly £70,000,000. The public debt of Yictoria, however, is only £49,324,885, or £42 4s. 6d. per inhabitant, as against £ 4 8 per inhabitant in New South Wales.

New South Wales has built up her prosperity by the expenditure of loan moneys until she has now to raise nearly £2,250,000 a year from, her people in order to pay the interest. Mr PoYJf'rox -Which State has the better assets, from the point of view of return ? ber has made a very unfortunate interjection. If the people of New South Wales had spent on reproductive works the money which they have borrowed as the people of Viotoria have done, things would be very different; bnt a very large amount of tlie money which has been borrowed has been spent upon works which will never return a shilling of interest. Even paltry expenditure, such as that required for the furnishing of a building, has been taken out of loan money. The making of roads, bridges, and other works, even when they were of a most temporary character, has been paid for, not out of revenue, but out -of loan money; and when the honourable member for Bathurst, as Minister for Agriculture, imported some cattle from Scotland and England, some of which were pronounced by experts to be practically useless for the purpose for which, they were imported, they were paid for out of loan money. The Minister for Internal Affairs, and other honourable members, know that for years I did all I could to stop this wasteful expenditure, and to get Parliament to insist that loan money shoidd not be expended upon any but reproductive works; but this expenditure has been going on all along, though a time must shortly come when it will be stopped. had been made of the revenue derived from internal industries witli that derived from other sources in the two States, it would have been a fair one; but a State which has a land revenue of about£2,000,000 p.er annum, which it is spending as ordinary revenue, while at the same time it is spending millions of pounds of borrowed money in the same way, must naturally appear to be ahead of a State which is not pursuing that suicidal policy. I find that the loan expenditure of Victoria during the five years previous to 1898 was £1,365,400, while that of New South Wales was £7,763,865. The number of persons who are members of friendly societies is another index to the prosperity of a State. Now, I find that Victoria has amongst her smaller population 88,726 persons who are members of friendly societies, while in New South Wales only .70,287 persons belong to such institutions, the funds of the friendly societies of Victoria being £1,173,960, and of the friendly societies of New South Wales £612,104, or £ 1 3 4s. 8d. per member in Victoria and £ 8 14s 2d. in New South Wales. I have taken these figures from the statistics of the New South Wales Government Statistician, in order that they might not be challenged. I hope, however, that after the conclusion of this debate, comparisons such as have been made will never again be employed in this Chamber, because the States have now joined hands for weal or for woeI believe that it will prove to be for our common weal-and we want to get away from the old InterState jealousies. Our duty is to do all we can for the development of Australia as a whole, not for the development of one part of the Commonwealth at the expense of another part. We have to find out what is the best policy for the whole continent. Are we to content ourselves with the policy of the revenue tariffists, and remain producers of wool and exporters of meat ? Are our sons and our daughters all to be boundary riders, or employed only in connection with those industries ? Do we not rather want to build up some industrial life in this fair land of Australia which will enable every one to gratify a reasonable ambition by adopting, when he reaches the age of maturity, some vocation for which he is specially suited ? What is the use of our keeping up our technical colleges? What is the use of our training our sons and daughters for the occupations they will have to follow if we by If a comparison a fiscal policy give the greatest of our good gifts to those who are alien to us, and have nothing in common with us ? That is really the position which Australia has to face. We have determined, and wisely determined, so far as the white races are concerned, that our barriers shall be thrown down. We have become again the members of one family. We have now to meet people in every way hostile to us. How can we meet them ? Can we meet them by imposing a so-called revenue Tariff?

The only occasion on whicli she approached to free-trade was when the light honourable gentleman at tlie head of the Opposition imposed his Tariff, but it was not very long before he wanted some revenue. He did not get it from a free-trade Tariff; he went back to duties upon biscuits, tea, jams, and that kind of thing, and he calls from the class who are the bone and himself a free-trader.

That difficulty would be largely remedied if sufficient Care were taken in the drafting of Bills in plain, straightforward, Anglo Saxon language.

The Government are at the beginning of things also with regard to machinery for the administration of the law.

One matter that has been incidentally touched upon in the' course of this debate, but of which not much How is it possible, when men eduhas been said, is the proposed appointment to the civil service of a gentleman well known in the politics of New South Wales. We were informed that one of the Ministers in the late Government of New South Wales was to receive an appointment under the late Premier of New South Wales. I allude to Mr Fegan. Then we were suddenly informed that Mr Fegan, after having made preparations to enter upon his duties as Under-Secretary for Internal Affairs, had retired from that position. Whilst we do not know what led up to the retirement of Mr Fegan from this position, those of us. who are well acquainted with him are aware, that there were veiy good and substantialreasons. He has indicated that he retired, with the desire to save his friends in the Government. Save them from what ? That is Whether he be born a fair question which I may reasonably ask. It has been said that it is undesirable to appoint a gentleman holding a place in thepolitics of. any State to the civil service of the Federation, and tliat appointments to that civil service should be from the civil, services of the States. If a good appointment can be made from outside the civilservice, and the duties can be discharged with efficiency and capacity by I am afraid my right honourable the person appointed, I am not prepared to confine the appointments to thecivil service. I am prepared to give-. the civil service of all the States a fair show and nothing more in these matters. There are those in New South Wales, pirticularly amongst the workers, who consider that Mr Fegan's appointment was objected tonot because of his incapacity to fill an i m portant position of this character, but on: other grounds.

As to the civil service of the .Federation being drawn only fi'om the civil servants of the States, and to the .statement that Mr Fegan's withdrawal was due to that objection, we are now led to suppose that important appointments are to be made from outside the civil service, but, in these cases, from the legal profession.

If , however, they are going to fill the civil service with legal men, I , for one, will raise my voice against appointments of this particular -description, because I believe such appointments will not be in the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the States. There is one matter I am glad to see the Government proposes to deal with. I do not know whether the relative importance of measures is to be gathered from their positionin the Governor General's speech, but the measure I refer to is of such importance that I trust the Government m i l give it one of the first places in their consideration. The 'measure is that by which it is proposed to give to the Federal Parliament its own franchise, and its own-methods of conducting elections for this important Chamber, and also for the other House. Under the terms of federation hitherto, we were not in a position to deal with this question, and-it had to be left to the several States to deal with it in the way best suggested by their wisdom; and the result is that the first Federal Parliament is constituted on a franchise as varied as it posI f this is a legitimate sibly could be, each-of the States having its own different legislation and methods. So far as the franchise of the first Federal Parliament is concerned, it is one of the biggest conglomerations a Parliament has ever been elected on. In New South' Wales we recognise the principle of one man one vote, and endeavoured to secure in our Federal Legislature the principle of every vote having an equal value. But, in practice, for some reason or other, that principle was not carried out to the extent it should have been. For instance, in some of the electorates, there were 16,000 voters, and in other electorates close by only 9)000 voters, and our legislation was deficient and defective to the extent that whilst in theory we had one man one vote, thousands of voters were debarred from taking any part in the constitution of the first Federal Parliament. Mi-: BROWN In the electorate which I have the honour to represent, through the bungling, or worse, of one of tlie Government officers, no less than 200 voters were disfranchised. In another electorate, through the fault of an officer in not returning the proper papers to the revision court, some 60 names were left off the roll. Then, again, in an electorate some 60 men applied to be enrolled, and their names should have been submitted to the revision court. These men did everything they, were required to do under the legislation, but when the rolls came to be made up it was found that while some who applied subsequently were enrolled, the names of those 60 men had been omitted. In other places it was discovered that electors who were on the State rolls found no place on the federal rolls. These -are matters of administration rather than of legislation, but they show a deficiency the Federal Government would do well to look into and remedy as speedily as possible. In other States there is the same difficulty .and the same trouble; and I suppose",40,Kennedy The N The Occupation Of The Different Departments Who Will Becharged

165,Confined To The Civil Service So Far As. Mr Mr Kingston,"Ho w is that 1that in no State of tlie Commonwealth at the present time can it be truthfully said tbe whole of the electors, or the whole of the men entitled to take part in the constitution of the first Federal Parliament, had an opportunity of voting. Such an important occasion would naturally call up the patriotism of every man, and yet in each State largo numbers of electors were disfranchised or disqualified through the faultiness of legislation or of administration in . some respect or other. Then, in some of the States, the women's vote is allowed, whilst in others there is only one man one vote, and in very maiiy there is not even one man one vote. Tlie federal franchise should be based on the recognition of the principle of not merely one man one vote, but one adult one vote. I am not like the gentleman who spoke a little prior to myself this evening, and who intimated that he was opposed to giving the franchise to women. I am prepared'to extend the franchise to women, and I say we cannot get uniformity in our federal elections until we are prepared to grant the extension. Some of the States have secured recognition of the female franchise, and their experience of it is, or, .at least, it has been shown in practice, that they are not going to abrogate the principle for the sake of uniformity ;'so that uniformity can only be obtained by bringing all the States up to the level of-recognising the principle of one adult one vote in tlie federal franchise. We should strive, as far. as the Constitution will permit, to.aim at making every vote in the Commonwealth of equal value, so that every Australian may have equal weight in making the laws of tlie Commonwealtli. I know there are constitutional difficulties in the way of this consummation so far as the whole of tlie Federation is concerned, but stitution, at -making every ' vote of equal value in--a particular State. There is at present ari absence of uniformity in this respect. Some of the State Parliaments split up tlieir respective States into electorand against the development of any of our ates for the return of members to the House of Representatives, but in other cases the whole of .the State constituted one electorate for that purpose. These are only a few of the instances that can be quoted in support of my contention tliat our first Federal Parliament has been constituted under a form such as no other Parliament has been constituted under. There have been so many differences and varieties of procedure and so forth. It seems to me that we should aimnow that we have the matter in our own hands-a t getting a federal franchise that will enable the people of Australia to constitute the Nationa] Parliament upon uniform lines. I have indicated what I consider those lines should be, and I certainly think they must embody the principle of one adult one vote. not voters. cannot get votes without voters. There is another matter upon which I wish to touch briefly, because I know it is the desire of honourable members to bring the debate to a close, and a good many subjects have been so thoroughly thrashed that it is impossible to say anything new upon them. But I desire to add my opinion to tlie opinion already expressed on the desirability of this Parliament legislating as to a white Australia. I know objections have been urged to tlie effect that we should handle this question with great consideration, and do nothing in any way approaching a spirit of haste. Delay is urged. We are asked to appoint a Royal commission to investigate this matter, and in that way to delay it . But I believe that this is one of the questions where delay would be dangerous. The quicker we deal with it, the better for us, and'for tlie attainment of a white Australia. Tlie longer we delay this matter, the more difficult will it be to deal with it . Of course, I do not speak as an expert on the Kanaka labour question. Unlike other honourable members who have spoken, I am not thoroughly familiar with the many phases of this subject, but I take my stand on the ground that I am prepared-to place the purity of my race above every other consideration. Wheni t we .must' aim, within' tlie Conis a question of pounds, shillings, and pence, or when it is a question of tlie development of any particular part of Australia, to the sacrifice of the Anglo-Saxon race from which I spring, I stand for the purity of tlie race, resources by coloured labour of any description. There is another-matter to which the Federal Parliament will have to give some consideration; and I think tliat the Government will be very well advised if tliey refuse to act on tlie suggestion of some honourable members that they should place this question low down upon their programme. I hope they will decide as",41,Honourable Members Oh Oh Surely

Of course, the Constitution provides that the federal capital Wales territory. serted as a result of the Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne, at which certain amendments were made in the Constitution Bill to meet objections urged against it at the referendum, and which made it acceptable to the people of Australia. AVe do not know the particular reasons that were placed before that meeting of Premiers which led to this matter being dealt with in the way it has been, and which resulted in the Constitution -embodying the principle that the federal -capital should be located within New South Wales territory, with certain But we have been led to suppose that this concession was made by the representatives of the other States as compensation, as it were, for the disadvantages which it was -conceded on all sides New South Wales would labour under in the initial stages of the Eederation. that this Parliament, whilst considering the -question of suitability of climate and other matters that may reasonably be expected to be important factors in the selection of a proper site, should also attach weight to fixing the capital in tliat part of New South Wales where it will confer the greatest' benefit that disregarded, then the concession of the capital to New South Wales may go for nothing, and its location may be such that practically it will confer very little benefit on the people of that State as a whole. I am simply stating that as a supposition. was one of the reasons why the Constitution was altered, and this provision was placed in it. I think that the sooner this Parliament arrives at a decision-a which, in its wisdom, it considers is in the best interests of the whole of the federating States and of New South Wales, which is primarily concerned-the cerned. There is no need to unduly delay this matter. New Soutli AVales has compiled a lot of information, and has had a commission to inquire into the sites tliat may fairly be considered eligible for such a capital.

It may be desirable, if it be conceded that New South Wales should have some special, shall be within New South say in the matter, that steps should be That provision was intaken to obtain some expression of opinion from the people of New South Wales, through their Government, concerning some particular site among those suggested. But I think that the suggestion which has been amendments made by the Minister for Internal Affairs is a very good one. Reports are all very well in their way, but reports cannot convey to the members of this House that information whicli they can get from their own observation and personal inquiries. I understand that the Government propose at an early date to invite honourable members of this House to inspect for themselves limitations. the different sites that have been suggested, so that, in addition to the reports made, they will have the benefit of their own common sense and observation to lead them to a right decision. AVhatever that decision may be, I think the Government will be wise in arriving at a determinaIf that be true, it follows tion at an early date, so that this question of' where the capital shall be may be settled, and the necessary steps taken to get the different buildings under weigh. Whilst there is much else in connection with this matter that might be dealt with now,-1 think it better to deal with it when we come to deal with the main question of the upon the people of federal capital. Now, the question of taxaState. If this consideration is tion has engaged a large amount of attention and consideration. AVe have had the free-traders giving expression to their views upon it in some very able and eloquent addresses, and we have heard the protectionists replj'ing on behalf of their particular That theory. The protectionists tell the free traders that under the Constitution they cannot have free-trade, and with.equal truth the free-traders tell the protectionists that decision under the Constitution they cannot have protection. We have to take the Constitution just as we find it, and it confers upon us tlie absolute right of providing for the cost better for all conof federation through taxation by means of Customs and Excise. AVhilst we have the The State Parliament of right of direct taxation in common with the States, we have that as the special privilege of federation. But to tliat condition is attached this other condition, that for every 5s. we require for federal purposes we shall tax to the extent of 2(Js., and return that to the State Treasurers. That clause is oue of those in the Constitution Act that did not commend itself to me. The clause requiring this burdensome taxation for State and federal purposes was one that induced me to oppose the acceptance of the Constitution at the first and second referendums. I believe it will be found to be fraught with great financial difficulty, ancl that tlie Government will need federation. I am not going to assist this to exercise great care, and the very closest economy, in order to keep taxation within reasonable limits. Now, I notice that apparently the Government propose to provide not only for the recmirements of the Federation, whatever they may be under this provision, but also for the requirements of the States. up to that point where federation started. To that extent I disagree with the policy of the Government in this particular. I say that what they ought to do is to charge themselves with the duty of financing the Federation by taxation through Customs and Excise, but I say it is not part of the duty of the Government, or of this Parliament, to finance the States as ing it to finance the department, and in well. That is introducing into the Federal Government a principle which is unsound, and which because of its unsoundness is fraught with clanger and likely to lead to complication and trouble in the near future. I lay it down as my guiding principle that having established the primary forms of government, the Federal and the State, it is the duty of the Federal Treasurer to raise the taxation necessary for federal purposes, and that he should not be placed in the position of being also the tax-gatherer for the understand-o n the people of Australia of a States. member amend the Constitution 1 put in the position of being a beggar or dependant on the Federal Treasurer. I admit it cannot now be helped, but I think that the States in the interests of good, sound, financial government will have to come to our assistance in this matter. However, I am prepared to take the Consitutipn as I find it, and endeavour to make it as workable as I . think possible; but in order to attain that ideal I do not hold that I should be asked to make it a primary condition of taxation that I should provide for State as well as for Federal expenditure. I want to see the Federal expenditure made the primary consideration, and cut down iis low as possible in accordance with sound and healthy government. Whatever deficiency may come to the States they should rely upon themselves to make it up. The sooner they are taught to be self-reliant ancl to depend upon themselves to make up any deficiency that may arise through the Federal Government taking over Customs and Excise, the better for themselves and the better for Government to lead the States to suppose that the Federation for all time is going to be their taxing medium. If the withdrawal of these sources of revenue is too severe upon the States, the way for them to meet the difficulty is to hand over some necessary function of government to the Federation that does not return revenue, ancl in tliat way equalize their expenditure. For instance, public education throughout Australia is recognised as a State function. It is now reaching the point of absolute freedom, ancl it costs a considerable amount of money to the different States. The States might hand that matter over to the Federation, allowthat way relieve themselves of expenditure. The same might apply to old-age pensions and the relief of the aged poor. I prefer to work in that direction rather than in 'the direction which the Premier's address indicates-that is, to make it a primary part of his taxation proposals to finance the States and the Federation up to their present requirements. That is the crux of the difficulty, and it involves the imposition-if it is to be carried out on the lines we are given to heavy revenue Tariff such as is not necestlie honourable sary, and ought to be obviated if sound, healthy principles of government are worked upon. This Parliament should attempt, as far as the Constitution will permit it, to act on sound and healthy lines of government. Now, with respect to tlie question of free trade and protection, the status of the different States has been brought forward, ancl we have had some very excellent speeches from the opposite side, particularly from our Victorian friends. Victoria seems to have been so steeped in the principles of protection, that not only has it become a synonym for liberty and labour, but also for religion. It must be a revelation to find that, on the continent of Australia, there are those who consider that the principles of protection are neither synonymous with liberty, nor freedom, nor progress, nor anything else.

169,Mr Bbown,"The State should not begraduated from the workers of this country, and I know that while there are in the State of New South ""Wales numbers of those who believe in tlie protectionist theory, I have never been able to bring myself to believe in it , and I have no hesitation in saying, tliat until I do believe in a theory I will not espouse it for any man or any cause. I believe that freedom is not limited to matters of commerce. I believe that freedom is a good thing, so far as commerce, production, and so forth are concerned; and while it has its disadvantages for the labouring classes it has not the disadvantages that protection has. I heard one honourable member speak about the great difference in the price of wheat. Reference was made to this subject by the honourable member for Riverina, whom I esteem very much, but with whose political principles I do not agree. He talked about the price of wheat. I happen to be a wheat grower of many years' standing in . New South Wales. We were told by the pro-' tectionists there that if we only got protection we should blossom into independence almost at once. They said that what was keeping us in poverty and distress there-it was a highlyornamental picture which they drew-wa s that the wheat-growers in Victoria had protection, and would not allow us to trade Avith her, whilst she had free access to our markets, and was sending over her surplus produce to compete with us. I remember that one fine morning we farmers in New South Wales woke up and found that our Government had sneaked in protection. Some of us thought that it was the best thing that had ever happened for New South Wales. I was then a farmer in that State, as I am now, and I know what protection gave to my particular district. , Instead of getting a top price for our wheat, we got a price lower than any before or since. that protection makes tilings dearer ? say that protection was responsible for it . It was due to the fact that the millers having secured a market from exporters, also formed their rings, got us within their clutches, and kept us tliere. AVhat is more is tliat whilst we had to sell our wheat for ls. per bushel tliat year, and were glad to get that for ifc, yefc when we came to buy seed wheat we had to pay 7s. a bushel for it . We have learned that protection does not assist the farmers. AVe assist ourselves by forming co-operative companies to burst up rings. It is that, and not protection, which assists us. It seems to me that protection, instead of bursting up the rings my friend talked so much about, is just the one tiling that the rings fight for. Our honourable friend opposite was talking about machinery for farmers. He led us to understand that because of free-trade what we could buy in America for £20 or £25, we had to pay £50 for in Sydne}'. The honourable member led us to understand that was because of the ring fonned in Sydney, and inferentially because of free-trade. Let me say this, that the ring is not a Sydney ring,' but an American ring, a ring formed in protected America,and the agency in S}-dney which dares to sell a machine under the £50 fixed by the ring is cut off the list, and is supplied with no further machinery. AVe did not create tin's ring in free-trade New South Wales. It is the growth of America, and one of tlie natural growths of protection. I have had catalogues sent to me, in which I have been shown that certain articles that ai'e-sold in America at a certain rate could be landed to order in New South Wales at half that price. In other words, I have been offered the right to purchase the article at half the rate which is being asked of American farmers, according to the catalogues of tlie company. Protection, it is claimed, makes a country wealthy, and brings about progress and prosperity. I have been looking for a country that has had progress and prosperity as the result of protection, but I have not yet found ifc If any honourable member oan show me where such a place can be found, I am prepared to take a pilgrimage to it for the purpose of getting enlightenment. I was told in New South Wales to look at ATictoria, where I would find factories with smoking chimneys, and that it was because we had not got protection in Sydney that we do not possess the same tiling. I I am not so foolish as to have come to Victoria, but am not at all convinced. If anytliing, Victoria is behind New South AA ales. I have been looking at r statistics, because I thought ifc was just worthwhile to have a look at them, ancl see where some of my honourable friends have been getting their information from, and whether their statements are borne out by facts.

In 1885 Victoria had 41,542 men and boys employed in her factories, and in 1889, 44,041; so that an outlet for the employment of only 2,499 persons was provided within that period of fifteen years. In the old days it used to be said"" Give us protection ; because, what can we do for our boys without protection? It is only by establishing factories, and by imposing protective duties, tliat we shall be able to find work for our boys."" Yet, with protection, Victoriai n fifteen years found work for only 2,499 extra hands; so that protection seems to offer only a very slow solution of tlie problem. But what happened in the same period in New Soutli Wales the benighted country where the calico Jimmy lives, and where men aro produced who are not patriotic, and who want to sacrifice the natural opportunities of their State for tlie benefit of the foreigner 1 In 1885 New South Wales employed 36,390 men and boys in her factories, and in 1889, 4*7,063; an increase of 10,673. Between the years 1885 and 1889 both States suffered from severe commercial depression. Now, if there is anything that will test the stability of the industries of a country it is u period of financial trouble, ancl these figures show that New South Wales industries stood the test much better than Victorian industries did. The number of hands dismissed from New South Wales factories between 1889 and 1893, the years when the depression was at its worse, was 6,546, while 17,954 men were dismissed from similar industries in Victoria during the same period. I find that during the fifteen years to which I have referred, 120,000 persons emerged from boyhood into manhood in Victoria; but her smoking factories, and the avenues of employment which were to be created by protection to solve the problem, did not offer work for more than 2,499 of them. I would commend those figures to the consideration of honourable gentlemen opposite. I want to know why, if protection has not been able to solve in Victoria the difficulty of finding employment for the people, it will solve the difficulty when applied to the whole of Australia. Protection has had a fair trial, in a fair field, ancl its apostlesand believers in Victoria have been veiy earnest, so that if If protection had fulthere were a possibility of extracting out of it any solution of the labour trouble by finding larger avenues of employment, that solution should have been obtained in Victoria. If we compare the rate of increase of population in tlie two great cities of tlie south, Sydney and Melbourne, between 1891 and the present time, we find that while Sydney has increased her population hy over 102,109, the population of Melbourne has increased by only a miserable 3,069, and that of Adelaide has increased by 28,842. a protected State. anything for a country, it must find in creased opportunities of employment for the population of its big cities, and I understand it to be the contention of the advocates of the policy that it has that effect. But the fact remains that while tlie population of the capital of New South Wales, where natural conditions have been allowed to undergo their natural development, increased by over 100,000 in ten years, tlie population of the capital of Victoria, notwithstanding the artificial assistance given to tlie development of its resources, increased by only 3,000, and the population of the capital of South Australia increased by 28,000. free-trade policy 1 tionist policy of Victoria.

It deals with British expansion during the Victorian era, and the writer points out that, despite the fact that tliere was a large decrease in the population of Ireland, tlie population of the United Kingdom doubled itself during the reign of Queen Victoria. During the same period the public reveuue increased by 132 per cent., although the number of articles upon which duties are imposed has been reduced from over 1,000 in 1S43 to about 20 at the present day, and the public expenditure increased by 156 per cent., while the imports and exports of the kingdom increased by about 539 pei' cent., and the tonnage of shipping to the same extent. The writer, Mr Alleyne Ireland, sums up the position in this way :We hear a great deal about the decadence of the United Kingdom as a commercial power. We have heard a great deal on that subject here, to prove that protection is a better policy for building up commerce and increasing population ancl national greatness than is free-trade. But Englishmen may take some comfort from the above comparisons, which serve to show the enormous built of trade which still falls to the inprotection in New South Wales against habitants of the United Kingdom. It will be seen that the United Kingdom imports per head of ber population more than the United States, IVance, and Germany together, and that she exports of her own produce and manufactures nearly as much per head as the people of France and Germany taken together, or as the people of the United States and Germany taken together. It may also be noted that, whereas England depends on the United States for 32 per eent. of her trade, the United States does 57 per cent of her total trade with the United Kingdom. Yet, England, we are invited to believe, is decaying uncier the policy of free-trade, ancl we are asked to look to America, Germany, Erance, ancl other countries for evidences of national growth and prosperity under protection. I , for one, am satisfied that the comparison which has been made is wholly to the advantage of tlie mother country, so far as volume of trade and national wealth is concerned, though I . agree with the statement that national greatness does not depencl upon the volume of trade and national wealth of a country so much as upon the distribution of wealth among tlie people of the country. AndI find that amongst tlie people of .the country in free-trade countries it is more evenly distributed, and that tliere are those conditions which go in the direction of true national greatness and true national prosperity. That is my reason for tlie faith I have within me, ancl whilst I hold to that opinion I am not going to lend myself to any attempt, be it covert or otherwise, to inflict on this Australia of ours a protectionist Tariff. I believe that protection does make people wealthy; but it makes the few wealthy at the"" expense of the many. I belong-to the many, ancl I am going to raise my voice, and to assist in devising legislation in the interests of the many, and not in the interests of a particular class or section, or the few. I believe that true national greatness, true national life, is not to be built up by putting the millions in the hands of the Vanderbilts or in the hands of the few, but by distributing them as far as possible amongst tlie millions who make the millions-the toilers and workers. We have heard discussed, in years gone by, in New South Wales, these theories of free-trade ancl protection, and I have heard the honourable member for Riverina say the very identical things about New South Wales which he has urged here concerning Australia. He wants freedom in Australia and protection against the outside world. In New Soutli Wales, not so veiy long ago, he wanted Victoria, New Zealand, Queensland, ancl the other colonies, and one 'of the greatest benefits which federation will confer on Australia is to break down tlie. fiscal barriers that separate one Australian community from tlie otlier. The sooner those fiscal barriers are broken down and the people are allowed to trade in those directions in which they find it suits tliem best to trade in without let or restriction the better, and tlie more solid will the comniunity become.

Andi f it is a good thing for the people of Australia and New Zealand to trade with each other, why is it not equally good for the people. of the mother country and the people of the race from which we have sprung? there are those who say-""We agree in sentiment with that, but what we want to provide against is the competition with pauper labour and foreign labour."" Let honourable members look up their statistics and tliey will find that the trade which tlie people of Australia do with foreign powers is infinitesimal. The bulk of our trade is done with the people of our own race, and I believe in making that trade free, and in opening up the natural opportunities of our country; and we cannot open up those opportunites and make them available unless we have free intercourse and freedom of commerce and trade. It is in that way that we shall build up a nation here which we can very well be proud of, and which the race from which we have sprung may well be proud of. I a.m very pleased to have had this opportunity of addressing these sentiments to the House, and whilst there is much more that can be said on the matters set forth in the opening speech, I am not so hide-bound to any party as not to recognise good measures when I see them.

Some remarks. fell from the honourable member for Deniliquin in connection with revenue tariffists and protectionists. I stood before the electors of Illawarra as a revenue tariffist, and I held that a revenue Tariff meant this -that we thought that all the money coming from the Customs of the country should go into the public Treasury, be treated as I know public money, and be spent for tlie benefit of the people, whereas those who advocated the system of protection advocated that tlie whole of that money should go not into the Treasury, but should filter into the pockets of private individuals. I and the party to which I belong strongly objected to any part of the money coming from the Customs of the country going into the pockets of private individuals to enable them to become rich at the expense of the great masses of the comniunity. as far as true protective duties are concerned. been recognised as the result of protective duties that the bulk of the mone)*, at any rate, goes into the pockets of private individuals.

Luckily for tlie people of Australia, we have a strong and determined man in the position of Minister for Internal Affairs. I trust that the Government will, as Soon as practicable, take over the quarantine departments in the whole of the States, so that we can have one uniform system in tlie Federation. It has been pointed out by those in charge of the quarantine station in Sydney that if certain ships -had been properly inspected at the various ports they visited, this serious outbreak in Sydney and Melbourne would not have occurred. Nor, indeed, is this the only occasion on which a similar thing has occurred. Some time ago the Ghinykii was passing Thursday Island, and if a proper inspection had been made, we should not have had the serious outbreak which did take place.

I know that protectionists very often claim as the result of their system thiugs to which they are not entitled. I know that time after time in New South Wales our protectionist friends, in its Parliament, have claimed, as the result of their system, things to which they had no right. I know that there are some honourable members here who will remember tlie debate in tlie Legislative Assembly of that Statei n 1889, in connection with the duties on butter, bacon, and cheese. In another place during this debate it has been stated that the expansion of the butter industiy a few years ago really saved the State of Victoria. Naturally that would be put down to the system of protection which has been in existence here for a great number of yearSi But I would point out to honourable members that tlie protective duties were in existence here for a great number of years, and that there was no expansion of the industry under their operation. In New Soutli Wales we had exactly the same state of affairs. Under protective duties this great industry, whicli has become a national one, went down to a veiy low ebb indeed, and we men in tlie soutli coast districts of that State were compelled to make an inquiry into the matter with a view of bringing about a better condition amongst the farming population tliere. The result of our action was that one of our number went home to the old country and found out the most recent improvements in connection with the industry, and brought tlie dustry is only of recent growth in New South Wales. It was in that State that the industry was started, and thence it has extended to all the States of Australia.

But how can protection help the dairy farmers of New South Wales? We exported last year over 7,000,000 lbs. of butter to London and other, markets of the world. From Victoria there went over 26,000,000 lbs. of this article, and tlio export of butter from Australia altogether amounted to about 53,000,000 lbs. There was no butter imported into Australia, so that the dairy farmers had to contend with no competition in this article. How can there be any system of protection which will raise the price of butter to the dairy farmers ? We are dependent upon the price it brings in London and the other marl-ets of the world. We have to send our produce over 16,000 miles of ocean, and when we get it to London have to compete with Denmark and other countries which are only a few days' sail from tliat great market.

WhatI have said as to the wheat industry applies to all the great primary industries of Australia. In my constituency I take my information large quantities-of coal are produced.

It was officially called the Factories Act Inquiry Board, but it became known as the "" Sweating Board."" Its duty was to .inquire into the working of the Factories Act since 1890. In opposition to tliat, there was an organization known as the Victorian Anti Sweating League, and on the council of the organization were parsons, judges, merchants, journalists, legislators, and working men. Two big mass meetings were held in the Town Hall, the first of which fell through in consequence of the unpopularity of the then mayor, but the second held in 1895, and presided over by the Rev. Dr. Charles Strong, was a very large meeting. The first resolution carried was :That this meeting deeply regrets the extension of the sweating evil in our midst, and deplores the fact that public opinion has not long since been sufficiently aroused to insist upon its Suppression. A t that meeting remarks were made by a gentleman well known in Victoria, to which I would like to call the attention of the labour representatives here, and through them the attention of labour men in the Commonwealth. In submitting the motion, he said :Ardent protectionist as he was, he was sorry to admit that protection had failed-(cheers ) -so far as the workers were concerned. Workmen united to support protectionist candidates for Parliament, and were told when that system was established ""their wages would be secure. But the result had lieen that the employer was protected, whilst the workmen were starving. (Cheers). That is exactly what we on this side of the House say of the protectionist systemnamely, that the effect is to give the employer the opportunity of taking money out of the pockets of tlie people, and putting it into their own, while paying starvation wages to their own men. The speaker goes on to say :There were three trades that had suffered more than others by sweating-the boot trade, the furniture trade, and the clothing trade. (A voice: "" All heavily protected."") He was bound to admit that protection had failed in that respect. It was granted on the understanding that employers should maintain the standard rate of wages. Had they done so? (""No, no."") No,they had not done so, and the Avorkmen Avere ground down. They must insist on protection to the worker as well as to the employer. (Cheers.) Otherwise they must call upon ibhe' Legislature to withdraw that principle. (Cheers.) And these were all heavily protected trades. That is the opinion of Mr Bishop, In Victoria a board was then president of the Trades Hall Council; and the Trades Hal l at the present time is, I understand, a very large supporter of protectionist principles in Victoria. These are Avoids which ctdl for the most serious attention at the hands of everybody Avho wishes well for the working population of the whole of Australia. I do not Avish to labour this matter further than to quote the opinions of a few of the labour leaders of England. We have been told by some honourable members on the opposite side of the House tliat, so far from free-trade having benefited the working man, the very opposite has been the result. Now, I haA-e in my hand the opinions of five or six well-known labour leaders in England, and these, instead of supporting the proposition put forward by those honourable members, have the very opposite effect. I Avill just make a few quotations from some of these men, in order not to weary the House too much. months ago? sent from representative English labour leaders to MrA . Salaman, of Melbourne.

In reply to your inquiry ds to whether I think new industries spring up from the adoption of free trade, I beg to say that the great commerce of England has developed by leaps and bounds since the adoption of free-trade principles. With respect to wages of brass workers, they have increased since 1872 to the extent of between 30 and 40 per cent., and their hours reduced from GO to 54.

When we get Inter-State free-trade, if this black labour business is to be continued in Queensland, we shall immediately have the white men who are employed in tlie northern districts of New South Walesi n the sugar industiy placed in competition with the coloured labour of Queensland. I think it ought to be the duty of fore, to see that we do away with this black labour, so that we may 'have the whole of the industries of Australia carried on with white labour from one end of the continent to the other. I should like to say a word or two in reference to tlie federal capital. As far as I am concerned, I always objected to Sydney and the hundred miles of country around it being absolutely excluded from any possibility of becoming the site of the federal capital. I have always thought, seeing that Sydney is the oldest city of the continent, and that there are such beautiful sites for a capital about her neighbourhood, that that part of Australia should have the same right to be submitted for the consideration of this Parliament as any other part. However, we have agreed to the Constitution, in which the provision I have referred to is made. I look upon it as a most important thing, and 1 do not wish to go into the arguments that have been used in connection with this matter; but I do think that the Government ought, with the least possible delay, to have the site of the federal capital fixed, so that we may know where our federal Houses are to meet. As far as the whole of the land in connection with tbe capital is concerned, I think that not one acre of it should be sold. It should be kept in perpetuity for the people of Australia. We expect the federal capital to be a large place, and it must be borne in mind that we are not legislating for the few. millions who are in Australia at the present time. Many more millions will yet occupy this great country. When that time comes, this land on a proper system of lease, and with a periodical appraisement, will yield a large amount of revenue which will help to l if t the burden of taxation from the masses of the community. An other matter of importance is that of an Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration [39] Bill. We remember in New South Wales particularly-and Victoria had also some experience of it-the disastrous effect of the great maritime strike of 1890. As far as this Parliament is concerned, we have only power to form an industrial conciliation board for disputes extending beyond the limits of one particular State. I think the time has arrived when we should get away from the barbaric system of strikes, and have all these disputes between employers and employees settled by arbievery honourable member, theretration. I consider that this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should be made compulsory and binding so far as both parties to a dispute are concerned. I do not wish to take up further time at this stage of the debate, although there are many other matters I woidd have liked to have touched upon. I have come here as one of the representatives of New South Wales to do my best not only for New South Wales, but for the whole of the States. I regret exceedingly that, as far as the great colony of New Zealand is concerned, she is not with us in this Federation. We know that in 1891, when she was represented in the Convention by some very eminent men, including the late Sir George Grey, Captain Russell, and others, that Captain Russell said that, as far as New Zealand was concerned, she was prepared to accept the embraces of Australian Federation. But for some reason or other which is best known, I think, to her politicians, because I feel sure that the majority of tlie people of New Zealand do not agree with them in this matter, that colony has chosen to stand out of this federal movement. Not only has she stood out of it, but through her Agent-General, Mr Pember Reeve, she sought, when onr delegation was in London, to throw every possible obstacle in the way of the passage of the B ill ; since then she has tried to establish a sort of secondary federation by the attempted annexation of Fiji, which Mr Chamberlain promptly put his foot upon. accuse Mr Pember Reeve of throwing obstacles in the way; he made certain suggestions which were considered by a conference. There was no further trouble. that, because I gathered from the press that . a good deal of that sort of thing had been done.

To that fact I attribute the length of this debate. Now, I would not have spoken on this occasion at all had it not been for the remarks made by Mr Reid, who is not here to-night, and I am sure we are all sorry for the reason why he is not present with us.

Dr. Atkinson, suited him to form for his own guidance, I see how far he was likely to receive support. In addition to that he laid down, as he usually does, with great force and great ability, the views he holds with regard to the fiscal question; and I regret to say that he and some others who followed him adopted the old plan, to which we have become so accustomed in these colonies when this subject is being discussed, of apparently looking upon those who may differ from them on that question as belonging to one of two classes-eithe r the ignorant or the not quite honest. In other words, tliey are either to be classified as ignorant men who are fools or interested men who are knaves. No w l was in hopes that when we met together in this great Legislature whicli is now to administer the affairs of an enormous country, or what will in time become an enormous country, that we should have had this question discussed in a somewhat different spirit; that, at any rate, we should have been prepared to admit honesty of motives on both sides. I am addressing myself now to the special views put forward by the leader of the Opposition, but I am not prepared to say for a moment that both sides have not indulged in the same sort of thing. Surelyi t is for us, as men who have a great responsibility, as men who are making history very rapidly, to deal with this question in a way somewhat different from that in which we have dealt with it in our separate and somewhat antagonistic positions as members of different States having different policies. In speaking here to-night, I confess that my desire is, if possible, to prepare our minds to This debate is one of a some extent for a certain amount of tolerance of each other's views, so that when we come to deal with the very important matter of the Tariff we shall, at any .rate, be able to give each other credit for fair and reasonable conduct, and a desire to do that which is best for the country. Now, to show that my view in this connection is not an unreasonable one, I will just quote a few sentences from an authority whom I am sure our free-trade friends will accepta leading free-trader of the United States of America, Dr. Atkinson, who was one of the great supporters of Mr Cleveland. He does not, in supporting his view of the case, underrate or misrepresent the views of his opponents, but seeks to do them justice, and rests in his work ""Industrial Progress of the suppose, in order that he might Nation,"" at page 253, saysTo incite an inteUigent dUcussion of the Tariff and other economic questions in place of the common vitii/perative method which is so customary among those who may have no intelligent basis for what they call their opinions, and who are, therefore, accustomed to cover their real want of any knowledge of the subject by imputing ignorance or bad motives to their opponents on either side of the question. Having set out the points of the protective theory, Mr Atkinson continues:One may not hastily and dogmatically pronounce all these propositions to be without any foundation; and it is both useless and mischievous to denounce those who present such views as being mere spoliators, or to say that they are striving as a body to support themselves and those whom they employ at the cost of their neighbours without rendering any true service in return. These views have been and are now held in perfect sincerity and integrity by many of the most upright citizens in this country ; they are still believed to be sound by a very large number of intelligent men, who sustain them without any other purpose than because they fully believe that the wclfare of the nation depends upon their being' sustained.",54,Honourable Members Oh Oh Surely
235,Mr Harper (Mernda),"I regret that,orable member mean to say that that is the tone of our side ? bers to form their own opinions. Those whom the cap fits can wear it. Those who feel they are free from any charge of that kind do not come under my condemnation. Sir WILLIAM deny it, MrH ARPER 1 leave it to honourable members themselves, but I say it is desirable, on a great question of this sort, that we should deal with it in a fair, reasonable, and equitable manner, and that we ought to have open minds to hear the views of both sides, because we have a veiy serious responsibility attaching to us. Pharisaism. pensn. I prefer to be allowed to go on. If honourable members will interject I dare say I shall be inclined to follow tliem sometimes, but at this late hour it is desirable that I should be permitted to use my arguments in my own way. Those who feel that what I have said affects them can apply it ; while those who feel that they are not touched by it need not be affected in the least degree. My position is to some extent a unique one. I am as much interested in Sydney as I am in Melbourne, although I live in Melbourne. I am interested in large concerns in all the States, except Tasmania. I know the working of the fiscal systems that are in force in each of those States, and I think to a certain extent I may fairly claim to have some degree may call cosmo-political feeling with regard to all the individual States. I say this unhesitatingly, that I have often felt indignant beyond measure at the way in which those who advocate free-trade do so on grounds, which, to my mind, and for reasons which I will give presently, seem to be absolutely irrelevant. These grounds take the form of depreciating, in every possible way, the great State of Victoria. I read the other night the speech of an honourable member, whom I had not the honour deprecated the manner in which the provincial feeling existing between Victoria and New South Wales had been brought forward Of course, both States were blamed. getting out of a difficulty. He particularly objected to the manner in which certain financial peculiarities of New South WalesI leave honourable memhad been alluded to. He deprecated any such reference as being, I suppose, unfederal. It isa good thing to know that some honourable members have that feeling. I wish that all were of the same way of thinking; but I would remind honourable members of this, that when they adopt a line of argument which is irrelevant to the subject, and reflects upon others, they must expect reprisals. I say advisedly that a wise man avoids throwing stones when he lives in a glass house. There are two main points upon which Victoria, as it seems to me, is sought to be proved willy or nilly a shocking example as the result of pursuing a policy of protection. The free-trader looking at one side of the question, by some extraordinary constil l o n i soil qui mal y tution of mind, seems to me to take up this position, that if his policy is not carried out in any given circumstances or by any given State, that State must be going to ruin rapidly whether it knows it or not. But of course if it is proved, as most men would consider it perfectly proved, that it is not going to the dogs at all, thfcn of course it is so much the worse for the argument. There are two points which are looked to for proof that Victoria has suffered, is suffering, and will suffer under the policy she has pursued for -30 years past. The main point is that she has lost population; that she has not increased in population as a neighbouring State has done; that she has been in point of fact rapidly going back. I do think of what I that those who make that statement should certainly take the trouble of studying the statistics on which they base the opinion which they put forward with so much confidence ; that they should take care tliat they fairly read those statistics, and that they do not merely lay hold of what suits thc particular purpose of their argument. They should deal with the matter fairly and reasonably. Unquestionably, the State of Victoria has not kept pace of late with New South Wales in population. No one denies it. But was it any reproach to New South Wales that in the fifties and the sixties little Victoria added about 500,000 to her population when New ""South Wales added only about 150,000? Ofcoursenot. Weknow what the reason was. The reason was the That is a very favourite way of attraction of the gold-fields. During a very",55,Honourable Members Oh Oh Surely

240,Of Knowing,"Mr Lee-wh o said that hefew yearsI have got the figures here, but will not trouble to read them, although I brought them jyith me in case I should be questioned-durin g the few years between 1S51 and 187,0 Yictoria ran her population up from 70,000 to about 750,000. In the meantime tlie parent colony had gone on plodding along quietly, acquiring new population, more or less. Of course, Victoria outstripped her at that particular time, .and what I claim is-and what my honourable friend the honourable member for Wentworth knows perfectly well, because he is a Melbourne man, although he has become a Sydney man lately-that when we were attracting all these numbers Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN the population argument in my speech. I am simply referring to the honourable member as a gentleman who knows what happened at a particular period. not wish to attribute to the honourable member any remark which he did not make. I say this, that the fame of this country's gold-fields attracted within a few years, in my own time, as many as 1,000 people a day into Victoria. These men were not all miners, not. even a very small proportion of them, and they found after a short while that mining was not exactly the thing that suited them. They found also that the land they had come to, with the intention of making a fortune by goldmining, and then returning to the old country, was a desirable land to live in, and they naturally set about to see how tliey could make a living by the trades to which they had been accustomed in the old land. We put on protective duties here because, I believe, of an instinctive feeling, though perhaps it was not very logically or scientifically defined. We know that people do instinctively what them xinder given circumstances, and these people set to work to t r y to settle in this country and make it a great land. I say they have done it . During all this time has it not been the fact that Victorian men have gone from end to end of Australia ? You will find them everywhere, as I can say from personal knowledge. In the early sixties or seventies they rushed off to Port Curtisi n thousands and tens of thousands We had no protection then. date, but I was a young man at the time, and I remember well these men going off in their thousands, not because they disliked Victoria, but from the spirit of enterprise and adventure which animated them and whicli brought them here at first. We had to send for them, and bring them back again, because they did not get any gold. Then who were they who, after the Scotch, settled the Southern Island of New Zealand? In my time, 20,000 men went from Victoria to New Zealand, not because they disliked this country, or were dissatisfied with their prospects here; but moved by the spirit of adventure. These men helped to make New Zealand. Who were I never used they who, later on, made BrokenH ill ? the miners of BrokenH ill are, I understand, Victorians. Who were they who increased I do the population of little Tasmania? Victorians. Who were they who, in the early seventies, took up Riverina, and who by so doing increased the population of New South Wales? Victorians. Who were they who establislied the sugar industry in Queensland, and lost £5,000,000 of capital the last time there was a crisis in the sugar trade ? Victorians. Western AustraUa1 reminds me of what I had almost forgotten; a fact which, though last to be mentioned, is not least in importance. I ask, who ran up the population of AVestern Australia from 40,000 to 160,000? Mainly Victorians. Victorians have from tlie first been Australians. It has often been said that Victoria was more strongly in favour of federation than was any other State. W h y was that ? It was because A^ictorians had is best for set themselves to possess AustraUa before' the question of federation came up for consideration at all. It is only since the crisis of 1893 tliat there has been any falling-off in the population of Victoria, and, in my humble opinion, it is unfederal, and, I think, unkind to refer to it . Up to 1893 Victoria and New South Wales kept neck and neck, although the territory of New South Wales is three and a half times as large as that of Victoria, and her resources,, therefore, much greater; but when that terrible calamity which aUof us have good reason to remember fell upon Victoria, our people",56,Mcmillan I Absolutely

248,Mr Harper,"My honourable friendreceived a stunning blow, from which it took us years to recover, but from which we have recovered. Many of our people went away-no t because of any question of protection or free-trade. to earn a living elsewhere, because the Statei n which many of them had wives and families was for the time being unable to afford them the sustenance they required. I trust that we shall have no more of these comparisons. I have given honourable members my defence of Victoria. I have told the House why our people left this State for a time. Are honourable members aware that between 1892 and 1S94, between 50,000 and 60,000 people left the city of Melbourne, and that we have since gained back that number, and 3,000 persons in addition? Why was it that the financial crisis was so severely right honourable friend the Treasurer had to bear the brunt of it , and I think that it took a good deal out of him. He received instructions from the electors-and I do not think they were quite wise instructions-that he was not to spend any more money than he could help. From spending £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 of loan money a year, as the Government had been doing for years past, they came to spend almost nothing, and tliat cessation of Government expenditure came on top of the dearth of private employment which was the consequence of the financial crisis. My opinion all along was that at that time the Government ought to have borrowed and spent money reasonably on necessary works in order to give our population employment, and thus help us over the stile. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN member must not forget that we in New South Wales went through very nearly the same difficulties.

Scotch. Scotch. I want to remind the House of a few facts which account for the felt in Victoria? My mildness of the crisis in New South Wales compared with its severity in Victoria. Are honourable members aware that, during the ten years which have elapsed since tlie time to which I am referring, New South Wales has steadily spent over £2,000,000 of loan money per annum, while the average annual loan expenditure of Victoria has been only £500,000 ? The net amount of loan money spent in New South Wales from the years 1892-93 to the year 1900 has been £12,564,000, while the amount spent by Victoria has been only £4,000,000. Then, during the last eighteen years, there has been an expenditure of capital amounting on the average to £1,200,000 per annum. The expenditure is going on now. refers to the expenditure of land revenue ? ture of t h e ' proceeds derived from the selling of Crown lands. It is only fair to admit that we are doing the same thing in Victoria; but we are doing it on a much more limited scale.

I think we get-is All I ask for it £400,000 from that source? there which New South Wales has to the good-£2,000,00 0 of loan money and £1,000,000 of land money. MrA .

286,Mr Harper,"There are a good manygold-fields. States are: Queensland, 50; New South Wales, 48 ; Victoria, 30. It will be seen that the return for Victoria is far better than for New South Walesi n regard to bad debts ; and that is.a very good gauge as to whether a country is anything like "" dead broke "" or not. That is the point I wish to enlarge upon, because the argument with regard to Victoria is that protection has nearly ruined her. AVe are told that Victoria is ill and we do not feel it . We do not see any symptoms of illness; and we, therefore, tell honourable members opposite that if tliey want to prove their free trade arguments they will have to go upon a different tack altogether, and find some other grounds for tlieir contention. One other point was made by the leader of the Opposition, and has been utilized by the press. AVe are told that Victoria, owing to her protectionist policy, is bringing the women and children into the factories and making the men walk tlie streets in enforced idleness: That is a very strong point with the leader of the Opposition. I am sorry I did not bring his exact remarks, but I think I have correctly stated his point. AVell, the otherdayMiss Cuthbertson, a veiy competent woman, who is the chief female, inspector of factories for Victoria, made a statement in which she alludes to this point. She says, very fairly, that the charge that our system excludes men from employment, while women and children are being employed in the factories, would, if it Were the case, "" be an absolute blot not only on our factory legislation but on our civilization."" Buti t is not true. That is the misfortune of these statements-the y are telling as arguments for free-trade, but they are not true. I will tell the House why. Miss Cuthbertson says, but I will give the gist of it. She points out that, from 18S6 to 1891, there was a steady increase of males and females employed in our factories. Tn .1.891 the crisis came. From 1891 to -1894 there was a diminution in the numbers of both males and females employed. In 1894 an A ct was passed which brought under the factory law places in whicli four or more persons were employed. Miss Cuthbertson very fairly starts her comparison from 1894, a time when she had a satisfactory ground upon whicli to make it. In 1894 there were employed in the factories of Victoria 23,164 males and 11,104 females. In 1899 there were employed 31,649 males and 17,897 females. These figures show an increase of males in the period of 8,485, and an increase of females of 6,793. Miss Cuthbertson points out-and this is the answer to those precious statistics which are used in such an indiscriminate fashionthat 4,000 out of these 6,793 females were employed in the dress-making mantle'ttiaking, clothing, and shirt trades, which, are pre-eminently women's employments, and at which men could hardly work. As to the remaining 2,700, it would take too long to read the list of trades, but I will show the return to any honourable member who wishes to see it. Miss Cuthbertson gives the increase in every trade, and the result is that the 2,700 are fully accounted for She says in her closing remarksWe find that the general increase outside of four trades, which may be deemed trades whicli are given over almost entirely to women, is only 2,000 in 5 years, and this increase would be spread, over 50 trades. NowI have dealt with the statement that we are putting women into our factories and turning men out of employment, and I will not say anything more about it. I trust that we have heard the last of that sort of argument. the Commercial Bank. improper remark as applied to me, but I am prepared to answer it . I had no more to do witli theCommercialBank tlian the honourable member who interjects, and I am glad that I liad nothing to do with it .

Now, I have connected the Commercial Bank question with the question before the House; and I wish to tell honourable members that I had no more to do with that institution than the honourable member hod whdinterjected. ThelateHonorable James Service sent a telegram to me at Adelaide, where I was when the bank stopped, aud asked me in common with two other gentlemen-publi c men--to come in and do what we could to stem the tide of distrust and save the institution if it were possible. I had neither share nor interest, in the"" Commercial Bank, and it ill becomes the honourable member or any other person to throw this at me, for reasons which are well known in the House, and to which I need not refer. I will now, sir, come back to the argument whicli I was placing before the House when interrupted. I of those charges against Yictoria, which are made in order to prove that free-trade is right and protection is wrong. I have every respect for those who take the free-trade view, and, respecting their opinions, I agree with tliem when I can. But those honourable members are constantly telling us that, because Great Britain is great and prosperous and has free-trade, therefore, free-trade is the right thing for the Australian Commonwealtli, and, in fact, for all the world. That is a very poor argument, and I will quote another authority whom honourable members will respect, whether or not thejr agree with the opinions expressed. I refer to Professor Eawcett, who, in his book, .Free-brade and Protection, savs, at pages 11 and 12 :I think it cannot be denied that the progress of free-trade has been materially retaixled by its advocates assuming a too contemptuous tone towards the supporters of protection in other countries. We in England are much too prone to overstate the results of free-trade. Scarcely a week elapses without its being said, as if it were a triumphant rejoinder to all tliat is urged by the American, the continental, or the colonial protectionist, ""English exports and imports have member is suppressing something. more than quadrupled since protection was abolished: the income of the country, as shown by the yield of the income tax, has more than doubled, wages have advanced, and population has increased."" Professor Eawcett goes on to say :But a moment's consideration will show that I have referred to the other causes have beeu in operation besides free trade to promote this wonderful growth of prosperity. tliat. ber, and those who think with him, do not admit that practically in their arguments. AAHiatI complain of is that those honourable members are always admitting things, but when it comes to argument they will not admit any tiling. bring them into prominence. position. Tliere is a judicious suppression, allowing awkward facts to drift into the background, while other facts are brought into undue prominence ; and we know that a false perspective is most difficult and dangerous to deal with. Professor Eawcett adds:Nothing seems to me more certain than that in discussing the position of protection at the prehave dealt with the question sent time something more will be required than perpetual appeals to the rapidity with which commerce has grown and wealth has been accumulated in England. I say, so, too and I think that is what we want in Australia as well as in England. If any one desires to prove a case, it seems to me always a sign of weakness to go into side issues which are not relevant and can be met by others equally strong; and that is what Professor Eawcett says. If you boil down all the arguments put forward in Sydney or Melbourne, in tlie press or on the platform, in favour of free-trade, it will be found that about 99|per cent, are just arguments of that sort, and that there is a little residuum, about ^ per cent. tection, too? trade just now. the game all right himself. game, and I challenge any honourable member to show that I am.

I have learnt too much from discussing matters with free-traders to fall into that mistake and I always look argument to see if there be any vulnerable point before I put it forward. It will not do to tell us, as we are told every day, that Great Britain is prosperous. We know she is prosperous; but there are a great many things, as Professor Eawcett points out, which have built up that prosperity, and these things are well known. I am going to bring forward an argument tonight, and I want to guard myself against doing that to whicli objection has just been taken. I am going to make a statement with regard to the progress of Great Britain, and also other countries, notably the United States. purpose to show that the protectionist policy is the right one because America, Germany, or any other country has got ahead of England at a certain time. I simply want to call attention to the position of those countries, and to ask my free-trade friends the question : if free-trade is a heaven-sent inspiration, John Bright admitted it was not given from Mount Sinai, although he said it was equally strong in favour of freedom and for the benefit of the people, or something of that sort tion that made John Bright support the slave-owning states in the American civil war.

Now, I may tell honourable members, although, perhaps, it is not very interesting, that the Corn Laws were abolished just about the time that I came into this world, I am not desirous of and I was brought up under the ful l inspiI f the honourable ration of the wave of feeling that occurred then. But when I began to grow up, and to take an interest in this question, I can assure the House that the first thing which shook my confidence in the Cobden doctrine round my was the fact that whilst the free-traders had always been predicting that the United States would come to grief, it never came off. the sort. down to the honourable member's ignorance of history. I am dealing with the question from the historic stand-point. able member to name any one who has said anything else, It is not my fair question. that any well-informed man, whether free trader or protectionist, who knew anything about history, knew that. I confess that I am not here to-night to prove a thing which I thought would meet with universal acceptance ; but, if the honourable member for Werriwa will give me an opportunity, I will produce authority for my statement later on. WhatI want to say is this: that we have had prominently brought before our attention two countries in which we can trace clearly and unmistakably two lines of fiscal poliej-. Those countries are Great Britain and the United States. Now, Great Britain, as we know, is a very much older country than the My argument is not, as United States.

316,,"Mr HARPER , I am glad to hear of their minds in order to impress it upon them, because it seems to me that many of those honourable members allow facts to glide over tliem like water over a duck's back. I intend giving a very few figures, and I would like the attention of those honourable members to whom I refer, for about two minutes. The wealth of Great Britain in 1800 was £1,740,000,000, whilst in 1790 that of the United States was £129,000,000. In 188S, the wealth of Great Britain was £9,400,000,000, whilst that of the United States was represented by £12,824,000,000. The earnings of Great Britain were represented by £ 3 4 per head in 1889, and in tlie United States by £ 3 9 per head in 1886-89. In the savings bank in 1889 Great Britain had deposits amounting to £107,000,000, and the United States had deposits totalling £283,000,000. I mention these facts to show that a country which started its career with 12,000,000 of people less than Great Britain, and which has reclaimed a great territory, is certainly a couutry that has not been ruined by her fiscal policy. United States last year were monj than those of Great Britain. I want to impress that aspect of the question on my honourable friends. I say if it be soSir WILLIAM' McMILLAN -Nobody ever said it was so; that is the only thing. this side of the House said that the United States was ever ruined. honourable member quite understands my argument. I do not say that the honourable member said so. I am simply pointing out that the free-traders say that England is prosperous. she is prosperous because she is free trade. I am pointing out that America is also rich and prosperous. She i's a protectionist country, but I am not going to follow the example of my free-trade friends and say ergo she is prosperous because of protection. I think that is a perfectly legitimate line of argument. I think that the great weakness of the other side is that they are always stating things which are indubitable. Nobody denies that England has been prosperous any more than that America has been prosperous. We arrive at two different conclusions from two different methods. And I would ask-I s it not becoming, is it not right, that we who have been placed in the honourable and highly responsible position of initiating this new Commonwealth, ancl of starting it on its career, should come to the consideration of this question, not with our minds hide-bound, .but with our minds open to see how far we can get historical guidance, which after all is the best guidance, because "" what has been, shall be, and tliere is nothing new under the sun."" I take it, that we have to consider-if we have a sense of our responsibility-the circumstances of each country; to discover, if possible, that country which most nearly resembles our own in circumstances and in prospects, and to the best of our ability and without bias to say what we think is the right policy to pursue. Instead of that, what do honourable members on the free-trade side say? They come here hide-bound, fighting the question of abstract free-trade, and prepared to fight it at a time when the difficulties confronting us, without the added difficulty of .this abstract question, are enormous. We are confronted with the task of uniting these States, of welding them together, of making them a Commonwealth in fact as well as in name; aud I I am coming to that. say that when we realize, as I have tried to realize, our responsibilities and difficulties, we must come to the conclusion that it is a misfortune to add to those difficulties at this stage by bringing up a question which is, after all, one of abstract politics. It can be shown on the one side that Great Britain has been prosperous, and on the other side that America has been prosperous. AVe here I do not think the in Australia can point to five States out of six, which have adopted a certain policy. Perhaps, if I have time before I finish my speech, I may say a word or two as to what I consider are the serious obligations that England is free-trade, ergo, confront us. the hide-bound country which returned only one member with different opinions to all the rest ? may laugh, but I have been there before. NowI have read those figures briefly about America, and in the Norih American Review there is a very remarkable article dealing with this question. It is not a free-trade or protectionist article; it deals simply with a question of trade, and it points out that America for the first time has equalled Great Britaini n her exports.

They exported double the quantity of manufactured articles. They are now iu the position of exporting £ 2 worth of manufactured goods for every £ 1 worth of manufactured goods which theyimport. Now, I say, we are not entitled to put aside these facts. They ought to be considered, and if possible accounted for. There is only one way of accounting for them. We know the great outcry there has been and the prophecies of ruin that have been uttered about Germany, and now when there is a little bit of an industrial crisis in Germanyi t is said, as a matter of fact, that they are ruined. I think it can be easily proved that tliey are not, although people will tell you that such is the case on account of the beet sugar industry. The only possible explanation to my mind of the facts which I have mentioned, is the old one, and one for which the high priest and prophet of free-trade, Adam Smith, is my authority. I trust honourable gentlemen opposite will, at all events, i-espect that honoured name. to read him. able gentlemen the explanation which commends itself to me, and which commended itself to Adam Smith. the whole of Adam Smith the honourable member has in his hand, is it? friend ought to know me well enough to be sure that he will not put me off any is quite capable of showing it up.

Adam Smith saysThe capital which is employed in purchasing* in oue part of the country in order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country, generally replaces by such operation two distinct capitals that hud both been employed in the agriculture or manufacture of that country, and therefore enables tliem to continue that employment. When both are the produce of domestic industry, it necessarily replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals, which had both been employed in supporting productive labour, and thereby enables them to continue that support. The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to London, and brings back English manufactures and own to Ediiiburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such operation, two Britisli capitals, which have both been employed in the T h a t is not agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain. posed by John Stuart Mill.

360,Mr Glynn,"Has the honourable memberwent np to double its value. Of course, I am merely arguing in this way so as to get honourable members to realize that, in starting the affairs of this new nation, we ought to give due consideration to all these facts. We ought to ascertain from them, so far as they can guide us, what is the right course to pursue. Honourable members may laugh, and those who know the conditions of business in the old country may be held up to opprobrium; but I have read a letter written to the newspapers by Lord Masham, who, before he was made a peer, was the head of the largest silk concern in Great Britain, in which he points out that the silk trade of England has been absolutely ruined, and he attributes its ruin to the want of protection. He points out that the people of England have apparently made up their minds to do without a silk trade, and that, if so, they have only to let things remain as they are in order to bring it to an end. He shows most plainly that free-trade is a craze whicli seized the British people, but from which they are now recovering. I saw very -marked signs of that recovery when I was home in the years 1895 and 1896. I heard an honourable gentleman speak to-night about what the leaders of the unions have to say on this subject; but, in my opinion, the leaders of the unions will change their views on this subject, as they have changed their views on other subjects, whenever they find the shoe pinching them; and they are beginning to find it ' pinching them now. In my boyhood, if you went into a shop or commercial establishment in Great Britain, you wonld not see a foreign article in the place; but now nine out of ten of the articles on the shelves have come from America, Germany, Belgium, ancl other countries. No country can go ou importing foreign manufactures at that rate, and for Australia at this stage of its development to think of subjecting itself to the competition of the world, as some honourable members would have us do, is mere madness. WhatI plead for is that honourable members will try to realize the position in which we are placed, and open their minds and increase their knowledge-I , on my part, am ready to hear anything that may be said on the other side-so that when we come to legislate on this question we may deal with it in the Constitution was formed upon the as a way that will be satisfactory to the people, and, what is of more importance, in a manner which we may feel assured will bring about results which will be conducive to the future welfare of this country. England increased in 30 years from £ 1 1 to £ 2 1 per head. honourable member's interjection ; but I am not going to be led aside, because I want to conclude my remarks. I need only say that we have heard statements like that before. I have already alluded to the very serious position in which the Constitution Act has placed us in regard to tlie imposition of a uniform Tariff. There is a phrase in the provision of the Constitution which deals with the Tariff, which seems to me to need a good deal of explanation ; it is tlie phrase"" after the imposition of uniform custom duties."" In my opinion, the financial sections of the Constitution-and I have never held two opinions on the subject-ar e about the most unsatisfactory part of tlie work of the Convention. I have tried to project my mind into a consideration of the condition of things which may occur when we begin to work this financial machinery. The honourable member for Bendigo has expressed the opinion that, in order to get over the preliminary difficulty in regard to £ the collection of uniform duties immediately their intended impositionis announced, an Act might be passed to validate such a proceeding; but the honourable member for In di has given it as his opinion that that would not meet the case, ancl I , as a layman, agree with him. The point is one to which I should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to give his attention. According to tlie provision in the Constitution, certain things are to happen upon tlie imposition of a uniform Tariff. One thing which is to happen is that intercolonial free-trade must at once ensue. Another thing is that from the time of the imposition of the uniform Tariff all goods imported into any State prior to such imposition and exported within two years to another State, must pay duty equal to the federal duty. difference between the State duty and the federal duty. the difference.

384,Mr Conroy,"I will withdraw thestatute-book that will be worthy of us. I think the Ministry ought always to bear in mind three great points in submitting any measures to the House, and indeed before venturing to put them before the country.' The first is that laws should be as few as -possible, so that everybody may know what they are. beas simpleas possible, so that everybody may 'be able to understand them. And the third point is that laws should be so drawn that they will effectually accomplish the purpose 'intended. I hope that that will be the spirit in which honourable members will treat all the measures that may come before them. I am aware that the Ministry do not propose that there shall be full discussion upon all their measures. They have shown that in a way which I think is unmistakable. Why, sir, tliey brought forward a proposal that no less than twelve members should rise in their place to entitle a motion for the adjournment of the -House to be moved, clearly excluding the members for smaller States from rising and bringing forward any serious inatter, it might be a State matter. Tasmania has only five representatives, and if it is insisted tliat twelve members shall rise to support a motion for adjournment, how can those honourable members draw attention, as they may have to do, to some pressing matter 1 Andi t is tlie same in regard to South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia. will help them. in which a Ministry ought to introduce measures in this House. We have done with the days of aristocracy or autocracy for ever I think in that respect, and the only aristocracy that is going to rule is the aristocracy of intellect. How clearly Ministers are addressing themselves to the electors and not to the members of this House measure they that is a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. They propose that that measure shall be coiupulsory. I should like to ask the Government how they can possibly make any measure of arbitration compulsory 1 They may compel the parties to submit their case to arbitration, but they cannot make them abide by the decision of the arbitrators. Take the case of men going out on strike for higher wages. Do the Government propose, in order to carry out the award of 'the court, to make those men go back to work at the rate of wages upon which they struck,, when perhaps in other directions they could earn a higher rate t If they did not compel the men to go back how could the law be called a compulsory arbitration law ? in New Zealand. under it . There have been cases where by means of a little mutual conciliation, and through a court before which the parties present themselves and have the matter of difference thrashed out, the decision has by force of public opinion been carried into effect. But that is not compulsion Western Australia also. with the case where the verdict goes against the men, and shown how impossible it would be to make them go back to work at wages with which they were discontented. Take tlie case of employers. I am supposing an instance where the difference between tlie men and their employers is not one that has arisen through some hasty circumstance which has not been thoroughly considered, but a strike about matters upon which it has not been possible to come to an agreement. If a higher wage is fixed, do the Government propose to compel the employers to pay it ? If so, another court may step in, and that is the Court of In solvency, which may compel the masters to pay only such wages as are consistent with profits. I object to measures being brought into this House and given names that do not properly describe them. We are not here to court popularity, but to legislate for the benefit of Australia as a whole. We are not here to give popular names to measures that are not workable, but to advance the interests of the general community. is shown in another have spoken of, and SirJ OHN FORREST -That is what we all want to do. honourable members opposite there is as true an interest in the affairs of Australia as there is even in myself.

391,Mr Conroy,"I trust so. In manybe raised by means of the Tariff. He has said that it is necessary to raise no less than £8,500,000, by Customs and Excise, and that some measure of taxation, designed to bring in that revenue, will be submitted to this House. The amount of revenue collected from Customs and Excise last year in Australia was £7,4=00,000. It will be a very bad thing indeed for tlie Eederal Go-, vernment to go beyond that amount. The answer given by the Prime Minister to one interjector was, that we must consider the interests of the smaller States and the revenue they require. To that I reply, that we are considering the interests of the smaller States when we refuse to impose any greater taxation upon Australia than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of government. In lessening the load of taxation upon the smaller States, as we shall do if we do not propose the raising of not more than £7,400,000 through the customs, we shall be allowing a full opportunity for the development of the revenue in a hundred other directions. The whole experience of govermnent in tlie past shows that the more you lighten taxation through Customs and Excise the freer play you give for the revenue to advance in other ways. In England at the time of tlie corn laws there was a class objection to the duties being removed. She was then suffering from annual -deficits of nearly a million. The teaching of political economists was that, if the Government swept away three-fourths of the duties then imposed, the}' would receive more revenue in otlier directions. They did so, and got what tliey required. We must not lose sight of thefactthatthe greatest of the States, and the one which contains one-third of the whole population of the Commonwealth, is perfectly convinced that a Tariff producing £6,000,000 would give her backallthe revenue sherequires. Such aTariff would give New South Wales every penny she needs, and it would also, I take it, produce the £1,500,000 which will be sufficient for all the requirements of the Federal Government, unless there is to be some extraordinary increase in the military vote. As to that, if the experience of the -last Boer war has shown anything it is that we can considerably lessen onr military expenditure. So far from increasing the military vote, our object should be to decrease it very considerably indeed, by lessening the military establishments of the various States. That can be done without injury to any one. Our defences would then devolve upon our citizen soldiery. citizen soldiery now, barring the permanent artillery 1 tablishments are costing .something like £500,000 a year, and there is too great an expenditure upon what I call the trappings of militarism. It is our duty to get away from that bad system altogether. I believe that New South Wales is content for the purpose of preserving the Union to allow the Tariff to go up to £7,000,000, which would be ample to give the Federal Government all it requires for some time to come. If we start with a low Tariff, we shall still leave a taxable reserve for the Federal Government to draw upon as soon as the 87th section is amended, as amended I believe it must be. Even then the Federal Government will be able to extend its powers in many other directions. We have been told that there is only one way in which the revenue can be collected, and that we can have no direct taxation so far as the Federation is concerned. We have been assured that we must raise an extra amount to pay back to the smaller States what they require. able member's leader told us. must have a Tariff of as high as £8,000,000, and the Prime Minister said that wealth could not bear any more taxation. that; it is entirely incorrect. gives a denial I am glad to hear it.

If it be right to put a tax of 4s. or 5s. on the poor classes of the people, it is right and just that an income tax of 4s. or 5s. sliould be put-= ber quote the Minister who said that ? whole argument. of the kind said the Ministry has been that a certain amount of the high duties must be kept ap. As a strong free-trader, I object to taxation of any sort whatever, and any taxation beyond that necessary for the sound and honest administration of the country represents to my mind, a sum taken directly from industry itself. It lessens the amount of capital in the community, and consequently increases the burden on the poor. We have been told that we ought to ask ourselves 1 what protectionmeans; but the sentence is never finished by protectionists. Protection means protection' to the manufacturing class. As we are now exporting our agricultural products, tliere clearly can be no protection so far as'the agriculturist is concerned ; as it is and always has been in the past, tbere clearly can be no protection so far as. a miner is concerned, and there clearly can be no protection so far as the pastoralist is concerned. Therefore, we at once fall 'back on the one class which, by any' stretch of the imagination, duties can be said to benefit, namely, the manufacturing class.. And the manu; facturing class do riot-always receive the full amount of-tlie tax, because sometimes it costs far more to produce the article than the price they cari at first get for it , and certainly far more than the price at which the people of the country could get it elsewhere. Why should we seek to limit trade in any way whatever? natural exchange that goes on; and I , for one, have never asserted-no r have I.heard -it asserted-that free trade is, a panacea for : all ills. We only assert that free-trade means allowing the natural exchange which goes on betweenindividuals, to go on just as freely between nations. No amount of argument can alter that great natural law. Whyi n ' protectionist America do people congregate at ports like New York, or places like Chicago, if not because these places offer the best advantages for trade ? W h y do people congregate in a place like Melbourne ? Because Melbourne offers the best facilities for trade. If tlie protectionist argument be right, and the desire be to keep employment and money in the country, all that it would be necessary to do in order to start thousands of carriers, employ farmers to breed horses for those carriers, waggoners to drive the horses and blacksmiths to shoe them, carriage builders to make the -waggons, and harness-makers to make all the harness, would be to pass a law removing Melbourne 50 miles inland. If one class is worthy of consideration, the classes engaged in all these industries-and look at the amount of indirect employment that would be afforded in other directions-ar e just as deserving of consideration. Butprotectionists never do carry out their argument in this respect. In spite of them trade always congregates at places where the best facilities are offered. The honourable member for Moreton said that so. far as he was concerned, he could se'e no difference between allowing cheap goods to come in and allowing cheap 'labour to come in. I trust I may be allowed to explain the very great difference there is. I will take as an illustration the matter of tea, which is produced by Chinese cheap labour. It is perfectly clear that wages are determined absolutely by supply and demand, and, of course, by the amount of capital there is to divide amongst the workmen here. An Honorable MEMBER -I s that the "" wage fund "" again ? exactly by the amount of capital there is in a country, and the number of workmen offering for employment. If there are two workmen, and only capital to afford sufficient employment for one, wages clearly go down. If tliere is one workman, and capital for two, wages just as clearly go up, and the amount of wages is limited solely by the Trade is the amount of capital there is offeringfor workers.

406,Mr Conroy,"Wages are determinedcome from in the first instance 1 lated product of the labour of a community, and it cannot be obtained by making things at a loss. That is the point I should like honourable members to bear in mind. It is only when a thing produced is worth more than it cost to produce that there can be any capital at all created; aud honourable members can realize that in a dozen cases. If a man be put on to work in a mine at £ 2 10s. a week, and the mine only produces 30s. worth of gold, so far as the community is concerned there is a loss of £ 1 . If a man be put to work at a trade at £ 2 10s. a week, and he produces an article only worth 30s., it is clear the community have lost £ 1 ; and not only that, but the workman has not gained by being employed in an unproductive work, because he would have been producing something else in some other line. A very different result, indeed, is obtained if, instead cannot be obtained under a protectionist of allowing a free exchange of goods we allow workmen who have been accustomed to work at l d . per hour to come to our employers and say they will work for that rate of wage. It is perfectly true that wages, following tlie same law of supply and demand, would then show a tendency to fall to the rate of I d . , and would undoubtedly do so. As showing how entirely the rate of wages is dependent on supply and demand in a particular locality, and on the amount of capital there, we have only to go to Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie, where, with a large influx of capital ready to be put into the mines, men got £ 4 and £ 5 a week, because there were not sufficient men offering themselves for employment. But the moment that the mfen crowdedin, and the amount of capital to be divided amongst tliem became less, the wages began to fall. If the protectionist arguments are perfectly right, then, instead of the"" men being crowded at the ports, we would see them up in the furthest parts of Central Australia, because those parts offer a natural protection. I suppose that in the centre of South Australia, or in portions even of the Northern Territory-if that is taken over by the Federal Government;-ther e are fine localities for the establishment of all these manufactures, because there they would have a natural protection of not less than 300 or 400 per cent. any demand for their wares up there ? arguments are right; instead of having a railway to the border, we ought totear it up, because of all the-men we would give employment to in the carrying trade. Thevery men we would thus employ would need double the number of boots they now require, because they would wear them out so much quicker. I admit that this sort of argument brings the inatter down to an absurdity, but that is what tlie protectionist doctrine really is. If the Government cameforward and said-""We-ar e going to impose a revenue Tariff because it is an easy way. of collecting revenue "" there would be more difficulty in answering them. But we would still . have to say "" You must bring down a Tariff which will exact from each man only in proportion to his means,"" because tlie proper principle of taxation is that there shall be'as far as possible an equality of sacrifice, and that Taritf. Even a revenue Tariff, which does not put anything either into the pockets of the manufacturer or into the coffers of the State, causes considerable burdens to fall upon the people. Honourable members will find that tlie people of the country will have a great deal to say about this inatter when next they have an opportunity of exercising tlieir votes upon it . They are beginning to see that protection is only taken up in the interests of a class, the manufacturing class, that is often blind to its. best interests,as many politicians in Yictoria were blind to the interests of tliat State when' they put on a stock tax, and thus raised the price of meat to the consumers to the extent of 2d. or 3d. per lb. They caused that additional burden to fall upon the people, a burden that is so heavy that the people of Yictoria consume 76 lbs. of meat per head less than tlie people of the neighbouring State. This is not because their desire for meat is not so keen as that of the. people of the neighbouring State, but simpfy because they are unable to pay the extra amount demanded of them.

How can it be ? Trade is merely an exchange of goods for goods, commodities for commodities, and any interference with it must be wrong.

The moment, therefore, thereisany interference ou the part of the Government or any one else, some injury must result. member sooner trade with free-trade England or protectionist America? wherever it is to my advantage, and if I can get £ 1 2 0 worth of goods, for £ 1 0 0 worth, I shall be only too glad to do it, and so would the honourable member. I could not help feeling a certain amount of regret when I heard the Minister for Customs make the statement that as far as England was concerned, 1£ per cent, of the people held 99 per cent, of the wealth. adult population held 80 per cent, of the wealth. I took notice of the statement, and I regret to say that there have been several others made which cannot be supported by an\book of statistics that I am acquainted with. I find that it is perfectly true that 2 per cent, of the people hold 65 per cent, of the wealth of England, but that is all, aud that, I admit, is a very great amount, too. Rut when I come to look at the statistics of America, I find that one-fifth of 1 per cent, hold over half the wealth,or 54 per cent, of it . What we are aiming at, I take it , is to increase the wealth of the community, and by compelling a certain portion of the population to go in for industries which are not natural, we are clearly trading on those people who are engaged in the great natural industries. When a man manufactures an article and it is worth less than it cost to produce, how can it be said that there is any addition to our wealth-o n the contrary, there is a diminution of our wealth to that extent. No trouble arises when a manufacturer comes to us and asks £ 1 for an article that is worth £ 1 . The trouble arises when he comes to us and says-""Her e is an article which is worth 15s., and I want £ 1 for it . "" When we object to pay the extra sum, and say we will not give it , Therefore what becomes of the what does he do 1 He at once goes away to Parliament, and by some means or other gets people to join in with him in agitating for a duty of, say, 25 per cent., such as is placed on many articles in Yictoria. When he gets the duty he comes back to us and says"" You would not give me £ 1 for this article, now you will have to give it because you cannot buy it anywhere else V What an injury that is to us. fsict 1 not get a higher price for the article, where is the advantage of the duties % honourable member refer to 1 articles which demand a Tariff before they can be produced. It is quite clear that the community has to bear this burden, and I ask why should it be necessary to impose it . We are, of course, told sometimes that the importer pays the tax. Well, if it is the importer who pays it , and if he does not pass it o n ; if we have a body of charitable men meeting together, and agreeing to pay £8,000,000 of money which they will not pass on to others, perhaps honourable members on the other side would not mind mentioning them to us, and we should be only too glad to know them. What is the meaning of the words "" in direct taxation,"" unless it is taxation collected from a person with the expectation and intention that he will indemnify himself at the expense of others 1 Clearly, therefore, if they have to pay these duties, it is equally clear that we have to pay not only the* same amount, but interest also to compensate them for putting the capital down in the first place.

435,Mr Conroy,"I am referring to anyestablishment of bonded stores. They admit that it is not well to collect the duty too soon, and therefore they allow tlie goods to be put into bond without paying any taxation. ""What is that but an admission on the part of tlie protectionists, aud on the part of tlie Govermnent, that this taxation must eventually fall on the people 1 As far iis possible, the principle of equality of sacrifice ought to be followed in any taxation measures that tbe Government propose. No one should be allowed to escape entirely' scot free, because all of us are equally interested in the preservation of law and order, and, therefore, to that extent, ation through the Customs is perfectly allowable. But the further amount that is needed to look after the interests of property and for the thousand and one works which are required ought to come from wealth alone. We have been told by honourable members that they see no difference between revenue and protective duties. think the clearest answer that can be given to that is an illustration of what .will take place if only an duty is placed upon sugar aud no excise. The production of sugar throughout tralia, last year, was about 140,000 tons. The consumption is something like 150,000 tons at the very least, so that with a customs duty on sugar at £5 a ton, something like £50,000 only will be paid to the Treasurer, while the great sugar companies of New South Wales and Queensland would take something like £720,000 extra on sugar, which would have to be paid by the people. Well, sir, this is an instance of a protectionist Tariff, and if we do adopt that principle here, then, as far as a customs duty on sugar is concerned, £50,000 only will go into the Treasury, while the enormous sum of £720,000 Will go to enrich the company. That is what the Prime Minister, in order to enrich that sugar company and get the support of its shareholders, would carry out. I trust, however, that it is not the policy this Parliament is going to follow. If that money is going to be collected from the people of Australia we will take great care that the excise duty, less a certain amount for its collection, equals it, and see that if tlie people pay a tax on that one item to the extent of £770,000 by a customs' duty of £5 per ton, tliat tlie whole of it, as far as practicable, shall go into the Treasury. We could go on multiplying instances of this kind one after another. Mr Conroy. instances like that. It is the creature of the honourable member's own imagination. the policy which the Prime Minister, when' he went up to Queensland,' said he would propose. He said he proposed to put a' customs duty on sugar, and that he objected to an excise duty on it because he was a protectionist. Therefore, one cannot be wrong in saying that tiiis is what the right' honourable gentleman intends to do. The Government have declared themselves to a certain extent protectionist, and I have taxgiven clear instances of the wrong that will happen to the people of the Commonwealth. -ho w tliey will be taxed, and how thosetaxes will fall upon the bulk of the consumers if that policy is carried into effect. No wonder that when the Prime Minister went to Queensland the shareholders of the sugar company welcomed him as a brother, I and said he was the greatest and finest man that ever lived. No wonder they did so, because they saw the prospect of something import like £3,000,000 coming into their pockets. Ausmember abolish Kanaka labour, and give no compensation in the way of a duty 1 that. I have said that the bringing of men. here at once reduces the rate of wages unless the amount of capital can be increased '! Unless a man brings into the country a suflicient amount of capital t'o carry on, or unless the country itself has sufficient capital to employ him, then every extra man who comes in is really tending to lower the rate of wages here. were growing sugar-cane 1 case there would be an exchange of products. In Yictoria at the present time there is a duty of £ 6 per ton. That means that every time the wife of a working man buys her weekly supply of 10 lbs. of sugar she pays something like 7^,-d. more than if the duty were off, and do you mean to assert that because the working man has to pay the additional 7£d. for his 10 lbs. of sugar, he is better off; .do you mean to assert tliat because the money is in the country that therefore the country is wealthier in that.respect?

From 1800 to 1870, when there hear any more of the argument about the money being still in the country. I am glad I am reminded of the utterances of the honourable member for Mernda because in the Yictorian Parliamentary Debates for 1892, volume 70, page 2060, I find-some very fine expressions on this very subject from the honourable member. Such expressions, I am sure, do him credit, and I would say that, to a large extent, I cordially agree with them. He is reported as sayingWe cannot overlook the fact that the great bulk of popular opinion in the United States at present is against the high Tariff men, and that is the position I take it we are getting into in this colony. The figures in America tend in precisely the same direction iis the figures given by the honourable member for Portland. In 1850 in the United States when there was a low Tariff the value of farms was something like £050,000,000. In 1S60 still under a low Tariff-thoug h not what we would call a free-trade Tariff-the value of farms had increased to £1,300,000,000, but in the following ten years after the Tariff had been very largely increased the rate of progress was much lower, and the value of farms only rose to £1,850,000,000. continuedIii the following decade, under a still liigher Tariff, there was almost a total arrest of progress, the value rising only from £1,850,000,000 to £2,000,000,000. So that during the first ten years, under a comparatively low Tariff, the increase was at the rate of 100 per cent., whereas during the last ten years, with a largely increased immigration, including a large body of farmers coining from all |jarts of Europe, the increase was less than 10 per cent., .although the population increased during the same period by something like 30 per cent. The honourable member for Mernda drew our attention to the United States of America, but he forgot to look up his past -speeches. some further opinions which he expressed then. He went on to sayI could give furtherfiguresin the same direction, showing that the production of the community has been arrested by these enormous Tariff imposts, but I do not wish to weary honourable members. I hold in my hand an extract from a book recently published in connection with the American Tariff, which shows most forcibly that the same force of things applies to the great accumulations of pro-, perty. During thc last ten years, from 1850 to I860, when a low Tariff was in foree, there was an enormous increase of real and personal property was a jump in the Tariff of 100 per cent., the rate of increase was pulled up, being only 39 per cent. And from 1870 to 1880 with a higher Tariff, it was still further arrested, being at the-rate of only 10 per cent. How are we to obtain these things from abroad unless we have an exportable surplus to send back in exchange for the-comforts and luxuries which' really make life worth living, so far as its material aspect is concerned. We must obtain thosethings from countries that produce them in superabundance, and in exchange we must send them the things which we produce in superabundance. Those are the words of the honourable member for Mernda. It is father a peculiar thing that to-night, in his speech on the progress of the United States progressed a good deal since 1892. the United States have progressed. I have never heard it asserted by men who understand tlie question that free-trade is a remedy for all ills. Honourable members on this side of tlie chamber do not say that it is a universal panacea. We say only that it is the natural state of affairs, and ought to prevail, and that people adopt it because they think they profit by adopting it . has been followed by only one country in the world. went on to speak about freeing the producers from tlie shackles protection imposed on them.
