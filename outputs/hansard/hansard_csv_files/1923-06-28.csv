Proclamation prohibiting tbe Exportation (except under certain condition) of Dried vision from year to year. The same thing Fruits (dated 30th May, 1923). . move That His Excellency thc Governor General be respectfully requested to summon the first meeting of the Tenth Parliament at the Federal Capital, Canberra. The motion which I have the honour to submit is one which should commend itself to honourable members on both sides, because it is quite outside the realm of party politics. It deals with a matter of' national importance to Australia, and should 'he approached in that spirit. I do not submit the motion in any party spirit, but with a desire to do something for Australia. For over twenty years an endeavour has been made to secure a capital for Australia. We have been repeating here what occurred in the United States of America before a Federal Capital was secured for the American people at Washington. The intrigues, the narrow outlook, and the selfish motives blocking the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra are the same . as those that were in operation to block the establishment of the Federal Capital of the United States of America at Washington. In 1913, the then Governorv General, Lord Denman, journeyed to Canberra; Lord Denman to lay the foundation stone of the Federal Capital, and Lady Denman to name the Capital Canberra. Since then there has been the laying of one foundation stone after another, until it has been said that the Federal Capital, instead of being a Capital, is merely a city of foundation stones, and, I was nearly saying, of tombstones. I hope that we shall erect upon those foundation stones a Capital which will do much to .inspire an Australian national-spirit. Year-after year, the Government of the day have placed certain sums on the Estimates to carry out works, at Canberra, and each year there has been an enormous sum carried over. Only last year, no less than £90,000 of the amount voted for works at Canberra was unexpended at the close of the financial year. It.is quite apparent that some . influence is retarding the progressof the work for which Parliament makes ""prowill occur year after year until we lay it down definitely that the Commonwealth Parliament must meet at Canberra on a certain date. Certain honourable members consider that a separate Federal Capital [3.6] I is unnecessary; but they must admit that Commonwealth affairs are, at any rate, coloured by the influence of the State capital wliere the Federal Seat of Government is. Thc Commonwealth Parliament is. just as much a creature of environment as human beings undoubtedly ' are, and its legislation is, therefore, influenced by its immediate surroundings. For that reason I would be as strongly opposed to the establishment of the Federal Seat of Government at Sydney -as I am to the retention of the Federal Parliament in ..Melbourne. A broad Australian outlook cannot be secured while this Parliament sits in a State capital. Should legislation affecting the well-being of every person in Western Australia be affected by that influence which a State capital in the eastern part of Australia undoubtedly exercises upon the Federal Parliament sitting in its midst f I am sure that by establishing the Scat of Government at Canberra we shall go a long way towards getting that true Australian sentiment of which we have had too little in l i e past, and which it is now time we took steps to cultivate. I hope that this Parliament will agree to my motion, because it will then be incumbent upon the Government to take steps to give effect' to it , and, instead of making provision on the Estimates year after year for small amounts for works at Canberra, they will be obliged to allocate at least £2,000,000 to a trust fund to be operated on for the building of the Capital. This policy would enable the Departments to proceed with a definite and continuous programma, and they would have no excuse to offer for delay. I trust that honourable members will rise above party considerations, and record their votes in favour of my motion. If they do so they will be",13,Presentation Of Address In Reply

This building, when completed, w ill accommodate honourable members of this House and of the Senate. Far greater progress has been made with the building of our Federal Capital than bad been made at ""Washington when the American Parliament decided to meet there. I am afraid that unless we agree to meet at Canberra on a certain date the slipshod manner of building our Capital that we have had in the past will be observed in the future. But I am sure that if honourable members -know what progress has already been made at Canberra they will have no hesitation in voting for this motion. The construction of sewers is almost complete. A power plant has been erected which will light the city. A beautiful supply of water is available, and is ready for reticulation.

A t present we are getting about £90,000 a year in rentals for leaseholds, and as properties will increase in value through occupation, revenue from this source will of course also increase appreciably. It was laid down in the Constitution that Parliament should meet at Canberra within ten years after the establishment of Federation, but over twenty-three .years have elapsed, and we are still in Melbourne. We are', of course, under a debt of gratitude to the Government of Victoria for permitting us to meet here for so many years, but it is time we made a start for ourselves. Fortunately, financial stringency cannot now beadvanced as an argument why we should not expedite the -removal of the Capital to Canberra, because there is now a surplus .of nearly £7,000,000. 1 I urge honourable members who are not acquainted with the locality not to believe a l l that the press is saying about it .

16,Mr Bruce,"I accept the honorableing the past few years. The Government which was led by the Tight honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) did much to pave the way for the occupation of the Capital, and the thanks of the people of the country are due to the members of that Government for what they did. The present Government accepts the policy enunciated in this respect by its predecessors in office, and is following the lines which were laid down when the scheme for the establishment of the Capital on a more limited scale was first adopted. Honourable gentlemen who think that this motion should be carried will not feel the same necessity to press it when I put before them the position as it is at present, and as the Government is confident it w ill be in the future. motion asks that the next Parliament should -be summoned to sit at Canberra. If the House makes that stipulation, it may seriously embarrass the Government, because the Capital may not be ready to receive honourable members when the next Parliament has to assemble. If this Parliament, as appears certain, runs its f u l l term, I am confident that the position at Canberra w ill be that desired by honourable members who support the motion. We are pressing on with the work w i th the utmost expedition, and are doing so for many reasons. planned what to do, and have provided the money for it . Obviously, the most economical action the Government can take will be to proceed with the plans so that there will be regularity of employment and continuity of effort. In that way we shall be able to carry out the work at a minimum of expense. We are not, on the one side, fallin g into dilatory methods, which would mean an increase in cost, nor are we, on the other side, pressing on at such a pace as would unduly inflate the cost. I am confident that the Capital w ill be established at Canberra w it h in the next three years. Honourable gentlemen may have noticed that in the policy of the Government, as set before the country, it is proposed to establish a Commission to control and manage the Federal Capital site. AB ill w ill be introduced later in this session to give effect to that plank in the policy of the Government, and when honourable gentlemen get it they will see that it represents an earnest effort to carry . out the necessary work at the Capitali n the best possible way. ThisB ill will probably effect our object of establishing the Capitali n the shortest possible time at a minimum of expense. For the reasons I have cited, I ask the honourable member not to press the motion. Prime Minister has said, but I hold the view very strongly that u n t i l Parliament has fixed a definite date we shall be here indefinitely. If the Prime Minister w ill suggest a date which is reasonable, I shall be willin g to accept it . orable member's anxiety, but I do not share it . I look at the inatter, perhaps, from a somewhat different viewThe point. I have the greatest possible confidence in the present Government; I am sure that this work could not be in better hands, and that the Capital will be occupied at the earliest possible date. I do not think the honourable gentleman need be in the least alarmed. He has heard me define the Government's policy, and there w ill he a further and more complete statement on the subject when the B ill to appoint the Commission is in t r o duced. When the B ill has been in . troduced, and the House has f u l ly debated the subject, the doubts and difiL We have culties which now present themselves to the minds of the honourable members w ill be cleared away. They w ill then see that the most satisfactory progress is being made in the establishment of the Capital and the carrying out of the solemn obligation entered into by the Commonwealth. I could not help contrasting the attitude of the Prime Ministeri n the speech which he has just delivered w i th his action during the proceedings in this House last night. If we then had had a little of the savoir faire which he has just displayed, it might have avoided the unpleasant situation which caused the House to sit throughout the night. The solemn promise was made by the nation, as a whole, to its principal State that the Federal Capital would be established at Canberra. U p to the present moment that pledge has not been honoured.

Thus the revenue Over 100 years ago that great architect, L'Enfant, died broken hearted because his plans at Washington Any honorable member who had been spoiled by others; and in Australia another great architect, Mr. Griffin, who won a world's competition continent, with his plans for the Federal Capital, walk down Collins-street, was being subjected to similar treatment, when Sir Joseph Cook, as the head of the Let him then Government, invited h i m to Australia in order to prevent disaster On the floor of this HouseI have quarrelled with the methods of T. P. Owen, and others of the Commonwealth Works Department, and I see no reason to withMelbourne draw any charge I have made against municipality them. That gentleman has assured me, however, that the' committee now in I trusted with the work at the Federal Collins-street, Capital is carrying out the ideas of Mr. to Russell-street, G r if f in; and I heartily welcome that assurance. What was my principal comthat over plaint against Mr Owen and those associated w it h him ? It was that what is the loss may known as the composite plan of the Cannot Department would be like, say', the of honourable memefforts of a few good little Australian artists to repaint pictures of Tintoretto square or Raphael. So deep was the resentment by Collins-street, Swanstonon the part of 150 of our leading arohiBourke-street, and Elizabethtects and engineering architects from Brisbane to Perth, at the treatment of Mr Griffin's plans, that they petitioned this House to have it stopped, and ' Sir Joseph Cook, as the representative of the Government, was good enough to give their representations attention, and see that justice was done to the original designer. It was because of this action by the architects of Australia that Mr Griffin's plan .was not set aside in favour of that of the five men of the Government Departments, who, in its preparation, had sucked the brains of the men who had taken part in the world's competition. Thank goodness, that evil was averted; and Mr Griffin's beautiful plan for the Capital city is to be carried out in its,entirety. NowI have to deal with a misconception in regard to the financing of the Federal Territory. Even Sir Joseph Cook, one day when, I think, I had spoken, said he could . now see how, in the future, the city could be provided at a cost of not one penny to the Commonwealth of Australia. What was the cost to the State Government of Victoria when they had to seek a new Parliament House for the State, to take the place of this House, which they had generously handed over for the use of the Commonwealth? The State Parliament House at the Exhibi tion Building cost about £14,000, and any one who has dined or visited there will know how superior is the convenience to that which we enjoy in this vast building. I suggest that when the time arrives for us to go to Canberra, and the State Parliament returns to its old home, the Commonwealth might obtain all the fittings of the temporary State Parliament. House for, perhaps, £10,000 or less. I may say that I have' given much consideration to what is known as the Guernsey Land Experiment, which, for the benefit of new members, I shall briefly outline. build a new market in the principal street, the old one being so crowded with stalls that, at times, it was impossible to pass from one side of the island to the other. A t Guernsey there was a clever man, named de Lyle Brock, who occupied a position somewhat analogous to Ministeri n Australia, and was consulted by the people as to the feasibility of borrowing money for this work in England. He suggested that borrowing was unnecessary, and asked them whether they had not architects, bricklayers, carpenters, stonemasons, and other skilled men amongst them. Such men were obtainable in Guernsey, he was informed, and he then asked why they did not build a market themselves. His suggestion bore f r u it , and in a few years it was decided to act upon his suggestion. A t a meeting, the townspeople resolved to issue market currency scrip notes to the value of £5,000, the shopkeepers, contractors, and people generally agreeing to accept these as legal tender. A splendid new marketwas built by the acceptance of these notes, and on a certain day of every year the municipal or town representatives' burn t as many of the notes as had been returned to them in the ordinary way of business, in payment of rents and so forth . The result was thab in ten years the markets had been paid for, and the town was in possession b f a rent-producing property for ever. Why could we not adopt .that plan at Canberra? sufficient population there. Guernsey is very small compared w i th the population of Australia. When members' of this Parliament meet at Canberra they will want homes there. If a man required a house which it would cost £1,000 to build, and were charged rent for it on a basis of 5 per cent., its construction cost would be repaid in twenty years. By adopting the system I have referred to we might within twenty-one years pay the whole of the cost of the construction of Parliament House at Can-'' berra. The only additional expense would be that involved in the printing of Canberra scrip notes. The financiers of the world tried to destroy the evidence of the system adopted in Guernsey for the construction of public buildings, and but In Guernseyi t was desired to for the publication t h i r t y years ago of a booklet on the subject by an American, that system would have been lost to the world. To-day there is quite a respectable library of books on the system. We can. compare that system with the infamous system of private ownership.

I think that the honourable member for Bourke( Mr. had paid back in interest Anstey) and myself are the only persons of the capital over here who have read that report. Honorand still owed £50,000,000. able members have only to read it to discover the financial powers we may exert through the Commonwealth Bank.

I will give my vote in favour of the motion moved by the honourable member for Dalley. will press it, because, public opinion in the Commonwealth is in favour of the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra, and it is our duty to keep our sacred pledges. seems to be an impression that because certain members of the Public Works Committee, myself included, are opposed to the project of building the Federal Capital at Canberra, they may obstruct or delay the submission of reports to Parliament in regard to work at the Capital which has been referred to'them for investigation and report. I can assure the House that every effort has been made by the Committee to lay before Parliament the fullest information concerning the work referred to it. The Committee's report is already in the hands qf the printer, and should be available within a fortnight. occasioned by 'the lithographing of a plan showing the alterations which the Committee have recommended in connection with the provisional Parliament House, -but I have had under consideration the suggestion that it would, perhaps, be wiser to have the report printed without the lithographs, and make the plan itseK available for the inspection of honourable members. This would enable the Committee's report to be presented as speedily as possible. However, when the report is available, honourable members will be in a better position than they are at prehostel accommodation sufficient.

It is absolutely necessary that the members of the Public Works Committee should report faithfully upon the evidence submitted to them, and when honourable members see our recommendations they will find that they are I hope the honourable member faithfully based on the evidence submitted to us. We are submitting two alternative proposals for the consideration of the House, and if the second be adopted, I do not anticipate that there will .be the slightest difficulty in having a provisional Parliament House completed within three years after plans have been prepared and tenders have been called. A year is but a short period in the life of a nation, and I hope that the anxiety of honourable members'to get to Canberra speedily will not cause this Parliament to come to a decision which may render it impossible to effect a large saving of expenditure in the erection of a provisional Parliament House. There is no reason why the two administrative offices, the"" erection of which is also recommende'd by the Public Works Committee, should not 'be completed within, three years, but I do not think that this Parliament would expect the large staff Delay may possibly be necessary at the Seat of Government to be removed to Canberra until reasonable accommodation had been provided for them. To my mind there has been an unconscionable delay during the last few years in carrying out quite a number of works that would have expedited the meeting of Parliament at the Federal Capital. It is true that within three years a water supply will be available in the area which will be occupied, and that the sewerage system will also be available,, but there is not yet a.sufficient number of cottages there, nor is the proposed ing to the report of the Advisory Committee, it will be necessary to have a",19,Meetin G Of Parliament At Canberra

Nevertheless the dearth of labour and many other little difficulties that may crop up may cause a delay of six months or twelve months, and in such circumstances it would not be wise for Parliament to commit itself to a definite date for meeting at Canberra.

32,Mr Gregory,"That is only one unthem to carry through, this work in. the appointed time. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Australian asset. Mahony) puts some of his friends in a rather invidious position because of his over-enthusiastic attitude towards the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra. I have nearly always supported Canberra; but I have done so sometimes with a little compunction, arising from the fact that there is a great deal of ill-considered carping talk from certain people in Sydney, who, in their selfish parochialism, quite exaggerate to this question by people in Victoria. As a matter of fact, the Victorian electorates generally have not taken sufficient interest in the location of the Federal Capital to turn a parliamentary vote upon it , and I have never met an elector of mine who took any burning, terest in it . in New South Wales, who are an in considerable and very noisy minority, presume to tell the people of Victoria that the retention of the capital in Melbourne is due to the greed and selfishness of Victorians, I feel a certain amount of compassion for them, and yet I feel almost persuaded to vote against my mature judgment in favour of the establishment, in due time, of our Parliament at Canberra. monstrative and self-opinionated' persons, with.whom I do not for a moment associate my friend the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), who looks on this question from the broad national standpoint, are political party than that to which my honourable friend belongs-that is if they support any political party at ad.1-and , at all events, they will not persuade me to vote against the principle of the Capital City. I believe in national territories, and this is one of the few distinctly Australian territories that we have. the Capital City movement is this: It is not a mere question of the city. There is a Federal Territory many thousands of acres in extent, and for the first, time in Australian history we have the satisfaction of knowing that the increase in value that takes place from year to yearwith the growth of settlement becomes an Australian asset; not an asset of the land speculator. I feel a certain sense of pride in the possession of this distinctly tive; member probably has not seen the Territory. I am not pretending that it contains the richest land in Australia. We have in Victoria, aa even my honourable friends from New South Wales w ill agree, land of much greater potential productivity than the land in the Federal Capital Territory. the importance . attached The land in the Territory is what one might call second class, or even t h i r d class land, but still there is a great acreage of good quality sheep grazing country, and much is suitable for closer settlement. It is not poor, unproductive land, as my friend the honourable member for Darwin has suggested. I am a supporter of the or even serious, inestablishment of the city. I think it Therefore, when persons will have, from_ the point of view of health, an ideal location. From the point of view of scenic beauty, the site certainly bears very favorable comparison with the best outlooks in Australia; it is not a position of grandeur, perhaps, but it is undulating, and on the whole beautiful, and eminently well suited to a handsome , city. I am very glad to know that substantial 'progress has been made w i th afforestation under the capHowever, these deable management of those in charge of tree planting in the Territory. My regret is that this work was not pushed on w i th a great deal more vigour in the early days of Federal administration, because trees which are now coming on as associated with another small plants would have been by this time nearly full-grown. H a d we done that, it would have been a distinctly beautiful territory to-day. Road construction, too, has been proceeding on lines of durability, and, I think, sanity. Sof a r as the work generally has gone, although, at first glance, not very far advanced, it is proceeding on sound lines, and, for the My main reason for supporting most part, is of a permanent and useful character and in ioonformity w i th the plan on which the city is to be erected. Unquestionably, when it does reach completion, Canberra will be a model city. The honourable member for Dalley wishes to pledge this Parliament to a resolution in favour of meeting there at an early date. While",22,Chapman Are You Lic Works Committee Is Endeavouring To

There is no hurry. I quite approve of the building of the city. I heartily endorsed the acceptance of this fine Territory. I believe in all the work ,that is going on, and to which I have referred. All these activities, I think, should be continued steadily on sound, permanent lines. The work is not being undertaken for to-day or to-morrow, or even the next fifty years; but for the life of a nation. We are founding the Capital for the centuries to come. That being so, the mover of the motion, and his supporters., must curb their very natural ambition to get to Canberra within the next year or two. Our little lives, great and important as they are, must appear, in the history of a nation, as very short. Therefore, I am sorry that although I have gone along this national road of Capital building with my honourable friend for some distance, and have supported many of his wise efforts to secure funds from the Treasurer to lay the foundations of the Capital, I cannot ask honourable members to pledge themselves to hasten to Canberra for the next Parliament. Bad as this Melbourne Parliament House is, I feel that we should bear with it in patience rather than enter with undue haste into our new heritage. once I find myself entirely in accord with a speech made by the honourable member for Batman. for that. do so, because it is the fault of the honsomething like three years to complete. orable member himself that I have not been in accord with him on other subjects. I desire to approach the consideration of this question from the realm of practicability, and I claim that it is imits meeting at Canberra as indicated in the motion submitted by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). It is true that the Advisory Committee, which has been referred to by two or three speakers already, declared that we could get to Canberra within three years. Committee have been taking evidence, and from what I have heard during the last month or two, the opinion of the the facts placed before us. Let me put the position before the House. In addition to accommodation for 112 members of Parliament, provision must be made for about 1,100 people, representing the staffs of the Parliament and members of the Public Service, whose presence at the Seat of Government will be essential. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Eiley) told us a little while ago that already there were 100 houses erected at Canberra. All I can say is that within the last six or seven weeks I have had them counted, and have found there are thirty-nine houses completed. There is a batch of twenty in course of erection, and, I understand, tenders have been called for another nineteen. The Advisory Committee stated that 300 houses would have to be built by the Government for the necessary staffs, and added something which has not been mentioned hitherto in this debate, namely, that they expected private enterprise to provide another 370 houses. I remind the House now that, until'the Government come to some decision with regard to land tenure and values, and throw open a certain area for selection, we are not likely to get any of those 370 houses built by private enterprise. get them until Parliament moves to Canberra.

I do not believe that the change w ill affect Australia to any appreciable extent. The North-South railway will be a developmental work, and it should have been undertaken many, years ago. would certainly confer much more benefit on Australia than would the building of the Federal Capital, although I think that bhe Federal Capital will eventually become a payable proposition. I sincerely trust that the House will not blindly pass the motion proposed by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). requires a very little stretch of the imagination to realize why the honourable member who has just spoken is opposed to the motion. He was secretary of the Committee which opposed the construction of the.JFederal Capital. It is evident, also, that he has no knowledge of building construction. He may have been a member of the Works Committee, b u t that does not make him a carpenter or a plumber. I have always looked upon the Federal Capital as an important means of furthering the policy of decentralization. We have been told that it was part of a compact made with New South Wales. I say, as one who took an active part in Federation with Sir Edmund Barton and other great men, that the people of New South Wales were the pioneers of our Federal system. It took a long time to educate the other portions of Australia up to the high standard of national life attained by them, and it took us a few years to bring about Federation. The men who took part in forming the Federation were aware that in other parts of the world capital cities had been built. The people of the United States of America to-day are proud of their Washington, whicli is a show city for visitors. Our more closely allied brothers in Canada have their Ottawa, which is one of the finest cities, containing some of the finest buildings, that architects and mechanics have been able to design and The North-South Eailway, construct. The ambition of the people of Australia is to have a Federal Capital, No t one of the other and those whose duty it is to give effect to the will of the people and carry out I have yet to learn the necessary work, ought to have minds that can rise above the spirit of "" littl e Australians '""' and can think in national terms. We must create a national atmosphere in which there is none of the parochial spirit which is found in all the State capital cities. Honourable members who, like myself, have travelled over the whole of Australia, understand the benefits that will accrue to the nation from the establishment of 'a Federal It Capital. Let us consider the cause of the delay in building the Capital. I wonder whether honourable members have read anything about the construction of the Panama Canal, or the erection of a huge irrigation dam in the SoudanI f they have done so, they know that difficulties were encountered there similar to those met with at Canberra. The first thing that had to be done was to provide water, sewerage facilities, and light for the men employed in construction work. When the Labour Government of which I was a strong supporter took active steps to establish the Capital, it followed lines similar to those which were laid down by the engineers who undertook the great works to which I have referred. A water supply has been provided at Canberra, the sewerage system is well advanced towards completion, and roads have been made. A i l that remains to be done is to erect buildings, and that could easily be accomplished in three years. I do not know what the Works Committee's report will contain, but I charge the members of the Committee with being Canberra butchers, because the information which has come to me indicates that they have not tackled the job like men experienced in building construction. The honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) came to the conclusion some time ago that the first buildings to be erected would have to be capable of being utilized later when the permanent structures were put up. The permanent structures, I admit, will cost a considerable sum of money, but they will be monuments which will make our children feel proud of the foresight of their forefathers.

The latter, which was burnt down thirty-five years ago, was built in twelve months. The Government of the day, led by Sir Henry Parkes, thought that an International Exhibition ought to be held in Australia, and instructions were given for the Exhibition Building to be erected.' The 'architect was Mr Barnett, and I think it was a Melbourne builder named the The Victorians in the daysbefore the land boom were a progressive people, and they decided to have a great exhibition in Melbourne. The building then erected was of a much more permanent character than is usually built on such occasions, and it stands to-day, utilized partly as a Parliament Housef o r the Statea Parliament House, I may say, much more comfortable than that in which we do our business here. similar to those employed in the erection of the Exhibition Building, would be sufficient to provide Canberra with a Parliament House and all accessories for the legislative work of the 'Commonwealth. In my young days men were to be found to carry out such a work in the time now proposed, and we can hardly suppose that the brains and energy of the people of to-day are not equal to those of the people of a few years ago. I am told that there is a proposal to build a sort of "" lean-to"" around which the remainder of the Parliament House w ill be gradually erected; but who ever conceived such an idea is no friend of the Oommonwealth or of Canberra. The Avorkmen who Avould be engaged on the outer portions of the building Avould interfere Avith the legislative work being carried out in the internal portions. The men who, during the term of office of a Labour Government, laid what might be called the foundations of the Eederal Capital, all insisted on its -being made the Seat of Government in the shortest possible time. think that the Government of to-day have any intention of going on w i th the building of the city ; it is my opinion that if the people of Ife w South ""Wales desire the Federal compact to be carried out in spirit as in letter, they will have to wait unti l a Labour Government once more reigns. There are many men connected w it h our parliamentary life who have business associations Svith Melbourne, and it is rather boo much to expect them to remove their parliamentary work to a city which to them presents no financial advantages. Buti f this Parliament is prepared to go on, and we get to Canberra within a reasonable time, I believe that members, and Ministers, will be more contented; at any rate, they will be free from the influence Mr Young who put up of the Argus and the Age, to Avhich some structure in twelve months. of them, in my opinion, attach undue importance. We cannot expect newspaper proprietors to decry the city in which their neAvspapers are published. Of course, it shoAvs a good spirit on the part of the people of Melbourne that they are ambitious to make bheir city a -greater metropolis than Sydney; but we must remember, when we are returned to this Parliament, that we are legislating, not for particular cities, but for the whole of Australia. We ought to take a Materials and labour, broad outlook on such questions, and stir up the 'national spirit throughout; the States. I wish the .present Government had the same point of vieAv as that of the Labour Government in 1910-13. If it had, I feel confident that, with blie Avork already accomplished in the Federal Territory, there would be nothing to prevent Australia, in three years' time, inviting people from the other side of the Avorld to the opening of Parliament at Canberra. Suoh an event would be a great advertisement for Australia, and do much to remove that narrow local spirit which is much too prevalent. -As one who had the honour to nominate the Yass-Canberra district as the Federal Capital Territory, I am as d.eeply interested as any other honourable member in seeing that Parliament is removed there at the earliest possible moment. Fortunately for us, a great deal of spade work has already been done, and the way prepared I do not for much more rapid development of the Capital than, perhaps, was hitherto practicable. , A t the same .time, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there has not been that enthusiasm displayed by successive Administrations that there might have been, and that I should have liked to see, in pushing on with the Capital. The delay caused by the war, although in evitable, Avas not wholly responsible for the",26,Chapman Are You Lic Works Committee Is Endeavouring To

However, we know now that the preparatory steps have been taken, and everything is really in readiness to push on with the building of the capitalas rapidly as possible. There is no reason that I can see why the work should not be carried out and completed in really a much shorter time than three years. What is to prevent three continuous eight-hour shifts during the whole twenty-four hours? means, provided the necessary skilled labour is available, we could get the work completed at no greater ultimate cost, and we might meet there much earlier than otherwise would be possible. A t the same time, like other honourable members, as well as members of the Government, I feel somewhat embarrassed by the terms of the motion of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr. Mahony). That motion is as follows:That His Excellency the Governor General be respectfully requested to summon the first meeting of the Tenth Parliament at the Federal Capital, Canberra. I am in favour of the object of the motion, but it seems to me that the honourable member has lost sight of certain possibilities-le t us hope they are not probabilities-no t the least important of which is that this Parliament may not 'survive its f u l l term. It is quite possible thab in the course of political events honourable members may find themselves engaged in an appeal to the country very much earlier than they anticipate. like this, I hope! Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON may I say that I think appeals to the country every three years are too frequent for the National Parliament? my opinion the duration of the life of the National Parliament should certainly be fixed at not less than five years. However, we all know that the accidents of political life may precipitate us into the turmoil of another election contest at any time, possibly within the next twelve months, in such an unfortunate event it would be obviously impossible for the tenth Parliament to besummoned atCanberra, and, in view of this, to carry the motion, as drawn, might place us in rather a ridiculous position. member threatening us with an election in twelve months ? Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON I think it rests more w it h honourable members opposite than 'with honourable -members on this side. I do not look forward with any degree of pleasure to any such untowardevent. However, I suggest to the honourable member for Dalley that he amend his motion in a way that w ill enable the 'supporters of Canberra to vote for it. There is nO reason, so f a r as B y that I can see, why the Government should hot immediately take steps to formulate its policy in regard to the land tenure in the Federal area for business people and others.

It must also be remembered that we have at present between 7,000j000 and 8,000,000 of the very finest quality bricks lying at grass, absolutely idle, available for building purposes'. The plans for the provisional Parliament buildings are prepared, and honourable members have, had an opportunity of studying them.

The amendment that I suggest to the honourable member for Dalley is that all the words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to inserting, in lieu thereof, the following words:it be an instruction to tlie Commission, to be appointed iby the Government, to expedite the building of the Federal Capital, so that it w ill bo ready for occupation as the Seat of the Federal Government within three years. If the .honourable member would accept that amendment I think he would find that it would receive a larger measure of support than he could look for from his motion. In its present form it would place some of the supporters of the establishment of the Federal Capital in an embarrassing position. If we agree to a motion in the form of an instruction to the Commission to push on with the building of the Capital, and have it ready for occupation within, the next three years, some progress may be looked for, and once the Capital is* made ready for our occupation, no time will be lost by the Federal Parliament in removing to its proper habitation. Amendment not seconded. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) . [5.6] A great deal has been said on this matter, and I do not know that anything that can now be said upon it 'by any one will alter the opinions we have formed as the result of a fairly lengthy acquaintance with the subject. The attitude of the Government, so far as it was expressed in the speech of the Prime Minister, is quite satisfactory. But one has to remember that we have heard something very like this before. I have had a long and a rather chastening experience of this question, the progress of which is a sort of outward and visible sign of the vanity of human effort. From the day upon which my late colleague ( Mr Fisher) commenced the building of the Federal Capital until the present time obstacles have ibeen* placed in the way of tlie accomplishment of the purposes of various Ministries who have been concerned with it. These influences have been referred to by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) and others. fluences, and that they are at work today, any one who has given the matter ten minutes' thought must be well aware. I am profoundly convinced, therefore, that nothing the Government can say, and no instruction to a Commission, will be in themselves of any avail. .The Government cannot rid themselves of the responsibility which attaches to them by virtue of the fact that they are the Government of the Commonwealth. They cannot place their responsibility in this matter upon the shoulders of a Commission. The establishment of a Commission is, no doubt, a very proper thing, ibut the responsibility for the completion of this great national work wall remain npon the shoulders of the Government.' We have, therefore, to as'k ourselves whether the Government really mean to get this work done. I believe that they are as earnest as any other Government, but I think that the influences that have baulked previous Governments will baulk them unless counteracted by a firm and persistent determination to get this work done. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has made himself notable in previous Parliaments by his championship of the establishment of the Federal Capital, and were he in any other position than that which he at present occupies, we should no doubt hear him speak with great force in support of the motion. But the honourable gentleman is now silent. I believe that we ought to be at Canberra, and should have been there long ago I believe that three years is ample time for the erection of a building to accommodate this Parliament, not the permanent structure to which the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) referred in such eloquent terms, but a place fit for the likes of us. We can leave to posterity the work of rearing for itself that mausoleum which is suited to its shadowy greatness; 'but suoh a place as would be pre-eminently suited to our talents and upbringing could be built in three yeans or less. The present Government, in common with every other Government, is susceptible to influences to which I need not specially refer. If the Government thoroughly understands that these influences That these are very real inare moulding themselves into a resolute determination to complete this great work, and that it is very to them completed then we shall be there in three otherwise we shall not. The members of the Government are torn to a certain extent by conflicting emotions. that way to avoid hurting their feelings* Some of them want to get to Canberra, some are not so particular and some are even against going there. Naturally some difficulty in expressing its desires in terms of action. my political career in the a believer in Canberra. my Governments have had, unique opportunities for carrying out the work of the establishment of the Capital there, but I -am bound to say that, although I have been accused at times of autocratic exercise of authority, to grapple fluences to which the honourable ber for Dalley referred. with all respect to the honourable for Eden-Monaro, that the people look to him in this matter, and hold him responsible. He has said a very great deal on the subject. now listens member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) is a little afraid that this Parliament not last its time, but I do not think there is any real fear of that. either the motion or the suggested amendment; but if by the amendment by the honourable member for Lang intended that there should be merely an instruction could not support that for a moment. responsibility in this matter rests upon the shoulders of the Government, and to put it quite plainly, if Canberra is not ready for us in 1923, Commission or no Commission, this Government itself open to such censure that, in the State of New South Wales, at any rate, it cannot live. I believe the are doing all that can be done, but they must keep on doing it, and must be prepared to take a word of advice from those of us who regard this as a very matter. who are everlastingly some new obstacle that this thing has got to be done. If the Government do that, the work will be done, and we can watch, as time goes on, the rate of progress to Mr W. M.

The honourable ment to Canberra. We are bound by the Constitution to remove the sitmay tings of the Federal Parliament to Canberra. We are already thirteen I could vote for years late. There can be no gainsaying the fact that, while the Commonproposed wealth Parliament has been sitting in Melbourne, the policies of Commonwealth Governments have been affected, to some given to the Commission, I extent, by the influence of the powerful The press of this city. Conservative Governments have taken their views very largely from the Conservative press. They are always influenced in their action by a desire to avoid adverse press criticism. vvill have laid They have been influenced here to follow lines of policy calculated to suit the in terests of Melbourne and Victoria, and not the interests of remote States, such as Government Queensland. We, as Australians, should take a national, and not a parochial view of public affairs. We find that State jealousies still exist. B ut Australia, which important has proved itself a nation, should have That advice is to tell the people a broader national outlook. I believe putting forward that the influence of the Melbourne press w ill , while the Parliament meets in this city, be exerted to prevent the remodelling of the Commonwealth Constitution,",28,Chapman Are You Lic Works Committee Is Endeavouring To
61,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [5.16],"which progressive Australians aim at to invest the National Parliament of Australia w i th greater powers, and the subdivision of the big States into more manageable cheaper forms of government, leaving questions of merely local development to subordinate Legislatures throughout some progress in this direction if we remove this Parliament to Canberra, and can induce the Government to set aside a special session in which to review the Constitution, but I prophesy that certain influences w ill block the reform while Commonwealth Parliament take place in Melbourne. In one of the fourteen points submitted by the Country party to the electors at the recent elections, they proposed the creation of a Constitution Convention, for the purpose of reviewing the Constitution. Although the Country party has powerful influence in the present Government, we have had no statement from the Treasury bench of an intention to call together a Constitution Convention or to remodel the Commonwealth Constitution facilitating the Provinces. influences so eloquently referred to by the honourable member for No r t h Sydney are at work to prevent the calling together of any Convention for the purpose of reviewing the Constitution. I join issue with those honourable members who declare that no part of Australia suffers through the Federal Parliament not sitting at Canberra. Queensland industries do not get from the Parliament sitting in Melbourne, influenced as it is by Melbourne interests, that sympathetic, consideration which they would receive from a Parliament sitting at Canberra. Therei t would be away from those powerful parochial in fluences which are exercised by great cities, and, in neutral country, could regard everything from a broad Australian point of view. certain influences have skilfully succeeded in preventing the removal of this Parliament to Federal territory at Canberra. promised that everything would be done to expedite the building of the Capital, but, to-day, we are not much nearer our goal than we were twenty years ago. Commissions have been appointed, and a great deal of money has been spent, but those opposing influences with which the ex-Prime Minister has said he has areas with simpler and been unable to grapple have always , been able to secure the upper hand. The honourable member for Dalley is wise in asking the House to fi x a date on which Australia. We may look for the Federal Parliament shall meet at Canberra. That does not allow the Government to side-step the question. Of course, the Government can always find a way out of any difficulty in which the adoption of ' this motion may place them if they the sittings of the shelter behind a Royal Commission, but we expect something definite from them, particularly when we know that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. Austin Chapman) has always been an earnest advocate of the removal of t h t Seat of Government to Canberra. The responsibility rests with the Government. It has been said by persons who are in a position to speak wifpi authority that the necessary buildings could be erected within two and a half or three years. As a proof that all that should be done is not being done, we have the fact that creation of new States and £90,000 of the money voted on' last Probably, some of the -year's Estimates for works at Canberra has not been spent. Queensland has every reason to feel aggrieved at the unsympathetic treatment meted out to its interests by Government*"" located in Melbourne and under the influence of the powerful press of this southern city. The great bulk of the people engaged in the sugar-growing industry, that has enabled the consumers of Australia to save £17,000,000 during the last six years, have a real grievance against' the parochial views taken by a Commonwealth Cabinet sitting in Melbourne, influenced daily by writers on a biased and conservative press who have not a proper understanding of the industries of the northern State or of the peculiar conditions associated with them. For the past twenty years These writers do not realize that these industries are the bulwark of our White Australia policy, and that every consideration must be extended Successive Governments have to them if the northern part of the Commonwealth is to be properly developed'. I strongly urge honourable members to vote for the motion. Do not talk it out. ' Have a vote taken to . see where Canberra's friends are. This is a non-party question, and the carrying of this motion will enable us to realize at an early date all our amibitions in regard to Canberra, and cause a greater and better national spirit in Australia to be created, tending to the speedier development of this great country of which we are all so proud. location of the Seat of the Federal Government is a matter of considerable i m portance, and likewise the motion submitted by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) is important, because it seeks to fix the time when this Parliament shall meet at Canberra, thus enabling intending property-holders at the Federal Capital to secure their leases and proceed with building operations while we are doing our share by making provision for the housing of Parliament there. This is an important aspect if we aire to look at the proposition in a. erect the buildings that w ill he required; business-like way. It is pleasing to me to note that the arguments for and against the establishment of a Federal Capital at Canberra have practically ceased. I know that there are still a few objectors who say that we should not go there at the present time. As a matter of fact, the removal of the Seat of Government to our own territory is already thirteen years overdue. The delay has undoubtedly been caused by the war, but it is part and parcel of the Federal compact that the Seat of Government should be on neutral territory. Under our Constitution the power of each State, in so far as its representation in the Federal Parliament is concerned, is strictly defined, and the representations of each State should have their due weight; but when we find ourselves as we are at present, not on neutral ground, but situated in one of the largest capital cities in Australia, naturParliament should meet on neutral terrially we are so influenced by environment that the Federal idea is lost. I do not blame Melbourne in this respect. people of this city are paddling their own canoe. If we are anxious to be out-andout Australians and to carry, out the Pederal arrangement, Parliament must meet ou neutral ground where the fullest weight can be given to the representatives of the various States. Thepress of Melbourne may take it as a compliment t h a t they are considered as being capable of influencing members of this Parlia^ ment. But when a case is put before a jury both sides are heard. In Melbourne only one side is heard, and it is hard, indeed, for an honourable member, no matter from what State he may hail, to read the Melbourne newspapers and not' be influenced consciously or unconsciously by the political views expressed therein. The politics of the people of Victoria may be very sound, but that is not the point at issue. When the States entered into the Federal arrangement -the understanding was, as it also was in the United States of America, that, in order to avoid any possibility of State influence, the Federal Parliament must meet on neutral territory. The matter of honouring the Federal compact to build the Federal Capitali n the State of New South Wales has also to be considered. Those who are opposed in any circumstances to the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra, say that our financial position w ill not justify us in raising sufficient money to but seeing that we shall have control over 900 square miles of terri-. tory, it is reasonable to suppose that the Federal Parliament will eventually be able to finance this undertaking from the revenue it w ill derive from its own lands. I quite agree with what the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has said concerning the quality of the land comprised in the Federal Territory. There is no finer wool-growing country anywhere else in the world. It is also excellent dairying land. Altogether, the Territory which we shall occupy s'hould prove eminently suitable for our purposes. But the question whether it is the most suitable spot in Australia for a Federal Capital has been settled long ago. The matter of greatest importance to-day is that this tory, so that every State may get the f u l l weight of the representation to which it The is entitled under the Constitution. I believe that we can do this by meeting at Canberra, and that when we meet there we shall have better and cleaner legislation, more truly Australian in character, than that which the people are getting today. In supporting the motion submitted by. the honourable member for Dalley( Mr. Mahony), I point out that if it is adopted the responsibility w ill still be",30,Chapman Are You Lic Works Committee Is Endeavouring To

63,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [5.35],"upon the Government to carry out .the work. not be treated as a party matter. Former Governments were not in earnest over this project. The present Government have not been in office long enough to judge, but I hope that they will bring down a progressive policy, and that, if the motion is carried, as I feel sure it will be, they will give effect .to the wishes of this House. It has been said that, the present Parliament may not run its ful l term. This is an argument which one might expect from objectors to the proposal, and, so far as I can judge, it has up bearing upon the question at issue at all. I agree with the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) that the Government should without delay come to a decision' with regard to land tenures, so that private people who desire to build for business or other purposes may have an opportunity of commencing as soon as possible. The statement by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) that it is not possible to have construction work sufficiently advanced to enable Parliament to meet at Canberra in three years is not endorsed by the Eederal Capital Advisory Committee. In its first general report, published in July, 1921, that Committee states, in clause 73The period of three years assigned by the Committee for the first stage is the minimum that the resources in materials and labour would permit without unduly increasing cost. That report was published two years ago. Only one year of the three-year term mentioned now remains, and still we are sitting in Mjelbourne. ""We can only hope to get to Canberra within a reasonable time if we adopt the motion now before the House. States of America were in the same position with regard to their Federal Capital in the earlier years of the Republic. Delays were so exasperating that finally Parliament decided hy resolution to meet at Washington at a specified date. That is what we must do in connection with a proposal to establish the Seat of Government at Canberra. I have no desire to take up the role of a carping critic of the present Government on the Federal Capital question. They have not been long in office; but if , three years hence, we find the position much the same as it is to-day, there will be good reason for the strongest censure, which I hope will I trust that this question will be delivered from both sides of the House by honourable members supporting the project. If we decide that the first session of the next Parliament must meet at Canberra, then, in spite of officialdom and any other obstacles, the work of building the City will be expedited in preparation for that event. So long as it remains in the capital city of any State, so long will the parochial .view-point predominate. But we should consider the effect which the building of this Capital City will have upon the national life of Australia, and, for that reason, and in spite of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) and the nan), I think it is quite possible for Parliament to meet at Canberra three years hence. It is easy for those who have no practical knowledge of building construction to say that the work cannot be done in that time. We had the definite statement, made by experts two years ago, that it was possible for Parliament to meet at Canberra in three years, so it is useless now to contend that we shall not be able to meet thero within another three years. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that unlike many other similar resolutions with regard to Canberra, it will, not be regarded as merely a pious expression of opinion. cannot support the motion because it will place the Government in a very awkward position. We must regard this as an actual business proposition. I understand that the sum of £175,000 has been earmarked for the building of the temporary Federal Parliament House at Canberra. The people in the UnitedI t might be said that if that were the only building to be constructed, it could be completed within the time specified,, but I say definitely that it could not. In addition to the Parliament House, it will be necessary to provide a number of other buildings for administrative officers and members of the Public Service, and members of Parliament, so probably another £100,000 will have to be spent. As a builder of many years' experience, I claim to know something about a project like this. . There are many difficulties in the way. In the first place, there is a serious shortage of skilled labour. I do not know whether",32,Chapman Are You Lic Works Committee Is Endeavouring To

It is possible, however, that the construction could be carried out in reinforced concrete instead of brick. Many such buildings are now being erected in this city owing to the shortage of bricks and skilled labour. I understand that the Government have 8,000,000 bricks available on the site in Canberra, but in view of the shortage of skilled! labour they are useless. building the hostel now, so skilled labour is available. vermnent pay the wages demanded, no N doubt skilled labour will be obtainable, but if wages are to be substantially higher than the rate upon which the estimate of cost has been based, instead of costing £175,000 Parliament House will cost probably £275,000.

Thus over twelve montlis would be gone before a start could be made. I oppose the motion because this House, by carrying it, would place the Government in an awkward position. I realize, that an obligation which 'has been placed upon Men going to the country will the Commonwealth by the Constitution. A city must be built at Canberra, and I am in favour of its being built. Three million pounds have already been spent there, and I have seen the works that have, been carried out. These include the provision of a splendid water supply and underground drainage system, and the erection of buildings and some four-roomed cottages. The cottages,. which cost £1,200, took as long to build as half-a-dozen would have taken in ordinary circumstances. 'No man can say when the work can be finished, and that is the reason why I am so anxious that the motion should not be carried. I have yet to be convinced that a temporary building should be erected for a Parliament House. If we must ultima tely build a Parliament House to stand for all time, why should we not build it at first, instead of spending money on a temporary structure which will probably have to be pulled down later? The parliamentary building will cost nearer £270,000 than £170,000. _ We have to realize that buildings have also to be erected to accommodate members and the staff of Parliament. I am not yet Already we are half convinced that Canberra is a good place for a Capital city, for there is not sufficientagricultural country surrounding it to make a good city of it. It may be a satisfactory political Capiial, but without a thriving back country it can never 'become a big city. I believe, however, that good legislation will come from it. There are at Canberra some plantations of pine trees, and I was surprised to see the amount of work that had The Public ""Works Combeen done j-in that direction. IThe first building put up was the powerhouse, which is built of reinforced concrete. After the Government had built this, it also spent from £50,000 to £60,000 to establish a brick works.

In advocating furthe r delay in the completion of the Capital he referred to the cost of erecting a parliamentary building, but entirely overlooked the fact that something like £3,000,000 has already been spent on 'Canberra, and is so much capital lying idle. completion of the city is delayed, the capital cost w ill be increased. remind honorable members Government side of the House that there is -very much unemployment in Australia at the present time, and that if the. construction of the Capital is expedited it w ill afford an excellent means of absorbing a large number of unemployed. The arguments that have been used in ""this debate, by those who may be termed dishonest advocates of delay -Order! It is not parliamentary to refer to arguments used i a this Chamber as "" dishonest."" arguments that are unscientific and illogical. Por the past ten years, ever since the foundation stones were laid at the Capital site, certain honourable members fro m Victoria and Tasmania, and some from the other States, excepting New South Wales, have been advocating delay. MrO ' KEEF E Not all Tasmanian members. of the arguments which were used ten years ago have been repeated to-day. This is not a party question, but it is a matter of urgent national importance. The time has arrived when the compact made in the Federal'Constitution should be honoured by this House. I agree with the utterances made by a certain honourable member who referred to the baneful influence of the Victorian press, and I think it would be in the best interests' of the Commonwealth, to remove the Federal Capital to Canberra, where Parliament would be free from parochialism and "" big business "" influences. I hope that a vote on the motion before the House will be taken without further delav. P9J motion because I feel it would be most unfair to tie the hands of Parliament in a matter of such great national importance. We have to consider the construction not only of a Federal Parliament House, but also of administrative offices, oflicial quarters, a hostel, and workmen's homes, aud railway communication must be provided for members to travel to and from the State capitals. The time l i m it proposed is much too short, and it would be impossible to complete tbe work satisI f the factorily in such a short period. Experts are of opinion that it will take at le'ast I would five years to-complete the work and make on the the city ready for the transfer of the Federal Parliament. Accommodation will be required for about 1,200 officers, and when the high cost of buildings, and the shortage of labour are taken into account, it becomes obvious that it would be inadvisable to rush the work through in the time suggested. I do not. object to proceeding w it h the undertaking on sound lines. We ought to honour the compact with New South Wales. The time has passed for objecting to the site, so much money having been spent there that we must reconcile ourselves to making the best of the job, whether the site is a good or bad one. There is not the slightest need for the break-neck speed desired by some honourable members. M i l lions of pounds are involved in the scheme. One of the principal arguments used in favour of the removal of Parliament to Canberra is that honourable members will then be able to get away from the influence of the daily newspapers of Melbourne. Honourable members have argued that public criticism warps and T h a t is so. Some directs their minds. Are they aware, however, that they have not the slightest chance of escaping the scorching criticism of the press even if they move to Canberra? The press w ill be there, and w ill criticise just as forcibly as it does to-day. It is desirable that we should have a press and a public to criticise us. All public men should be under the searchlight of reasonable, honest criticism, which is an incentive to a man to do his best. I sometimes feel that, the honourable member who desires to get to Canberra so hurriedly may' have an in clination to do something which would probably not stand the searchlight of public criticism.

Of ... ... ... 27 this amount £364,000,000 represented money borrowed to meet war expenditure, and £48,000,000 money borrowed for Commonwealth works generally and for advances to the States, and the value of McDonald, F. transferred properties.

A sinking fund, if managed on proper lines, will ultimately wipe out the whole of the debt, and is useful too, because, showing, as ifc does, a desire on the parr, of a people to meet its obligations, it (by D r . EABLE PAGE) agreed tends in some degree to raise that people's credit, and that enables such renewal transactions as take place from time to time in regard to portions of the debt to be handled in a much more satisfactory manner than when there is no stocking upon which to draw, and the whole of the loan falling due has to be provided for. Nothing is more encouragiug to a lender than the faGt that the borrower has a regular and definite programme for paying off his debt. Investors are further benefited, because a sinking fun d managed on proper lines always keeps the market for their stock more or less alive, thus permitting them to obtain ready cash for their security if occasion demands its sale.

Tbe transactions which have taken place in connection with the Sinking Fund of the Commonwealth are as follow: On the 30th June, 1923, the amount that w ill ' have been transferred from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth to the Sinking Fund will be, approximately, £11,675,000. A t that date the interest earned by the investment of the Fund will amount to about £265,000, making the total receipts of the Fund £11,940,000. securities the sum of £9,670,000 has been used, leaving a balance of £2,270,000 in tbe Sinking Fund on the SOth June of this year.

It is in accordance with the proposals agreed to at the Conference of State Premiers and Treasurers held in Melbourne last month, when it was unanimously decided' that sinking funds on a basis of £ per cent, should be inaugurated for the extinction of debts. The sinking funds will be used for the redemption of the Commonwealth' debts, but, pending such redemption, the funds may be invested in defined securities. BeforeI deal in detail with the actual provisions of the B ill , I would like for a few seconds to indicate briefly what are the provisions made in other countries for sinking funds. attention to those which exist within the British Empire. Great Britain formerly provided for capital expenditure practically out of revenue, and she always used any surplus revenue for the actual reduction of her debt. The main feature of the present English system is the provision of an annual fixed sum for the reduction of the national debt. normal times there is no borrowing by the British Government: the debt is continually being reduced. The conditions, however, have been very greatly modified by borrowings for war piirposes, and a slightly different system has now been inaugurated. The sinking funds in Great. Britain are under the control of the National Debt Commissioners, who are: The Speaker of the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Master of the Bolls, the Lord Chief Justice, the Paymaster-General, the Governor of the. Bank of England, and the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of England. In his Budget speech in A p r i l, 1923, the British Chancellor said he was providing a sinking fun d of £40,000,000 for 192324, increasing to £45,000,000 in 192425, and £50,000,000 as a maximum thereafter. As the to t a l ' national debt of Great Britain at the 31st March, 1923, was £7,773,506,000, it will be seen that the sinking f u n d for this year -£40,000,000-is just a very little in exContricess of 10s. per cent, of the debt. In 1922-23, the payments from revenue to the sinking funds totalled £21,750,000. A f t e r providing for this payment, there During that fifty year period was a surplus in the revenue account of £101,500,000. This surplus was used for the reduction of the debt. The total amount applied to the reduction of the debt in 1922-23 was £123,250,000. In 1921-22, the sinking fund contributions from revenue totalled £25,000,000. The surplus of revenue over expenditure in that year was £45,693,000. This surplus was applied in reduction of the debt. In addition to these two amounts, certain other funds totalling £17,773,000 were used for the reduction of the debt. The total amount applied to debt reduction in 1921-22 was £88,466,000. In 1920-21, the total amount used for redeeming debt was £259,500,000. In that year, and in 1921-22, large sums were received by the British Treasury as the result of the sale of war assets, &c. These special' receipts totalled FirstI will t u r n my £288,000,000 in 1920-21, and £170,806,000 in 1921-22. From the outbreak of war to 1920, GreatB rita in suspended all sinking f u n d payments. The New Zealand sinking f u n d is con : trolled by a Board, consisting of the M i nister of Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Public Trustee, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, As in and the New Zealand State-guaranteed Advances Office Superintendent. Their sinking fund contributions are 1 per cent, per annum on outstanding war debt. Funds are invested by the Public Trustee at 4-i per cent. The war debt will be extinguished in forty years. On other debts, the annual payment is a sum sufficient to provide for the redemption of the debt in seventy-five years from, the date of the issue of each loan. Taking the war debt and the other debt together, the average annual contribution is about 10s. per cent., or the amount which it is suggested Australia should maintain. Sinking funds totalled, at 31st December, 1921, £8,763,072; and the New Zealand war and other public debt at 31st March, 1923, was £219,000,000. In South Africa the management of the public debt is vested in a Board-of Public Debt Commissioners, consisting of the Minister of Finance, who is, ex officio, chairman; a member of the Railway Board, and one other member appointed by the Govern or-General. fund contributions total between J and \ per cent. In Australia, the only State which has had a really honest sinking f u n d , and has maintained it properly, is ""Western Australia, which has followed the same policy ever since the inception of responsible government: and even before, when she was a Crown Colony, her loans were provided with a definite sinking f u n d . was first a sinking f u n d of 2 per cent.; and it later became 1 per cent., on a somewhat similar basis to that proposed in the Government's B ill . funds provided since responsible government are not controlled by Crown agents, but by two trustees in London, one of whom is the Agent-General. The trustees are appointed by the Governor-Generali n Council : their positions are purely honorary, and they control the whole of Western Australia's sinking funds, including those provided for local inscribed stock. Thef u l l amount' provided from Consolidated Revenue for this purpose is remitted to them for investment monthly, and is thus placed beyond the use or influence of any impecunious Treasurer. The amount at the credit of the sinking fund on 30th June, 1922, was £S..370,160, of which £8,292,802 was invested in Government securities, £31,447 in an assurance policy, and £45,911 was cash in the bank. In Victoria, redemption funds were established in 1898. In the early stages, the sinking fund was fixed at 1 per cent., but after a short experience ib was, in 1906, reduced to A per-cent. Since 1906, tliese moneys have been used for investment in redemption loan stocks, instead of for redeeming the debt outright. Thus the f u n d has been turned into a sinking f u n d , interest on the investments being credited to the fund. the hands of the Trust Fund trustees, but the authority for investing is wholly in the hands of the Treasurer. Investment, however, is restricted to Victorian Government securities. The amount to the credit of the funds on 30th June, 1922, was £2,754,000. Tasmania has had sinking funds, on and of f , for thirty or forty years. Sometimes they have not been on a very'sound basis, but during the last seven or eight years they have been placed on a niore Or. Earle Paye. satisfactory foundation. There was at the credit of the funds on SOth June, 1922, The sinking £1,118,020, which was invested as follows:-Governmen t debentures, £ 3 3 , 8 0 0; Commonwealth inscribed stock, £ 4 6 2 , 1 1 9; war gratuity bonds, £ 3 2 , 0 9 4; municipal debentures, £43,500;' local inscribed stock, £539,410; and cash in bank, £7,097. There has been a nominal sinking f u n d in New South Wales for many years, but it has been used nearly all the time for It meeting deficiencies in revenue. There is ostensibty an annual contribution to the fund of £350,000 from the Consolidated Revenue, bu t the total amount The sinking standing to the credit of the f u n d is now only £498,602. TheB ill before the House provides first of all for the repeal of the present sinking fund provisions. The Loan Sinking Fund Act 1918 is wholly repealed, with some provisions of the Loan Act 1913-14 A National Debt Commission is proposed, consisting of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth as chairman, the Chief .Justice of the H i g h Court, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Solicitor-General. MrE . RILEY W h a t does a Chief Justice know about finance? create a National Debt Commission which will command respect, will be impartial in its view of the position, and will not be too readily overwhelmed by any local political situation. I think the constitution of the Commission will not permit of its probity being questioned, and will give it a respect which will warrant its being intrusted with the duties allotted to it . TheB ill provides that during a period of fifty years a sum of £1,250,000 shall be paid annually out of the Consolidated Revenue into a National Debt Sinking Fund. The sum of £1,250,000 The funds are in has been arrived at as follows:-The total national debt is £412,000,000. The amount of debt in respect of which no contribution is to be made to the sinking fund uuder this B ill is £161,000,000, which leaves a balance of debt of £251,000,000. I will explain exactly how the £161,000,000 is made up, and how the redemption is already provided for. A sum of* 10s. for each £100 in £251,000,000 amounts to £1,255,000 or roughly £1,250,000. The proposed payment of 10s. is based upon the reduced",40,Second Reading
119,Dr. Earle Page,"The object is tosum of £251,000,000, because there are special arrangements for treating the amount not subject to the contribution of 10s. The funding arrangement with the British Government provides for a special sinking fund of slightly more than 1 per cent, per annum on the amount originally due to that Government, in respect of payments made by them on behalf of Australia during the war. That sinking fund will extinguish the debt in 1956. By adding together the sum of £251,000,000, in respect of which the sinking fun d of 10s. is provided by this B ill , and the sum of £90,388,604, provided for in the funding arrangement with Great Britain we get a total of £341,3S8,604. Deducting this total of £341,000,000 odd from the total of the national debt of £412,000,000, there remains a sum of £71,000,000. This sum represents moneys lent to the States for public works and for soldier land settlement, moneys expended on War Service Homes, other advances which are repayable to the Commonwealth in cash, and the balance of loan moneys in hand. Obviously it is not necessary to provide a sinking fund in connection with these portions of the national debt, and the Bill provides merely, that, on the repayment of the moneys to the Commonwealth, they shall be credited to the National Debt Sinking Fund. If tlie securities purchased out of the funds belonging to the national debt sinking f u n d were allowed to accumulate, a vast amount of securities would exist, and their existence would give a wrong impression because, while the balance-sheet would show a great sum iu hand; that sum would really be valueless from a practical point of view. TheB ill therefore provides that securities repurchased or redeemed shall be immediately cancelled. sinking fund may have the benefit of compound interest, however, ib is intended that in each of the f if t y years referred to, a sum of 5 per cent, per annum on the amount of the cancelled debt shall be paid into the sinking fund . This will not cause any additional burden upon the revenue, because the 5. per cent, will be paid to the sinking f u n d in lieu of the in terest previously paid to the owner of the bonds. member contend that the 10s. per cent, contribution will pay off the debt in fifty years ? at compound interest. There is no intention to accumulate huge funds which will be embarrassing to the finances of the country. In respect of future debts a sum of 10s. for each £100 borrowed is to be paid annually into the National Debt Sinking Fund. Provision is made here only up to the end of the fifty-year period already referred to, and w ill not be sumcient to wholly redeem the new debt. The Government think, however, that it would not be wise now to pass legislation to regulate what might happen after the lapse of fifty years. Provision is made for half the net profits of the Commonwealth Bank after the 1st July, 1923, being paid to the National Debt Sinking Fund. Up to the present the profits of the Bank have been divided equally between the Bank reserve f u n d and the redemption fund. The redemption fund may be used in repayment of any money advanced to the Bank by the Treasurer, or in redemption of debentures or stock issued by the Bank, or for redeeming Commonwealth debts or State debts taken over by the Commonwealth. No part of the profits of the Bank has yet been applied towards redeeming Commonwealth debts or State debts taken over by the Commonwealth, and as the Bank has not issued debentures or stock, and has no advances from the Treasurer, half of the profits of the Bank to date have remained in the redemption f u n d . The balance of the redemption f u n d at the 31st December, 1922, was £2,099,483, of which £9S,653 represented half the profits for the half-year ended 31st December, 1922. As there may be some In order that the misapprehension as to why this course is adopted, I shall read the section of the Commonwealth Bank Act referring to this matter. Section 30 relates to disposal of profits, and reads1.

Monaro-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.45] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. I ask honourable members to carry their minds back to the last Parliament, when the cattle and meat industry was in a very bad way, and we passed a B ill to enable a bonus or bounty to be given on frozen meat and cattle for export. The bonus was i d . per lb. on beef for export, and 10s. per head on cattle, under certain conditions outlined in the 3 ill . measure proved a great success. It was enacted for one year, and this year found the cattle industry in a very parlous state. There was a big demand from graziers andothers that the Bill of last year should be re-enacted, and an endeavour made to help them out of their troubles. There had been drought conditions right throughout the Commonwealth, aud when it was represented to the Government that the industry was suffering, -we determined that assistance should be rendered. waited on the Prime Ministeri n Sydney about last Easter, and he promised that a similar Bill would be passed this year, with certain small alterations in the conditions. In the first Billi t was stipulated, that certain reductions in the cost of canning were to be made, and also certain reductions in the wages and transport charges. The bounty given last year was £d. and 10s.. and the reduction in wages was 12s. a week, to which the men had agreed in order that the industry might be kept going.

Those interested in the meat industry said some harsh, unkindly things about the Government, because they considered that we were too hard on -them, and were depriving them, by making these conditions, of the benefits as promised.

190,Mr Bowden (Parramatta,"Ministe rreturn to the work to which they had been apprenticed or articled. The difficulty was remedied in regard to the M i l i tary Forces by section 40A of thc Defence Act 1918, which providesIn time of war any person wild is employed under articles of apprenticeship may, notwithstanding any provision of or obligation under the articles, enlist in the Military Forces, and any person who so enlists shail not be liable, during the period of bis service in the Forces, and until n. reasonable period thereafter, to be claimed for service under the articles. This Bill incorporates that provision in the Naval DefenceA c t , so that apprentices may have, in the Navy, that protection which they are afforded in the Army. When the apprentices who had enlisted returned from the war, some employers were not prepared to re-employ them, or permit them to complete their terms of apprenticeship. That difficulty was met, so far as the Military forces were concerned, by section 40u of the Defence Act IU 1.S, which provides(1) Any person employed .uuder articles of apprenticeship who has in time of war enlisted in the Military Forces shall, upon discharge from the Military Forces, unless the Minister otherwise determines, .be entitled, within a period of three months after the date of his discbarge-. . . to resume his employment under his article of apprenticeship, and the period served by him after discharge shall be deemed to be a continuance of tlic period served by him prior to enlistment. (S) If any master, upon the application of an apprentice who is entitled under the last preceding sub-section to resume his employment, refuses to employ him, lie shall be guilty of' an offionce. Penalty: Fifty pounds In order to cover youths who enlisted in thc Naval Forces, this provision is also sought to be included in the Naval Defence Act. We have had a very serious difficulty in regard to the graduates of the Royal Military College, and the Royal Naval College. It arises from the fact referred to by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) last night, that many of the cadets, after having availed themselves of the privileges of the colleges, and after having been trained at the expense of the Commonwealth for a particular class of work, leave the M i l it a r y or Naval Forces, as the case may bo, and seek civil employment, finding greater benefits outside the Service. , MrE . EILEY --I s not thai a good thing for the men themselves? trained at the expense of the Commonwealth for. a particular work for which it was expected their services would be available to the Commonwealth. train graduates at either of the Colleges? £800 and £1,000 per annum for each student. The Commonwealth incurs considerable expense in training these youths. The student enters Jervis Bay at the age of thirteen or fourteen years, and is trained for four years. He then proceeds to England and returns with a commission in the Royal Australian Navy. But before a boy can enter the Royal Naval College he and his parents or guardians must undertake that he w ill serve the Commonwealth u n t i l be is thirty years of age. Thus each graduate from the Naval College upon obtaining his commission should spend twelve years in. the service of the Navy. A similar undertaking is given in regard to boys who enter Duntroon College, but as tlie Duntroon cadets graduate later than the Jervis Bay cadets the period of service they are required to give as comm-issioned officers in the A r m y is about eight years. Both naval and military graduates, however, are obliged to serve until they are thirty years of age. In fact, they enter into a bond, which is ' signed by the students and their parents or guardians, that they w ill not withdraw from tlie service of the Commonwealth until they reach that age, unless they have previously obtained the consent of the Navy or M i l it a r y Board, as the case ' may be, and. paid a sum, which is fixed at £375 for each student. The trouble we have experienced is that under the Defence Act ancl thc Naval Defence Act the moment a graduate of either College becomes a commissioned officer he ceases to be .governed by the regulations controlling the Colleges,"" and passes automatically under the Defence Aet or the Naval Defence Act, which both provide that an. officer may resign from the Service on giving three months' notice. The result is that, although these people, have deliberately entered into an obligation to serve the Commonwealth until they are -thirty years of age, once they have",48,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading

ThisB ill w ill give legal force to the undertaking entered into by the student that he w ill not resign from the Serviceu n t i l he is t h i r t y years of age except by the permission of the Navy Board and upon payment of the prescribed sum. MrE . RILEY there are no positions open to these students when they graduate from thc Colleges? at present. During the recent period of retrenchment students who had just graduated from the Duntroon College and from the Naval College were allowed to leave the Service, because there were no positions which they could fill. they were compensated under the Defence Retirement Act. ceived commissions were compensated where their positions were certified to be in excess of the establishment; but in other cases boys who were going through the course of training at Duntroon or Jervis Bay, and had not received commissions, were simply told that there was no work available for them. They were obliged to seek employment in other spheres. Such a condition of affairs had a very material effect upon the Colleges and upon the number of students offering, but at the present time there is no doubt that the whole of the students in residence w ill be required for the Eorces. w ill , not be a sufficient number of them coming forward from Duntroon or Jervis Bay, w it h the reduced establishments there, to f ill the positions that owing to the wastage of the Service w ill become vacant during the next three or four years. The deficiency w ill be intensified if the students coming forward now are permitted to retire and leave us as soon as they get into the Forces. That is why this clause has been placed in the B ill . A similar clause, to apply to the military college, has been placed in the amending DefenceB ill . allowed to leave except in special circumstances, with the permission of the M i l it a r y ' Board, and on the payment of compensation'^ which may.be assessed stops at the Navy Beard. A provision which has given much trouble, and is still doing so, affects the enlistment of men for special work and special service in the Navy. A man may be wanted for a special job at a special time, but under the Naval DefenceA c t the Navy Board has no power to enlist him for a shorter period than two years. It was customary under the I s it not a fact that BritishA ct to enlist men for six months, or, in the later days of the wax, for the duration of the war. In Australia, there is no power to enlist men, in any circumstances, for a period of less than .two T h a t is not the case years. TheB i ll removes that restriction, and gives power to the Navy Board to enlist men for any period that may be necessary. In the DefenceA c t there is provision that the Governor General may discharge or dismiss an employee in the naval service. As a matter of fact, so far as the ratings are concerned, that section is never acted upon. Underthe regulations men may be discharged when their term of enlistment expires; they may be retired for a variety of reasons; and they may be dismissed, which is a punishment for offences. The Navy Board has always dealt with these cases. In practice it is almost impossible to send men whose services are. dispensed with, or who are dismissed, to the Governor General. As the men are not employed by an Executive minute, but under the regulations of the Navy Board, it is thought that the authority which creates the employment should be empowered to discharge or dismiss the men employed. Although the power of the Governor General will not be taken away, the section of the Act, if altered as proposed, will read, "" A In fact, we fear that there seaman may at any time be discharged or dismissed by the Governor General or as prescribed."" tions controlling that? fications controlling it .

He has a right to state his ease to the Board and make a final appeal before it adjudicates on it .

The intention of the clause is to give to the Navy Board power which is held only by the Governor General at present. any qualification, "" He may at any time be dismissed or discharged."" qualification the honourable gentleman would Buggest. The power of dismissal and discharge must rest with some authority. for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) has suggested a Naval court-martial. Naval Court martial has to be confirmed by a higher authority. the proposal is adopted, in which a man will not get a public hearing. because under the Naval Act he has the right to state his case f u l l y before being dealt with. tain the same provision? override the rights a man may have under the King's Kegulations? it proposes to do is to take away the right of appeal to the Governor General, which is never exercised, and to leave the confirmation of a man's discharge or dismissal in the hands of the Navy Board.
