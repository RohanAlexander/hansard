Prime Minister And Ac.ting Minister For Defence)","by leave-Yesterday , the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams), the right honourable the Leader of the Australian Country Padden) and the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) raised various aspects of the subject of migration, and I undertook to make a statement upon it to the House. In October, 1943, the Government appointed an inter-departmental committee to examine all matters relating to post-war migration, and to submit recommendations. The committee consists of representatives of the Departments of the Interior, Treasury, External Affairs, Social Services, Post-war Reconstruction, and Repatriation. Representatives of the Departments of Labour, Information and the Army, and of the Security Service, attend meetings of the committee as observers. The secretary of the Department of the Interior, Mr J. A. Carrodus, is the chairman of the committee. Before the departure of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) for the United States of America and Britain, early in this year, the committee dealt with and made recommendations to the Government in regard to these matters:-British migration, with particular reference to British ex-service men and women, and assisted British migration other than ex-service men and women; child migration; and a proposed Jewish settlement in East Kimiberley. The committee's recommendations in regard to these matters were approved by the Government. the extent to which migration to Australia can be permitted will be largely controlled by Australia's absorptive capacity, having regard to the housing situation as well as to economic conditions and Thursday, 16 November, 1944. The Government decided, however, that",5,Setup

2,Mr Forde (Capricornia,"Actingthe rehabilitation of our own people who are engaged in war and war industries. The Prime Minister, while in Britain, dismissed in an unofficial and preliminary manner the Government's decisions in regard to British migration. Later, the Australian High Commissioner in London, Mr Bruce, and the Chief Migration Officer, Major ""Wheeler, were appointed by the Government to, represent the Commonwealth at official discussions with the British Government in, connection with this matter. The objtect of these discussions is to draw up an agreement governing British migration. Recently, an extensive report was submitted by the inter-departmen.tal coni mittee to the Commonwealth Government on the question of white alien migration. This report is at present being, considered by a sub-committee of. Cabinet. In view of the importance attached by the Government to child migration, the inter-departmental committee was recently instructed to give full and detailed consideration to amuch larger scheme than that previously submitted I am advised that the committee has already discussed this, matter, and will be in a position in a few days to submit recommendations to the Government. I believu that many thousands of war orphan children will be available in England and on the Continent at the end of hostilities. If brought to Australia and educated in our schools, they would be trained in our way of life, and be readily assimilated into the Australian community. The Government realizes that publicity will be necessary to give effect to its migration policy. It is of the opinion that such publicity or propaganda must be honest, factual and specific. To that end, the Department of Information was asked to submit a report and recommendations. This report has been prepared, and .will be considered by the interdepartmental committee about a fortnight lience. Another important matter which the committee has heen instructed to report upon, is the reciprocity of social benefits. It will be realized that migrants from, say, Britain, who have qualified.in their own. country for certain social benefits, Sir. Forde. may beunwilling to cometo Australia unless somescheme has been devised under which they will beeligible tor social benefits in this country. If. will be seen that considerable progress has heen made on the subject of migration. But the Government ennnot announce its policy in regard to British migration until definite agreement has been reached with the British Government. Moreover, the time at which migration can start in a big way must be governed hy the. progress of the Government in rehabilitating Australian service men and war workers. The Government, however, fully realizes that much planning and organization must be perfected in regard to migration before the war ends; otherwise, Australia will not be ready to take its fair proportion of available migrants from both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. ""We must make a realistic approach to the population problem. Australia has an ar.ea of 3,0.00,000 square miles, hut carries only7,300,000 people. In pre-war days, the sharp fall of the birth-rate pointed to a 'decline' of the Australian population, within the next three decades. History will some day reveal how close Australia was to being oyerrun. Divine Providence was on our side. We might not be given another chance. The cost of this war, and of future defence schemes for this country, must be borne hy a greatly increased population. Whilst everything possible should be done to increase the birth-rate, we must also .be realists in regard to the necessity for a scientific migration policy. Whatever our preconceived ideas may have been, we must guard against a repetition of the mistakes that were made ip connection with migration after the last war, bearing in mind that ourprimary responsibility is the rehabilitation of ex-service men andwomen, and war workers; but we can. do this, in addition to carrying out a migration policy: As our sister dominions and other countries will become keenly interested in securing migrants in the post-war period, Australia will have to bring its plans to the blue-print stage before the end cf the war; otherwise, we shall be left behind.in the quest for suitable migrants. tings of the Parliament, the honourable member for New England persistently expressed doubt as to the truth of a statement by the Minister for War Organization swea ring-in of officers of his department as officers of the Prices Commission. Is the Minister now in a position to state positively the dates on which such officers were sworn in as officers of the Prices Commission? nally required to perform the work mentioned were sworn in by my department in May, 1943. An y other officers since required to assist in the performance of that work were sworn in on the dates on which they joined the section. Prime Minister say whether any officers of departments other than the Department of War Organization of Industry have been sworn in as special officers of the Prices Branch, so that they may study the secret files of taxpayers in the Taxation Department, and can he say whether it is proposed to extend this method of evading the taxation laws? such swearing-in, but shall have inquiries himself,If the application originates from the soldier made.

I told the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that as the result of a recent government decision the Army had approved the-discharge of approximately 4,800 personnel for the dairying industry whose applications had previously been refused. That number was discharged irrespective of .the location of the unit, but in the same reply I said that future applications received for release of men to the dairying industry would be subject to the ordinary Array conditions governing occupational discharges, aud would not be unconditional as was the case with those already reviewed. The Government is most sympathetic towards the dairying industry and arranged for it to receive a very substantial number of the 20,000 men already discharged. The industry is to receive a further 8,000 of the 30,000 men to be discharged up to the 30th June next year. Unfortunately, there are 45,000 demands for man-power for various industries which cannot be satisfied ; while this counAustralia, and also for the benefit of try is engaged in an all-in war effort, we cannot hope to satisfy all industries making claims for man-power. But the war is not static, and a reconsideration of the whole man-power problem is to take place early next month, and by the end r»f December there will be a further review by the Commonwealth War Cabinet after the claims have been considered by the War Commitments Committee representing the three fighting services, the Director-General of Man Power and the Allied Works Council. HOME LEAVE.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces assured me only a few days ago that he was doing his utmost to give effect to War Cabinet's decision that leave should be given to the troops at regular intervals, but he said that the granting of leave was dependent on operational requirements and transport facilities. I shall endeavour to obtain the information sought by the honourable member. KNOW AUSTRALIA. Information make arrangements for copies of that excellent booklet published on behalf of the Department of Information entitled Know Australia, to be circulated to all senior pupils in Australian schools ? immediately to do as the honourable member suggests, but I hope that I shall be able to meet his wishes later. This book was first produced for the benefit of Australian servicemen engaged overseas, so that they would be in a better position to inform people in other countries about Allied servicemen in this country. The demand for the booklet has been overwhelming. About 70,000 copies of the first edition and 60,000 copies of the second edition were printed. A further reprint has been ordered, and it may be possible to meet the honourable member's wishes out of that edition. The British Minister for Information recently asked the London office of my department for 20,000 copies of the booklet for circulation among senior pupils in schools in Great Britain. 1939-43 STAR.

At the same time, the Government has been informed that, if the miners wages are garnisheed in order to collect the amount of the fines, industrial action will be taken. Is not the giving of such directions a misdemeanour iu common law in that they constitute an incitement to defy the law f Have any prosecutions yet been launched against the men concerned? What action does the Government propose to take in regard to the matter? the regulations are collected in due course without any ministerial direction. I have not seen the resolution referred to. If the honourable member will supply me with a copy of it I may be able to give him a more complete answer. I am sure that he will excuse me from dealing with questions of law in this House. General say whether it is a fact that the proprietors of the Olstan Colliery-on e of the Gregory Forster group of collieriesdismissed one of their employees, and that, Mr Connell, the local coal authority, ordered his reinstatement, which, however, did not take place? Further, is it a fact that the matter then went to the Central Coal Authority under Mr of charge? Willis, and that the reinstatement of the employee was again ordered? As the refusal of the coal-owners to reinstate this employee has resulted in a stoppage of work at this colliery extending over three weeks, will the Minister say whether or not such action constitutes a breach of the National Security (Man Power) Regulations, under which an owner may not dismiss an employee without consulting the man-power authorities-a n action amounting to a claim to the right to hire and fire honourable member to frame his question ON CAUSES OF properly.

Has that committee yet submitted its report to the Government? If so, why has not the report been made public? Is it because the report reveals that except in one or two instances the employers were in no way responsible for stoppages? that committee has not been placed before the House, honourable members have at least been informed of the substance of it on several occasions.

Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Defence) -by leave-Yesterday , the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Volunteer Defence Corps rifles and equipChambers) asked me a question regarding the future role of the Volunteer Defence Corps. I am now in a position to make a statement regarding the future of this organization. Approval has been given for a further substantial portion of the Volunteer Defence Corps in metropolitan areas throughout Australia to ibe placed on a reserve basis. This develop1 ment is the outcome of the continued success of the Allied forces north of Australia, which has further reduced the threat to the Australian homeland, and has made it possible to re-organize our forces in accordance with their changeover from a defensive to an offensive role. The personnel now being placed on reserve comprise those who have been carrying out duties in connection with anti-aircraft, coast artillery, searchlights, Information to edit one such newspaper, and infantry close defence in the various fortress areas. The manner in which these duties have been performed has reflected great credit on all concerned, and has relieved materially the man-power situation by releasing a considerable number of full-time members of the Australian Military Forces for service in forward areas. As a result of this decision, 95 per cent, of the corps will in future be on a reserve basis; the remainder will still be required to perform voluntary duty in coast and anti-aircraft artillery and searchlight units at certain defended posts for some time, in order to enable more Australian Military Forces men to be released for active service in operational areas. I emphasize that the placing of members on a reserve basis does not mean that the Volunteer Defence Corps is being disbanded. It is still essential to retain the unit organization, and to carry out the modified training prescribed, which amounts to one parade each month, to enable members to retain their skill at arms. It is confidently anticipated that metropolitan units will carry on these activities with the same enthusiasm as has been shown by country units, which have been carrying out rifle practices on a competitive basis since being placed on the reserve in July last. Minister for Defence whether he will consider cancelling the order recalling ment insofar as it refers to the north-west coastal areas of Western Australia, where the Volunteer Defence Corps units have rendered a most, valuable service. will be given \o the honourable gentleman's representations.

92,Mr Scully,"The honourable memMinister for Commerce and Agriculture about a jmblished statement, made by the president and secretary of the Australian Wheat-growers Federation on their return from an interview with the Minister in, I think, Sydney. Those gentlemen reported that they had received an assurance from the Minister during that interview that the Australian Wheat Board would be credited with an amount, on account of wheat which had been sold by direction of the Government at concessional prices, which would bring the realization of that wheat to the board up to the level of the average realizations over the year of wheat sold for export. Is that a correct statement of the assurance given by the Minister? Incidentally, if it is, will the Minister in future himself make statements of public policy involving millions of pounds, rather than allow them to be made for him by private citizens following interviews with him? by the honourable member is not quite correct, for the export price was not directly referred to by me. The only assurance I gave to the deputation was that which I gave to honourable debate on a motion for adjournment moved by the' honourable member for lndi at our last sittings, when I said that average realizations of the pool would be taken into consideration, and that I intended to make a submission to Cabinet seeking approval for an amount of money to be placed to the credit of the pool to bring the payments for concession wheat up to the average realization figure. That was substantially the statement. I made to the deputation. UNIT ED NATIONS RELI EF AND REHABILITATION Debate resumed from the 15th Novemattention was devoted in the debate yesterber (vide page 1827), on motion by Dr. day to the military operations in Greece. That tlie bill be now read a second time. whether the people of Greece should be and Minister for External Affairs) [3.33] -in reply-The Government has been pleased that honourable members have agreed, practically unanimously, to ratify this bill, although certain criticisms have been made in the course of the debate. 1 shall refer to some of these in my speech. My second-reading speech on the measure was made several months ago, since when several developments have occurred. An indication of these will also answer many of the questions which have been put during the debate. In some respects governments of liberated countries have been established more rapidly than was considered possible. In some respects, and in some countries, the situation is not so desperate as was feared. At the same time, the need for relief is no less great or urgent. I agree with some of the criticisms which have been made regarding the actual organization of the administration. There are two points to be remembered : This is the first United Nations post-war administration to be formed. As the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) observed, the best available people for work of this uature are already employed in war-time activities. Inexperience and lack of suitable personnel may lead to the members in replying to a development of an administration which is cumbersome and burdened with too large a staff. In my view-and it is a view which I know is shared by many observers at Washington-the central machinery of Unrra must, in the interests of efficiency, be subjected to continuous scrutiny. Another factor which has hindered the effectiveness of the administration is that it is not allowed to operate until the armies of occupation permit it to do so. That explains the absence so far of Unrra from Greece. The result is that this large organization has spent over a year in preparation, and has not yet had an opportunity to test itself in the field and adjust itself in the light of experience.

95,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genera lhelped. I believe that everybody will agree that throughout the war the people of Greece, in co-operating with the forces of the United Nations, have shown a courage almost equal to that of the Greek Armies. The people of Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand-al l of us-ow e to the people of Greece undying gratitude, and they will, therefore, agree that Greek civilians should be helped through Unrra. At present, however, the armies of liberation are still in Greece, and they rightly consider that the first task is to clear the enemy from Greek territory. All available transport and organization is therefore being devoted to that primary task. In the meantime, Unrra is waiting to assume its responsibilities in relation to the relief and rehabilitation of the civilian population. Insofar as the Pacific and Far Eastern area is concerned, the Australian Government is desirous of making relief a practical and effective means of assisting the populations of liberated territories to return to satisfactory conditions of health and welfare. As a resiilt of our representations, a branch office is being set up in Sydney, and whatever the difficulties are which have hindered the work of the administration in other areas, we shall do what we can to see that they do not apply in this area. It is important to Australia, both now and in the future, that relief in this area should be effective. supply position, they have been approved. Meetings of the Far East Regional Committee and its technical sub-committees on health, displaced persons, agriculture, welfare and industrial rehabilitation will be held in Sydney early next year. From the point of view of preparations for the time when the administration will be permitted to operate, I submit additional facts to honourable members: Countries requiring relief have been asked to supply estimates of likely needs. Discussions on supply matters have taken place between representatives of the Governments of the United .States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Cuba. Tentative estimates of relief requirements have now been supplied by Unrra to the Combined Supply Boards, but it has not been considered desirable to have supplies allocated directly to the administration to the full extent of estimated needs. In a period of scarce supplies it has been considered unwise to allocate for needs that may arise in the future at the expense of currently existing urgent demands. What Unrra has done has been to secure the co-operation of the Combined Boards and the supplying countries in promptly making available supplies, when the need arises. Allocations have been made by the Combined Boards of various goods such as agricultural machinery, footwear, medical supplies, textile bags, seeds and foodstuffs-thes e allocations will become available at varying dates in 1944 and 1945. Unrra has, ""however, placed special emphasis on creating a reserve of supplies that will permit prompt relief and rehabilitation. Such a reserve exists already in the Middle East. Also advantage has been taken of seasonal and non-recurring surpluses. In respect of goods that will not be available in adequate quantities unless orders are placed now, for example, finished clothing, Unrra has taken steps to place such orders. The governments of several occupied countries have themselves arranged for procurement of supplies. In the terms of the Unrra agreement these have been co-ordinated by the Director-General and wherever possible, in the light of the The total Unrra staff, including all grades, located at Washington, London, Cairo, Chungking, Algiers and Casablanca, numbered, on the 30th June, 1944, nearly 1,000. Of this number 450 were in Washington and 300 in London. Nationals of 21 member governments were represented. In addition, 260 persons attached to voluntary organizations were, on the 15th July, 1944, serving in the Middle East in co-operation with Unrra. Training schools for field workers have -been established in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Cairo. A quota of Australians will be employed on the staff of the administration. During the recent visit of Mr Lithgow Osborne and Mr Rolf Nugent, a number of applicants were interviewed and a preliminary selection was made. Some 50 Australians are to be appointed to the administration's staff immediately. I want honourable members to understand that the appointments are to be made, not by the Australian Government directly, but by this organization. connection with food relief? Australians will be employed in the Sydney branch office to which I have referred. The Australian Council of Unrra consists of representatives of voluntary societies such as the Red Cross, bodies such as the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's Christian Association, and all the churches in Australia. These have 'proved in peace-time that they are really zealous in work of this type. It is expected that through that great council of different bodies many teams of field workers will be drawn from voluntary organizations to serve in the liberated countries ol Europe and the Ear East. Unrra recognizes that the closest cooperation must exist between the administration and the military authorities. Obviously some time must elapse betore civilian relief workers can enter newly liberated territory, and accordingly relief measures immediately after liberation are undertaken by the military authorities. As a working basis, the period of military responsibility has been taken as six months. Such countries as France and Belgium will probably be able to procure and pay for most, if not all, of their relief requireis to be liable, however, to repay the cost ments. In these countries Unrra's task will be to aid in the procurement of goods and to assist in the return of displaced persons. Other countries, such as Greece, have been reduced to such destitution that they will need all the help which Unrra can supply. Plans for a Balkan mission are well advanced, and close liaison with the military authorities has been established through the head-quarters of that mission at Cairo. The military authorities have already requested Unrra to act as their agents for relief distribution in Greece, Yugoslavia and Albania. Working relations in respect of Western Europe have been established with the Supreme Head-quarters, Allied Expeditionary Force. Especial attention is being paid to the displaced persons problem. In the Middle East, Unrra has, since the 1st May, 1944, been administering six refugee centres, in Egypt, Palestine and Syria, originally administered by the Middle East Relief and Refugee Administration. The estimated population of these camps in September, 1944, was 53,000. Greeks, Italians, Yugoslavs, Albanians and others driven from their homelands are cared for in these camps. All physically fit refugees are required to work at these camps; for instance, as carpenters and painters in the case of men, and in the case of women, sewing or knitting is organized. Small allowances are paid to those unable to work: Until recently, Unrra's general policy has been that operations should be carried out in enemy or ex-enemy countries only if the council approves the scale and nature of the proposed operations and if the countries pay. At the recent session of the council, however, that policy was modified and the administration was authorized, without the need of obtaining prior approval of the council, to carry on operations in enemy countries with respect to displaced persons and epidemics. Authority was also given for the expenditure in Italy of a maximum of $50,000,000 for the following limited purposes, namely, medical and sanitary aid and supplies, displaced persons within Italy, and the care of children and of nursing and expectant mothers. Italy if it is found able to do so. People who have been the victims of oppression were also included within the scope of Unrra's activities. Unrra's nine committees, the regional committees for Europe and the Far East, the committees on supplies and financial control, and the technical committees on agriculture, displaced persons, health, industrial rehabilitation and welfare, have met regularly and formulated policies in their respective spheres. Unrra is undertaking the revision of the International (Maritime and Aerial) Sanitary Conventions. These conventions, relating to quarantine measures, have in some respects become out of date. The authority which normally'",16,Evatt

Since the war, however, the body has noi met, and, in view of the urgent ueed for the session of the convention,' Unrra has under La ken the task. 'Member governments have been asked to submit their comments on draffs which have been supplied. The Australian Government has completed a survey of Australia's supply position, and estimates are revised periodically in the light of changing conditions. It is obvious that the Departover, there is a close link between ment of External Affairs is concerned primarily with the international aspect of this organization. A department of the government will have to administer the whole of the supply side of Unrra in relation to Australia, and shortly the Minister to be charged with that responsibility will have to be named. No orders have yet been placed with Australia, for tlie reason that in view of our existing but here again relief makes its demands commitments we are not yet in a position to divert our man-power to the supply of relief goods. However, that problem is being examined by the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), who will probably have charge of our Unrra activities. I shall now reply more specifically to the points raised during the debate. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr that members of this House might help on Holt) suggested that the operation of a council is likely to delay work. It is true that the first meeting of a council lasted some weeks, but this was only because it was the first meeting. The second meeting, which took place recently in Montreal, lasted but a few days, and concentrated on one or two outstanding matters of importance, such as the application of reliefto enemy countries, and the revision of sanitary regulations. I agree with the observations of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr tions. Unrra is as anxious to avoid this Morgan). This organization is well described as one for "" mutual aid for peace "", and it is important as the first post-war United Nations organization. The attitude of governments to this organization will be a demonstration of their good faith and intention to support the other United Nations organizations which are at present proposed. The suggestion of t the honourable member that the trade union movement be represented on the Australian council for Unrra has already been adopted, and we look for the help which, the movement can give. The operation of relief will in no way be permitted to hinder the prosecution of the war with Japan. The combined boards are used by Unrra so that any claim Unrra makes is made to these boards and is considered along with the urgent war-time needs. In this way there is also co-ordination of wartime operations and relief. Morethe food and agriculture organization and relief. The effects of relief will often be of a long-term character, and it is important to establish continuity between wartime organizations, the relief organization, and the permanent Food andAgriculture Organization. As regards shipping, it is true that there is no specific provision mentioned in the agreement; on the combined war-time organizations, so that there can be no competition between war-time and relief objectives. I agree with the observations of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) regarding the provision for education and occupational training and the restoration of the voluntary organizations in the countries receiving relief. His suggestion the Australian council of Unrra, and in relief work generally, is one which will be kept in mind. There is the danger, which the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) pointed out, that some people, seeking limelight, attracted by the apparent glamour of relief work, or wishing to escape from responsibilities at home, might seek appointment either with the Unrra administration itself, or with field units sponsored by voluntary organizaas we are, and the Government, working with the Australian council of Unrra, which is composed of voluntary societies, will do its utmost to secure appointments of able, energetic and altruistic men and women. I am attracted by the suggestion of the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) regarding Unrra as a field for training young diplomats. I am especially examining the possibility of inducing Unrra to appoint those who have given combat service in this war.' Nearly every diplomatic cadet at present in the External Affairs Department has had combat service, and some of these would benefit greatly by work with Unrra. So, I think, would Unrra. Some have served in Greece, and I hope it can be arranged for some to return to help those who helped them in a time of desperate need. Arrangements have already been made for inspection by the appropriate Commonwealth department-the Department of Commerce and Agriculture-of all goods shipped for Unrra. I agree that it is important, not only to examine qualities, but also to see that a prominent bad or as necessarily good. The honorAustralian mark shall appear on all goods for the purpose, not so much to advertise the goods as to show to the people concerned that Australia's interest in them is real and abiding. will be done. In the same way, I believe that all Australian personnel serving in Unrra uniforms should have an Australian insignia prominently displayed just as have our servicemen wherever they may be serving. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) appeared to be opposed to the ratification of this bill, but I do not think that he seriously objects to it. He asked why the contribution to Unrra is fixed in terms of money. My reply is that under the agreement Articles5 and 6 contemplate that it shall be so fixed, and most of the contribution will be expended in supplies which will have to be procured from Australia. The £12,000,000 is fixed at a percentage of .the national incomes of all of the United Nations in relation to the year which ended on the 30th June last. The honourable member is also under a misapprehension about the Australian personnel. Those oflicers will not be sent abroad to administer our contribution to the fund. The money goes, in a sense, into a common pool,although the goods for the most part will be purchased here. We are parties to this agreement, and we must take a share in the administration, not of the Australian contribution, but of the international organization with which we are to be associated. The honourable member-I hope facetiously-read Dr. Evatt. of the countries comprising the United Nations. Not long ago he would not have favoured the inclusion of one or two of the countries whose inclusion he now approves. for instance. Can the Minister tell me what that country has contributed towards the war effort, or is likely to contribute to the cost of Unrra? the United Nations, and I have no doubt that even Liberia is making its contribution to the common effort. Al l are working towards a common end. It is a mistake to regard international arrangements of this kind as necessarily able member is inclined to reject all of them, but we should judge them according to their purposes, and then determine whether Australia should participate in That them. Such proposals should be carefully scrutinized before we accept them, and this agreement has been carefully scrutinized. The task of providing relief will be a very difficult one, and it is wise for us to be cautious. We should do our utmost to emphasize the practical side of relief and rehabilitation. For the most part, our contribution must come from our own physical resources, subject to the overriding requirements of the war itself. The honourable member for lndi sized one aspect of the matter. It is perfectly true that what Australia can do will depend on what is physically -possible rather than on what is financially possible. The position was not put in exactly that way by the honourable member, but that is what he conveyed. Our contribution will depend on what we can give out of our production. years has been for governments to enter into these agreements and to submit them to Parliament afterwards. I suggest that that reduces the Parliament to a very subordinate role. bind of agreement.

Messages reported recommending appropriation for the purposes of the bill, and for the purposes of an amendment to be moved by the Minister for External Affairs.

That it is expedient that an appropriapaigns, the training of these officers in tion of revenue be made for the .purposes of a bill for an act to approve the agreement for United Nations Belief and Rehabilitation Administration between the Commonwealth of Australia and certain other nations and authorities, and for other purposes.

The committee is now considering the appropriation of certain moneys for the purposes of Unrra, and this seems to me to be the appropriate stage at which to ask how the money is to be expended. I desire information regarding the staff that w ill be employed by the organization to be set up as the result of the appropriation by this bill of £12,000,000. 1 suggest that provision should be made for the employment in Unrra and in the food and agriculture organization, as well a3 in the Department of External Affairs generally, of young men discharged fro m the Army, even though they may be over the age of 25, which is the upper l i m it fixed for those seeking diplomatic cadctships. months, of the war, the pick of Ans[60] tralia'd young men joined the forces, many of them evading the regulations designed to restrict the enlistment of those engaged in certain occupations. Among them was a large proportion of the better educated men who gave promise of taking outstanding positions in the professions, in commerce or in production. B y a process of selection, which is even more drastic in the armed forces than in civil life, some of them have risen to positions of authority and responsibility as captains, majors and colonels. They enlisted in 1939, and it may he 1947 before they are released fro m the forces. B y that time they will have passed the age when, ordinarily, they would be eligible for cadetships in the Department of External Affairs. They arc holding key positions in the forces now, some of them commanding battalions or even regiments. Because of the nature of modern war, and because of the relatively long intervals between camleadership and administration has been more exacting than was the case during the last war. Some of them, when they enlisted, were in the middle of university courses; others had just started work. Since they have been in the forces their training and experience have tended to fit. them for administrative positions rather than for the callings which they had previously planned to follow. It would bo an admirable thing for Unrra, for the Department of External Affairs, and for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, too, for that matter, if they could dip into this reservoir of trained men for peacetime administrators. I hope that the Minister for External Affairs( D r . Evatt) w ill indicate that it is the policy of the Government to give such men preference when making appointments to Unrra. In that event it w ill not be necessary for me to move an amendment.. SeA'eral of the men who have distinguished themselves in the Department of External Affairs, such a3 Mr R. G.

The Minister is well aware that there are in the fighting forces many young men who gave up their training in colleges and universities in order to help their country in its hour of trial. They have acquitted themselves with distinction. Some have risen from the ranks, and arc now senior commissioned officers. high staff positions, or are in command of unite. They will find themselves in a different position when they arc discharged from the forces, because for years they have been dissociated from civil life. Tf they were appointed to positions with Unrra they would work in countries where the people had become used to -regimentation, and their war training would be invaluable to them. In the ordinary course of events men discharged from the Army will be handicapped because of the long period of useful service which they have rendered to their country. Men who joined the services in :1,989 may not re-enter civil life until 1948, or even 1949. By then they would not be eligible for appointment as Unrra officials because they would be over age. I urge the Government to accept the suggestion of the right honourable member for Cowper, and give these men special 'consideration, particularly in view of -their training, and the qualifications which they will possess. and Minister for External Affairs) [4.10] -Had the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) heard my reply to the second-reading debate, he would have known that the view of the Government is that for this class of work servicemen with actual combat experience in That policy has been followed in the appointment of diplomatic cadets; every one of them has not merely served in one of the service departments, but has actually been in a combat area during the present war; some of them having been awarded honours and decorations.

During the temporary absence of the right honourable gentleman from the chamber, I pointed out that, without exception, cadets appointed to that department had hot only been in a service department, but had actually served in a combat area in this war, and that some of them had. been decorated for meritorious service. Sir EART,E PAGE -What about the age limit and its effect upon men in the services ? which the right honourable gentleman has raised, and, broadly speaking, I am in agreement with him, as I think every Australian should be. support the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) regarding the age limit as applicable to these appointments, but that is something apart from the subject under discussion. Under the present rules relating to: the appointment of cadets to the Department of External Affairs, even a Rhodes scholar might not be eligible for appointment, because, of the age limit of' 25 years. It is essential that the age limit shall not be adhered to in respect of service personnel when appointments are made to the Department of External Affairs-. I hope that we understand one another in this connection. suggestion, but the matter does not arise under this bill. from the age limit be made, service personnel wiU be shut out; therefore, a definite ruling should be made. T h at is so. He has been Australians who may join Unrra' may beabsent from this country for many years. I was astonished to hear one honourable member say that persons would join this"" organization because of the glamour associated with it. I assure him that there will be little glamour; on the contrary, this service will entail a lot of hard work. Any one who has seen conquered countries knows that these .appointees will have to work amongst starving people, and in districts in which typhus, small-pox, and other diseases exist. They will have to face many hardships, and may themselves contract T h at has already been diseasea. The purpose of this administration is to give effect'to that part of the Atlantic Charter which aims at freedom from want. Some honourable members saw to-day a picture which must have moved them deeply: The problems are so tremendous that we should put aside all differences, in order to make the organization work effectively. I believe that it will work because of the spiritbehind it. For that reason, I was astonished that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) should I appreciate the point attempt to pour ridicule on the proposal by referring to the number of smaller nations which will be associated withUnrra. I remind him that the great powers also are signatoriesto the agreement, and that statistics are available regarding the conditions in Greece. There is, unfortunately, ample evidence that many thousands of Greeks have died from starvation-.

Can the Minister for External Affairs indicate that the Government will give sympathetic consideration to the suggestions which have been made? once. 14.21],-The further this discussion goes the more interesting it becomes. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) has just said that the employer, tlie selector of these people to go overseas, is not to be the Commonwealth, such selection will reside in the representatives of Unrra who conic to this country for that purpose. He also said that these people would be employed by Unrra overseas, and that that organization could dismiss them.

I should like the Minister to explain the purpose for which the second appropriation is required. What will be done with respect to people in Australian territories which have been liberated ? I refer particularly to the people of New Guinea. This subject has been brought to my notice by the New Guinea Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia which, in a letter to me, statesThe Chinese who were captured in the Lac area and afterwards released had not been molested by the enemy, and it is reasonable to mentioned New Guinea, but before I deal assume that the sumo state of affairs may exist so far as the Eabaul area is concerned.

One instance will sufficea period of nearly three months elapsed before shoes were provided, these had to be ordered from Australia and shipped to Lae by sea.

However, [ have not been able to ascertain what privileges, or benefits, it is intended to extend to them when they are liberated. I raised this matter in correspondence with the Minister for External Affairs, who replied that he intended to bring it to the notice of Unrra. I hope that he has done so, and that some concrete promise will be extracted from Unrra in respect of these people. In view of the fact that we are retributing £12,000,000 towards Unrra, people liberated in territories under Commonwealth jurisdiction should come within the scope of this scheme. The method of selection of the staff of Unrra has not been made clear. schedule states that the Unrra administration itself will select its staff; but I presume that it will be guided by recommendations of the Commonwealth Government. recommendations of the Commonwealth Government and also the voluntary council of Unrra, which includes representatives of the Red Cross and other bodies.

That second contribution is comparable with the yearly contributions which we have for years past made, and still make, to the League of Nations. regards our own territories, the letter of the honourable member for Richmond brought the matter to my notice and I took it up with the authorities. The view of the British authorities, with which we agreed, was that, Australia being a country whose mainland was practically untouched by enemy action and no portion of which had ever been occupied by the enemy, relief and rehabilitation in colonial or territorial porpeople in New Guinea. tions attached to it should be cared for by Australia independently of Unrra.

I understand that of the millions of pounds that have been contributed in Australia towards insurance against war damage a large amount has been earmarked to alleviate distress and help towards reconstruction in New Guinea. The Minister in his second-reading speech gave a long list of representative organizations which have the right to recommend persons for appointment to the staff of Unrra. mending authorities, but the ultimate authority which has the power of appointment is Unrra itself. stated definitely in the bill that Unrrai i responsible for the selection of staff from those recommended by that long list of authorities? but the administrative unit of Unrra is the executive authority under the bill. For instance under Article4 the Director General is the executive authority who does the appointing. stand that we are called upon to contribute £47,000 towards the administrative expenses of Unrra. contributions for both purposes-ou r major contribution towards supplies and resources under Article V., and the contribution towards administrative expenses under Article VI . i? that we are voting an appropriation which is essential, and which we are bound to make under the bill. 1 desire to elaborate certain points in connection with this proposed organization, for it will probably be the pattern of other international organizations which will engage in post-war activities. It is essential that we should scrutinize the proposal carefully in order to make sure that we shall have a real voice in the work that is to be clone. Unrra is to have a Director-General who may not be removed except by the unanimous vote of the central committee. If there be one dissentient voice on any proposal to remove him, the effort lo do so will fail. In other words, the Director-General will have complete control of the whole organization. Article IV . of tbe agreement provides1. The executive authority of the United Nations Belief and Rehabilitation Administration shall be in the Director-General, who shall be appointed by the Council on tin nomination by unanimous vote of the Central Committee. The Director-General may he removed by the Council on recommendation by unanimous vote of the Central Committee. 2. The Director-General shall have f u l l power and authority for carrying out relief operations contemplated by ArticleI . , paragraph 2 . . . It appears to me, therefore, that the Director-General will have practically unfettered power. I consider that we should have some safeguards in relation to the supervision of these administrations. The constitution of Unrra can be altered only by a two-thirds vote of the council, and the Director-General can be removed from office only by a unanimous vote of the central committee. I consider tliat the Commonwealth Government should have some control in respect of Australian personnel who may be associated with Unrra. I ask for an explicit assurance that this will be so. The Minister has told us that an agreement was reached with the two officers of Unrra who came to Canberra, that th» Government would have some authority, but that does not seem to me to be a satisfactory or business-like arrangement. It is essential, in my view, that provision should be made for the Government to have an effective voice in relation to our appointees and their work. I shall confine my remarks to the points raised by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). I agree with him' that Unrra will probably set the pattern for other international organizations. It is therefore essential for us to voice any criticism of the general set-up at this stage. It seems to me that the Director-General will have complete powers in relation to administration, and also largely the right, to direct policy, and determine who shall be employed, and on what terms and conditions they shall work. No supervisory power is given to the council. The Director-General will hold such a strong position that it will be almost impossible to remove him. His position will be comparable, in some",26,Evatt

The Director-General of Unrra will, in fact, be in an even stronger position. It may be that the officer appointed will carry out his duties in accordance with the general wishes of all parties, but it may also happen that, on some question of policy or detail, he will refuse to bend to the wishes of the majority. In that event he will be supreme, for no tribunal has been set up to which he will be really answerable. Any power of control which may seem to exist is, in fact, illusory. In relation to Unrra such a provision may not be very serious, for the organization may not continue in operation for many years; but in relation to some other international ^organizations such a provision could have serious results. I take no exception to the agreement, in a general way, but it appears to me that the Director-General is being given substantially unfettered power in respect of both policy and detail. member suggest that the Director-General find that the legislative authority is could determine what commodities shall vested in a body called the Council of be sent from Australia? be able to interfere with the domestic representative, and such alternates as may be economy of this country; but he will be necessary, upon the Council of the United able to determine how relief shall be disNationals Relief and Rehabilitation Administributed.

Under Article IV . , his functions are described, and the executive authority is vested in him. He is appointed by the council on the nomination, by unanimous vote, of the central committee. Therefore, China, Russia, Britain and the United States of America must agree before he can be appointed. They must also agree before he can be dismissed. I 3ee nothing unreasonable in that. criticism that he cannot be removed except by unanimous vote. It is of no use to say, ex cathedra, "" 1 agree with it "" , because I do not.

I concede that it could be said that there should be executive authority in the committee. That view has been rejected. The committee determines policy. Should there be any question as to the dividing line between policy and the execution of policy, I believe that ultimately the view of the committee and the council would prevail. The Director-General has not a vote on policy, but is the executant of policy. executive officer frequently will spill over into policy. He will do it and, theoretically, they cannot remove him. so.

The making of recommendations for appointments may not be made by member governments. Whether or not appointments should be made by member governments is a matter of policy, and that principle has been adopted. We shall have the very great assistance of the council of Unrra established in this country. As the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has said, bodies like the Red Cross Society will take a very active part in the working out of the plans of Unrra, especially in field work.

U NIT ED NATIONS FOOD AND BILL 1944. Debate resumed from the 27th September (vide page 158-6), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second turn-.. This is a bill to approve the constitution of a permanent organization to deal with all problems relating to the production and distribution of food, nutrition, and so on. The idea had its genesis at a conference convened by President Roosevelt and held at Hot Springs, Virginia, in May last. In many respects, the bill follows the one we have just discussed providing for the setting up of the Unrra organization. The purpose of Unrra is to arrange for the distribution of food and other necessaries to distressed peoples in the war areas. The present bill arises out of an attempt to create a permanent world organization which will work continuously for the material welfare of the people of all nations, and particularly to ensure that sufficient food shall be produced for their needs, and that it shall be properly distributed. The organization will come into being when twenty nations approve its constitution. Then, at some place yet to 'be deteimined, be established, and the various members will work together for the common weal. The main work of the Unrra organization will be done, by an executive and a Director-General, but, unlike Unrra, the organization with which we are now dealing, and which, rather than Unrra, will, I believe, become the model for future international agreements, the Director General is to be appointed by the conference upon such terms and conditions as the conference decides. He and the executive will apply the policy determined by the conference. Thus, the conference will be the main policy-making organization, whilst the administration will be done by the Director-General, who will, in a sense, be the permanent head of the organization. It is proposed at the present time that only Allied nations shall be members of the organization, but I believe it would be a mistake if, in the future, all nations, whether or not they are our enemies now, were not admitted. In making this statement, I do not compromise with our aim to crush our enemies completely, nor do I deviate from the declared policy of the Allied nations that only'the unconditional surrender of our enemies can put an end to the war. I mean that once this upheaval is over, and the necessary controls for peace have been established, the nations with which we have been at war should be admitted to -the organization because their internal.",29,Evatt

An organization which sets out bo improve living standards throughout the world, and to ensure full stomachs-everywhere, must play an important part in maintaining the stability and peace of the world. If it is not our aim to produce such conditions we had better stop talking about the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. Unless we are prepared to ensure that the peoples of all the world shall enjoy decent living standards it is merely idle chatter to say that we support the principles of the Atlantic Charter. Among intelligent people to-day there is a strong feeling that many of the problems with which the nations are confronted can be solved only by international co-operation. Acting singly, the nations of the world lost the peace after the last war, and acting singly the Allied nations, as we call them to-day, nearly lost the present war. Indeed, had not a certain group of nations, which we refer to with pride a3 the British Commonwealth of Nations, stood together in 1940 it is doubtful whether western civilization would be in being to-day. No nation is a complete economic unit. It influences, 'and is influenced by, for agricultural development unless marthe economics of other nations. Real economic success iu any country can be achieved only with the help of other countries. There could be no more important world movement than one which sets out to raise living standards all over the world, and to arrange for the production of sufficient food for the feeding of the people of the world, and for its effective distribution from the point of production to the point of consumption. In ordinary international conferences the voice of Australia would bo a very small one. In population, and in power we are a small nation. Our importance in world gatherings springs from the fact that we are a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. In future conferences at which diplomatic moves are being contemplated, or the exercise of force majeure is proposed in order to maintain the peace of the world, the three great powers will be Great Britain, the United States of America and Russia. They, and perhaps China also, will play a predominant part. The other nations will play more or less minor roles. In a conference such as that now proposed, however, Australia can play a most important part, because it is one of the great food-producing countries of the world. Any country which does business on the London market is familiar with the name of Australia. For instance, people whom I met in Latvia about nine years ago, knew of Australia merely because Latvian butter was in competition with Australian butter on the London market. This country's possibilities in primary production are by no means exhausted, and we can confidently anticipate greatly increased production in the future. The disposal of that production is of vital importance to us. On the success or failure of an organization such as that now under conr sideration may well depend the whole of our economic planning for the future. The. result may determine the road on which we shall have to travel. xVt a recent conference in Canberra of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the land settlement of ex-servicemen was discussed. That subject is inextricably interwoven with that of markets. It would be useless to open up large areas of land kets either internal or overseas could be ensured for the extra produce anticipated. There is little doubt that, during the first four or five years after the cessation of hostilities, this country will be confronted with so great a demand for food that difficulty will be experienced in supplying it ; but, from that period onwards, it may be necessary to find markets for the ever increasing food products which Australia expects to be able to supply. If the necessary markets arc likely to be available, the first role of this country should be to develop further its agricultural industries, and to regard its secondary industries as supplementary to them. If , however, we have reason to believe that the demand for our food products will not be so great in future as in the past, we shall have to reorientate our economic system, and possibly give a major role to our secondary industries. Many factors may operate in the post-war period which do not operate to-day. It will be of interest to trace briefly the course of development in Australia in the last 150 yearsa development without parallel in any country. Even the United States of America, with all its great national resources and its fertile Mississippi Valley, cannot point to such progress in the first 150 years of its history. But this progress has to a great degree been fortuitous. In using that term I do not cast any aspersion on the pioneers of this country, because I pay tribute to their intelligence and unsurpassed courage, but the development, which has taken place in .Australia has had direct relation to the progress of Great Britain. I doubt whether it is realized by many people in Australia that about 150 years ago the population of Great Britain was under 9,000,000. Australian development was then in its infancy, and as we progressed we witnessed a remarkable growth of the population of Great Britain, which increased over a period of, roughly, 120 years to between 40,000,000 and 50,000,000. That is one of the romances of history. Side by side with that remarkable expansion of population was another development of which we should take due cognizance. During the industrial revolution the people of Great Britain turned their attention from agriculture to manufacturing industries. That change resulted in an ever-increasing need for food products, and the supplies required were obtained mainly from the dominions and colonies of Great Britain. As gold production in Australia declined, a much more profitable source of wealth was opened up, that of the supply of the foodstuffs needed by the United Kingdom. increase of population in the Old Country was accompanied by increased land settlement and agricultural development in Australia. During that period Great Britain became one of the great creditor nations. Its mercantile marine and its insurance and discounting business brought in many millions of pounds, each year. to expend annually from £300,000,000 to £400,000,000 more than the value of its visible exports. income the increased quantities of Mr Hutchinson. the products which Australia, Canada and New Zealand were able to supply could be paid for. Obviously, our economic development has been closely linked with the development of Great Britain during the last 150 years. Australia has provided Britain with a valuable market, whilst the British market has been invaluable to us. There was an ever-growing stream of manufactured goods coming here from Great Britain, and at the same time an increasing quantity of agricultural products was going from here to the Mother Country. In recent years conditions have altered considerably, but, in the main, Australian economic development has been based on primary production. That was brought home to the people of this country forcibly during the depression years, when the collapse of world values was reflected in the returns from primary products, with the result that unemployment became widespread. When our financial position overseas became acute, it was to the primary industries that the Commonwealth Government looked in order to obtain relief. Even the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) has not more lustily advocated the cause of wheat-growing than did the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr 'Scullin) and radio announcers in expounding the ""grow more wheat"" slogan. Concurrently with the effort to expand our export trade, a policy of curtailing imports was adopted. The steps taken by Australia during that period were taken by nearly every other country, with the result that everywhere there was increased production and a restricted market. As Australian growers produced more wheat they added to world confusionflbycausing Therefore, the remarkable the price of wheat to fall still further. The policy followed by the nations at that period was one of the best examples possible of disconnected and non-cooperative national action, tending to increase international chaos and distress. Up to that time, Great Britain remained the only relatively free market in the world, and, accordingly, it soon Great Britain was able became the dumping ground for the goods of all countries. Eventually, however, Britain was compelled to limit its With this imports, with the result that producers in Australia had no longer an open door into a free market, bnt bad, instead, to bargain with the British authorities to enable their products to be shipped to the homeland. The last free market in the world had vanished. the depression, there was a tremendous growth of economic nationalism, which, in turn, accentuated the world'3 ills. Now that brings me to the war period with its demands for production of all kinds. What of the future? It will be seen that the conditions which led to the earlier development of this country will not be present in the post-war period. Britain is not likely to have a greatly increased birth-rate after the war, so tliat there will not be in that country an expanding population requiring increasing quantities of primary products from abroad. Britain's financial status has completely altered. That country, will probably emerge from the war a debtor nation, in which event it will no longer be able to expend annually between £300,000,000 and £400,000,000 above the value of its visible exports. Another important fact is that during the war Great Britain has been forced to increase its own production of foodstuffs-in some cases by about 40 per cent., but up to 80 per cent, in respect of other commodities. I do not think that ever again the people of Great Britain will allow themselves to be left at the mercy of the elements of air and water, by dependence on overseas supplies of food as in the past. Moreover, now that the British agriculturist has obtained "" a place in the sun"", he will be at some pains to keep it. Clearly, the conditions which led to the development of primary industries in Australia will not be present to the same degree after the conclusion of hostilities. We have to take those factors into consideration. The circumstances which will exist in the postcerted and co-operative attack upon this war world will determine the economic road which we must follow in the future. Unless we can obtain markets for our products, we shall have to think twice before we embark on great schemes of stopping up primary production. If markets can be obtained, our path in the future should be much the same as that which we have trodden during the last 150 years. That, is to say, we should concentrate on those industries which are natural to this country, giving to secondary industries, not an uncertain Following place, but a supplementary role in the economic set-up of this country. In mentioning some of the difficulties which I foresee will confront us in the post-war period, I do not suggest that Australia has reached the end of the road, because the distribution of food, as well as the production of food, has to be considered. Of the population of Europe, probably between 20 per cent, and 30 per Among other things, Great cent, do not receive sufficient food to maintain a proper standard of life. In many Eastern countries appalling conditions exist. Indeed, tbe expectation of life in some Eastern lands is only 26 years, due chiefly to insufficient food Moreover, Great being available for the people. I , myself, have seen pitiable and depressing poverty iu Bussia, which has a, population of over 200,000,000: and even the people of the United States of America received a rude shock when they read in their press that not less than 33-i per cent, of the young men called up in that country for military service were classified as unfit, mainly because they suffered from certain forms of malnutrition. If these low standards can be corrected, and fowl can be evenly distributed to the peoples of tbe world, all the difficulties I have mentioned will disappear like thieves in the night; because a correct, distribution of food will be accompanied by a demand for food products that could quite easily revolutionize the future of this country, and completely correct the changes in our relations with Great Britain to which I referred earlier. Undeniably, one of thp solutions for the present bad distribution, of food throughout the world lies in some world planning organization capable of making on behalf of the nations a conproblem. Such is the organization contemplated under this measure. I do not suggest for a moment that world planning alone will provide a solution. The basis of any attack on this problem must be national planning; but, as I said earlier, national planning cannot be evolved in the proper spirit and along the proper lines unless it takes cognizance of world influences and forces. measure, it is proposed to set up an .organization composed of representatives of the different nations who will nieet once a year to discuss matters relating to food and agriculture; .but the decisions .of that organization, and .the conferences ^t sponsors, will not be binding upon member nations. Those decisions will be purely recommendatory. much will depend upon the composition of the conferences, the qualifications of the nations' representatives, and ""their degree of unanimity. will also depend upon the politics and problems of the different nations, because we know from past wo.rld conferences that national jealousies, ambitions and politics play a most important part in such matters. In the main, success or failure will depend upon the .representatives whom the respective nations send to theso conferences, because in such negotiations the human element is always most important. participate in this scheme, but one can assume that practically all of the 45 nations represented at the Hot Springs conference will eventually participate in it. present a curious medley of representatives drawn from various and diverse countries, from China to Peru, and from "" Ioeland to India. visualize the enormous difficulties which will arise in discussions when . so many different shades of opinions must be satisfied in any endeavour to hammer out a policy on a world basis. fact emphasizes the importance of the human angle and the individual calibre of the representatives of the different nations participating ferences. I have studied the resolutions which emerged from the Hot Springs conference,, and must confess that the results achieved by that confei'ence have not impressed me very much. It was composed mainly of ' diplomats and economists of one kind and another; and it seems to me that they turned the proceedings into something like a draftsman's picnic. Resolutions were drafted on almost every conceivable subject related to food, food distribution and nutrition, and these followed one Mr Hnt chin ami. upon another in a glittering array. If Under this it is proposed that conferences under this scheme will deal with all the angles of the subject, scientific and otherwise, that were considered at the Hot Springs conference, there will be much talk, but very little achievement. In such circumstances, their reports will be so voluminous .that they will scarcely be read by responsible Ministers in the Therefore, respective governments, and will be relegated like many other reports to departmental archives. Our first concern should bo to send as our representatives to these Much conferences practical men with a wide knowledge of the requirements and conditions of their country, and with sufficient sense to steer discussions along lines that really matter. If that be done, possibly recommendations of considerable value will emerge from these conferences. The problem of the distribution of food is inextricably bound up with that of world-wide employment. Undeniably, that is the basis of any demand for Twenty nations must food products. Consequently, the latter problem must be dealt with by the nations participating in this scheme. However, each nation when evolving policies designed to promote employment in its own Therefore, these conferences will country must have sufficient vision to provide for not only the present but also the immediate future. The point I emphasize here is that if nations, in One can their endeavours to guarantee employment, once again embark upon a policy of economic nationalism, immeasurable damage will be caused. In this respect, the position of Great Britain in the postThat war years will be altered materially, because of the loss of its overseas markets and investments during the war. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has pointed in these conout in this House that in the post-war period Great Britain will need .to increase its exports by £-280,000,000 a year, and that, of course, will involve the problem of tariffs. Therefore, any national policy with respect to employment which fails to pay regard to international implications may not achieve its purpo.se. The next problem is that of the stabilization of prices of food products in the member countries. I do not require to elaborate that point in this Parliament. The conference will need to give its attention to the matter of exchange If food is to be produced, and employment, created by wise national policies, then trade must flow freely throughout the world, and trade cannot flow freely unless we have reasonably stable exchange, and unlosswe can put to work the moneys of the world, because these are often idle unless exchange and other conditions in the different countries can be made relatively stable. The matter of exchange stability is tremendously important. The relation of the dollar to the pound, the relation of the pound and the dollar to gold, and the relation of gold to silverall of these will be most important problems in the post-war world. Overseas investments, the possibility of being able to give credits to some nation which is in dire need of them-and other monetary matters are of supreme importance if the objectives of this oi'ganization are to be met at all. The attention of any contemplated organization such as this must be devoted to those big problems. All that the conference could do would be to advise that certain action be taken. All that our representative, for example, could do would b.9 to report to his government that the world situation was so and so, and that we could do nothing unless certain steps were taken. It is only from the wisdom and .the pressure of the recommendations made by this organization that we can expect to get action. If the problem of employment can be solved by the different nations, if stabilized prices can be given, if exchange stability can be achieved, then the matter of the production of food may reasonably be expected to solve itself. I am not suggesting that the producers of different commodities cannot obtain knowledge of immense value out of a world pooling of information, but in the main, if these problems are' solved, if there is a demand for food, if stable prices sensible policy can be evolved anywhere are given to induce people to grow food, if exchange is made stable and trade is rplatively free, the matter of production will solve itself, and then tlie problem of nutrition will also in the main solve itself. know that, if we are planning an I have a very real idea of the value of the dietitian, but if we make food abundant, and give the people the right to purchase it, then to the extent of 80 or 90 per cent, our nutrition problems are solved, and the remaining percentage pan be overtaken by the dietitian disseminating his views and information to the people. I have indicated the big problems, and if these can be solved, or if by the exertions and energies of this conference they can be even partially solved, great benefits will follow. I have dealt with the application of this principle to Australia, and have said a few words regarding the qualifications of those who should go to the conference. I have also intimated that there will be great difficulties in. getting a conference composed of men from so many different parts of the world to act together and weld themselves into a body from which great results can flow. Whilst the principle is sound, I suggest that it will be foolish for any person to be unduly optimistic of the outcome. We have witnessed in the past the failure of the League of Nations because of the conflicting views, the self-interest and the ambitions of the different nations composing it. In a conference such as this we can expect to have again all the differences of national outlooks and national set-ups 10 contend with. [Extension of time granted.] Further, we know that, even if unanimity be attained at such a conference as this-and a two-thirds majority will be required to obtain any decisionany such decision must be approved by the different Parliaments and governments of the nations before any real move forward can be made. There again will be encountered all the difficulties inherent in the different FPMVOS of governments in the various countries. Even, however, if the conference resolves itself into a mere disseminator of information as to the policies and proposals of different countries in regard to food production, I believe that it will still be of great value to any nation represented in it, because no really sound and unless we go along (he geometrical line of having all the known facts before us before we attempt to solve the unknown. In this country for example we expansion in any particular direction, we must take cognizance of what is being done elsewhere in the world to expand the growth of any commodity. So that if the conference only comes down to being a disseminator of knowledge of what other countries arc doing, and of scientific knowledge relating to animals, plants and human beings, I believe we can expect some advantage from it. If for example there can be brought from some other country a plant that will blossom in our arid regions', the benefit to Australia will be great. Therefore, whilst I do not suggest that we shall gain from this conference any earth-shaking result, I believe that it will have a definite value. The cost of our contribution, in the first place at any rate, is to be smalla mere £26,000 a year. That is for. the first year, but we know how movements like this grow. We know how expenses, deemed ample in the earlier years, increase as time runs on. country of three government departments expending to-day something like £650,000 more than they expended two years ago. There is a danger, of course, that this organization, being of an international character and its personnel being recruited from the four quarters of the globe, will tend to become more expensive as the years go on. Still, it can always be judged by results. At the end of four years, and with notice of a further year, Australia could withdraw if it so desired, but I believe that we shall not adopt that course at any time, because, although one would be foolish to expect great results, we must acknowledge that the principle underlying any such world organization is sound, and that every country has something to gain from it. Whilst we cannot be sure that big results must follow, it is always well to remember that from small beginnings great things grow. I support the bill, but will take the opporapprove of it ; I am speaking on general tunity to make some comments upon the principles underlying the making of treaties. First let me say that it is a matter for congratulation that the British Commonwealth of Nations is playing such an important part in the establishment of this organization, for it has undertaken the responsibility for 31 per cent, of the early expenditure, compared with 25 per cent, accepted by the United States of America, and 8 per cent, by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is also a matter for congratulation that, having regard to the fact that 46 nations are parties to the agreement, Australia has undertaken responsibility for 3.3 per cent, of the early expenditure. That is an earnest of our determination to play our part in the establishment of international organizations which, we hope, will be of lasting benefit to mankind. , The treaty now before us is important in that it is the first, probably, of a number of treaties which will involve some surrender of sovereignty by this Parliament. It is true that the implementation of the policy embodied in the treaty will depend substantially, upon approval, ultimately, of the Executive, and. not necessarily by the Parliament. The persons appointed to administer this organization undertake to withdraw in effect from We have the spectacle in this their own nationalities, and carry out the purposes of the organization on a completely international basis without regard to their own national ties, and without seeking to benefit their own nations. That is a departure of some importance and marks an important, albeit a. short step along the road of international collaboration. I share the doubts of the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) as to whether the hopes we sometimes optimistically express will be achieved, but certainly this is a step along the road of international goodwill. As to treaty making in general, it is a fact that in. the last two or three years international treaties have been made in this country without any consultation with the Parliament. If Parliament has been consulted at all it has been long after the agreements have been made. It may be that agreements have been signed which would not find general acceptance by the Parliament. I do not say that that is the case in relation to this agreement, for I principles. In several instances we have been given the alternative of either approving or rejecting a treaty which has been entered into by the Executive, and in such cases we have had no power to alter either.the phraseology or the obligations created, although we have known that the treaty has been made without consultation with us. In terms of practical politics we have had to accept in ioto many agreements that have been made by this Government. ments too.",30,Evatt

I shall not speak in relation to previous governcently the Government invited the people ments, but for myself I say that this tenof Australia to vest additional powers in dency must be arrested. In this country the power to make treaties is in the hands declined to do so; yet it is a strange f actof the Executive. In the United States of America no international obligations may be entered into except with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the Senate. No such limitation exists in Australia. Agreements which may seriously affect the life of the community and of the individual may be made by a handful of Ministers without consulting the Parliament in any way. I consider that this is. a matter of such prime importance that immediate attention should 'be given to it. Of course, it is quite futile to invite Partreaties which override the provisions of liament to discuss the details of agreements made with countries overseas when the Parliament merely has the right of approval or rejection of the whole document. It may be assumed that Ministers and probably some departmental heads discuss certain details with the representatives of overseas countries, but all too frequently the Parliament has been completely ignored. Recently the Australian-New Zealand agreement was entered into without any consultation with the Parliament. I am not concerned at the moment with the merits or demerits of that document. My point is that the Parliament should have been consulted before the agreement was made. I do not consider that any such agreement should be binding upon the Parliament until the Parliament has expressed its view. In connection with the agreement now before fus, action was also taken without consulting the Parliament. We had just completed the discussion of another bill which provided for the ratification of an agreement which was binding on Australia, although the Parliament had not been given the opportunity to consider it before it was entered into. We should, save in most exceptional cases, be given an opportunity discuss the broad lines of any proposed international agreement before it is actually made. It is not sufficient simply manifest. The bill deals with a food to present to Parliament a completed document which must be accepted or rejected in to to. The treaty-making power in our existing circumstances may easily be abused. Rethe Commonwealth Parliament, but they that the Executive may enter into international agreements in respect of such matters as restriction of production, agriculture and other subjects vitally significant in the life of a community without approaching the Parliament. I shall examine the general principles in relation to treaty making, having regard to the constitutional situation in which this Parliament is placed. Although the people have said quite recently, ""We will not grant additional powers to the Parliament the Executive may conclude any act of the Parliament, and which, in fact, "" walk around "" the Constitution. It is significant that yesterday the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) remarked in answer to a question that this Government had shown great aptitude for overcoming difficulties. He was answering a question in regard to constitutional limitations, and he said, in effect, that the Government could avoid observance of the clearly expressed determination of the people. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. treaty-making powers of this country in these terms: First, that the Executive may enter into any international treaty, and that it need not consult the Parliament either before or after entering into the treaty; and,secondly, that having entered into a treaty in respect of a certain subject-matter, it may then legislate so as to implement the treaty, although apart from the treaty it would have no power whatever so to do. That is a very important consideration for this Parliament, because it is well that the Parliament should realize the need for determining what powers the Executive should have and what control, if any, should be imposed on the Executive in to any particular case. If I turn to the bill, and show what is the subject-matter of it, the point of my remarks will become and agriculture organization. It states that the purposes of it are, among other things, to secure improvements in the",36,Evatt
183,Mr Spender,It has been true of,37,Evatt

I pause there. It must be apparent that the subject-matter of the bill is the very subject-matter which, in point of fact, recently was submitted by way of referendum to the people; aud the people rejected the proposal to grant to this Parliament the additional powers then sought. Nevertheless, if my point be correct-and I believe it to be-eve n though the people have said that this Parliament shall not have the power to deal with those matters, under this agreement the Executive could enter into arrangements without consulting the Parliament, giving to it complete power to make laws with respect to the marketing, processing and distribution of goods, and to fulfil all the other purposes set out in the bill. It is true that ArticleI . deals with recommendations. But certain other articles, with which I shall deal in a little detail, do not stop there. If honourable memlbers will look at Article III . they will find, first, that paragraph 8 provides-Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Constitution, or by rules made by the Conference, all matters shall be decided by the Conference by a simple majority of the votes cast. Then, under Article IV . , which deals with functions of the conference, they will see two important matters which have practical relationship to the point that I am making. Paragraph 1 of that article providesThe Conference shall determine the policy advisory functions; but, having been Paragraph 2 providesThe Conference may by a two-thirds majority I said previously-and I wish to repeat of the votes cast, make recommendations concerning questions relating to food and agriit again and again-the y may be carried 3fr. Spender. culture to be submitted to member nations for consideration with a view to implementation by national action. The functions of the As I read this constitution, the Government, given an appropriate majority of the conference, could enter into an agreement, for example, to restrict the production of this or that commodity. It could enter into an agreement with respect to the marketing and distribution of all food; for the adoption of policies of adequate agricultural credit, national and international; and for the adoption of international policies with respect to agricultural commodity arrangements. The Government could enter into such agreements by executive action, without recourse to the Parliament of this country; and, having done so, it could then proceed to implement the arrangements it had made, irrespective of tlie fact that otherwise this Parliament would have no power to legislate with respect to that subject-matter. I am not saying that that would be a wrong thing to do under any given set of circumstances. My reason for drawing attention to it is to fortify my suggestion that the bill -should not be approved by this House without the safeguard that, if any agreement should be made for the implementation of any recommendation of the conference under Article IV . , such a recommendation should not be implemented until this Parliament had first been consulted. I consider that the points that I am raising are important, and I hope that the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) will see the force of them. Paragraph 6 of Article IV . providesThe conference may, by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast agree to discharge any other functions consistent with the purposes of the organization, which may be assigned to it by governments or provided for by any arrangement between the organization and any other public international organization. Thus it will be seen that the signatories to this agreement may assign to the organization certain other functions-as , for example, the States of Australia may surrender certain of their powers to the Commonwealth. These could be .more than assigned, they would become a part of the constitution of this organization; and, as out .by executive actiou. However, the pointed out that those powers are -vested matter does uot rest there; because Article in the Executive of this country. X III . provides.1.

I have looked in vain in this constitution for any real "" limitations "". I draw attention to this matter because vitally important subjects will have to be considered by this Parliament. The agreement now before it is one of many important agreements which will be brought to our notice. I nowdraw attention to certain remarks made by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) when he was a justice of the High Court, In the case of K in g v.

194,Mr Spender,"declares that universal peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice and that labour unrest caused by unsatisfactory conditions of labour imperils the peace of the world. In face of these declarations and the setting up (under the Treaty) of the International Labour Organization it must now be recognized that the maintenance or improvement of conditions of labour can (as it does) form a proper subject of international agreement, for differences in labour standards may increase the friction between nations which arises even when trade competition takes place under conditions of reasonable equality . . . And in our view the fact of an international uonvention having been duly made about a subject, brings that subject' within the field of international relations so far as such subject .is dealt with by the agreement. Accordingly (to pursue the illustration), Australia is not "" a federal State the power of which to enter into conventions on lofooui matters is subject to limitations"". A contrary view has apparently governed the practice of the Commonwealth authorities in relation to the ratification of the draft conventions of the International Labour Office. In our opinion such view is wrong. . . . It would seem clear, therefore, that the legislative power of the Commonwealth over external affairs "" certainly includes the power to execute within the Commonwealth treaties and conventions entered into with foreign |K>wers. The legislative power in section 51 is granted "" subject to this constitution "" so that such treaties and conventions could not be used to enable the Parliament to set at nought constitutional guarantees elsewhere contained, such, for instance, as sections 0, 28. 41, 80, 5)2, Article IV . and no alteration of the con100, 110, or 117. Buti t is not to be assumed that the legislative power over "" external affaire"" is limited to the execution of treaties or conventions; and, to pursue the illustration previously referred to, the Parliament may well be deemed competent to legislate for the carrying out of "" recommendations"" as well as the ""draft international conventions"" resolved upon by the International Labour Organization or of other international recommendations or requests upon other subject-matter of concern to Australia as a member of the family of nations. The power is a great and important one. used during the recent referendum campaign. paign, the view now expressed by me was firmly held and given expression to by me; but, on the other hand, the people have now spoken, and I am obliged to comply with the w ill of the people. That is an obligation resting upon every honourable member, no matter on which side of the chamber he sits. 1 pointed out during that campaign that the most extreme use could be made of the external powers, in order to introduce, for instance, certain labour conditions in Australia and New Zealand, and then attract to this Parliament the very powers which the people have in the result denied. Because of that, I draw attention to these matters. -If my contention be correct, these propositions emerge: This agreement, which is only one of a number, may be entered into to cover matters which on the face of them do not impose any serious obligation on Australia. A t present the agreement merely provides for the making of recommendations in order to ascertain whether each nation will adopt them; but, if a recommendation is made by the necessary majority, and it is then adopted, for example, by Australia, by executive action, the Parliament w ill then be empowered to legislate in respect of the subject-matter of that recommendation. If that be correct, this Parliament should determine whether some limitation should be placed, not on the agreement itself, but on the bill. 1. suggest to the Minister that a clause should be drafted to provide that no commitment, shall be entered into to be implemented by national action under stitution of the organization should be made under Articles XIII . or XX . , unless it has first been approved by the Parliament. I regard that as of outstanding importance, fro m the point of view of the rights of this Parliament, In the past, treaty-making has been almost solely a function of the Crown, acting through the Executive. As to mo3t treaties which are openly discussed beforehand these days in the press, there is no reason why this Parliament should not was express its views on them. Private members have a duty, not only to their constituencies, but also to the country at D u r in g that camlarge, and my view is that, unless there are reasons of secrecy which prevent a treaty from being discussed before it is entered into, it should always be discussed before any commitment is made, and, indeed, even before a d r a ft commitment is prepared. I claim that there is no sound, reason why the subject-matters of",40,Evatt
195,Mr Harrison,That contention,41,Evatt
196,Mr Spender,"the international monetary agreement discussed at Breton ""Woods, and the Australian-New Zealand paot, for example, should not have been discussed in this Parliament before they were entered into. Other than in the most exceptional circumstances, the Parliament should have the right to discuss such agreements before firm arrangements arc made. much value unless definite action can be taken ? Take the monetary discussions at Breton Woods, which raised matters which had been discussed long before in connection with the White plan, the Keynes plan and the Canadian plan. Surely some discussion could have taken place in this Parliament regarding the principles for which we stood. Tho Government could have introduced general principles for the purpose of ascertaining the opinion of the Parliament. I shall always assert the rights of private members to express their views in respect of these matters. There should be general discussions before such agreements are entered into. My final contention is that an appropriate clause should be introduced to ensure that no commitment shall be entered into which would extend the constitution of this organization until it has at least been first approved by the Parliament. This is a minor proposition as compared with my first submission. In other words, there should be no executive commitment which this Parliament cannot dispute. If we do not adopt this course, Parliament will have little voice with respect to this and other agreements, and the powers of this Parliament will be vitally affected, contrary to the will of the people as expressed at' the recent referendum. Close attention should be paid to the terms of these agreements, and whilst I agree that the bill should be applauded because it follows the Hues of international collaboration, there can be no doubt that, if we believe in tlie principles of the Atlantic tion of more food by the farmers. ParCharter, many other international agreements must be entered into, dealing with different subject-matters of domestic as well as international affairs. For instance, there must be agreements with respect to labour conditions, for the purpose of increasing employment throughout the world. Recently the Minister for Supply and .Shipping( Mr Beasley) fought in Ohio for a principle which I believe should be generally agreed to, and which sought to impose on each nation the domestic obligation of providing ful l employment. At the recent referendum, power was sought with respect to employment and unemployment. That could be made the subject of a detailed agreement between Australia, and New Zealand, and then power could be vested in this Parliament, to implement that proposal. I do not seek to reduce the external power of this Parliament. Indeed, I agree with the view expressed by the Minister for External Affairs, when a justice of the High Court, in the case to which I have referred, but I think that we should pay more attention to the jjowers which this Parliament already possesses, and the ways in which they are exercised. I express my approval of this bill, but the House should not pass it unless a limitation is imposed so there shall be no extension of the constitution of the proposed organization until Parliament has been consulted and has approved of it. That does not necessarily imply that there should be a debate in Parliament, before any discussion by the Government with other powers takes place as to whether the constitution of the Organization should be extended, but I seek to safeguard the rights of this Parliament by contending that at least there should be no extension binding on this country until the Parliament has given its approval. That is of importance, both to the Parliament and to the people of this country as a whole. [8.30] -It does not seem to me that from this bill the primary producers of Australia are likely to obtain the maximum benefit possible. The stated purpose of this organization is to increase the consumption of foodstuffs in the poorer countries, and to encourage the producticulars of the scheme are set out in the schedule, which an eminent lawyer, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), has just assured us is as complicated, as our own Australian Constitution.

199,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"-approve the acceptance of the constitution of the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations,. and for -other pnrposes which are set out in the .schedule. In the preamble to the schc-dule it is stated that the nations accepting the constitution are determined to -promote the common w e l f a r e by raising levels of nutrition and standards ol living of the people under their respective jurisdictions, securing improvements in the efficiency ot the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products, bettering the condition of rural populations, and thus contributing toward an expanding world economy, The laudable purpose of the organization is to correct some of the ills from which the world suffers. We in Australia suffer from certain social and economic ills for which we are ourselves responsible, and no international agreement can help us to correct them. It is stated in the preamble that one of the purposes of the organization is to improve the distribution of food. In Australia, the distribution of food is hampered because the coalminers of New South Wales refuse to work, and this proposed agreement cannot help us in that respect. Neither will it help us to induce the wharf lumpers to load our produce on to the ships. The plan envisages placing upon the primary producers the responsibility for increasing the production of food without affording them any assurance that they will receive a reasonable price for their products. There is no assurance that there will be a market of any sort for the increased quantity of foodstuffs which it is proposed to produce. The first consideration-should be to feed the poorer peoples of the world, and China should be able to absorb a large amount of our production. China has lost a great deal during this war, and it is not set down as a large contributor. Australia is to be the ninth largest contributor among the -44 nations, being responsible for contributing 3.33 per cent, of administrative costs. This is expected to amount to 2,500,000 dollars this, year, and the -organization's expenditure under this ""head during the first five years is expected to average 5.000,000 dollars a year. The functions of the organization arc set out as follows in ArticleI in the schedule to the bill:1. Uhe Organization shall collect, analyse, interpret, and disseminate information relating lo nutrition, food and agriculture. 2. The Organization ^hali promote aud, where appropriate, shall recommend national and international action with respect to(<i) scientific, technological, social, and economic research relating to nutrition, food and agriculture; (6) the improvement of education and administration relating to nutrition, food and agriculture, and the spread of public knowledge of nutritional and agricultural science and practice; (c) the conservation of natural resources and the adoption of improved methods of agricultural production; (rt) the improvement of the processing, marketing, and distribution of food and agricultural products; (c) the adoption of policies for the provision of adequate agricultural credit, national aud international; (/) the adoption of international policies with respect to agricultural commodity arrangements. 3. It shall also he the function of the Organization(rt) to furnish such technical assistance as governments may request; (ft) to organize, in co-operation with the Governments concerned, such missions as may be needed to assist, them to f u l f i l the obligations arising from their acceptance of the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Food and agriculture; and (c) generally to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement the purposes of the Organization as set forth in the Preamble. I am disappointed that something more did not emanate from such a distinguished assembly. Unfortunately, the representatives of the various countries reached decisions upon agricultural problems without first consulting competent agricultural authorities. The basic purpose of the organization is to ensure freedom from want for the various peoples of the world, and this is to be achieved by improved methods of production and distribution. One may be pardoned for feeling some concern for the future of our primary producers if, after they have responded to the invitation to increase production, the organization is not successful in developing methods of distribution to cope with the increased production. The organization has a humane objective, namely, to supply the wants of those nations whose peoples are at present underfed. It is proposed that credits shall be made available to such nations to enable them to purchase foodstuffs. That should be of assistance to Australia as a seller of primary products, but we have vet to solve the problem of transporting our produce overseas. That is a matter for the Commonwealth Government to attend to. The organization is deserving of our support because of its worthy objectives. The scheme holds great economic possibilities for Australia as it may lead to the expansion of our exports of primary products. However, any such expansion will ultimately be conditioned by tariff arrangements and trade agreements with other countries. We have been told that the organization will strive to prevent violent fluctuations of the price of primary products, but no machinery is to be set up for this purpose. We have been told that the organization will seek to improve farming practices and agricultural processes, and that it will concern itself with land tenures and agricultural research. This is all to the good. We in Australia have hardly touched the fringe of this work. When we looked out of the 'windows this afternoon and-saw the sky filled with dust, it was brought home to us that energetic action is necessary if we are to prevent the I hope that before entering into any comcountry from being devastated by erosion. Drought is the chief enemy of Australia, and it can be combated only by taking measures for the conservation of water. We know that this should be done, yet we continue to allow our back lands to be blown out to sea. We decline to follow the advice of eminent scientists who have told us that we must dam the rivers, conserve water and increase the humidity of the inland areas. Until we tackle these problems for ourselves, and solve them our losses will continue. They can be avoided only by the application of science to production and the provision of sufficient money to establish great scientific institutions such as exist in other countries. Russia and Canada have set an example which Australia might well follow, because if we set out earnestly to deal with the problems confronting 113 we can increase our production considerably. I can see some hope for Mr Bernard Corser. the future if the organization which is to be established gives good advice which will be acted on, but Australia's problem is to face the difficulties which exist in this country. The primary producer has to sell his products in the world's markets at prices over which he has little control. In that respect he is in an entirely different position from that of the industrialist, whether worker or owner. It would seem that the proposed organization will encourage primary producers to produce more, and to send their products to the world's markets, but there is no guarantee that they will receive for those products prices which will ensure a payable return. The primary producers of Australia have endeavoured to encourage the growth of secondary industries in the hope that thereby an assured home market for their products would be provided. That is the only market that we can organize. The gentlemen who have got together, and have accepted this agreement, not being farmers, have urged increased production and a greater volume of exports, but they have not provided any guarantee of a payable price for the commodities so exported. Those persons in the United States of America, who have formulated this plan have not viewed the problems of the primary producer from the point of view of the man on the land. mitments the Government will carefully review every aspect of this bill, particularly its preamble, with a view to ensuring that primary producers and those engaged in export industries will not be in a worse position after the war than before it commenced. If the Government were to grant to primary producers a subsidy sufficient to guarantee to them a reasonable return, it would achieve better results for both the primary producers of this country and those who need their products than this bill will provide. Unrra sets out to do in order to settle the short-term problems of the world by providing food, machinery and other items for rehabilitating a war-worn world, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations seeks to do in the field of long-term problems. I do not share the pessimism of the honourable",42,Evatt
200,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [8.50],"Whatmember Oorsor). There are many things in the schedule to the bill which do not greatly affect the problems confronting this country. That must necessarily be so, because it is impossible at any conference of nations to cover the whole ground; what is done must necessarily be confined to broad and general principles. I give my blessing to the bill, because it sets out to do some32,424,000,000 eggs a year in the United thing which should have been done many years ago by some organization such as the League of Nations. The purposes of the bill which are set out in the schedule represent high ideals. They are four in number. The organization sets out to raise the levels of nutrition and standards of living; to increase efficiency in the proideals, and honourable members should be duction and distribution of food and agricultural products generally; to improve the condition of rural populations; and to contribute to an expanding world economy. I shall deal first with the subject of nutrition. Only in recent years has the world realized the extraordinarily low standard of nutrition among the peoples of, not only Asiatic countries, but also the United States of America, many western European countries, as Avell as Australia and other units of the British Empire. It has always been thought that in the United States of America, with its great riches and high wages, the diet of the people would reach a high standard, but a recent investigation has shown that about 30 per cent, of the population of that country is undernourished. A similar state of affairs existed also in G<reat Britain ""where, despite the riches of the population generally and the efforts of far-sighted governments, 30 per cent, of the population was undernourished in 1937. Even in Australia, which in normal years, is a land flowing with milk and honey, some sections of the community are undernourished. It will be seen, theredepends on the prosperity of the people fore, that there is tremendous scope for an improvement in matters of nutrition. Within the last year or so about 3,000,000 people have died of starvation in the Bengal region of India; and in large areas of China similar conditions have prevailed. Much can be done to improve nutritional standards in regard to both quantity and quality. Let us consider for example the two protective foods, milk and eggs. A recent survey shows that in for Wide Bay( Mr Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and western Europe there was an estimated shortage of milk products, including cheese, equivalent to 5,500,000,000 gallons of milk each year, and that a similar state of affairs exists in regard to eggs. Just before the war it waf estimated that there was a deficiency of States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, and thirteen Western European countries. Australia produces large quantities of these Foods, and is capable of exporting vastly increased quantities of them. The bill embodies the highest humanitarian glad' to (associate .themselves with it. because like other Australians, they have a sympathetic regard for the suffering peoples of the world. We know what happened after the last war in Greece and other European countries, to some of which Australia exported large quantities of foodstuffs. By producing food for export to the peoples of other countries who require it so badly, we shall do more than help them in their distress, for we shall also help ourselves. I have no doubt that if the world's markets for food be expanded, and Australia gets its share of the trade, we shall ourselves gain great advantages. Hitherto, Australia has been largely dependent on the export of primary products; our prosperity has been closely related to the prosperity of those engaged in primary industries. That remark applies to most countries. There are people in Australia who believe that we can establish a closed economy; that by taking certain measures internally we can raise our standard of living and provide our people with all that they require. That, however, is not so. Experience has shown that our prosperity of other nations. In this connection, I draw the attention of honourable members to a White Paper on unemployment which was tabled recently in the British House of Commons. In a foreword the following statement appeared:A country will not suffer from mass unemployment as long as the total demand for its goods and services is maintained at a high level, but in this country we are obliged to consider external no less than internal demands. That statement applies also to Australia. The only difference between Great Britain and Australia iu this connection is that, whereas Great Britain's prosperity depends chiefly on its export of secondary goods, Australia's prosperity depends chiefly on the export of primary products. However, the underlining namely, that the prosperity of one country depends on the prosperity of other countries, is true in each case. It is not generally realized by Australians the degree to which this country's primary industries affect the national economy. In the ten years prior to the commencement of the war, Australia produced primary products to the value of £9,500.000,000, of which produce to the value of only £64,000,000, or 4 per cent., chiefly to the United Kingdom. The products of secondary industries were valued at £.1,500,000,000, of which goods to the value of on'y £64,000,000. or 4 per cent., were exported. Those figures show clearly tliat our prosperity depends mainly on our primary production, so that anything that can be done to find markets for our primary products must add to the nation's prosperity. that our necessity to export primary products is not always apparent; that we can still maintain our position in spite of a reduction of exports. As I said earlier, experience has shown that that is impossible. I now turn to another aspect of the distribution of these primary products. Tlie problem is most difficult because distribution will depend almost entirely upon the purchasing power of the countries which will require these goods. It is quite clear that in the post-war period Australia must look for markets other than those which it enjoyed in the past. Before the war, as the honourable member for Deakin( Mr not look forward to any immediate appreHutchinson) pointed out, we were largely dependent upon the United Kingdom market, whereas the great development in agriculture in the United Kingdom during the war, and the fact that Great Britain has lost most of its own overseas investments, will make it difficult for Great Britain to import primary products on so large a scale as it did prior to the war. Australia, therefore, must look for other markets. ""We should look for them in Asia, particularly India, Mr Ryan. and, possibly. China. This will mean, probably, that Ave shall have to await the industrialization of India. Investigations arc now being made by the United. States of America and other countries with a view to the establishment of secondary industries iu India. Only by 'principle, that means will India be enabled to increase its purchasing power sufficiently to enable it to absorb appreciable quantifies of imports. The same observation applies to China. I can sec no reason why Australia should not endeavour to invest capital in India and China in order to encourage the development of secondary industries in those countries in the hope that later they will be enabled to purchase increasing quantities of our primary products. The second difficulty with respect to the distribution of foodstuffs is that of customer habits. When I was in Germany, I received a visit from the then Agent-General for Western Australia in Great Britain, who at that time had for sale large quantities of beef and mutton. Germany was then very short of meat, and wanted to buy meat, but the fact was that most of.the It has been said meat offered to it by the Agent-General for Western Australia was not of the kind normally consumed by the German people, who prefer mostly veal, and eat very little mutton. Had that meat been sold to Germany, there would have been no retail market for it. Consequently, the deal fell through. Much the same observation applies to Asiatic countries, whose peoples eat no meat, and very little butter, or milk products. Much of the foodstuffs we produce are not of the kind eaten by the peoples of those countries. It is a long-term job to change the customs of the people of any country, particularly with respect to food. Therefore, we canciable expansion of our trade in foodstuffs with those countries except in the form of wheat and rice. Our export trade with those countries is not likely to reach substantial proportions in the near future. Another problem is that of the increase of production. Under this measure, we agree to improve our efficiency in the production of foodstuffs and agricultural products. Production of foodstuffs has increased to a remarkable degree during tbe last 50 years; and, owing to more efficient methods, new plant and improved methods of cultivation and breeding, it is certain that we shall continue to increase our rate of production, even should the number of people engaged in primary industry decrease. About 60 or 70 years ago in the United States of America, 70 people produced sufficient food for only five persons, whereas today that ratio has .been practically reversed. It has been estimated as the result of recent surveys, and the experience of more advanced countries, that 10 per cent, of the population of any civilized country is capable of producing sufficient food for its whole population. That is true, also, of Australia; and, although to-day about 22 per cent, of our population is engaged in rural industries, 10 per cent, of our population could provide all the food required by our people as a. whole. We must bear that fact in mind in relation to schemes of land settlebecause it is a first step in an endeavour ment. It is useless to establish large numbers of people on the land unless we 1 can guarantee them payable markets overseas; and that problem is bound up Avith the success or failure of the scheme to be inaugurated under this measure. Some sections of our community are very vociferous at present in declaring that the enactment of this measure will result in an infringement of Australia's sovereignty. Those people seem to helieve that this measure will permit of the exploitation of ourraw materials, and our economy generally, at the expense of the Australian people. If I thought that the slightest ground existed for such a fear, I should oppose the bill. cannot contemplate with any degree of satisfaction any diminution of our sovereignty. come when some supranational power will attain control over tlie nations, but that time must be very far ahead. I see no tendency to-day for any nation to accept control over its internal economy by an outside authority. This measure, I such fears. The schedule makes it clear that there is no contractual obligation on the part of any nation which subscribes to this agreement to implement the recommendations of this organization. Therefore,, there is not the slightest ground for fear that our sovereignty will be infringed in any way whatever. At the same time, I agree entirely with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that any recommendation made by the central council of the proposed organization, before it is implemented in this country by the Government, should be submitted for the approval of Parliament. Quite apart from any constitutional consideration, it is entirely wrong that any matter affecting the internal economy of the country should lie settled merely according to the whim of tlie Executive without reference to Parliament. For that reason we should be well advised to provide specifically that all: recommendations under this scheme shall be referred to the Parliament before they are implemented. Summing up, I repeat, that in striving to make a success of this scheme, we shall be satisfying not only our hearts hut also our heads, to bring, about wider consumption of foodstuffs throughout the world, and raise the living standards of the people; and, later, we can advance until we provide some general system which will bring not only more happiness and nourishment to the distressed, peoples, but will also 'be to the advantage of our own economy. Should this scheme prove successful, it will have a profound influence on the world and on the prosperity of Australia, measure should receive general support, It provides an international foundation on which the nations can build a structure for the good of all. Although the scheme We is still only in its preliminary stages, it is fruitfu l of great practical possibilities. All of us remember the days of the depresPerhaps, the time may sion,, when we could not distribute surpluses of foodstuffs, and the prices of agricultural commodities were seriously depressed, yet, at the same time, the peoples of many countries were starving, and, many of our own people were unable to find employment. responsible. silly shibboleths of people who do not study these questions.

That depression forced many people off the land, and brought distress in a thousand ways. not hesitate to participate in international come to our help in an emergency, just as conferences for the purpose of dealing with such problems. Just as international collaboration is essential to enable the Allies to achieve victory in war, so it will be essential to enable us to achieve victory in peace. To-day, we passed the United.

We should follow a similar course in dealing with the problems of peace, and we need have no fear that in doing so we shall jeopardize our sovereignty. We can participate in international agreements of this kind, and at the same time, preserve our democratic institutions. We should not confuse ideals and ideologies. We who live in a British Christian democracy should know that we can achieve greater perfection within that democracy, without expecting any new order or social state which may be quite contrary to the British outlook. We can take part in world-wide discussions and agreements such as this, and at the same time preserve within our own country our loyalty to our own institutions, and develop them as we should, realizing that we are members of a great Empire which is to-day and has been over the centuries the greatest in the world. Let us keep our loyalties in proper perspective, and not seek some perfect international system because in so doing we might destroy our own democratic foundations in favour of some world revolutionary plan, some totalitsirian ideal, or some type of government in which opposition is not tolerated and government is by coercion and not by Mr White. consent. If we followed such a course, we should ultimately lose our own sovereignty and destroy that great institution which for centuries has been a pattern to the world. When we enter upon an obligation of this kind we need not jeopardize our own Empire relationships; we can still continue with our system of preferential trade within the Empire, knowing that ""We should Great Britain will always be ready to we would help Great Britain in its need. At the same time, on these bigger world issues, we must recognize the international point of view and co-operate with other nations. We have in this movement an opportunity to raise living standards throughout the world, and advocate a policy of expansion and not restriction of primary products. The nations have got together and decided that this ought to be done, but they have not yet decided how it can be done. Naturally, there will be great difficulties in bringing about the result aimed at. Speaking of the recent conference on world security held at Dumbarton Oaks, which had to be international in its ramifications and agreement, Stalin said that surprise should be expressed not that differences existed but that they were so few. Wheu we can meet other nations in conferences of thatkind, we find that we have forms of government suited to our own traditions and temperament, but. at the same time we can agree with great cordiality and unanimity on many important issues. I submit that this is one of the subjects on which we can agree. League of Nations. was an ideal. Had the nation which sponsored it, been a participator in the agreement, it could have been continued and we might not have had a world war to-day. Wilson was a democratic president, but he had a republican government. I was in Washington at the time and heard the debate. It was a tragedy of colossal proportions that his proposals were rejected by his own government, with the result that the league, when it was set up, was without the backing of the United States of America, and was soon deserted in turn by Italy, Germany and Japan.

I found in Great Britain a firm resolve shall be a payable price for the prothat depressions must not happen again. I attended some of the meetings of the Empire Economic Union, and heard the different points of view expressed very emphatically by men of all shades of political opinion. Anybody with any humanity at all is moved by the sufferings of the distressed peoples in the conquered countries to-day. One of the most pitiful things in this unending drama of man's inhumanity to man is that such suffering should continue, instead of the maximum of peace and goodwill existing among men. continue for a long time, and we as legislators in this Parliament must accept any proposal that will lead to a betterment of conditions in this and in other countries. I. do not ©all myself an internationalist, but in many .respects we must recognize chat we are our brother's keepers. We cannot allow starvation iu a distant country to be regarded as something which we can ignore, and be unmoved by, or take no action to prevent. Therefore, there is an obligation on us to support this bill. I have heard many discussions in Great Britain, where they have in such a masterly way overcome their own economic difficulties. While Britain is the and the Communists throughout the spearhead of the war, the British people are producing war weapons and turning their whole industry to war production. Britain is losing 70 per cent, of its trade whilst supplying its allies, even our great control. English-speaking ally, the United States oi America, with equipment. It is supplying Russia with equipment for twenty armoured divisions and immense quantities of boots, petrol and rubber under great difficulties, and losing many men and ships in the process. The people of Great Britain have done all that and at the same time have been fighting wars on almost every front, holding the mastery in the air, producing in addition the finest aircraft in great numbers, and have ' made their economic peace plans and have determined that depressions shall not comeagain upon them. Australia, which is largely a primary producing country, although its secondary industries aregrowing rapidly, must be interested to tives of the British people is that there ducts of agriculture, which is still the greatest industry in Great Britain. They have learnt the danger of being dependent on other people, and havedecided that their own agriculturists shall be supported, and a payable price guaranteed to them, whether it has to be done by tariffs or in some other way. They are determined that their own farmers shall be kept on the land, that finance shall be controlled, that great fluctuations in the price of goods shall be avoided, and that there shall be no booms, because the This condition will natural corollary of a boom is a depression. They have planned to smooth out the peaks and Valleys, so that they mayachieve the maximum of general prosperity without great economic disturbances. It can be done under a democracy; it does not need communism nor socialism to do it. The Socialists in Great Britain to-day are beginning to say that socialism is not to be accepted as a dogma applicable toeverythiug. The Socialist is now prepared to socialize only something which can be more effective if it is socialized, and to take each item by itself. If that were the general outlook of the Socialists world, we could soon arrive at a saner world outlook. be some international control, but it is not necessary to control everything within our own community.

I support the controls in international affairs contemplated in this bill. you did not hear-my prologue. At. the risk Without control we shall not get that betterment of world status that we want. I should like honourable members to know what the Empire Economic Union does, and what its objectives are. It will help in the colossal task of reconstruction which Great Britain has to face after the war. Great Britain was a creditor nation and is now a debtor nation. It sold its securities abroad, lost much of its trade, and will have a terrific battle to get its share in the scramble for world trade after the war. There exists in Great Britain to-day a movement which I think had something to do with promoting the conference at Hot Springs from which the agreement in this bill emanated. Has the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) Alliance? body, but an organization conducted by an expert economist and business man. He has by a strange paradox worked it out that, in the same way that a cartel can control trade within the world, so the cartel system can be used, not for the benefit of the capitalist who controls it, but for the benefit of the people as a whole. I commend to the Minister for External Affairs the objectives of the World Trade Alliance as propounded in a pamphlet by Sir Edgar R. Jones, K.B.E., who was formerly at the head of the tinned-plate cartel. That was a cartel, not a monopoly. In relation to raw materialsthere were pre-war international agreements covering aluminium, Mr Whiic. nitrates, pulp, rubber, tin, timber, zinc and nickel. The World Trade Alliance proposes that international agreements shall be made not only in respect of. raw materials, but also in respect of manufactured goods. Before the war such agreements operated in relation to cement, coal and coke, cables,, dyes, enamelware, electric lamp bulbs, granite, kraft paper, lamp glass, linoleum, steel rails, tubes, sheets, tinned-plate and other iron and steel products. will feed starving populations. I ask the honourable member to return to the bill. of boring honourable members, I will repeat that the World Trade Alliance has in mind the provision of international agreements covering many essential raw materials and manufactured products. Such agreements are intended to operate for the benefit not of capitalists who may be members of the cartel,, but of the people at large. The pamphlet to which I have referred indicates that The international organization contemplated under the proposals for a world trade alliance is for the regulation of the distribution of the main export products of all countries, so as to ensure a satisfactory state of general employment, avoidance of want-' and poverty, and u steady uplifting of tbe standards of living. That, in brief, is the objective of the World Trade Alliance, and it' has heard of the World Trade been carefully examined by Cabinet That is not a. wild-cat Ministers in Great Britain. It was also considered by delegates at the Hot Springs conference. It has, in fact, received a good deal of acclaim in Great Britain. The main provisions of the World Trade Alliance are that all surpluses of raw materials of countries throughout the world shall he acquired hy international agreement for distribution where they are most needed. In the same way that Unrra will provide foodstuffs for indigent peoples, so the surpluses of raw materials and manufactured, products will be distributed to indigent nations, even if they are unable to provide a quid pro quo. Although, because of drought conditions, Australia will not have a big wheat crop this year we all know that under normal conditions",49,Evatt

209,Mr White,"1 am sorry, sir, that we have a heavy export surplus, and so has Argentina, Canada and, to a lesser degree, the United States of America. Such surpluses would be acquired and used, for example, to meet the needs of the starving millions of China. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Byan) referred to starvation in many countries. There are 30,000,000 people in China starving and 50,000,000 are homeless. Wo all remember, too, the distressing famine in Bengal recently. If the international authority to which I have referred acquired surplus products where they were available it would be able to distribute them to countries where they were needed. If China could not pay for what it received it .could place contracts with large engineering firms in Great Britain and' the United States of America for supplies .for irrigation works or something of that nature, and in that way the feeding of the people of China could lead to the general betterment of the whole community. The three main provisions of the -Interment, power over which was refused to national Product Agreement cover(X) the allotted quantity or percentage referendum. share for export of each participating country.

"" There may be special prices for certain markets, &c) -agreement we are now being asked to (Z) the .maximum and minimum trading stocks or buffer stocks to be carried by each country. I cannot, at tlie moment, discuss all the details of this scheme, but I emphasize tliat it is not a wild cat proposal. It has ibecn "" vetted "" by leading authorities in Great Britain and has been given considerable support in the House of Commons. I have no doubt that the authorities will he able to deal effectively with the whole project on the organizational side, for this has been widely discussed. Honourable members may ask how the scheme is to be financed. It i8 proposed that a small export, levy shall he imposed in exporting countries and the resultant fund would be used to acquire surplus foodstuffs such as wheat, sugar, cotton and the like. These will then be made available to needy nations. This bill should be strongly supported. Th« statement of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that an agreement between, say, the Governments of Hew Zealand and Australia, or an international agreement which would make employment and unemployment an international matter, might permit this Parliament to legislate on subjects which are now beyond its constitutional power should be examined very carefully. The fact that Australia .becomes a signatory to an international agreement should not give this Parliament power to legislate on matters beyond its normal constitutional authority. If there is any danger of that kind ahead of us the matter should be determined by the High Court without delay. Australia became a signatory to the International Air Convention some time ago, and, subsequently, this Parliament passed legislation on the subject; but when the matter -was tested in the High Court it-was held that the legislation was ultra vires the Constitution. I do not consider that by becoming a party to an international agreement this Government would be entitled to legislate on such subjects as employment and unemploythe Commonwealth at the recent I consider that this 'bill should be supported wholeheartedly. The fact that all the allied nations are signatories to the ratify is important, for it reveals that rhey-are facing the problems of the future with common sense and understanding, and. desire to plant the seeds of world betterment, knowing that by so doing living standards will be raised and human life improved. Can we contemplate with equanimity that within a fewflying hours of our shores we have 400,000,000 people in China, 350,000,000 people in India, and 60,000,000 in Java, the vast majority of whom, partioularly in China and India, are undernourished and living on a -substandard level ? Tho purpose of this bill is to do something to improve the lot of these teeming millions, and we should therefore support the measure with enthusiasm. If we do so we shall be acting wisely in r the interests of our own primary producers, for there will then be no need to -fear that satisfactory markets will not be available in the years to come. Under the proposals now before us we shall be able to dispose, in a satisfactory way, of all our food surpluses. We should therefore support the bill enthusiastically knowing that thereby we shall be doing something for world betterment and for the improvement of the living standards of depressed peoples. In other words we shall be helping to give effect to the fine principles of the Atlantic Charter. -objectives of this bill are clearly set out in the preamble of the constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which appears in the schedule to the measure. It readsThe nations accepting this constitution, being determined to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part for the purposes ofraising levels of nutrition and. standards of living of the peoples under their respective jurisdictions, securing improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products, bettering the condition of rural populations, and thus contributing towards an expanding world economy, hereby establish the Food and Agriculture -Organization of the United Nations, hereinafter referred to as the "" Organization"", through which the Members will report to one another on the measures taken and the progress achieved in the fields of action set forth above. I heartily support the measure. Our experience in regard to the distribution of primary agricultural products has not been happy in recent years, and I believe that all the nations will welcome the setting up of an organization which will tend to overcome the difficulties that we have experienced. When we think of these matters our minds at once revert to the unhappy years following the last war, when there was a constant and bitter struggle for world markets by nations which had surplus products for export. This struggle led up to the disastrous experience of the depression years, during which tens of thousands of people in many countries suffered from undernourishment clue to lack of food. Conditions became more normal in the agricultural industries prior to the outbreak of the present war, but even in those days we were trying to bolster up our flagging industries by means of inflated home-consumption prices, subsidies and the like. In the early days of this war we had not overcome all our difficulties, and we had not realized the important part of food production in a total war programme. We can recall how we drained our agricultural areas of their best men and enlisted them in the forces. There followed the rather ludicrous experience of sending glamorous recruiting officers into country districts to recruit girls for the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and the Australian Women's Army Service, and later sending equally glamorous recruiting officers through our city areas to recruit land army girls to take the place of those who had been drained away from our farming areas. That was indicative of our confused thinking in those days. We have found that the primary industries, which previously had had to be almost browbeaten into accepting restrictions on acreage and the reduction of production, Avithin recent months and years had literally to be cajoled into an expansion of production so as to meet the needs of our own services and those of the other nations that Ave are seeking to assist. As the result of these experiences, certain lessons have been learned which should assist us in dealing with the general problem of feeding the undernourished peoples of the world and supplying an adequate measure of food of a suitable type and a pleasant variety in the years after the Avar. In order to stepup the production of foodstuffs, scientific research has been successfully applied to its needs, and there has been a development of mechanization in relation to farming generally. Both of those developments have stimulated production, and have opened up prospects of a happier future for the man on the land. Then we have had the encouraging experience provided under the lend-lease organization, and Avhat it has achie\-ed. This is indicative of what the nations of the world may be able to do in the days of peace if they can sink petty national differences and combine to promote international welfare in distributing as widely and as favourably as possible the production of which the world has UOAV become capable. The third happy development-and it is one which I suggest virtually saved the British nation from extinctionhas been the development in the application of our knowledge of nutrition to the",50,Evatt
210,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [9.40],"Thepractical problems associated with the feeding of the British people at a time when Britain's sources of supply for so much of its foodstuffs were cut off. These developments suggest the necessity for an international organization in which there can be some agreement as to the quantum of production, and some success may be obtained in the international distribution from one country to another of the foodstuffs that are produced. It is easy for us in this place to make the rather cosy assumptions that are set out in this bill. A statement of objectives is easy. The difficulties will arise when we try to put into practice the ideals that are here recited. One of those difficulties was sugmight be outside the scope of the Comgested, by implication, in the reference by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) to what he understood to be the post-war policy of Britain in this regard. The honourable gentleman said that Great Britain is determined to maintain its agricultural production, even if that should mean the imposition of high tariffs against the importation of foodthere would be at present a weight of stuffs from other countries. In that short expression, he suggested immediately a tremendous difficulty that will have to be overcome if this organization is not to prove entirely futile. If we are to have throughout the world each country endeavouring to export as much as it can, and to import as little as it can, then we shall have a repetition of the conditions tliat were so fruitfu l a source of friction prior to the outbreak of the present war. That is only one of the manifold problems that will be suggested before we can claim to have succeeded in carrying out the objectives of the bill. I do not think there is any occasion to dilate on what the measure proposes, or even the difficulties that will sonally, however, I do not consider that have to be faced. After all, this is an international agreement to which we are asked to subscribe. What we say to-night will not affect the text of it, and We now have in office a Government we can do little more than give it our blessing and wish it well. But there is one point upon which I should like to make a few comments. It is related to the measure, because it has to do with Government practice in regard to the presentation of treaties of this kind to the Parliament, and it was dealt with in some detail by the honourable member for CC7] Warringah ( Mr Spender), who stated what he believes to be the probable legal position as to the capacity that exists today in an Australian government to commit this country, through international agreements, to policies which may well affect the internal and domestic policy of this country when the treaty has been fulfilled. The honourable member put the point that, by the exercise of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth, it would be possible for an Australian government to enter into treaty obligations which would impose upon us the necessity to carry out within Australia measures which in themselves monwealth Government under the present Constitution. There is substantial support for that view, put forward as a legal proposition, in the leading case in the High Court. In the King versus Burgess case, there was an expression by several of the justices, including the Chief Justice, which has led legal men to believe that view on the High Court bench in favour of that proposition being a legal fact. The honourable member for Warringah was naturally troubled at this possibility, and suggested a safeguard which he considered should be adopted by all Australian governments. His suggestion, as I understood it, was that before committing this country to obligations under treaties which would be likely to affect our domestic policy, the Government should first obtain the approval of this Parliament. That would be a safeguard of a sort, and to the degree to which it represented a greater safeguard than may have been the practice in relation to recent treaties, it is to be welcomed. Perit would meat our situation at all adequately. Let us consider what could easily happen in the present Parliament. with an overwhelming majority in both Houses. the next fifteen years. that assumption for the purpose of discussion; it will make my point a little stronger for members to understand, and",52,Evatt

212,Mr Holt,"I am prepared to acceptcertainly for the people outside to grasp. Let us assume that the Government has an overwhelming majority in both Houses for an assured long term of office. Such a Government, denied by the vote of the people the right to make a series of alterations to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, might enter into treaty obligations with other countries involving a limitation on our freedom to act in relation to domestic policy. Let me give an illustration. Three or four countries might agree to the introduction of a working week of 36 hours or some shorter period. The argument would be used that if one country were to introduce this shorter working week, other countries which did not do so would be at a competitive advantage, and therefore it would be proper for all of them to adopt a common policy. Such a policy would definitely be related to internal and domestic matters. I am -not suggesting that in the years to come that might not be the sort of thing which it might be desirable to do. WhatI am concerned about is that if the law be as the honourable member for Warringah has stated it, I can find no satisfaction in his gentleman had no right to start. He proposition, that a treaty should be endorsed by this Parliament if any of its ramifications were likely to override the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution. doing it would be by altering the Constitution. could present to this Parliament a treaty which, in substance, overrode the provisions of our Constitution, and with its overwhelming party support in this place and in the Senate obtain full parliamentary endorsement of its action. Yet it might be found in practice, as indeed it was, that that overwhelming parliamentary support did not properly or effectively represent the will of the people in relation to the issues dealt with. This Parliament will have to consider very seriously putting to the people .the propomind that what he proposed should consition that our external affairs power should have placed upon it the definite limitation that its exercise by the Government or the country should not involve any agreement as to policies which would call for an overriding of the provisions of our Constitution. gentleman seriously believe ""that the people would consent to any alteration of the Constitution at the present moment? honourable member's rather gloomy interjection, having regard to the vote recorded in his electorate. have a dissertation on the recent referendum. sufficient faith in the good sense of the Australian people to believe that they would be' prepared, if the matter were, explained to them fairly and adequately, to consent to alterations of the Constitution which they believed would be to their advantage.

224,Mr Holt,"I have made the point,capacity of Australian governments to commit this country, through treaty obligations, to measures which may seriously cut across the restrictions that appear in our Constitution, then some further alteration of the 'Constitution itself would become necessary. Every one will admit that the general idea of this measure is excellent, providing, as it does, for an interchange of men and ideas in regard to agricultural education and development throughout the world. But what impresses me most about the measure is that, although it has this general desire and very good intention, the proposed machinery is very vague indeed. The road to hell is said to be paved with good intentions. This bill, by its terms, indicates many good intentions, but it may not enable us tp reach the desired haven because it lacks the machinery required to give effect to those intentions. The point was stressed by the honourable member for Warringah that the principles embodied in the measure, and all the instrumentalities associated with it, were not fully discussed in this Parliament and in other parliaments before the agreement was formulated. The first conference of the interim commission which dealt with international food supplies was held in May, 1943. Before that conference took place, and before the Australian delegates left these shores, I raised a question in this Parliament as to whether it was not au appropriate time to have a discussion as to the policy which would be advocated by our representatives at the conference, but I received a very general and vague reply from the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt). For months after the conference, I tried to have its results discussed in this House. During the period of the second conference, public debate should have taken place in this Parliament, because the conference sat for seven months from July, 1943, to January, 1944. There was ample time for such discussion in this and other Parliaments. As the result of the absence of that debate, the agreement produced is expressed in most elusive terms. It has a doctrinaire approach to the problems raised, and it is very loose in its expressions. I agree that the objects aimed at are good, but the machinery provided is not adapted for the work to be done. This is partly due to the composition of the various conferences. All of the representatives at the first conference were either economic or scientific research professors of high standing. At the second conference, which was attended by the signatories to this document, the delegates were extremely able men in their particular spheres, but they were not lawyers or practical politicians who had held high administrative positions. Therefore, this measure will have to be moulded by a process of evolution before it can be of much use. The proposed constitution of the Pood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is all-emibracing, and the functions of the organization are set out in ArticleI . The preamble to the schedule sets out that the nations accepting this constitution are determined to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part f oi the purposes of raising the levels of nutrition and standards of living of the people under their respective jurisdictions, securing improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products, bettering the condition of rural populations, and thus contributing towards an expanding world economy. But, when we proceed to consider the functions of the organization, we find that, instead of having any executive functions, it is to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and, where appropriate, to recommend national and international action with regard to a series of projects. One finds that the Commonwealth Parliament has only a nodding acquaintance with many of those matters, because they fall within the province of the States. In order to make the measure effective, something should be done to ensure the provision of proper administrative machinery. Three types of machinery are essential for a scheme of this kind, if it is to be of real benefit. There should be Australian 'machinery to ensure ful l collaboration between the Commonwealth and the States with regaa-d to the various proposals set out in paragraph 2 of ArticleI . Secondly,",54,Evatt
225,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [9.59],"there should be Empire machinery to ensure that each dominion works in liaison and keeps step w it h other parts of the Empire. Thirdly, there should be international machinery to ensure that the Empire as a whole and its constituent parts work in line with the other countries of the world with which they are in continuous contact. Although the schedule sets out the functions and the international machinery over a wide scale of activities, it does not show how the result desired is to be obtained. In one section of the report of the Interim Commission, there is a reference to the range of subject-matter, and the following paragraph relating to the economic organization of agriculture might well be noted:Economic organization of agriculture, including tlie production and successive stages in distribution, marketing, and consumption of food and other agricultural products; the coordinated expansion of consumption and production; the efficiency of factors of production iu terms of physical output and cost per unit; methods of reducing costs of production and distribution; scale of enterprise; economical use of labour and machinery; provision and use of credit; demand and prices; gross and net income in relation to output and consumption ; trends and fluctuations in production, prices, incomes, and other factors bearing on the relation of agriculture to the general economy; domestic and international trade and other aspects of national and international economy, with special reference to their bearing on food and agricultural problems. An organization dealing with problems like that must be strong indeed and must have a solid foundation. It must not be an organization which is subject to change, but this organization can change its constitution and even its relationship to governments. Paragraph 6 of Article IV . statesThe conference may, by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, agree to discharge any other functions consistent with the purposes of the organization which may be assigned to it by governments or provided for by any arrangement between the organization and any other public international organization. When one remembers the spate of international organizations, have the most extraordinary need for effective machinery becomes evident. An agreement will shortly be submitted to this Parliament as a result of the international and the need for a check by this ParliaS-ir Earle Page. ment on the powers of organizations of this kind is obvious. In regard to matters dealt with in this bill, we must clarify our minds upon three points-the relationship of the States to the Commonwealth, the relationship of Australia to the rest of the B ritish Empire, and the relationship of the Empire to the rest of the world. For instance, one of the functions of the organization is set out in these terms. The improvement of education and administration relating to nutrition, food and agriculture, and the spread of public knowledge of nutritional and agricultural science and practice. That can be achieved in Australia only by co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. It is also proposed that the organization shall concern itself with the improvement of the marketing and distribution of food and of agricultural products. Those functions are at present divided between the Commonwealth and the States. The Government should tell us how it proposes to acquire power to deal with such matters. Doesi t propose, as the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) suggested when he was a member of the H i g h Court Bench, to rely upon its external affairs power, once an external agreement has been entered into, or does it propose to achieve some internal arrangement to meet the situation? It would be an absolute waste of time to employ research workers upon problems if it was then found that the Government lacked the power to give effect to their recommendations. Some sort of machinery should be evolved for dealing with the problem of Commonwealth and State relationship. In the financial field this has already been achieved by the setting up of the Australian Loan Council, and i u the agricultural field something has been accomplished by the Australian Agricultural Council, but this organization lacks constitutional and statutory power to give effect to its decisions. It is necessary to do something in regard to cost of production and some of which in regard to transport, but the Commonpowers, the wealth is unable to take effective action unless it can enter into an arrangement with the States. Before we place these matters outside our own control by signmonetary conference, ing the agreement, we should find out where we stand in regard to this matter of State and Commonwealth powers. I am concerned over the omission from this document of any suggestion for bringing into line .the various parts of the British Empire regarding the proposals. Up to seven or eight years ago, there existed means whereby the various Empire countries were brought together through an Empire Marketing Board, which concerned itself with problems of marketing, research, &c. Men like Sir John Bussell and Sir George Stapleton visited Australia from England, and we sent abroad such men as Sir David Kivett. Scientists of all grades visited Australia, and learned of our problems. An attempt has been made to maintain facilities for Empire-wide research by the establishment of a research library at Bothamstead. ""We shall not be able to play an effective part in this organization unless we reach an understanding that will enable the British Empire, when necessary, to speak with a single voice. I was interested to note the large number of signatories to the scheme. Australia is represented so that it may contribute to the cost of the organization. sary for Australia to do as the GovernThe contributions of the various parts of the Empire are together more than those of any other country. something more than that is necessary. machinery providing for consultation, we want to be able to say, "" These are the things which can be grown in the various parts of the Empire. These are the things which Empire countries, because of the facilities which they enjoy, can do better than other countries. These are the means by which we hope to reduce the cost of goods, while at the same time assuring the producers of a reasonable return"". The Empire should be able to speak as a whole on such matters. I believe that the success of the organization, and indeed, the peace of the world, depends upon the homogeneity of the Empire. I am convinced that the League of Nations, with all its weaknesses, only lasted as long as it did because of the support which it received from the Empire. Of course, it is not necessary to include in this document a provision for the making of united declarations by the various countries of the Empire. I should be satisfied if the Government were to give an assurance that an endeavour would be made to achieve Empire unity upon such matters as agricultural research and marketing, and that the idea of unity will be implicit in any arrangement which we make with other nations. The international wheat agreement was rendered possible because consumer countries like Great Britain were prepared to buy wheat at a certain price, and because producer countries, such as Australia, were prepared to give an undertaking to limit their surplus production. In this way it was possible to stabilize prices throughout the world. After the war, it will be impossible to stabilize the wheat industry in Australia unless there is power to deal with production and marketing. At present these matters are under the divided control of the Commonwealth and the States. It might well happen that the Commonwealth would commit itself in an international agreement to do something which, in fact, it had not the power to do. In order to ensure the proper feeding of our people it might be necesment of Great Britain did during the war, that is, to stimulate production by the However, payment of substantial subsidies. In this way the producer would receive an adeI n the absence of Empire quate return, while the cost of food to the public would not be too high. However, such a system of subsidies might lead to a sharp conflict between Australia and Great Britain or between Australia and Canada in the matter of agricultural policies, unless we can get together and reach agreement upon certain'general principles. There ought to be some such body as an Empire Agricultural Council to discuss and decide such things. It will also be necessary to reach agreement upon the matter of Imperial preference so as to ensure the continued prosperity of Australia. ""When we look at this document we have reason to ask whether our agricultural future is sufficiently safeguarded. We can see certain benefits accruing to this country, but we can also see dangers ahead, particularly should the constitution of the organization be altered, despite our protests. The Government should make it clear, not only to the Parliament but also to other countries, that Australia intends to take steps to protect the rights of its people, both producers and consumers, by ensuring that no outside body will damage the economic structure of this country. [Quorum formed.""] I have listened with great interest to the discussion of the proposal to approve the acceptance of the constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. One thing which must have struck every honourable member was the silence of supporters of the Government, not one of whom has so far .spoken on the bill, notwithstanding that it may affect the whole of the primary industries of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) showed how the people of this country might be adversely affected through the organization without the Parliament even being consulted. Although the constitution of the organization may appear to be innocuous, and notwithstanding that we are told that the organization will have no executive powers, but may only ""recommend"" or ""request "", there are other paragraphs which, as the honourable member for Warringah pointed out, will enable the organization, by a vote of two-thirds of its constituent members, to alter its constitution. I am aware that no additional obligations can be placed on any nation without its consent, but although Australia may refuse to undertake certain obligations which other membercf the organization may desire it to undertake, this country may nevertheless be involved in difficulties by the deprivation of markets brought about through the action of the other nations bound by the constitution. It is dangerous to enter into an agreement relating to numbers of primary products. Such an agreement differs from an international agreement dealing with only one commodity, such as wheat. We do not know what obligations we may be undertaking, or the effect of such an agreement on the internal economy of this country and on the lives of Australian farmers. Let us consider Australia's representation at the conference. One would have expected that our representatives would have been agriculturists, or experts in food production, connected with either the growing of foodstuffs or their processing in the Commonwealth. We find, however, that that was not so. The leader of the Australian delegation was Dr. Coombs, the DirecioGeneral of Post-war Reconstruction. He may be an excellent economist, but I doubt that he has any knowledge of food production, except, perhaps, what he may have learned from keeping half a dozen hens in his back yard. With him was Mr F. L. MacDougall, Economic Adviser to the Australian High Commissioner in London. I cannot but pay a tribute to the work which Mr MacDougall performed in connection with the League of Nations in his advocacy of protective foods, the necessity of better nutrition, and as a theoretical adviser on food production. He is a good man, but many years have passed since he was last in Australia or had any real connection with the production of food in the Commonwealth. Another representaSecretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. I admit that he also is' a splendid officer, but, as during recent years he has specialized in shipping matters, he was rather detached from those associated with agriculture and food production. Professor Brigden, an economist attached to the Australian Legation at Washington, was another of Australia's representatives. Dr. Burton, of the Department of External Affairs, also attended the conference, but I do not think that he has ever been engaged in farming or agriculture. Other countries sent as their representatives agrostologists and men associated with food production. For instance, one of Belgium's representatives was MrL . Borremans, Commercial Adviser of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Attache to the Belgian Embassy, London. Another of Belgium's representatives was a professor of physiological chemistry and nutrition of the faculties of medicine and sciences at the University of Brussels. Every other nation represented at the conference sent men who were directly connected with food production and agriculture. New Zealand sent its Director General of Agriculture, and it is",55,Evatt

227,"Tive Was Mr E. Mccarthy, The Assistant","somewhat astonishing to find that Australia, did not adopt a similar course. Soviet Russia included in its delegates Professor Vassili S. Nemchinov, of Tirniryazev Agricultural Academy, Moscow, and others directly associated with agriculture. It is a pity that Australia did not adopt the same course, because, had it done so, a better constitution for this organization might have been the result. As the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has said, this document, which contains the recommendations of that conference, which consisted of professors, economists and all manner of theorists, is full of pious platitudes and aspirations, and, like the road to hell, is paved with good intentions. Paragraph 3 of the conference's declaration states that there has never been sufficient food for all peoples, and that the production of food must be expanded. No doubt farmers will be interested to know that the Government sends delegates to these conferences overseas; but why does it not practise what it preaches? Honourable members opposite have not taken the slightest interest in this debate. Excepting the Government's professional interjector, the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), they have preserved extraordinary silence. I contrast the expressed intentions of the Government with its actions. I am indebted to the Minister for Information for a booklet entitled Facts and Figures, which was issued by his department in September last. figures. ing ones. They show that our wheat producing 14,346,000 acres in 1938-39 to 7,860,000 acres in 1943-44, whilst in the same period the acreages under other crops decreased as follows: Barley, from 745,000 acres to 443,000 acres; maize, from 324,000 acres to 231,000 acres; oats, from 1,784,000 acres to 1,414,000 acres; and hay from 3,250,000 acres to 2,047,000 acres; whilst there was a slight increase in vegetable production, which is one of the smaller sections of our agricultural production. With respect to dairying, the booklet saysSince' Japan entered the war in 1941, the number of dairy cows milked in Australia has fallen by 300.000. Dairy herds (milking and dry') total approximately 3,200,000 head, a tally which has remained generally constant throughout the live years of war. The number of cows milked in a season averaged about 2,000,000, but this figure has fallen progressively. In March. 1944, only 2,300,000 cows were milked. The Government sends its professors and economists, and other members of its brotherhood of good-intentioned gentlemen, to conferences of this kind, at which they report that there never has been enough food for all peoples, yet it does not do anything to remedy the food position in this country. So far as I am able to understand the position, the organization proposed under this measure is to be a kind of academy to teach the nations of the world what they should do with regard to agriculture, and how they should produce foodstuffs in order to provide more for the poverty stricken people of the world, particularly in eastern countries. The document which summarizes the resolutions passed at the conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to which I have referred, ignores completely the fact that men and women are human beings, and not machines. Apparently, these experts have no idea of dealing with the very great difficulties existing in eastern countries, particularly in India, with respect to the reception of foods, especially meat, from foreign countries. Members of religious sects in India will not eat meat unless it is prepared according to certain religious rites. We talk about increasing the purchasing power of the people in eastern countries, yet we have areas decreased from failed to help them by remedying the greatest wrong yet done to them when silver was demonetized which had the effect of crashing the Chinese dollar on the exchanges of the world.

229,Mr Abbott,"Yes, and very disturbbecause every farmer and primary producer throughout the world has known for years that the things suggested in the resolutions of the conference should be done, yet they have not been done. Any one who reads Cobbett's Rural Rides or the same author's Cottage Economy, written after the Napoleonic wars, will find that people of England were then faced with problems similar to those we are now discussing. These pious aspirations will not get us anywhere. We must give to the primary producer in this country full freedom to produce. We should adopt the biblical rule to provide for the seven lean years, and not be terrified when we have a few surpluses in years of plenty. Only a few years ago, when we had an enormous surplus of wheat in this country, we were told that we would never get rid of it ; but this year, we shall probably have nothing but bare boards. If the Government, instead of merely subscribing to documents like this, which, incidentally, may be heavily loaded against us, got down to the actual work of increasing production to the greatest possible degree, it would benefit Australia and the peoples of the world. -Sinc e supporters of the Governtion has done some valuable work in ment are not sufficiently interested in connection with agriculture, the control its food policy to make a contribution to of pests, and the processing and manufacthis debate, honourable members on this ture of foodstuffs.

First, there is the problem of the conservation of natural resources, and the adoption of improved methods of agricultural production. To my knowledge only one agency under the control of the the Commonwealth Government is capable of dealing with that particular objective of the measure. Practically the whole of the work in connection with rural production is in the hands of the State Departments of Agriculture, and very little of the material methods of raising food production is in the hands of the Commonwealth. Irrigation, the raising of the standard of the dairy herds, testing the herds, fertilizing the fields and crops, and the nutrition of cattle, all come within the scope of the State Departments of Agriculture, and very little is left for the Commonwealth to do except to delegate its functions to the States. One important factor which urgently needs attention and is under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth is the conservation of our soil. That can be handled through the agency of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Mr Fur/Lias -It only needs a dressing",59,Evatt

231,Mr Anthony,"The interjectiontbe dairying areas of Australia tbe application of superphosphate is quite valueless. Many people believe that it will restore the fertility of all soils in Australia, but that is not so. In certain parts, especially through the northern dairying areas, it has not had the same beneficial result as has been experienced in Victoria and New Zealand. Consequently our soil fertility has decreased, our carrying capacity has gone down, and our production of vital foodstuffs has fallen off. Therefore, if the Government is serious in reaching the objectives mentioned in the bill, one of the things it ought to do is to direct the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to make researches into the conservation and improvement of soil fertility. I am pleased to see the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) present, because he is the Minister in charge of that body. I put forward that suggestion, which has been made to me by some of the most eminent agristologists of New South Wales, because with all their knowledge they are not able to advise the farmers of the correct thing to do, seeing that research has not gone far enough to enable them to determine the question fully. That is the advice given to me by men who, as officers of the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales, have given many years of study to the subject. I hope that that will be one of the means whereby the Government will endeavour to give effect to the bill. Sub-paragraph e of paragraph 2 of ArticleI . of the constitution, which appears in the schedule, readsThe adoption of policies for the provision of adequate agricultural credit, national and international. That is something which the Government might well consider. It is true that the Government induced Parliament to pass a bill constituting a mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank. Many applications have been made through me for assistance from farmers who should come within the scope of that measure, but I have not yet been able to find a single farmer who has received an advance from the department. challenge honourable members opposite who represent rural districts to say that any of their constituents have received advances. The passing of that legislation was nothing more than a gesture. It was the greatest hoax perpetrated upon the unfortunate rural producers, and now we have a similar provision embodied in this bill. Let us have something real. Let us give, through the medium of the mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank, that assistance for which farmers struggling against adverse circumstances, 'particularly in droughtstricken areas represented by members opposite are clamouring. If we are to increase our agricultural output we shall need to make a substantial change in administrative action and in policy. Whenever any reference is made to the decline of agricultural production in tin's country the excuse is offered that it is due to war conditions, and the withdra.wal of man-power from the farms. decline except in milk production. should have said "" except in milk production, egg production, butter production and foodstuffs generally "". As a matter of fact, we have maintained production only in vegetables. If war conditions are a valid excuse for the fall in the production of foodstuffs in Australia, Great Britain should have suffered in the same way, but what has happened? According to a pamphlet Facts and Figures, issued by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), Great Britain has greatly increased its production of foodstuffs, in spite of the strain on its man-power resources and the demands of its war industries. Great Britain has had to maintain men on fighting fronts throughout the world, on the seven seas, and in the air, particularly over Europe, where tens of thousands of airmen have served with great distinction. than 7,000,000 people to draw upon. which I have referred shows that whereas our food production figures have declined steadily since 1939, the figures in relation to Great Britain have increased remarkably. Our wheat production will drop I from about 200,000,000 bushels in 1939 to 50,000,000 bushels this year. In 1939 Great Britain produced 1,645,000 tyns of",60,Evatt

In the last two or three years Australia's production of sugar has fallen from about 550,000 tons per annum to a little more than 400,000 tons last year. In 1939, Great Britain produced sufficient beet for the manufacture of 3,329,000 tons of sugar, and last year its production was sufficient to manufacture 3,800,000, with the result that Great Britain is now providing sufficient sugar for its domestic consumption. The same story is told in regard to potatoes. The acreage under potatoes and the value of the production in Great Britain have increased considerably. About 10,000,000 tons of potatoes are being produced annually in Great Britain at present. In Australia housewives have had to pay fancy prices for potatoes and form a queue at the shops to get, them in the last few years, except for short periods when the markets were glutted. These facts indicate the need of guidance in agricultural and rural problems. Great Britain has had more acute demands on its man-power than Australia has had, but in spite of that fact it has increased its production. If it had uot clone so, the people would have starved and surrender might have been necessary. The figures given in the booklet in relation to live-stock are also interesting. The dairy herds of Australia have decreased by about 300,000 in the last twelve months, but in Great Britain the number of cattle has increased from 8,872,000 in 1939, to 9,546,000 in 1944, and the increase has been chiefly in dairy stock. Incompetency on the part of the administration is the reason for Australia's unsatisfactory position in .^elation to food production. The agreement which is now before us will be of value only if we are able to produce food in sufficient quantities to meet the demands that will be made upon us. is making a McCormick speech. men opposite do not like listening to hard facts. Every time the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) speaks on the subject of food production he refers to war conditions and the shortage of man-power as the reason for our reduced output. If such conditions really caused the reduced output in Australia they should have had a similar effect in Great Britain, whereas, in fact, production in Great Britain has increased substantially. If honourable members opposite earnestly desire that Australia shall fulfil its obligations under this bill they should indicate measures which they propose to take to ensure such a result. adjourned.

The task of re-establishing service personnel is too great to be handled by any one department; it calls for all the administrative machinery at the disposal of the Commonwealth. The departments most concerned are the Repatriation Commission, Department of Labour and National Service and the Re-establishment Division of the Department of Postwar Reconstruction. 3. The Government is aware of the need foi co-ordination and for ensuring the co-operation of all departments hnd bodies concerned. It is the function of the Ministry of Fbst-war Reconstruction, in consultation with other departments, to ensure that the machinery for co-ordination exists, and particular attention is being paid to the problem in connection with the re-establishment bill which is now being prepared. 4. The training scheme for servicemen is an illustration of how the co-operation of many departments-Commonwealt h and State-and of other bodies has heen achieved in one field. The Government has established reconstruction training committees in each State on which are representatives of the Technical Training Authorities, the Universities Commission, Repatriation Commission, employees' and employers' and ex-servicemen's associations. In this way the Government believes that the available facilities for training have been effectively mobilized and that the co-operation of all bodies concerned is being assured aud overlapping avoided.
