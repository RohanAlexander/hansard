(Notice given 7 October 2003.) The following answers to questions were circulated: Attorney-General’s: Program Funding (Question No. 717) Ms Burke asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Are there any programs administered by the Minister’s Department that provide, or have provided, funding to local government authorities in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000, (e) 2000-2001 and (f) 2001-2002. (2) If so, for each program for each of the years that funding was granted to local government authorities, (a) what was the level of funding provided to each local government authority, (b) what was the purpose for which the grant was made and (c) in which federal electoral division or divisions does this local government authority fall. (3) Have any concerns been raised with the Minister’s office or the Minister’s Department from (a) local government authorities or (b) other organisations regarding cost shifting onto local government in regard to any programs administered by the Minister’s Department; if so, (a) to what program or programs did the concern relate and (b) were any investigations undertaken by the Minister’s Department in relation to these concerns; if not, why not; if so, what were the findings of these investigations. (1) Yes. (2)(a) The tables below provide details of funding provided under programs administered by the Attorney-General’s Department.

176,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:and to persons involved in other negotiations, inquiries, mediation or proceedings in relation to native title. The Department’s electronic financial information systems have been searched for payments made to local government authorities under native title financial assistance schemes. It has been a longstanding practice, endorsed by successive AttorneysGeneral, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence and not to provide information in relation to individual applications. However, these electronic records indicate that payments totalling $662,416 were made to local government authorities between 1996-97 and 2001-02. Assistance has also been provided to solicitors who act for local government authorities in native title matters. The Department’s electronic financial information systems record these payments by reference to the solicitor to whom the assistance was paid. Determining the local government authorities on whose behalf those solicitors were acting would require a manual cross-check of the Department’s paper files. This would be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking, which could not be performed within the resources available without adversely affecting the work of the Family Law and Legal Assistance Division.

(3) No. Fuel: Ethanol (Question No. 1082) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) Is the Government aware of any dangers from the use of ethanol in petrol. (2) Does the use of ethanol blended petrol result in a greater possibility of corrosion to vehicle fuel tanks, underground storage tanks at service stations and fuel feed lines than it would with unblended petrol, when the proportion of ethanol is (a) greater and (b) less than 10%. (3) Does the use of ethanol blended petrol result in a greater possibility of contamination in and around service stations than it would with unblended petrol when the proportion of ethanol is (a) greater and (b) less than 10%. (4) Will Australian standards be changed to ensure that the use of ethanol blended petrol is safe. (5) Does ethanol blended petrol result in the blended fuel being a better conductor of electricity than unblended fuel when the proportion of ethanol is greater than 10%. (6) What proportion of service stations have storage tanks made of steel. (1) & (2) (a) While 10% ethanol blends are widely supported and considered ‘safe’, there are conflicting claims about the safety and reliability of ethanol/petrol blends above 10%. To resolve these conflicting claims, the Government is funding an extensive testing program to determine the impact of 20% ethanol blends on small engines and motor vehicles. The preliminary testing results shows that 20% ethanol could cause deterioration of metal, plastic and rubber components in some older vehicles. (b) I understand that several studies in the US have concluded that ethanol, when blended with petrol up to 10%, does not increase corrosion in normal, everyday operation. (3) Ethanol is hydroscopic and can absorb water from the atmosphere (and any vessel containing water that it enters). It is, therefore, prudent to ensure that water contamination does not occur in the distribution and storage of ethanol blends (at any ethanol level). Recent research also suggests that ethanol in petrol may increase the migration of toxic petrol components in groundwater. This issue is the subject of ongoing research and can be managed through appropriate storage and handling procedures. I am not aware of any data which examine migration of toxic petrol components at different ethanol limits. (4) The Government has set a 10% cap on the level of ethanol in petrol. (5) Ethanol blended petrol is a better conductor of electricity than unblended petrol. This is true for any percentage of ethanol, including 10%. (6) The Government does not have data on the composition of storage tanks in Australia. However, the Department of Industry Tourism and Resources estimates that 50% or more of service station tanks would be of steel construction. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1552) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report by Valerie Lawson titled “Tax-free QC wigs up for the old day job” which appeared on page 3 of The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 February 2003 and claiming that Mr Clarrie Stevens, QC had not paid any income tax for more than fifteen years. (2) Is he aware that the report notes that Mr Stevens is known to be in practise for 28 years, a senior counsel for 11 years and specialised in tax advice for much of his career. (3) Is he able to say on what grounds the Supreme Court of NSW granted an extension of time in which Mr Stevens could file an appeal against being removed from the roll and under what power did Mr Stevens seek this extension; if so, what are those grounds and what is the power; if not, why not. (4) What action is he taking to ensure that the common law and administrative maxim that justice is not only done, but manifestly seen to be done is applied to ensure that public confidence is restored to the legal profession. (5) What legislative or other action is he taking to arrest the problem of practising barristers who are serial rorters of the legal system using taxation, family law and bankruptcy provisions to systematically suit their own ends.",122,Questions On Notice
177,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes. (2) Yes, although I understand that Mr Stevens became a senior counsel in 1991. (3) No. The NSW Bar Association website indicates that the original hearing date in June 2003 was vacated by the Court of Appeal and re-listed for September 2003. Mr Stevens withdrew his opposition to the NSW Bar Association’s action and on 9 September 2003, the NSW Court of Appeal struck Mr Stevens off the roll for professional misconduct.

Transport: Roads of National Importance Program (Question No. 1805) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) Further to his answer to my question No. 103 (Hansard, 26 March 2003, page 13409) in regard to the Roads of National Importance Program, what requests for funding under this program have been submitted by each State and Territory Government in 2002-03. (2) What forward priority proposals or indicative priorities have been submitted for the financial years: (a) 2003-04, (b) 2004-05, and (c) 2005-06.

Officers from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) and the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) held a meeting with stakeholders on 29 July 2003. That meeting provided a final opportunity for issues and proposals arising from the issues paper and the submissions to be discussed with stakeholders. ITSA and AGD will report shortly on the outcome of that meeting and refer the matter back to me for my further consideration.",125,Questions On Notice
180,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence: National Service Medal (Question Nos 1971 and 1972) Ms King asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 June 2003: (1) How many applications for the anniversary of National Service Medal are currently being processed. (2) How many applicants reside in the electoral division of Ballarat. (3) What are the delays being experienced in the processing of these applications. (4) When will the processing of the applications be finalised. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Anniversary of National Service Medal Team currently has a backlog of 25,000 applications awaiting action, which date back to August 2002. (2) Identification of applicants within electoral divisions is not separately identified for processing applications. Consequently, this information cannot be readily generated and a manual search would require diversion of the scarce resources now utilised to process applications, resulting in increased delays. (3) Since February 2002, when applications were first formally requested and received by Defence, the average time from date of receipt of applications to date of delivery of medal was six months. In December 2002, the introduction of a standardised departmental personnel recording system led to the loss of some systems functionality. More recently, staff shortages resulting from the move of the Army Medals Section to Canberra added to the delay. (4) It is not possible to anticipate when applications could be finalised given that it is expected that applications will continue to be received for some years yet, and given that Defence still issues medals in respect of applications received for World WarI service. Defence: Honours and Awards (Question No. 1976) Mr Edwards asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 June 2003: (1) How many members of the CMF or Defence Reserve have served more than 6 years but less than 15 years since 1965. (2) How many individual members of the Australian Defence Forces who have served in the following wars and conflicts have not claimed campaign medals or bravery awards to which they are entitled, (a) World War l, (b) World War 2, (c) Korea, (d) Malaya, (e) Borneo, and (f) Vietnam. (3) What steps have been taken to contact these individuals or their next of kin to encourage them to do so. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) This information is not readily available and would require significant departmental resources to research. I am not willing to authorise the diversion of departmental resources dedicated to processing applications for honours and awards, in order to research this information. (2) Refer to part (1). (3) The Federal Government’s commemorations program, Saluting Their Service, honours the contribution of Australia’s servicemen and women in war and conflict. Saluting Their Service, supports commemorative activities and educational programs so that Australians may learn about and acknowledge the events of out wartime years; the significance of those events in shaping our nation; and stories of people who experienced those years, their bravery and suffering. Importantly, the roles played by men and women in local communities throughout Australia in serving out nation can be acknowledged and promoted. Saluting Their Service provides opportunities for communities, organisations and individuals to take an active role in commemoration and to ensure that the service of today’s Australian Defence Force is properly recognised. Further information can be found on the Department of Veteran’s Affairs website at www.dva.gov.au. Attorney-General’s: Audit Reports (Question No. 2032) (1) In respect of ANAO Report No. 45, 2002-03 Reporting of Financial Statements and Audit Reports in Annual Reports, Appendix 1, Table 8, what were the errors identified by the Auditor-General in annual reports of agencies in the Attorney-General’s Portfolio. (2) What action has each agency taken to correct these errors. (1) and (2) The following agencies within the Attorney-General’s portfolio were identified as having errors in their annual reports and have corrected the errors as follows: Attorney-General’s Department The errors identified by the Auditor-General in the 2001-02 Annual Report of the Attorney-General’s Department were: On page 257, in the 2000-01 column, the receivables not overdue figure was shown as $8,644,000. This figure should have been shown as $8,523,000. On page 257, in the 2000-01 column the total receivables not overdue and overdue was shown as $11,711,000. This figure should have been shown as $11,590,000. The errors will be noted and the correct figures included in the section in the Department’s 2002–03 Annual Report dealing with material corrections to the previous year’s annual report. The Department has put into place additional supervisory procedures to ensure that a similar error will not occur in regard to the 2002-03 and future financial year statements. CrimTrac Three errors were identified in CrimTrac’s Annual Report 2001-02 after it was tabled on 22 October 2002. The Chief Executive Officer’s statement in the financial statements section was dated 20 September 2002 when it should have been 20 August 2002, while elsewhere in the same section there were two unnecessary dollar column headers. CrimTrac produced and included an adhesive-backed corrigenda in all reports distributed after the corrected report was tabled in place of the original on 4 March 2003. All reports distributed since then have included the corrigenda. Australian Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre An error was detected in the online version of the Australian Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) Annual Report 2001-02. A list of these errors is provided in Attachment A. Once errors were referred to AUSTRAC, they were immediately rectified. AUSTRAC’s procedures have been reviewed to ensure that errors in the financial statements do not appear in the future. This includes ensuring that an officer outside the Annual Report and Financial Statement compilation team reviews the financial statements in the hardcopy and electronic versions. National Native Title Tribunal An error was identified in the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) audit fee in Note 12 which was misstated as 13,000 with a $000 column heading. The correct figure should have been 13,000 with only $ as the column heading. The error was due to inadequate checking of column headings, in particular,",129,Questions On Notice
181,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 18 June 2003:",131,Questions On Notice
182,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:because the figure was carried over to a new page from the original draft during typesetting. The NNTT will include a correction statement in the 2002-03 Annual Report. Federal Court of Australia A formatting error was identified in the presentation of the Federal Court of Australia’s financial statements on its website. Landscape pages were presented in portrait format. The Federal Court has undertaken the necessary corrective action to rectify the error and has established procedures to address this oversight for future website publications. Australian Federal PoliceA discrepancy was identified in the Australian Federal Police (AFP) Annual Report electronic version on the AFP website. The nature of the discrepancy was the duplication of page 133 and the omission of page 134 in the electronic version. The omitted page contained the audit opinion and signature of the Auditor-General’s delegate. The AFP has incorporated a revised checking procedure into the page conversion process to ensure the integrity of all electronic copy conversions prior to the information being posted to its website. Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner The error in the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner’s Annual Report 2001-2002 relates to the late posting of the Statement of Financial Performance on the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner’s website. The error only occurred in the electronic copy of the Annual Report. The error was corrected on 14 January 2003 when the Statement of Financial Performance was published on the agency’s website. Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia In the printed and electronic versions of the annual report of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) for 2001-02, pages 106 and 107 (which show Note 19C of the financial statements) were published in reverse. The error occurred in the course of preparation for publication. The version of ITSA’s 2001-02 Annual Report on the agency’s website was corrected as soon as it was brought to notice.

Fuel: Petroleum Production (Question No. 2065) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 24 June 2003: Can he provide an estimate of the proportion of Australian petroleum supplies that will be sourced from indigenous reserves by (a) 2005, (b) 2010, and (c) 2020; if so, how confident is he that these estimates are correct; if not, why not. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Notwithstanding that the information which the member seeks is otherwise publicly available, petroleum consists of crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and condensate (a liquid, similar to crude oil, recovered from gas fields). All supplies of both liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas are expected to be sourced from indigenous supplies in the years specified. Future Australian crude oil and condensate production rates at various probability levels are estimated by Geoscience Australia, and future Australian consumption of crude oil and condensate is estimated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), as follows. It should be noted that because of geography and the composition of Australian oil, a large proportion of domestic consumption is met by imported feedstock and similarly a large proportion of Australian production is exported. The proportion of Australian domestic demand quoted below takes into account the net effect of imports and exports. The probability level refers to the chance that production will exceed that number. (a) In 2005: Production from indigenous reserves (at the 50% probability level) is estimated at 452 thousand barrels per day, consumption in Australia is estimated at 771 thousand barrels per day. The proportion sourced from indigenous reserves is 58.6%. (b) In 2010: Production from indigenous reserves (at the 50% probability level) is estimated at 458 thousand barrels per day, consumption in Australia is estimated at 850 thousand barrels per day. The proportion sourced from indigenous reserves is 53.8%. (c) In 2015: Production from indigenous reserves (at the 50% probability level) is estimated at 325 thousand barrels per day, consumption in Australia is estimated at 951 thousand barrels per day. The proportion sourced from indigenous reserves is 34.2%. No estimates for crude oil and condensate production for 2020 are currently available, but a new forecast to 2020 will be finalised this year. The reliability of the production estimates is reflected in the spread of the estimates as different probability levels; for example, the estimates at the 90% and 10% probability levels in 2015 are 215 thousand barrels per day and 475 thousand barrels per day respectively. Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Question No. 2134) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 August 2003: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the critique by Ian Castles and David Henderson of the economic and statistical work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) as published in an ongoing exchange in the journal “Energy and Environment”. (2) Will he ensure that the matters raised in the various articles by Castles and Henderson and the responses from the IPCC Team are analysed by Treasury officials and other relevant Government statistical experts to ensure that emission projections are based on a sound economic and statistical footing. (3) Will Australia take up this issue at the international level to clarify the complex issues involved in time for the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Review (AR4). (4) Will he encourage the national Treasury and statistical officers of other OECD countries to be fully engaged in the development of the economic and statistical work of the IPCC to ensure that uncertainties of this nature do not arise in the future. (1) Yes. (2) Relevant departments and agencies have assessed the matters raised by Castles and Henderson. The Government will continue to examine emissions scenarios issues. (3) Australia is committed to engaging with the IPCC to ensure the continued highest standards of scientific integrity, credibility and usefulness of the IPCC as the authoritative international source of advice on climate change science. In this context, Australia has encouraged further IPCC activity on emissions scenarios leading up to the development of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. (4) Australia will continue to encourage a range of experts both in Australia and other countries to consider these issues. Transport: Roads of National Importance (Question No. 2135) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 August 2003: (1) For each Road of National Importance (RONI) in each State and Territory, what funding is provided in the forward estimates for each year.",131,Questions On Notice
183,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) ‘What funds were allocated to each such road in the 2003 Budget. (3) On what basis did the Government decide not to allocate funding for the Calder Highway in the 2003 Budget. (4) Which roads has the Commonwealth (a) commenced, (b) suspended, (c) ceased funding as a RONI since the introduction of the RONI program in 1996. (5) Does the Government currently designate the Calder Highway as a RONI; if so, (a) for how long will this designation continue, and (b) does designation as a RONI guarantee the Calder Highway 50% funding from the Commonwealth for its upgrade; if not, why not. (6) Will he explain when Auslink will be introduced and in what ways it will replace RONI funding for unfinished road projects currently designated as Roads of National Importance. (7) What funds in each year are allocated for which aspects of the Calder Highway upgrade. (1), (2), (4) (a) The table below sets out annual payments to projects funded under the RONI programme since its inception in 1996, and the funds budgeted for such projects for future years in the 2003-04 roads budget. The forward estimates indicate funding at the programme level and do not separately identify RONI funding.",134,Questions On Notice

(4) Is he aware that Mr Hughson has received information indicating that the National Heritage Trust2 funding for the Landcare Resource Officer position will become available at the end of the transitional funding period. (5) Can he advise whether Mr Hughson’s position will be funded after 30 June 2003. (6) Is he aware of the achievements of the 121 Landcare groups attached to the Lake Macquarie Landcare Resource Office over the three years of the National Heritage Trust1 funding. (7) Is he aware that more than 1,000 community members have regularly volunteered their time over the last twelve months to the Lake Macquarie Landcare group projects and to the Lake Macquarie Landcare Resource Office. (8) Is he aware that a conservative calculation estimated that the value of the volunteer hours in the previous twelve month period for the Lake Macquarie Landcare groups exceeded $1.075 million based on an hourly rate of $15 per hour. (9) Is he aware that at least one of the Rivercare technical officers employed through the Greater Hunter Landcare region has been forced, by economic necessity, to see other employment because of the uncertainty of the release of National Heritage Trust2 funding to support the Rivercare program. (1) The Natural Heritage Trust budget of $250 million in 2002/2003 was fully expended. In 2002-03 I announced, with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, forestry and Fisheries, $20.5 million of interim priority projects in New South Wales. We also announced the funding of facilitator and coordinator positions in New South Wales using $4.25 million of Natural Heritage Trust funds. (2) I understand that Mr Hughson is currently employed as Natural Resource Officer at the Lake Macquarie Landcare Resource Office. (3) In March 2002 the Australian Government announced the extension of 650 facilitator and coordinator positions nationally to June 2003. In the meantime, a review of the network was carried out with the states and territories and the broad community. On completion of the review, my colleague, the Hon Warren Truss MP, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and I released a public statement on future arrangements for facilitators and coordinators. The statement presented an overarching framework for facilitators and coordinators which provides for local level positions, strategic regional positions and State level positions. To ensure a smooth transition to the new framework for facilitators and coordinators in New South Wales, the Australian and State Governments have agreed to extend all current Landcare, Bushcare, Coastcare and Waterwatch positions for up to three months from 1 July 2003. (4) Facilitators and coordinators in NSW will be employed under new arrangements under the second phase of the Trust from 1 October 2003. In addition, in its Budget, the Australian Government has committed $122 million to further strengthening Landcare activities over the next three years. As part of this initiative, my colleague, the Minister For Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, announced on 19 August 2003 funding for up to 70 new State and regional Landcare coordinators across Australia to complement the work of the coordinators funded under the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Mr Hughson can apply for these positions, one of which will be offered in the Central Coast region. (5) Mr Hughson’s position was funded after 30 June as part of an extension of all facilitator and coordinator positions in New South Wales until 30 September 2003. (6) The outstanding achievements of Landcare groups across the country are recognised by the Australian Government, including the achievements of the groups attached to the Lake Macquarie Landcare Resource Office. Funding from the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Landcare Program has contributed significantly to Landcare groups’ achievements.",135,Questions On Notice
185,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) The contribution of volunteers in helping Landcare groups to achieve outstanding outcomes is acknowledged by the Australian Government and will continue to be a key part of the partnership arrangements under the regional approach to natural resource management. (8) The Government recognises and appreciates the very large voluntary contribution of Landcare groups to achieving natural resource management outcomes. (9) I understand that Rivercare projects funded under the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust have reached their planned completion dates. NSW groups will now be responsible for setting regional funding priorities through integrated Natural Resource Management Plans and for determining how many facilitators and coordinators will be employed for the second phase of the Trust. Family Court: Final Orders Matters (Question No. 2147) What was the time taken from filing to hearing date in final orders matters in each Family Court location in each financial year since 1996-97. The Family Court of Australia has provided the annexed table in answer to the honourable member’s question. The annexed table provides a measure of the time taken for the 75th percentile in final orders matters. This means that 75% of cases are dealt with in the time described in the table. This method of expressing various metrics is used by the Court in preference to other measures, such as the median, for technical reasons. It will be noted that the information has not been provided for the years 1996-97 and 1997-98. The Family Court has advised that this is due to the fact that during that time the Court operated a legacy computer system that has been replaced. Furthermore, the counting method for delay, waiting time and similar metrics has changed since that time and accordingly the information for the two earlier years specified is not comparable with the figures from 1998-99.",141,Questions On Notice

(2) During 2001/2002 the Judge and the trial work for Dandenong were transferred to the Melbourne Registry Television: Surprise Weddings Program (Question No. 2148) (1) Is he aware of a television program titled Surprise Weddings broadcast on Channel7 in Sydney. (2) Has he obtained advice regarding the compatibility of that program and the requirements of the Marriage Act 1961. (3) Does he intend to take any steps to correct the public record as to the procedures involved in engaging an authorised Marriage Celebrant to conduct a marriage service. (1) Yes, I am aware of the program. (2) I understand that there was a disclaimer at the end of the program to which the honourable member refers, to the effect that all marriages performed on the show were symbolic and that legal marriages would subsequently be arranged for the couples. Hence, in fact, the couples were not legally married on the program. It is likely that this disclaimer would not have been observed by many viewers. I am advised that the marriage celebrant who participated in the program was not one appointed by the Commonwealth. He was a minister of religion of a recognised denomination under the Marriage Act 1961 and appointed by the New South Wales Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. (3) The program does give rise to a number of issues of concern. There are certain legal requirements to be followed prior to, during and after a wedding ceremony to ensure that a marriage is valid. For example, the Marriage Act requires that a couple intending to get married provide to an authorised marriage celebrant a Notice of Intended Marriage. This must be provided at least one month before the intended marriage. This notice requirement enables the parties to reflect on their decision to marry and to avail themselves of relationship education services. It is possible that the program may have misled people into thinking that there is no notice period for marriage. It is also possible that the circumstances of the program could result in people feeling pressured into agreeing to marriage. Receiving a proposal of marriage before a large audience would certainly place a degree of pressure on the surprised party to agree. It is important that all marriages are entered into with the full and free consent of both parties. In September 2002 the Attorney-General’s Department notified marriage celebrants appointed by the Commonwealth that it is inappropriate to be involved in ceremonies of this sort because of the concerns mentioned above. The website of the Attorney-General’s Department also clearly sets out the notice requirements for marriage. The Department keeps this matter under review and will consider sending out further material warning against participation in such ceremonies should it prove necessary.

190,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Foreign Affairs, Upon Notice, On 11 August 2003:",,144,Questions On Notice
191,Mr Downer,"the answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :(1) I understand that the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq considers any review of Iraq’s labour laws as a matter for a future Iraqi government to address. The International Labour Organisation issued a press release on 28 March (available on the internet at http://www.ilo.org/public/english/ bureau/inf/pr/2003/14.htm) declaring its readiness to participate in Iraq’s post-conflict rehabilitation. While the ILO does not yet have any permanent international staff in Iraq, it is preparing a needs assessment, based on the findings of an expert mission to Iraq prior to the conflict. This study will form the basis of the ILO’s input into the broader United Nations planning process for Iraq, including the international donors’ conference to take place in Madrid on 24 October. The ILO’s needs assessment will address future ILO priorities for technical assistance to Iraq. (2) Given the work already being undertaken by the ILO to address labour and employment issues in Iraq, there is no need for the Australian Government to take steps to ensure a role for the ILO in assisting Iraq. Barton Electorate: Program Funding (Question No. 2167) Services, upon notice, on 11 August 2003: (1) What programs have been introduced, continued or renewed by the Minister’s Department in the electoral division of Barton since March 1996. (2) What grants and/or benefits have been provided to individuals, businesses and organisations by the Minister’s Department in the electoral division of Barton since 1996. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) What programs have been introduced, continued or renewed by the Minister’s Department in the electoral division of Barton since March 1996. Note: The Department of Family and Community Services maintains records on funded programs on a financial rather than a calendar year basis.

(2) What grants and/or benefits have been provided to individuals, businesses and organisations by the Minister’s Department in the electoral division of Barton since 1996 A summary of the community organisations and businesses in the electoral division of Barton that have received funding from the Department of Family and Community Services since 1996 appears in the tables below. Part2 of this question on notice seeks personal information about individual recipients of Australian Government funding. This information is not provided as to do so may be regarded as unreasonable disclosure of their personal information. Information about organisations that are funded to deliver Australian Government programs falls under the gambit of “commercial-in-confidence” or “business affairs”. To disclose such information about organisations that receive funding of less than $100 000 per year may unreasonably affect their commercial or financial affairs. Therefore, information is only provided about organisations receiving more than $100 000 per year under each program. Note: The Department of Family and Community Services maintains records on funded programs on a financial rather than a calendar year basis. The answer to this part of the honourable member’s question provides the requested information for each financial year that covers the calendar years since 1996. The information is provided on a program basis and it is possible that some of the organisations, businesses or individuals listed have received funding under more than one program.

United Nations: Multilateral Treaties (Question No. 2185) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 August 2003: Would he identify each of the multilateral treaties deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and open for signature that Australia is not (a) a signatory to, (b) has not ratified, and (c) has not given effect to through domestic legislation. (a) (b) and (c) Since the creation of the United Nations, successive Australian governments have chosen to take action on UN multilateral treaties that are recorded in all 29 chapters of the Status Lists of Multilateral Treaties deposited with the Secretary-General. These chapters include details of treaties Australia has not signed and has not ratified. Decisions to sign or to take binding treaty action through the years have been taken in the national interest. Successive Australian governments have had the policy of ratifying treaties only where they can be given effect domestically, including through legislation. The work required to answer the honourable member’s question would involve a significant diversion of resources within the department and I am not prepared to authorise the use of these resources. The information requested is available publicly, and may be obtained from the website of the United Nations at http://untreaty.un.org/.

195,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Foreign Affairs, Upon Notice, On 11 August 2003:","(1) The Government has taken a number of measures to fulfil its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (28 September 2001). Most of those measures fall primarily within the Attorney-General’s portfolio. Within my portfolio, the Government has implemented a terrorist asset freezing regime through amending Part4 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945, and enacting the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2002. The Government has also ratified core UN conventions on terrorism, including, in 2002, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. (2) The Nasonini Declaration required Pacific island countries to take steps to implement internationally agreed anti-terrorism measures, such as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 and the Financial Action Task Force Special Recommendations, including associated reporting requirements. Draft model legislation under the Nasonini Declaration prepared by the Nasonini Implementation Expert Working Group was tabled at the August 2003 Forum. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat has advised that in-country drafting assistance, by legal drafters who have drafted the model provisions, will be available to individual Forum Island Countries to implement the legislative provisions upon their request. Australia is continuing to work with the Secretariat and other nations and organisations to pursue these matters.

(2) Does the SES index-based supplementary funding have the perverse effect of providing extra funding to private schools attended by children from high socio-economic status families when the school is located in an area with a lower socioeconomic status; if so, what will he do to ensure children from low income families from the same area attend well-resourced neighbourhood schools; if not, will he explain how the funding system avoids these perverse outcomes.",157,Questions On Notice
200,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow(3) Does the Government intend to discontinue the SES index method of supplementary funding to wealthy private schools and (a) cooperate with State governments to redirect these resources to poorer public, catholic and other non-government schools and (b) limit the application of the SES index-based funding to non-boarding students only; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) The SES model does not set out to measure the wealth of any individual household or school, but rather to rank school communities relative to each other. As the SES index measures the education, occupation and income levels of all the residents within a Census Collection District (CD), both high and low-income families have an impact on the SES scores of the CDs in which they reside. Expert advice to the Department of Education, Science and Training is that the collective CD SES profile for a school’s student population (including boarding students) is sufficiently representative to assess the school’s need relative to other schools. (2) A school’s SES score is based on the areas from which it draws its students not from its physical location. Schools that draw students from areas of predominantly high SES receive lower levels of funding than schools which draw from areas of average or low SES. (3) (a) The Government’s primary objective in school funding is to achieve a quality education for all Australian students and it works cooperatively with State and Territory governments to secure better educational outcomes from schooling in both the government and non-government sectors. The Government proposes to continue the SES funding arrangements for the 2005-08 quadrennium. (b) The SES methodology is not designed to produce an SES score representative of any particular family within a school community, but rather to calculate an average score based on all the CDs from which a school draws its students. As the SES index measures both social disadvantage as well as social advantage, all of a school’s students, including boarders, must contribute to the SES calculation if the validity of the measure is to be preserved. It should be noted that the Tasmanian Government applies the Australian Government’s SES methodology to distribute State funds to non-government schools in Tasmania. Child Support Agency: Debt (Question No. 2304) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 2003: (1) What was the sum of outstanding child support debt in each of the financial years ended (a) 1997, (b) 1998, (c) 1999, (d) 2000, (e) 2001, (f) 2002, and (g) 2003. (2) What is the sum of child support debt that the Child Support Agency (CSA) has failed to collect. (3) Has any of the child support debt owed to the CSA been written off; if so, (a) how much, and (b) for what reasons. (4) Is the CSA adequately resourced to discharge its functions; if not, why not. (5) What is the Government doing to ensure that child support entitlements are paid and received on time. (1) The cumulative value of gross maintenance child support debt for each year between 1997 and 2003 is: (a) $516.6 million by June 1997 (b) $544.3 million by June 1998",158,Questions On Notice
201,Dr Nelson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,159,Questions On Notice
202,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(c) $582.8 million by June 1999 (d) $634.7 million by June 2000 (e) $669.7 million by June 2001 (f) $758.7 million by June 2002 (g) $844.1 million by June 2003 These figures are cumulative, that is they represent the total value of child support debt at the end of each year since the Scheme commenced operation in 1988. The figures for 2001 and subsequent years also include child support liabilities that are being collected on behalf of other countries. (2) The CSA had not collected $844.1 million out of a total $14.3 billion in child support liabilities as at the end of June 2003. This means that 5.9 per cent of liabilities have not been collected since Scheme inception. (3) The above amounts are the total amounts owed without any write-offs or any allowance for bad or doubtful debts. (4) Yes, the CSA is funded in line with a funding agreement with the Department of Finance. That agreement provides funding in line with the growth in cases. The agreement expires in June 2004. (5) To address the growth in debt and to streamline and strengthen the services CSA delivers to parents, a National Collection Strategy was developed in 2002-03. The strategy brings a stronger focus to CSA collections and debt reduction activities. Furthermore, the additional funding of $31 million over four years announced in the recent budget will give the CSA increased resources to collect this child support. It is expected that over 105 000 children will benefit from the measure as an additional $130 million of child support is anticipated to be transferred from non-compliant payers through intensive collection activity. Transport: Roads of National Importance (Question No. 2314) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 August 2003: (1) In respect of the Peel Deviation, (a) what design and planning work has been undertaken, and (b) what is the estimated cost of the project. (2) Has any money been allocated in the financial years (a) 2003-2004, (b) 2004-2005 or (c) 20052006 for the project. (3) Does the government regard the Peel Deviation as a potential Road of National Importance: if so, would the Commonwealth be prepared to finance 50% of the cost of the project. (1) (a) Main Roads Western Australia advise that planning activities associated with defining a reservation for the Peel Deviation have been completed and a reserve set aside in the Peel Region Scheme. This is a strategic land-use plan for the Peel Region. Detailed environmental assessments and a Public Environmental Review Report have been completed. Environmental clearance of the project has subsequently been granted subject to adherence to the Main Roads commitments and conditions of approval. Negotiations are in progress with the Aboriginal community in regard to Aboriginal heritage clearance. Concept road designs have been completed but are being updated. It is expected that preliminary design will commence this year. Analysis of bridge waterways are nearly complete and bridge concept design is expected to commence soon.",159,Questions On Notice
