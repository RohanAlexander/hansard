The Government is particularly concerned to see the development of Aboriginal health professionals-doctors, dentists, nurses and para-professionals. Special measures may be needed to encourage Aboriginal students to go on to such training and Commonwealth Departments will take what steps appear appropriate. Beyond the measures needed to train and employ suitably qualified Aboriginal people as health professionals, there is also a need to employ Aboriginal people in administrative and clerical positions, at all levels in Commonwealth and State authorities which have responsibilities in relation to Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth Government has taken several steps to ensure these objectives are met and will commend a similar approach to the States. Recommendations Response/comment 13.

(4) The leasing of immovable property to taxable persons is a taxable transaction. This allows the lessee a deduction for tax paid to the lessor. (5) The 'zero rate' treats the taxable item as incurring a rate of zero on its sale, but allows a credit for tax paid on purchases. Thus an item taxed at a rate of zero bears no tax. This is in contrast to an exempt transaction where no tax is charged on the sale, but no deduction or credit is allowed for tax paid on purchases. (6) The normal rate of VAT generally applicable to all taxable transactions is 19 per cent on the taxable base including the VA T itself. Thus the effective rate is 23.46 per cent on the taxable base excluding VAT itself. (7) As at 1978.
