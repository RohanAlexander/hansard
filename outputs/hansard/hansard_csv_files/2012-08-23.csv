Thursday, 23 August 2012 Petition: Human Trafficking petition from about 2,914 signatures on behalf of the Uniting Church of Australia. The petition seeks to condemn the practice of human trafficking and prevent people continuing to be bought and sold. Human trafficking is the acquisition of people by improper means, such as force or such as fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them. This petition has been brought to my attention by Dr Mark Zirnsak, Director the Justice and International Mission unit of the Uniting Church of Australia. The petition promotes the need for a consistent approach to compensation for survivors of human trafficking in Australia. This would be the fulfilment of article 6.6 of the Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which states: Each State Party shall ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered. In order to be compliant with the international obligations Australia has accepted, it should either create a compensation scheme at the federal level for survivors or ensure survivors of human trafficking can receive compensation under current state systems. In contemplating this petition, one of the testimonies of someone who is actually on the petition is mentioned and recorded by the project research-one of the people who had been trafficked: 'We were made to feel like animals. Customers were violent. Some of the customers were crazy. They treated us like animals. We were sexually abused, we were drugged, we were hit. Some of us were given drugs so we could work all the time. Some of the women we know have become drug addicts and now they have to keep doing prostitution to pay for drugs.' Virtually every country in the world is affected by crime such as this, and I would like to point out that on 13 August 2012 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon. Bob Carr, asked the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to inquire into and report on slavery, slavery-like conditions and people-trafficking. The committee invites interested persons and organisations to make submissions addressing the terms of reference by Friday, 28 September 2012. The trade of men, women and children through force or coercion is one of the fastest growing criminal activities in the world, and as I understand it the committee wants to examine Australia's efforts to combat the problem. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million people worldwide are victims of this crime, and 1.2 million of these are children. International efforts to tackle the problem will also be examined. Australia has not escaped this serious form of exploitation-between 2004 and 2011 over 300 investigations and assessments of human trafficking and slavery offences were conducted by the Australian Federal Police. Thirteen convictions resulted. In the time.

178,Mr Byrne (Holt) (09:34,"I rise today to discuss and present later the Stop the TraffikThe petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: In 2005 Australia ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. Article 6.6 of the Protocol states: Each State Party shall ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damaged suffered. However, Australia has failed to provide direct avenues for survivors to pursue compensation. While Australia has recognised that there have been over 175 victims of human trafficking to Australia since 2004, only a handful have been able to obtain compensation through State Government crimes compensation schemes. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: Fulfil Australia's international obligation through the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children to provide compensation to survivors of human trafficking as victims of a serious crime. This should be done through a legislated Commonwealth compensation scheme for the purpose unless an adequate alternative arrangement can be made. from 2,914 citizens Petition received. Flynn Electorate: Dairy Farming Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (09:37): I rise today to support the dairy farmers of Central Queensland. I recently met with representatives of the Port Curtis Milk Suppliers Cooperative Association in the North Burnett region of Flynn. The Deputy Premier of Queensland, Mr Jeff Seeney, and I attended that meeting, where we were briefed on the extremely difficult situation that is facing their industry at the present time. Prices per litre of milk are declining for farmers in Flynn and right across Queensland-and probably the rest of Australia. This can be attributed to issues such as ever-increasing input costs, but predominantly the biggest threat is coming from the recent price wars between our major supermarkets, Woolworths and Coles. This issue not only threatens the future of the dairy industry in Queensland but goes to the heart of issues of food security in our home state. Since 1999-2000 the number of dairy farmers in Port Curtis has declined by 64 per cent, and milk production has decreased by 59 per cent over that period from 70 million litres to 30 million litres. Port Curtis Milk Suppliers Co-op identifies the key causes of this reduction as follows: suppressed prices, environmental factors such as drought and floods, rising costs of production, a carbon tax on the input cost and supermarket price wars. Generic labelling of milk-$2 for two litres-is identified as being the single biggest problem for the industry. Central Queensland dairy farmers are vital to the local economies of many towns in the regional areas of Flynn-Monto, Wondai, Biloela et cetera. A dairy farm often supports several families. Farmers habitually purchase everything from tractors to feed for livestock from local suppliers and are therefore a vital part of any community. Once the farmer is out of the industry it is most unlikely that they can return to dairy production-they are lost forever. The Port Curtis dairy factory in Rockhampton relies totally on milk from around the region and it is also a big employer of people. Australia produces five billion litres surplus every year-five billion litres are exported. So the production is there. Queensland produces five per cent of Australian milk supplies. Queensland will need to increase its dairy production by 22 per cent by 2020 just on growth rates in Queensland. The dairy industry in Central Queensland is absolutely vital to our regional communities and the security of our food supply as we continue to grow. It is an absolute imperative that we have a dairy industry in Central Queensland. Therefore, I implore this government to appreciate the needs of such industries, and I also implore the people of Australia to genuinely support their local farmers. Makin Electorate: VIEW Club Gully VIEW club-one of two VIEW clubs in the Makin electorate; the other being the Golden Grove club. VIEW stands for Voice, Interest and Education of Women. I understand that there are about 400 VIEW clubs nationwide with a total membership of about 20,000. The Tea Tree Gully club was formed around 12 years ago and has grown to 84 members. True to its name, the club provides an excellent forum for giving voice to and broadening the interests of local women. In addition, the club actively supports deserving community groups and engages in much fundraising in order to do so. I particularly commend VIEW clubs around Australia for their support of the Smith Family charity organisation. What particularly caught my interest at the meeting were the four resolutions that VIEW club members throughout the country were being asked to consider and vote on, they being, firstly: VIEW clubs of Australia call on the Australian government to implement the recommendations in the Gonski report to achieve rural equality in educational opportunity for all Australian children; secondly, VIEW clubs of Australia call on the federal and state governments to develop a long-term national housing plan which is gender aware and responsive to combat Australia's housing affordability crisis; thirdly, VIEW clubs of Australia resolve that the importance of the Advance Health Directive document be promoted and that a nationally recognised advance health directive form be made readily available in appropriate public places throughout Australia; and, fourthly, that VIEW clubs of Australia lobby the state and federal governments to initiate an opt-out or presumed consent regulation whereby organs may be removed from a diseased person for the purpose of transplantation if they have not expressed an objection to donating their organs. The arguments for and against each proposition were clearly summarised to assist members with their decision. Each of these resolutions deal with very important contemporary social issues. Unlike governments and politicians, VIEW club members considering the four propositions are not constrained by political or budgetary consequences and therefore are likely to reflect more accurately community attitudes on these matters. I urge decision makers to take note of the VIEW club members' responses to the four propositions, as a poll of 20,000 members should not be dismissed. I also acknowledge the meeting's guest speaker of the day, well-known and respected ABC personality David Bevan, who provided an entertaining and fascinating insight into his radio career and the background work that goes into preparing each program. I am grateful for David's presence as it was good to have a fellow male at an otherwise all-women's event. I thank President Helen Allen and Tea Tree Gully VIEW club members for the community",131,Constituency Statements
179,Mr Zappia (Makin) (09:40,"On Friday, 3 AugustI attended the meeting of the Tea Treework that the club engages in and for the warm reception I have received when I have attended their meetings. I also wish VIEW club members well with their upcoming national conference. Aston Electorate: Community Groups disadvantaged residents of my electorate for a meal put on by the Foothills Community Care. This is a church-based organisation that runs a program called the Mountain Gates Meals Night. Every Tuesday night it provides about 40 meals for people who are very isolated and very lonely and who often struggle to afford to feed themselves. It is a terrific program that they put on. There were 30 or 40 people having a meal there and I sat down with them. It was actually quite joyous. People were happy. They were pleased to be there and connect with others. For some, I think, it was one of the main forms of connection with others that they have. I commend the organisers of the Mountain Gate Meals Night for putting this on. They do so voluntarily without any government assistance. I particularly commend Reverend Steve Barrington, the program director, Andy Philips, and the coordinators, Donna Krenn and Greg Krenn, for the work that they do in this regard. My electorate is blessed with fantastic local community organisations such as this one. Many are church based, but many are not. They provide tremendous support and service to people in need. They provide the types of things which the nation state can never provide here from Canberra. We as parliamentarians should always support such organisations and do what we can to give them whatever support that we can. Of course, these organisations create tremendous community spirit, as well as serving the need. The volunteers go there to serve those people in need but they serve not only the people in immediate need but also the broader community. Sometimes we bemoan the fact that we are becoming a consumer society, but what we actually do know is that real happiness and satisfaction comes from the relationships that we form and from service to others. This is a terrific example of that. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Schools in Caulfield after the Education Act of 1872, giving children access to free education. It gave me great pride to be part of the government who helps continue this legacy of giving first class education to children regardless of means or background when on 6 AugustI opened their new multipurpose hall, the last of my BER programs. Under the National School Pride Program, the school invested $76,000 in the refurbishment of buildings and playgrounds, and $807,000 for its new multipurpose hall. Far from the denigration the program received from certain quarters, the hall is now used for assemblies, presentations, performing arts, a tuck shop, instrumental tuition, meetings and community occasions. Previously the kids of Caulfield Primary met in the garden or had to take over the library, where all 200 kids could not fit. The Australian government's Building the Education Revolution, as we know, spent $16.2 billion-the single biggest investment in government schools in Australian historyincluding $65 million across 36 schools in Melbourne Ports.

181,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (09:45,"Caulfield Primary was the first school to be builtMelbourne Ports, our students can now use new libraries, science labs, multipurpose halls and above all classrooms. In my electorate, we have a growing population. We have had to have a redistribution, because we have got so many people concertina-ing into the particularly beautiful part of Melbourne where I live. The pressure on classrooms has been well handled in the government, Catholic and independent sectors. I particularly want to praise Caulfield Primary for its Japanese language program, led by Miho Suzuki-Bevan and her dedicated team. The school is one of only 11 bilingual schools in Victoria. It is wonderful to see primary school students at a government school learning a foreign language, in this case Japanese. When I was at the Japanese school last year, I opened their BER building and cited the importance of education in Japanese culture. This is exemplified by the high ranking adviser to the Nagaoka clan, Torasaburo Kobayashi, in the play One Hundred Sacks of Rice, by Yuzo Yamamoto: 'The spirit of one hundred sacks of rice'. This is the Japanese attitude to education that I think is seen in both of these schools. The prosperity of a country, the growth of cities, everything, depends on people. Build schools and develop people of ability. Caulfield Primary's motto, 'Learn, create and participate', embodies this. It is an honour to represent in the federal parliament today such a fine, dedicated, small but passionate school. I want to thank the principal of Caulfield Primary, Peter Gray, and everyone who worked hard to deliver this important projectschool staff, parents, tradespeople and the wider community. Their efforts have improved Caulfield Primary School's facilities, as the facilities at all of the schools in Melbourne Ports have been improved. They have been very carefully supervised by their federal member! Mining: Olympic Dam of South Australia. It was a day of economic infamy yesterday in my home state, when BHP announced that due to increased pressure on them in relation to capital expenditure and the downturn in commodity prices they would not be proceeding with the expansion of the Olympic Dam mine up in Roxby Downs in South Australia. This, of course, has been the project that the state Labor government has been spruiking for some 10 years as the great saviour for the South Australian economy. In part, they were right to have been spruiking that, because the project itself in its construction phase alone would have created some 10,000 additional jobs in South Australia, with a huge economic flow-on, giving South Australia a real leg-up for the future. Sadly, for months and months and months, BHP, Rio Tinto, the Minerals Council and other organisations, as well as some in the federal parliament, have been raising concerns about the increasing cost of doing business in Australia, making it harder for companies like BHP to go ahead with these investments to create the circumstances for prosperity in states like South Australia. We saw the outcome of that yesterday, when the BHP board decided not to proceed at this time with the current project and indeed to recalibrate the project. It is very sad that Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, and his little sidekick, the resources minister, who have been assuring South Australians for months that this would not be the case and that this project would go ahead, have been completely blindsided by their federal colleagues and the appalling way that the federal Labor Party is managing the economy.",134,Constituency Statements
182,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (09:48,"I rise on a matter of extreme importance to my home stateJac Nasser, the Chairman of BHP, made very clear in May this year that there were four factors that were impacting on investment decisions in Australia, making Australia a highcost economy. We hear these members over here on the Labor side, who have no care for the people of South Australia, and they sit there and put their carbon tax on, they put their mining tax on, they reregulate the labour market and they make it harder for investment to be made in South Australia and in our country, and this will be the legacy of your government. The legacy of the Gillard-Rudd government will be that there is less investment-this lack of investment in the mining sector. When big companies like BHP, who are worldwide companies, look to invest across the globe, cost factors in one of those countries impact, and they have impacted on us; they have impacted on South Australia. Long be the shame on the federal Labor government for delaying this project and for delaying the benefits that would have flowed to my state through this investment from BHP, all because of the Gillard Labor government and its policies. Robertson Electorate: Aged Care Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (09:51): In contrast to that vitriolic, relentless negativity that we have heard, I have a few things to celebrate that are happening in the Australian populationMs O'NEILL: Well yes, but perhaps we need to get on with the positive things that are being done. Australians need that kind of leadership. In July, the seniors in my electorate had a great opportunity to be part of the discussions about how aged-care services will be delivered in the coming years. More than 45 locals turned out to speak with the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, during his visit to the coast, to tell him what the system should look like and how it should run to provide the best care possible for our older Australians. This was the second visit by the minister to my electorate to discuss matters for aged-care, and he had about 100 who attended on the very first occasion as well. It is a testament to our community that so many people have taken part in these important dialogues with the federal government, to ensure that future generations of older Australians are able to enjoy the best standard of living possible. During his visit, the minister also boosted Home and Community Care funding by nearly $1 million so that seniors in Robertson will receive more support to stay in their homes. WhatI hear from seniors on the coast is that they want to be able to stay at home for as long as possible, if not for the rest of their lives. It means so much to be able to stay independent and continue to look after ourselves as we age, and being able to stay somewhere familiar, such as the family home, is an important part of that. This funding means that more people on the peninsula and across Robertson will be able to access a range of domestic assistance, personal care, social support and respite to help them avoid a premature move to residential care. These are practical solutions from a Labor government committed to helping older Australians. I am proud to acknowledge the work of Coastlink, led by Lynne Rainford, as one of the eight local organisations that will benefit from this injection of funding, and I look forward to seeing the great results that will come from this much-needed investment. I thank the minister for spending time in our beautiful part of the world and for taking time to listen to the Central Coast community and to provide real assistance where needed.",135,Constituency Statements
183,Honourable Members Interjecting,"I also want to take the time remaining to me to acknowledge the work of two amazing women on the Central Coast, Tamika Dwight-Scott and Melissa Crozier. About a year ago, they set up a health and wellness centre in East Gosford. They were setting it up as a business, but they found that they had clients coming to them-women who were coming particularly out of terrible situations of domestic violence, who needed health and wellness, and needed some care, at that time when often they were at their least able to pay for that care. What they have done in one year is extraordinary. They have set up a charity and they have worked with local groups, including the Lionesses of East Gosford, to create a business with the support of the community that supports this wonderful, qualified place for people to go to seek assistance at a time when they are in incredible need. Collectively, Tamika and Melissa combine a range of therapies to offer an effective treatment for clients who experience distress or trauma, which could include recovering from cancer. They are amazing women doing fantastic things in Robertson. (Time expired) Bradfield Electorate: F3 to M2 Link electorate of Bradfield to relieve the severely overloaded Pennant Hills Road and the Pacific Highway, to improve journey times for those travelling between Sydney and the Central Coast and to deliver safety and amenity benefits to local residents. Pennant Hills Road is part of the designated National Highway, and it is the current link between the M2 and the F3. It is consistently one of the slowest, most unsafe and heavily trafficked arterial roads in New South Wales. Key design principles for the F3-M2 missing link have been identified and worked on over the last decade. The 2004 study by Sinclair Knight Merz identified air quality, alternative transport options and noise impacts as the areas the community wanted to be scrutinised. The SKM study found the project is capable of delivering positive benefits in each area, including reduced noise for 94 per cent of residents and air quality improvements by removing stopstart conditions and allowing ventilation of emissions. The most recently published New South Wales government estimate of the cost of this new road is $4.75 billion, so a project of this scale is likely to require funding from the New South Wales and federal governments as well as private sector involvement. Recently an unsolicited proposal from private motorway operator Transurban was provided to the New South Wales government for a possible F3 to M2 motorway tunnel link underneath Pennant Hills Road. This announcement does not commit either the New South Wales government or Transurban to the project, but it is encouraging that assessment of the project will now continue to a second stage, with the parties to work together over the next six months. Obviously the New South Wales government needs to carefully assess this proposal to determine if it delivers value for money. I want to put on the record my belief that private sector involvement such as that offered by Transurban offers the potential for the F3-M2 missing link to come to reality more quickly than if it were left to be wholly funded by government. The experience with other roads in the Sydney area such as the M2 and M7 supports this belief. Unfortunately, neither New South Wales Labor nor federal Labor delivered the F3-M2 missing link. In the 2011 federal budget Labor removed from the forward budget estimates $150 million which had previously been set aside for a feasibility study at initial planning work into the F3-M2 missing link.",136,Constituency Statements
184,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (09:54,"The M2-F3 missing link is greatly needed in myThe Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese, continues to provide a murky picture of where the government stands on this funding. In a recent radio interview following the budget, he made the vague claim that $150 million was still available for the link, although it is clear from last year's budget that it was removed from the forward estimates and where it sits in this year's budget is nowhere to be found. I again call upon the minister to provide clarity as to whether his government is committing $150 million to the F3 to M2 link and, at the same time, I call upon the New South Wales government to assess the private sector proposal carefully and express my view that properly managed private sector involvement could deliver a more rapid outcome than if it is left solely to government. Canberra Electorate: Defence Housing Australia Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (09:57): I rise today to talk about the Defence Housing Australia development of new dwellings for Australian Defence Force personnel in Weston Creek, which is part of my electorate. There are eight suburbs in Weston Creek. The region was conceived as housing for 34,000 people and, at the last census in 2006, the population was put at 22,886. For those not familiar with this part of Canberra, Weston Creek has been described by a former planning authority as being one of the most picturesque parts of the national capital. Currently Weston Creek is home to the Australian Defence College's Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies and the Australian Command and Staff College Centre. DHA wants to develop 73 allotments for single dwelling lots and three multi-unit sites and wants to build houses for Defence families on 50 of these lots. As of 1 February this year there were 240 Defence families in private rental accommodation, and that proportion is about 13 per cent within the Defence and DHA target of 15 per cent. This project will help DHA ensure that the current private proportion of Defence families in the ACT who use private rental accommodation does not exceed that 15 per cent threshold. DHA will ensure that the dwellings are built to silver level core-liveable-housing design elements to ensure appropriate disability access and that they will also achieve a minimum six-star energy efficiency rating as certified by an independent accredited assessor. I understand the proposed development also complies with the North Weston concept plan and the deed of agreement developed by ACTPLA. This proposed development was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. In my submission to the committee I registered my support for the proposal. BeforeI wrote my submission I met with the DHA and I was delighted to see that the sustainable development provided in the proposal factored in the environment, public and private transport, growth and the need for quality community services. When I wrote my submission I had been advised by DHA that there had been extensive consultation with the local community. However, as the committee's report makes clear, and as I later found out, that was not the case. The committee received four submissions. While the need for development was made clear and the proposed scope of the works was also deemed suitable to meet the needs, and the committee was satisfied that the projected cost of $39 million was adequately assessed, there were significant concerns about the consultation process. The committee commented that it would be to DHA's advantage to engage in initial notification to all near neighbours, followed by widespread and ongoing consultation on all current and future projects, regardless of whether or not such neighbours might have anticipated concerns. The committee also encouraged DHA to monitor feedback and stated that it was critical that DHA engage in widespread proactive and ongoing consultation with stakeholders. I maintain my support for this development. However, I am displeased about the level of consultation and strongly encourage DHA to heed the committee's recommendations on consultation. (Time expired) Battle of Long Tan fought in the historic Battle of Long Tan, a campaign that should never be forgotten in Australia's war history. Saturday, 18 August 2012 marked the 46th anniversary of when Australian platoons, numbering 108, were attacked by a force estimated to be more than 2,000. The bravery and resolve of the fighting spirit that Australian troops showed on that day is renowned. Such was the fighting spirit of our troops that, despite being outnumbered, our soldiers forced and advanced the enemy back and we held our position. The Battle of Long Tan claimed the lives of only 18 soldiers and 24 were wounded. I commend each and every soldier for their service. I also take this opportunity to recognise the service and the dedication of our Vietnam veterans. Australia's military involvement in the Vietnam War was the longest of any war in Australia's history and one that I hope will never be repeated. As proud Australians we reflect and remember the 500 Australians killed and the 3,129 wounded during this conflict. As a federal member of parliament and a father I feel it is a personal burden when our troops go to conflict zones around the world to assist and uphold our beliefs and the security of our nation. I pay my respects to the families and friends of our soldiers for their support. I would also like to acknowledge the soldiers who were unable to return or who did not return from the Battle of Long Tan and the Vietnam War, as well as the veterans who are still here with us today. I was fortunate enough to attend a recent memorial morning service in Beaudesert and a dinner in Jimboomba to mark these occasions. I would like to recognise some of the RSL identities who work so hard for their colleagues and their local communities. These include the Beaudesert RSL President Errol Guilfoyle; Senior Vice-President Peter Higgins; President of the Jimboomba RSL sub-branch, Jim Short; plus notables such as Sandy Lloyd, Brett McCreadie, Don Pidgeon, Marcus Bruty and Gavin Thurlow. They work tirelessly in ensuring the community is aware and able to commemorate important military dates such as the Battle of Long Tan and Veterans Day. There are parts in our military history that we as a nation should not be proud of. The way that we welcomed back our Vietnam veterans is a blight on our history books. I am proud that we as a nation have matured when troops now return from battles, which we currently have with the conflict in areas of Afghanistan and the Middle East, and that we do share a more heroic and thankful attribute with those brave men and women who serve and who offer a",137,Constituency Statements

Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (10:04): It gives me great pleasure to speak to the report, Discussion paper on late effects of polio/post-polio syndrome, which was tabled in the House on Monday. I see some of my colleagues from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing here. This was an issue that we all felt very passionate about. We met with a group of people who, for a long time, had had their needs ignored and their voices not heard. I hope that, as a result of the roundtable we had and the discussion paper we have issued, this will lead to them having a more powerful voice and their issues being considered by government. This issue was first brought to my attention when I visited a constituent who was suffering the effects of postpolio syndrome, or the late effects of polio-either of those descriptions are used in relation to it. As she had aged, the impacts of the polio she had had when she was younger had resurfaced and become a lot greater. She had muscle weakness, and the normal ageing process of having a little bit of arthritis was extenuated. She was finding it really difficult to function around the house, and it was only because she had a very supportive environment within the home that she was able to do so. I want to acknowledge the member for Parkes. He and I are both patrons and have been very involved in this issue over a period of time. It became really obvious to us that there was a large group of people who had suffered from polio, who had been victims of the virus that swept across our country right up until the 1960s. They had had treatment and had gone on with their lives but, as they had aged, the effects of it came back. It was also very obvious that GPs and other health professionals were not aware of the impact of it. Some of the medication given to people who have similar sorts of symptoms, even anaesthetics given to people with postpolio syndrome, can actually be fatal. There was this great lack of knowledge about the impact of the late effects of polio. We held a roundtable in Melbourne, and I particularly want to acknowledge a couple of people who were involved in that. Firstly, I want to acknowledge Dr John Tierney OAM, National Patron of Polio Australia and former Liberal Party senator of this parliament. He has really shown to me his great concerns about this issue. In fact, he is a sufferer of the late effects of polio. He is very passionate about this issue. Secondly, I want to acknowledge Gillian Thomas, President, Polio Australia, who is confined to a wheelchair and has a number of side effects of the late onset of polio. As she has aged, she had found it more difficult but is still a very vital, dynamic woman who is out there arguing for polio and its effects to be",139,Constituency Statements
186,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"Order! In accordance with standing orderrecognised. You suffer the acute stage and then, later in life, you suffer the effects, to a lesser degree but in a very debilitating way. I think that, as a nation, we need to look at this issue and at getting some evidence on the table in relation to it. The committee made three recommendations, and I will come to them a bit later. One of the things that I thought were overwhelming was the lack of information about polio and the number of people who are affected by it. I learned that, when medical students are being trained, they learn nothing about the late effects of polio. This matter needs to be addressed at a medical level. I would encourage urban divisions, Medicare Locals to actually get the information out to medical practitioners-and this is mentioned in our recommendations-so they know it exists and that there are appropriate supports and treatments that need to be put in place and that it is not just a normal part of the ageing process. It is not a normal part of the ageing process and that needs to be recognised. Not only do doctors need to be educated but the whole of the community. There needs to be information given to community organisations that there is this group of people who need special assistance. There are issues that relate to employment, because somebody who contracted polio in the early 1960s is a person we would hope would still be able to be gainfully engaged in the workforce. In a previous life, when I was a rehabilitation counsellor, I actually had a client who was suffering from the late effects of polio. He had come from a South American country. Whilst we do not have to deal with polio in Australia, there are many nations in the world where polio is still rampant in communities. People from those areas do come to Australia. So it is going to be an ongoing issue. This person with whom I was working had worked in a manual area. He developed a weakness in his arm and could no longer undertake the work that he did in the past. We tried to organise some retraining for him and get him into a job, which we subsequently did. Other things are associated with the late effects of polio and symptoms that not everybody understands. One of those is depression. Depression really accompanies the late effects of polio, as well as the physical debilitation. These are the types of issues that need to be raised and is the type of education that needs to be provided to doctors and health professionals, and people working in the community. Employers need to be aware that, as with anyone with a disability, a person may not have the physical strength or capabilities in a certain area, but they have a got a lot of other abilities. They need to be mindful of the fact that, if you give a person with a disability an opportunity to work, you will be well and truly repaid. There are enormous costs associated with disability and with not dealing with it. The committee felt that dealing with the disability and the effects of the disability would be of great benefit from a cost perspective to the country, as well as from the perspective of providing a benefit to the person who is suffering from the late effects of polio. Of course, there are social and emotional impacts. Just having to struggle with those everyday activities that people without a disability can do without even thinking about it really creates problems. I would like to turn to the recommendations in relation to the late effects of polio. Recommendation 1 is for the ABS or the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to look at some sort of mechanism to ask appropriate questions in the health disability survey to ascertain how many people in the community are suffering the late effects of polio so that we can get some feeling for the numbers that are out there and the numbers of people that this is impacting on. We felt that it was vitally important that we get some sort of knowledge base, and we thought that the ABS or the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare would be an appropriate body to collect this information. It is important to mention here that, when we had the polio epidemic in Australia, there were the people that had acute effects of polio and my grandfather was actually one of those. They ended up with quite severe disabilities, but there are other people who had polio that was nearly like the flu, and it is only by having proper tests that it can now be identified whether a person actually did contract polio when they were younger. So it is very important that we get this information base. Our second recommendation is that relevant national boards consult with the key stakeholders, and that is looking at peak professional bodies and educators to ensure that students learn that there is such a debilitating disease as the late effects of polio so that they can develop best practice for the treatment and management of people that have the late effects of polio. We also recommended that Medicare Locals engage with Polio Australia and the state-based polio associations to raise awareness of the late effects of post-polio syndrome, and that was looking at health professionals and working with communities through education and for people that are in that group of people that have the late effects of polio. It was a discussion paper with some recommendations that I think are achievable. There is one area that I think we also should touch on, which is that we need to do a tiny bit more research into the late effects of polio, looking at how they have impacted on people's lives and if there is a way or a treatment that can be used to lessen the effects of the late effects of polio. In conclusion, I would like say that as a society we are very lucky that we have managed to eradicate polio. We are very lucky that we will not have future generations suffering from the late effects of polio. We need to be vigilant as a country to ensure that all children are immunised and that polio does not re-emerge in Australia, and we also need to show compassion for those people that did contract polio back in the forties, fifties and sixties. I recommend the discussion paper to the House. post-polio syndrome, and I also endorse the remarks made by the member for Shortland. I have spoken on this in the other chamber but would like to add some other areas to this particular effect, because I feel they are important and should be put on the record. I would also like to congratulate the member for Parkes, who is in the chamber and who, with the member for Shortland, initiated this discussion paper through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. It was their efforts that made sure that we now have a discussion paper which the Australian polio association feel that they can take forward with them and use to help further their cause. The member for Shortland touched on the recommendations and also the employment aspect of the discussion paper, but there are a couple of areas that I want to highlight that I did not have time to mention the other day-that is, the physical aspects. We as members in this place take for granted that we can exercise and go out and use the gym and the swimming pool, and I see many members in this place who obviously do that.

187,Mr Irons (Swan) (10:19,I rise to speak on the discussion paper on the late effects of,142,Committees
188,Mr Irons,"Supreme athletes, as you say. We take those things for granted. We do notexercising and that it can actually have a detrimental effect unless handled carefully. I would like to quote from part 2.99 of the discussion paper, which says: As noted earlier physical therapies which alleviate symptoms of other chronic conditions, if used to treat people with LEOP/PPS may actually be detrimental. In particular participants commented on the need to carefully manage muscle strengthening and exercise programs to ensure that additional muscular damage does not occur. As Dr Tierney explained: You should not overstress the muscles. If you exercise, it has to be very gentle. Obviously, with hydrotherapy you are in water and it is very gentle. That is the way to keep yourself fit. But if people start doing weightlifting or going to the gym those very poor connections into the muscles then start collapsing at a faster rate, and you get muscle weakness moving towards paralysis if you undertake the wrong exercise regime. Part 2.101 of the discussion paper says: While noting that many people with LEOP/PPS ultimately manage much of their own physical therapy, one of the witnessescautioned that polio survivors first had to overcome a tendency to strive to achieve over and above what is required. In this regard Mr Doran noted: ... polio survivors have incredible mental stamina. What they do with that mental stamina is override the signs that things might be going wrong, because they have been used to doing that for most of their life. In particular, they override the fact that they might be feeling a little bit weak, they override the fact that they are absolutely exhausted, and they override the fact that they are in pain, because they have been told to shut up and get on with it for so long. Another area I want to refer to is diagnosis, which I touched on in my speech the other day. The time it takes for post-polio syndrome diagnosis can be, on average, up to six years. Research has not been mentioned yet here, but it is briefly mentioned in the discussion paper. Part 2.137 of the discussion paper says: While recognising the need for more research into LEOP/PPS in Australia, Dr Peel indicated that there are key centres of research in North America and Europe, noting: The research, as we have already indicated, might be inadequate [in Australia] but, nonetheless, research does occur in North America, particularly in Canada at the Montreal Post-Polio Clinic, and also in Europe. As I have already mentioned, there is the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Also, a lot of the research comes from the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam. The Danish Society of Polio and Accident Victims is another source of considerable research. The other day when we had a hearing of the health and ageing committee, as mentioned by the member for Shortland, Dr Tierney, Julian Thomas, President of Polio Australia, and Mary-ann Liethof, the National Program Manager, and Peter Guard, from Polio New South Wales, spoke to us about the discussion paper. They endorsed the recommendations that the member for Shortland has just spoken about. As individuals we said to them: 'Keep up the good work. You're doing a fantastic job. You've taken it this far and have been working for a long time.' But this is an area where we need more focus, more research and, obviously, more resources for people who are suffering from post-polio syndrome. I would like to say, 'Keep up the fight.' The resources are needed and, along with the other members of the health and ageing committee, I commend this discussion paper to the House.",142,Committees
189,Mr Doran,"be noted. As someone who contracted polio as a child I am most interested in the recommendations. brief comments on this discussion paper. Indeed sometimes in this job as a member of parliament you get to a point where you think you have done something worthwhile as part of a team, and today is one of those occasions. One of the great honours that I have had since I have come to this place is to have been asked by Polio Australia to be one of their patrons. It is a job that I am very proud to have and one that I take very seriously. I would like to, firstly, compliment the people from Polio Australia, led by Dr John Tierney and Gillian Thomas, for their tireless efforts. I think I met them not long after I was elected, probably early 2008, and they have been coming from all over Australia to Canberra on a regular basis, and they have mainly funded this from their own resources. Because of their own disabilities this is quite difficult for them to do, but they have just kept coming here, doing the rounds and spreading the word. I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing for adopting the idea of a roundtable and for this discussion paper. BeforeI go any further, I should recognise the secretariat, because I think they have done an excellent job in compiling information and putting into a nutshell what this issue is about, and in a minute I will talk about the three recommendations. They have done an excellent job on that. I also recognise the previous speakers, the member for Shortland and the member for Swan, for their contributions and indeed the entire committee for their efforts. Basically what has happened-and a lot of people do not realise this-is that many people who are suffering from the late onset effects of polio may not have even known that they had polio as a child. They may have had polio in the family; they might have had a sibling with polio. They may have had a bit of fever and so a very mild dose of polio. Largely, they got on with their lives. With all the publicity in probably the last 10 years about polio pretty well being eradicated in most of the world, I think there was a mind-set not only in the community but also in the medical profession that this job had been done. People were not looking at polio. One of the great frustrations for these sufferers is that they have been misdiagnosed with depression, chronic fatigue syndrome and a whole range of other ailments. In some cases the treatment that they received for these ailments actually exacerbated their condition. So it has been a big issue. I will just paraphrase the three main points of the report-and here I would like to acknowledge my fellow members on the committee, led in particular by the member for Shortland-that we need to have some recommendations to come out of this report. Basically, the three recommendations are that, as a society, as a country, we need to recognise the extent of this syndrome within our society. Maybe we can gather that information through the ABS from the next census. That is the first point. The second point is that we need to educate our medical practitioners that this is a real and very debilitating syndrome. So we need the medical colleges and the universities to put in some more work on this, and we also need to disseminate information through practising general practitioners. The third point is that we need to educate the wider public about this condition. If people are feeling lethargic, if they are having problems with movement or if they are having aches and pains, they may think",143,Committees

191,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:24): I too rise to make someback and ask whether there is polio in the family. The recommendation that the Medicare locals might be a vehicle for that is, I think, a good one. This is a good report. I commend everyone involved in it. It will be presented to the Minister for Health. From the reports of people in Polio Australia who have been speaking to the bureaucracy in the Department of Health in recent days, I think we are already starting to see a more enlightened approach to this issue. I will finish by saying that I am one of the lucky ones. I can still remember as a child in the mid-sixties being at primary school and lining up with the entire school to have our dose of the oral vaccine. Indeed, we are a privileged generation. I thoroughly endorse this discussion paper. I truly believe this is the beginning of a process and not the end and welcome this report. Debate adjourned. Regional Australia Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Murray-Darling Basin started long before I became an elected member of parliament. In fact, it started well before any of us came into this chamber. It would be a grave mistake to see the current debate in isolation of the many which have come before it. In fact, what we are currently considering is but the latest in a long line of reforms, the vast majority of which have had negative consequences for the constituents of my Riverina electorate. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia has again looked at the water issue, has again conducted public hearings into this topic of paramount importance to this nation and has again come up with a report, Report into certain matters relating to the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan, containing four worthwhile recommendations. Our last report of May 2011, Of drought and flooding rains: inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, contained 21 well-considered recommendations, yet was largely ignored and unfortunately remains so by this government. Members would be well advised to consider that much of the irrigated agriculture in my area was developed and enhanced as a direct result of government policy. From the building of irrigation canals to the encouragement of soldier settlers to turn their hands to growing food, to the recent speech of the Prime Minister encouraging Australia to enhance its position of food and fibre providers to the world-urging it to strengthen irrigation-successive governments have encouraged my constituents to believe that they had a positive future. It is an unfortunate fact that many Australians believe that the Snowy scheme was built to provide electricity. Whilst it is an unarguable fact that Snowy Hydro uses the assets of the scheme to support the Australian electricity network, it is also incorrect to say that electricity generation was the genesis of the Snowy scheme. On the contrary, it was built to divert water to the west-into the Murrumbidgee and the Murray-to enhance agricultural production. Over the past several decades irrigated agriculture has been under the water use spotlight. Participants have in the main cooperated with government initiatives, both state and federal,",144,Committees
192,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:30,"The national policy debate in respect of theto ensure the health of our basin. They have become more efficient with how they access and use water. They have taken steps to ensure that salinity does not claim their land. They have assisted recovery schemes to provide water to the rivers in their catchment and indeed further afield. Members should note the vast quantities of water retrieved from productive use of the Murrumbidgee which has been diverted to the Snowy. It is extremely important that this House acknowledges that irrigators and the communities they support do not oppose healthy reform; they support healthy rivers. Unlike many Australians, many of my constituents live on, rely on and work because of the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin. They have an inherent interest in the health of the system. To them it is not a philosophical discussion; it is their life. We should treat them with the dignity and respect that they deserve, not as political playthings to attract a particular segment of the urban vote. I also support a healthy working river, as do my colleagues. It is my understanding and belief that all in this House do-as we should. It was the coalition government which commenced the journey to the basin plan. It was this side of the House which provided substantial quantities of money to bring balance to the basin. When the basin plan comes before this House is just a few weeks, I urge all members to understand that the lives and livelihoods of good people are at stake. Indeed, the nation's ability to feed itself now and into the future is also very much at stake. Importantly, I ask all members to consider not only volumes of water, but how those volumes of water will be obtained. For it is here that the sides of this House divide. The coalition provided the pathway and the funding to replumb the Murray-Darling Basin. We provided the will and the means to obtain vast quantities of environmental water through infrastructure efficiency upgrades. We provided a total of $5.8 billion, a sum which, well spent, would have provided the balance between practical, environmental management and maintained economic and social productivity. Instead, we have seen that fund raided time and again by a government hell-bent on appeasing its Green partners with a serious lack of concern for the long-term economic and social damage it is visiting not only on my constituency but upon every Australian. It was the nation that built our agricultural productivity in the basin, so an attack on it is an attack on the nation. It has raided the infrastructure fund to pay for projects in Tasmania and Western Australia. With due respect to my interstate colleagues, and acknowledgement of the great capacity of their constituents, those funds were meant for the Murray-Darling Basin. It has raided the infrastructure fund to pay the cost of the holdings of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Only a government completely blinded by the bright lights of Canberra could consider that infrastructure. Perhaps most insulting was the $65 million raid on the infrastructure fund to pay for the increased cost of the rightly maligned Murray-Darling Basin Authority, an entity which comprehensively failed in a public engagement but was rewarded with funds designed to make the transformation with which they were tasked. Only a government such as this could consider that a legitimate use of funds. When the Murray-Darling Basin Plan comes before this House, I ask all members to be aware that it is not only the plan itself that matters; it is the plan to implement the plan. How will the water be obtained? Will it be achieved in the way the funds were intended, through replumbing rural Australia, through wise and efficient investment to maintain our social and economic assets? Or will it be through the simple, but long-term economic devastation of simply purchasing the heart of the nation. Finally, I am gratified that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, at my urgings, has decided to conduct a national food plan forum at Griffith, in the heart of the mighty Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, the area which produces $5 billion worth of agricultural exports, which helps this nation's balance of payments. Why the MIA was ignored in the first place remains a mystery. I commend this report to the House. Debate adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. and friend the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee, the Hon. Laurie Ferguson MP, which has sought further participation of NGOs in the human rights dialogue process; has sought further transparency, has sought that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade extend its human rights dialogues in both China and Vietnam and return to one in Iran; and recommends that, in order to ensure that human rights dialogues are properly monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis, the Australian government establish an independent human rights dialogue consultation committee to develop a set of principles, objectives and benchmarks for Australia's human rights dialogues. The committee calls for greater parliamentary participation in the dialogues, recommending that the committee receive briefings from participating agencies prior to and after each dialogue being held. Having attended many of the investigations at committee hearings that helped to produce this report, I want to also thank the witnesses from a wide variety of the Australian community who showed their ongoing concern for the need to sharpen the human rights dialogue process that Australia undertakes. Within the United States, Congress produces reports on human rights, and indeed the State Department's report on human rights around the world has become the authoritative document. We have got a long way to go in Australia before we achieve that level of expertise but hopefully the recommendations made in this report will help achieve that end. I particularly commend the committee's recommendation to re-establish a bilateral human rights dialogue with Iran. Of course, that is virtually impossible given the current state of the government in Iran. However, any evaluation of the people of Iran, both its majority Persian and its minority Azeri ethnic groups, would know that this is one of the most ancient and thoroughly civilised peoples, with a deep affection for education. The current regime that is imposed on them-it obviously stole the last election-is, in historical terms, a passing phenomena. I can imagine the days, just a few years hence one hopes, where Iran has replaced the current evil regime and Australia can extend its hand not just in trade and international affairs but also in helping civil society in Iran develop and reconstitute itself after the dark ages that this poor country is going through at the moment. The committee also recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General provide a brief to the Human Rights Subcommittee prior to each of the dialogues. I think that is an excellent recommendation. The committee also recommends that DFAT enhance its reporting of Australia's human rights dialogues in its annual report. At the very minimum it should list the dialogue participants, list the issues raised at dialogues about",145,Committees
193,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10:38,"I want to commend this report by my colleagueeach country and note the key outcomes or achievements. This is so both the Human Rights Committee and the federal parliament can evaluate them. It is very good that the foreign minister has formally invited the chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, or his or her nominee, and the shadow foreign minister, or his or her nominee, to participate in these dialogues as members of Australia's delegations. Again, in the US Congress the role of both leading Democrats and Republicans in participating in this debate ensures that there is continuing parliamentary oversight. It is not simply left to the executive or to the bureaucracies that deal with state-to state relations to see that the ethics of Australia as well as our national interests are prosecuted in foreign policy. That is the ethos of the theme of this report. I commend Mr Ferguson's activities and this report to the House. Debate adjourned. Rearrangement That order of the day No. 4, committee and delegation reports, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. Intelligence and Security Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Hezbollah organisation as a terrorist organisation could not be more timely. On 18 July this year, a suspected suicide bomber killed six people and wounded 30 aboard a tourist bus in the coastal town of Bulgaria. Hezbollah is suspected as having had a role in the attack. Most significantly, it is the first attack by Hezbollah on Europe and it has portents for this part of the world as well. Since the 1980s, Hezbollah and its mentor Iran which is its financier and programmer, have conducted a series of international bombings, hijackings, kidnappings and assassinations against US, Israeli, European, Saudi and Iranian dissident targets. Of course, in 1994 the most famous and injurious activity of the international activities of Hezbollah became known when in Buenos Aires 115 people were killed in the blowing up of a Jewish community centre there. Argentina's official state prosecutors charged Hezbollah and the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for using a web of diplomats and front companies to undertake this bombing. On 16 January this year in Thailand, the Thai police discovered large stockpiles of chemicals used to make bombs and that led them to a stash by a Lebanese man who had connections to Hezbollah. A month later, on 15 February, three explosions tore through a bustling Bangkok neighbourhood wounding five bystanders, and at another address at the same time in Bangkok a Hezbollah operative threw a hand grenade at Thai police. It",147,Committees

195,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10:44,"Australia's review of the relisting of therebounded and blew his legs off. The Thai police identified those people as being Iranian passport holders and one of them was detained at the city's international airport. Very significantly, that was in our part of the world. On 21 March, my friend the Chairman of the US House Committee on Homeland Security, Republican Peter King-a congressman from New York-ran a hearing on Iran, Hezbollah and the threat to homeland security, in which he stated: … top intelligence officials in the United States believe that Hezbollah is the group most capable of flipping its nationwide network of criminal fundraising cells into an operational terror force capable of great violence on orders from its leaders in Lebanon or Iran. In 2009 the Obama Administration said that Hezbollah is the 'most technically capable terrorist group in the world'. Obviously, that kind of warning applies to Australia as well. Interestingly, with Mr King's use of how the charitable networks can be flipped into operational terrorist groups, the report from the Intelligence and Security Committee notes: Besides operating a worldwide network of fundraisers, funds are raised through so-called charity funds. Some of these extremist institutions, while not directly connected to Hezbollah, support it in view of their radical Islamist orientation. While some of these funds undoubtedly pay for Hezbollah's military and terrorist operations, other funds enable the group to provide its members with day jobs to drape itself in the veil of legitimacy and to build grassroots support. The report suggests that these kind of charitable networks, as Congressman King suggests, may form part of Hezbollah operating here in Australia. I must say from my own experience I agree. Again, significantly, on 28 May this year, the Washington Post reported that US and Middle East officials see the thwarted attack by Hezbollah on Azerbaijan as a part of a broader campaign by Iranian assassins and terrorists to kill foreign diplomats in at least seven countries over a span of 13 months. The Washington Post report recounts the famous projected attack on the Saudi ambassador in Washington, half a dozen Israeli diplomats and several other Americans. The report presented to US officials in April outlines links between the attempted assassinations of diplomats by Iranian and Hezbollah officers in five countries-India, Turkey, Thailand, Pakistan and Georgia. On 10 August this year, the Obama administration placed sanctions on Hezbollah for assisting the Assad regime in Syria. The announcement by the US Treasury directly linked Hezbollah to the actions of the Assad regime, which, as we know, has killed 25,000 of its own people. I ask you one rhetorical question, Mr Deputy Speaker: where are all the demonstrators? Where are Socialist Alternative? Where are the Greens political party? If any Western country were involved in the deaths of this many civilians, they would be out in the streets, causing demonstrations, but there is silence. That points to double standards and hypocrisy. It is not good enough. The US Treasury has said: Hezbollah’s extensive support to the Syrian government’s violent suppression of the Syrian people exposes the true nature of this terrorist organization and its destabilizing presence in the region. I am not finished there. As I said at the beginning, on 18 July this year another terrorist attack in Bulgaria wounded 30 people aboard a tourist bus and killed six. Foreign Policy magazine-a very serious magazine of international affairs in the United States and probably the main left-of-centre publication-argues: … Iran and Hezbollah have crossed a dangerous line with their first strike in Europe in more than 15 years. I commend this report-its seriousness and its ongoing listing of Hezbollah's External Security Organization. I suggest that, from the reading of my speech and from the identification of the kinds of trends that are happening in other parts of the world and getting closer to Australia-in Thailand and targeting Europe-and with the suggestions by Congressman King that charitable organisations can be flipped for other activities at short notice and the identification by the Obama administration of Hezbollah's deadly intent and capability, this is a threat to Australia too. Therefore the parliamentary committee, in a non-partisan way, is doing exactly as the parliament intended in recommending these things to the Attorney-General and to the government. I commend the Attorney-General, ASIO and all of the people involved in the continuing, ongoing work in this area. Debate adjourned. Vietnam Veterans Day Debate resumed. and I do so in recognition of our Vietnam veterans and the contribution that they and their families have made to our nation and to our community. This year marks 50 years since Australia sent its first contingent of troops to serve in what would come to be known as the Vietnam War. It would be another 10 years before the last Australian soldier would leave Vietnam, with 500 men losing their lives in the conflict and more than 3,000 being wounded or falling ill. The war would come to represent an era of our nation's history, with songs, movies, television shows and books all being composed to discuss and portray our nation's role in the war and life back at home. However, the most lasting impact of the war was on our brave men and women who travelled far from home to serve their country in situations many of us just could not contemplate. This year marks the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, a battle which saw the 108 Australians of D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, confront a superior force of between 1,500 and 2,500 North Vietnamese and Vietcong soldiers. Throughout the afternoon and night of 18 August 1966, the Australians held off the North Vietnamese advance and managed to consolidate their position against any further counterattacks. Eighteen Australians were killed in action, with another 24 wounded. The Battle of Long Tan exemplifies the tenacity of the Australian spirit, which has been seen in many battles, and this spirit continues today amongst all of the men and women who have served their country and those who continue to do so. I am proud to have a sizeable number of veterans in my electorate of McPherson who have given so much for their country in some of the most harrowing circumstances and I reaffirm my support for them, and I will continue to fight to ensure they are given the respect and support that they deserve from a grateful nation. To commemorate the service of our Vietnam veterans, I attended a Vietnam Veterans Day ceremony in my electorate of McPherson last Saturday, 18 August. I joined over 200 Vietnam veterans, relatives and members of the community at the Kirra Sports Club memorial garden to remember those men who died for their country and to give thanks for those who came back home safely. I would like to commend Dave Dolan, President of the Coolangatta-Tweed",148,Committees
196,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (10:52,"I rise today to speak on Vietnam Veterans Day,Heads Sub Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, and Glen Wright, President of the Kirra Sports Club, for their hard work in organising Saturday's ceremony, and for providing an opportunity for the community to remember the service of those Australians who served in Vietnam. I would also like to thank Reverend Ken Spreadborough for his role in conducting the ceremony on Saturday and also Ron Workman OAM, the president of Currumbin RSL for his very moving address on that day. In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to all of those Vietnam veterans who served their country with distinction and courage, and pay my respects to those Australians who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country. Lest we forget. Long Tan and the brave efforts of D Company of 6RAR. They were the first Australian task force to be established in the operations near the village of Long Tan, a piece of high ground surrounded by rubber plantations in South Vietnam. On 18 August 1966, Delta Company encountered and engaged an enemy many times larger than their whole strength. On 18 August each year, we commemorate the 108 Australians who took part in that battle, under the command of the then Major Harry Smith. They bravely held off a force of more than 2½ thousand North Vietnamese Army, as well as local Vietcong soldiers. The Australian soldiers fought in very tough conditions, with the torrential rain in the Long Tan rubber plantation. From all accounts, and having spoken to Harry Smith myself, I understand it could not have been a worse situation. The Australians on the ground found themselves to be short of ammunition at the start of the battle and were forced to wait for assistance from helicopters to drop supplies. This all took place after the battle had begun, because it was not anticipated that they would be encountering the North Vietnamese Army at that particular location. The Battle of Long Tan perfectly symbolises the bravery shown, and the struggle endured, by our veterans during Australia's involvement in Vietnam. By the end of the day, 18 Australians between the ages of 19 and 22 were killed, another 24 were wounded. On the other side, however, as I understand it, they lost in excess of 500 soldiers, with many more wounded. This was the most costly battle for Australians that occurred during that war. As is the case throughout our military history, New Zealand soldiers were also lending crucial support in the finest traditions of ANZAC. New Zealand artillery provided an invaluable source of support and assistance throughout that battle. I also want to use the opportunity today to extend my deepest condolences and pay respect to the people of New Zealand, particularly the families of three young soldiers recently killed in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Jacinda Baker, who was 26 years old, Corporal Luke Tamatea, who was 31, and 21-year old Private Richard Harris were killed in the north-east of Bamyan Province on Sunday. The 10 New Zealanders and the 33 Australian soldiers who have lost their lives since the conflict began in Afghanistan should not be forgotten, even while we commemorate our veterans of Vietnam. Despite the difficulties encountered, Australian and New Zealand men and women continue to be deployed around the globe in the fight to defend freedom and liberty, just as they did in Vietnam. This year, 2012, marks the 50th anniversary of Australia's commitment in Vietnam. Clearly, Vietnam veterans deserve the same amount of pride and praise from our nation as",150,Statements On Indulgence
197,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (10:56,"Last Saturday marked the 46th anniversary of the Battle ofthose who served gallantly at Gallipoli, Tobruk and Kokoda. Out of the 50,000 Australians who served in Vietnam, 521 lost their lives in service to this country and more than 3,000 were wounded. Everyone who served in Vietnam deserves the proper recognition and full respect of this nation. Despite the tremendous bravery and sacrifice they offered, it is to this nation's lasting shame that the soldiers were not given proper acknowledgement or recognition until many years after the war. Even with the controversy and strong political disagreement, as well as disagreement in the social arena, about our involvement in Vietnam, our veterans deserve to be properly honoured for their service. Sadly, they had to deal with the post-war trauma in silence. Unfortunately, our nation failed them for many years after they returned. Even though it has been 50 years since our involvement in Vietnam and 46 years since the Battle of Long Tan, it has been only 25 years since we started to give proper recognition to the gallant efforts of our veterans. It was not until 3 October 1987 that thousands of Vietnam veterans and their families converged on Australia's largest city to march in a much belated welcome home parade. Approximately 25,000 veterans who served in Vietnam took part in the march, together with the next of kin of those whose tragically did not return. Several hundred thousand people lined the streets. That was fitting, but for those who had served this country it was certainly a long, long time to wait. It was only last year, more than 45 years after the Battle of Long Tan, that 6RAR company veterans were honoured with the Unit Citation for Gallantry by the Governor General-again, somewhat belatedly but certainly very fitting for those who served in that battle. Since that war, Australia has welcomed a large number of Vietnamese refugees to our shores who, today, make a tremendous contribution to the fabric of our multicultural society. As the representative of an electorate where more than 20 per cent of people are of Vietnamese origin, I am aware of the level of gratitude that the Vietnamese community still feels towards Australia and the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam war. Long Tan represents our first major engagement in Vietnam, and it was one of the most difficult and certainly one of the most courageous battles in this nation's history. I was recently very much touched by the emotional words written to commemorate the Battle of Long Tan by a very good friend of mine, Bao Khan, a Vietnamese refugee herself and a very strong advocate for human rights and freedom in Vietnam. She expressed the gratitude of the Vietnamese people towards Australian soldiers and Australia in the form of a lovely poem, which I would like to take a little time to read: There was the time, you were there for us There was the time, you fought for us For our freedom, for our lives Always the time, we'll adore you Always the time, we'll remember you Our Heroes… Our Friends Long Tan, Nui Dat, Phuoc Tuy, Ba Ria Saigon, Binh Ba, Hoa Long, Vung Tau… You were there to defend our land You were there against red demons Your sacrifice was for good cause Your sacrifice for us to live For freedom, democracy … Vietnam always remembers Now is the time we gather here Now is the time to show our love To all soldiers, Australia Always the time, we'll adore you Always the time, We'll remember you Our Heroes… Our Friends Lest we forget. Leader of the Opposition and all of my other parliamentary colleagues to speak on the motion recognising the Battle of Long Tan and the contribution of all Vietnam veterans. In recognising Vietnam 50 years on, it is recognising that also last Saturday, 18 August, was the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. It is an opportunity for all of us to pause, reflect and remember the sacrifice over the 10 years between 1962 and 1972 of nearly 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam War. Throughout the campaign, 521 Australians were killed in action and more than 3,000 were wounded in action. Every one of the men and women who served in Vietnam and returned home did so a changed person. TodayI join the Vietnam veterans and their families who honour their service and their sacrifice in our nation's name. This year has added significance as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first Australian troops in Vietnam in 1962. The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, the AATTV, was sent to South Vietnam in July 1962 to provide support and training to South Vietnamese troops. Throughout the campaign, Australia deployed approximately three battalions of infantry, one regiment of Centurion tanks and three RAAF squadrons, plus extensive naval transport and support. WhilstI admit the treatment of our Vietnam veterans remains a dark stain on our nation's history, I am comforted in knowing that we are starting to learn the lessons of these things we did wrong and seeking to address them for the current generation of men and women returning from active service. Last Thursday the Senate passed a motion acknowledging Vietnam Veterans Day, the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, the arrival of the AATTV and the shameful treatment of our Vietnam veterans upon their return. It also acknowledged the arrival at the Australian War Memorial of the original Long Tan Cross, which will be on display at the War Memorial until April next year. Vietnam Veterans Day is another important opportunity for us to reflect upon the service of all our Vietnam veterans from all three services and the important lessons our nation has learnt since their service ended. Last Saturday, in particular, we marked the anniversary of one of Australia's more iconic battles of the Vietnam War, the Battle of Long Tan. The Battle of Long Tan is best remembered as the Australian classic struggle against a much bigger enemy. The 108 men of D Company 6RAR fought against an opponent said to be over 2,000 to win the day and to be nationally and internationally recognised for their tenacity, their courage, their bravery under fire. Today, whilst honouring the memory of the fallen men in D Company 6RAR, we remember all of those who served in the Vietnam War and, in particular,",151,Statements On Indulgence
198,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11:05,"I rise today to join with the Prime Minister, theall of those 521 who paid the supreme price. Other battles and firefights deserve no less a recognition. Names like Nui Dat, the Horseshoe, Fire Base Coral and Balmoral all bring back different memories, all conjure up different emotions but all are uniquely Australian. To leave our shores in full knowledge that it may be the last time you saw your loved ones is an issue that plays on each and every person's mind. It has now been over 39 years since Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War came to an end in 1973, yet the Vietnam War remains remarkably fresh in the minds of many Australians. Vietnam was a war that divided our nation. While revealing the very best in our fighting forces-their gallantry, their professionalism-it was a war that drew unstinting praise for Australian servicemen from our allies in arms, including this tribute from General Westmoreland, the commander of the US forces in Vietnam, who said of our Australian troops at an ANZAC Day service: I have never seen a finer group of men. I have never fought with a finer group of soldiers. On previous occasions, I have spoken of the experiences that have been recounted to me. I have spoken of their hardships, their shameful treatment during the war and their rejection as citizens upon landing back in Australia at the tour's end. Whilst these experiences are important to acknowledge, to talk about and to address, today I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of other services to the Vietnam War. Whilst the Australian Army sent 42,407 troops to Vietnam between 1962 and 1973, it is important that we not forget the enormous contribution the men and women of Australia's medical teams made to the health and well-being of those who served in Vietnam; or the contribution of the 4,443 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force over the life of the Vietnam campaign, commencing in 1964, when a flight of Caribou began flying transport operations around South Vietnam, followed up by RAAF helicopters and the squadron of Canberra bombers in 1967, performing a variety of roles from aeromedical evacuations to airfield construction to combat flying with the US forces; or the contribution of the 13,500 personnel from the Royal Australian Navy-as I am always reminded, the 'Senior Service', always first into conflict. The Royal Australian Navy was in Vietnam showing the flag with HMAS Vampire and Quickmatch in early '62, followed by HMAS Quiberon and Queenborough in January '63. However, the Royal Australian Navy's presence was indirectly made known earlier by the hulk of the auxiliary minelayer HMAS Bungaree, laid up on the southern banks of Vung Tau harbour long before Australia entered the conflict. The first voyage of HMAS Sydney-or, as it was more commonly known, the Vung Tau ferry-to South Vietnam as a troop carrier, escorted by HMAS Melbourne, Duchess and Parramatta, began on 27 May 1965. The Royal Australian Navy's primary contribution consisted of destroyers, Fleet Air Arm personnel attached to a United States Army assault helicopter company and the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 9 Squadron, and a logistic support force consisting of transport and escort ships. Other Royal Australian Navy personnel served ashore in medical teams or performed staff duties at the Australian Embassy in Saigon or the Australian Task Force Headquarters in Nui Dat. The first guided-missile destroyers to deploy to Vietnam were Hobart, Perth and Brisbane. The Australian DDGs were well suited for the task of providing naval gunfire support. The guns of the Daring-class destroyer HMAS Vendetta proved extremely accurate, which served her well to wear the naval gunfire support ship title of a 'nine-mile sniper'. HMAS Hobart was the first DDG to join the US Seventh Fleet in March 1967, beginning the six-monthly rotations of Royal Australian Navy destroyers on the gun line. Hobart and Perth were deployed three times to Vietnam, Brisbane twice and Vendetta once. The destroyers carried out the naval gunship missions in all of South Vietnam's four military regions. Hobart, Perth and Vendetta came under enemy attack on a number of occasions. Perth was hit once during her first deployment. Hobart suffered two killed and seven wounded when she was mistakenly hit by missiles fired from a United States Air Force aircraft. Vendetta came under rocket and swimmer attack in Da Nang harbour and mortar attack off the coast of the Quang Tin province. HMAS Sydney's escorts included Her Majesty's armed ships Melbourne, ANZAC, Derwent, Duchess, Parramatta, Stuart, Swan, Torrens, Vampire, Vendetta and Yarra. In 1966, the Vietnam supply line was supplemented by two Australian National Line cargo ships, Jeparit and Boonaroo. In March 1967 members of the Seamen's Union refused to man Jeparit and Boonaroo. To overcome this difficulty, Boonaroo was immediately commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy with a full naval crew for one return voyage to Cam Ranh Bay and Singapore. Jeparit was later commissioned following further industrial action. Between 1967 and 1971 the Royal Australian Navy Helicopter Flight was fully integrated with the US Army 135th Assault Helicopter Company, flying Iroquois helicopters in both utility and gunship configurations. The role of the 135th Assault Helicopter Company was to provide tactical air movement of combat troops, supplies and equipment, and air mobile operations. This included augmentation of Army medical services, search and rescue, and the provision of a command-and-control-aircraft capability. Throughout the Royal Australian Navy Helicopter Flight's deployments there were many individual acts of bravery performed in the face of the enemy. One such incident occurred on 4 December 1971, when Lieutenant Jim Buchanan, Royal Australian Navy, was piloting a helicopter operating in the U Minh Forest. While engaged in medical evacuation the group came under heavy attack from enemy forces. Realising that the boat on which he was operating was disabled and drifting towards the enemy-held shore, Lieutenant Buchanan deliberately hooked the skids of his aircraft onto the boat's superstructure and towed it to a safe area. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and I believe has also been awarded the US Navy Cross. We must also recognise the significant contribution of one of the smallest-and unrivalled-Australian units to serve in Vietnam: Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diving Team 3. They were an elite group of 49 officers and men, divers trained in the dangerous business of explosive ordnance disposal who established an enviable reputation for courage and innovation in a time of war in the spirit of the divers' motto: 'United and undaunted'. During the 10 years that the Royal Australian Navy was involved in the war, eight officers and sailors were killed and another 46 were either wounded or suffered other injuries. The dedication and professionalism shown by members of the Royal Australian Navy earned the service the respect of our allies and continued the traditions established by Australian sailors in other wars. I am always honoured and very privileged to participate in Vietnam veterans Remembrance Day activities, which I did on Saturday at Medowie and Forster, for I, like the majority of Australians, believe that we are a nation deeply indebted to all of those who fought in Vietnam. So today, in this year of the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, it gives Australians an opportunity to offer our support and our gratitude for the service that they gave this great nation-support that, sadly, was not afforded when they came home. Visiting the troops on the front line in Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan a couple of years ago gave me a greater understanding of the stress and, importantly, the professionalism, dedication and camaraderie that exists as a part of the esprit de corps. I continually find myself being humbled and emotionally stretched on days like Vietnam Veterans' Remembrance Day, whether it be by the worn and torn faces I see in front of me, reading their stories about the hell of the war or hearing their softly told stories that reduce strong men to tears. From the first Australians killed in the South African wars in the last years of the 19th century to the tragic recent death of the most recent Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan, Sergeant Blaine Diddams-whose dad, Peter, a Vietnam veteran himself, and mum, Cath, reside in Pacific Palms in my electorate of Paterson-more than 102,000 Australians have lost their lives in defence of the freedoms that we enjoy today. The stories of bravery and fortitude in Vietnam take their honoured place in the chronicles of Australia's military history. The line that runs from Gallipoli through to Kokoda and Kapyong also runs to Long Tan and Tarin Kowt. All are synonymous in our nation's collective memory with the values of courage, endurance, valour and comradeship. Vietnam is also a story of the Australian national serviceman. From 1965 to 1972, more than 15,000 of those called up under the National Service scheme were sent to Vietnam. I would like to conclude today with a simple verse written by Private Gary McMahan, 6RAR, Vietnam. I believe it accurately portrays the Australian experience and the spirit during the Vietnam war. It reads: We would do anything for a mate, anything except leave him on the battlefield. We shared our last drops of water, or our last cigarette. We patrolled together, we slept together, we laughed together and we fought together. We even died together. It has been an honour to share these thoughts with the parliament today. I say to all our men and women: may God bless each and every one of you and may a peace finally meet your living soul. Ms BIRD (Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (11:20): I rise today to add my comments to the statements made by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and the shadow minister for defence to the parliament on Monday and to commend the contributions made by my colleagues, the members for Fowler and Paterson, immediately before my contribution today. Vietnam Veterans Day is commemorated in Australia on 18 August each year. It is a time to reflect in particular on the battle of Long Tan and the Australians who served during the Vietnam War and it is an opportunity to remember those who, most sadly, did not come home. At the request of the South Vietnamese government, a team of 30 Australian military advisers were sent to Vietnam during July and August 1962, 50 years ago this year. This was followed in August 1964 by the Royal Australian Air Force, sending a flight of Caribou aircraft. Australia sent the first battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, 1RAR, in June 1965. As hostilities escalated, the Australian government introduced the National Service Scheme, which saw conscripts involved in that conflict as well as all nine RAR battalions over the period of the war. Public opposition to the war eventually led to the Allied political leadership announcing the gradual withdrawal of Allied forces from 1971, and the Australian commitment ended in June 1973. The commemoration of the Vietnam War in Australia is held in August to mark the Battle of Long Tan. I would like to use the words describing the battle directly from the Australian War Memorial website. It says: On that day, 108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers fought a pitched battle against over 2,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops in a rubber plantation not far from the small village of Long Tan. The Australians prevailed, but only after fighting in torrential rain for four hours. They were nearly overrun, but were saved by a timely ammunition resupply, accurate artillery fire from the nearby Australian base, and the arrival of reinforcements by armoured personnel carrier. Eighteen Australians lost their lives and 24 were wounded, the largest number of casualties in one operation since the Australian task force had arrived a few months earlier. After the battle the bodies of 245 enemy soldiers were found, but there was evidence that many more bodies had been carried away. Last Saturday evening I joined many local people at the Vietnam Veterans Day commemoration service organised by the Illawarra Vietnam Veterans Sub-Branch and held at the memorial at Flagstaff Hill in Wollongong. I have attended this service regularly since I was elected, as many of my colleagues in this House do, in order to show respect to the service and sacrifice it honours and to show support for the excellent work carried out by the Illawarra Vietnam Veterans Association. We were joined-and it has been a regular occurrence-by members of the Vietnamese community in the Illawarra, who regularly support the activities of the Vietnam Veterans Association. The memorial was extended by a walkway which holds the plaques of returned veterans who have subsequently passed away. It is a moving and important recognition of their service as well. Each year, sadly, more names are added to the wall and this year six more veterans were honoured. The address for the service was delivered by Major General Hori Howard AO MC ESM, retired, who regular supports local service events and always has an important and well-received message for those gathered for the occasion. I want to congratulate the Illawarra Vietnam Veterans Sub-Branch on their continued work on behalf the veterans and their families and for their contribution to the better understanding of their service and sacrifice by the wider community. I will take a moment to acknowledge them by name: the President, Peter Mitchell; Senior Vice-President and Treasurer, Pam Bowmaker JP; Secretary, Kathy Kielbicki; Junior Vice-Presidents, Graham Parsons and Ian Birch; and committee members Eraldo Bensi, Alan Groome JP, Greg Keir, Gerry O'Leiry, Bob Green and John Kielbicki. I would make the point that I am sure that each of those soldiers we remember on occasions such as this, those who fought for their country and, particularly, those who gave their lives for their country, hoped that their war would be the last time that anybody would have to undergo that sort of service and sacrifice for the country, hoped that their children, their nieces and nephews and their grandchildren, would not be called upon to do so as well. Sadly, that has not been the case since the Vietnam conflict. I would like to also take this opportunity to say that those present on Saturday night recognised and sent their thoughts and best wishes to those in our armed services who are currently serving in places around the globe on behalf of our nation and hope that their families take some support from our expressions of goodwill, concern and hope for their safe return. Lest we forget. community to remember the sacrifices made by our troops in the Vietnam War. Vietnam Veterans Day is a particularly important day this year as it marks 50 years since Australia's involvement in Vietnam. Originally, it was a day to commemorate the Battle of Long Tan and, since 1966, it has been adopted by all veterans. This is appropriate as the Battle of Long Tan was the largest single unit battle fought in Vietnam by Australian troops. It began on the afternoon of 18 August and went right through the night until the morning of the 19th. The Australians had only been in Vietnam for a few months and this was the first major conflict on Vietnamese soil involving Australian troops. Eighteen Australians died at Long Tan, but they did not die in defeat. Long Tan stands tall in our memory and we do not forget. The Vietnam War became the longest war in which Australians served, spanning a ten-year period. By the end of the conflict, more than 58,000 Australians, including many from our local community, had served their nation, at their nation's request, in the Vietnam War. As the member for Paterson said, the treatment of our returning soldiers remains a dark stain on Australia's history. Anecdotal evidence holds that most men returned from Vietnam in the dead of night, hidden from the public. In fact, large numbers actually returned on the HMAS Sydney to a welcome by dignitaries and a parade. The manner of their homecoming affected the way in which veterans recovered from the war. Those who did arrive late at night to no fanfare and the seeming indifference of the military had more trouble adjusting to life at home than did those whose return was more public and who had the benefit of a couple of weeks unwinding on board HMAS Sydney before reaching Australia. But the return home was only the beginning of a long period of readjustment. For a long time after the war, large numbers of Vietnam veterans felt that many in Australia blamed them rather than the politicians for the war and the way it had been conducted. Fortunately, we have learned from those dark days, and today returning service men and women are given much more support when they return home. On 18 August we must remember every Australian who served and suffered in Vietnam at the request of the nation. This year, I was honoured to join community members at the Gaythorne RSL Sub-Branch's annual Vietnam Veterans Day service in Sid Loder Park at Mitchelton. I attended the service with my colleagues the Premier of Queensland and state member for Ashgrove, Campbell Newman; fellow state members Tim Mander and Dale Shuttleworth; and local councillors Andrew Wines and Brian Battersby. As always, it was inspiring to see so many community members attend this moving service and appreciate the heartfelt address by the President of the Gaythorne RSL, Mr Merv Brown, who is himself a Vietnam veteran. I congratulate those who are keeping fresh the memory of this special day for all Australians. Those who served our nation and, indeed, those who made the ultimate sacrifice will forever be remembered. Lest we forget. Forestry) (11:29): I join with my colleagues in this chamber to pay my respects to and to honour those people who fought in the Vietnam War and also, most especially, those who lost their lives and/or were wounded. It was my era but, fortunately, I was not called upon to go to Vietnam, although a number of my friends were.

200,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries andVietnam-in one instance, for a very personal friend, it has been very sad to see how it has affected him mentally and in his life choices thereafter. I too remember the unfortunately shameful way that we failed to recognise the service of our servicemen in Vietnam. The opprobrium of the politics of the war was directed towards them instead of where it belonged, or at least where the responsibility for the decision to go into Vietnam lay. In 1987 we did the right thing as a nation and welcomed them home. As unfortunate as it has been that our serving personnel have had to represent our country in the cause of both peace and peacekeeping in our contribution to service overseas, we recognise most especially our service personnel and the wonderful job they do on our behalf. One of the good things that came out of 1987 and the return was the recognition of Vietnam Veterans Day, or Vietnam war day. A lot of that is centred round an event that tended to summarise the feelings of many in Australia, and certainly of those who served, about what it means to represent your country, irrespective of the politics of the decision making to send you. It brings to mind to observers like me and others at a long distance what it means in a moment in history to serve your country. I read with great interest, and emotionally at times, the comments of Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith as the commander of Delta Company. He is a very straight-shooting person, if you will excuse the pun, who wrote a paper called 'No time to fear'. What an extraordinary title. I have never been under fire, but one of my colleagues here indeed has. No time to fear-I just try to understand myself and what it would mean to be in a serious firefight, a serious battlefield situation. How would I feel? To realise that in the Battle of Long Tan and on the Long Tan battlefield the youngest participant, I understand, on the Australian side was 19 years of age and the eldest was 22. I think of my children, my sons, and it really beggars belief. At 19 years of age you are in a plantation facing overwhelming odds-we use that term but I do not mean it in the hero sense; I mean it in the extraordinary sense-an extraordinary number of enemy soldiers before you and you enter into a firefight over three or four hours in the pouring rain. You are in there, totally undermanned and underprepared, and this force is dedicated to making a statement about your presence in their region and a firefight takes place. Fortunately, our soldiers were aided by others in this firefight. There were 18 young Australians killed and 24 wounded. We do not know what the total loss of life was in that battle. I am sorry that there was any loss of life. We know that at least 245 Vietnamese soldiers died, and we expect that there were many more. It sounded like absolute carnage. But they survived, with great will, and so much so that they were cited for the US Presidential Unit Citation. Long Tan has become, if you like, a symbol of what it means to face danger and to have to cope with that danger. You have no say, you have no time even to fear, as Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith comments. So that battle has begun to symbolise (1) their sacrifice and (2) what it means to share your life and your death with someone at a particular moment in time. I could not even begin to imagine what that must mean to those who shared that. But I do know that the Long Tan Cross must be an extraordinary symbol, a living symbol, to them of that moment. It has come to symbolise something very important, not just in the military tradition in Australia, which is a fine tradition, but also in our national tradition. I saw a record of one of those who took part in the battle and who saw the carnage, Peter SlackSmith. This is a record of what happened when he first saw the cross, which has come to Australia-and that is a fantastic thing. He said: The first thing I saw was the red mudat the base of the crossI know that mud; I have grovelled in that mud. For him it is not just about grovelling in the mud. For him that was a life-changing, lifesurviving experience with colleagues, some of whom did not live after that event or were wounded because of that event. Mud. That is what war is, apart from the extraordinary emotion and human qualities that are part of that terrible thing. The cross itself has an extraordinary history. Some years after the war, Australian troops got together and made a cross, which they helicoptered into the site and there it remained for some time, until it was removed and another replica was put there by locals to remember the event. They too lost people in that extraordinary event. The cross made its way to Dong Nai Museum, and the cross that is in Australia today is that cross. It is now on loan, and we do thank the Vietnamese authorities and the museum for it and also those Aussies who campaigned to get that cross to Australia. It will be here until next year. It is going to be hard to remove that cross. I want to thank and pay homage to those who fought on that day against extraordinary odds, who grovelled for us and also those who fought in Vietnam, particularly those who lost their lives and those who were injured. As I said, so many have been scarred thereafter. I do apologise for the way that we treated those soldiers, my friends. I was one of those who did not pay enough respect and thank them. I forever live with that. It will never be repeated again, I hope, in our history. I particularly want to say that the cross symbolises more than just a battle and the carnage that took place there; it symbolises the importance of being a human being and doing what you think is right. his heartfelt sentiment. our Vietnam veterans and to do honour to 18 August, which we now call Vietnam commemoration day. PerhapsI am a bit old-fashioned, but I would still like to hear it called Long Tan Day. We do not talk about Gallipoli as the Turkish campaign, we talk about it as Gallipoli. I think there is something very special about Long Tan, as speakers have said today. Celebrating the arrival of the cross at the War Memorial resonated particularly with me because Harry Smith, the commander at Long Tan, is a constituent of mine, and is much loved in the Hervey Bay community. We have had some amazing battles in Australia's military history going back to the Sudan and the Boer War. I mention Gallipoli and the Western Front in the First World War. There were some incredible battles of the Second World War, not least of which was Milne Bay to our north. It was the first time that the Japanese had been defeated on land for centuries. There was the amazing withdrawal, while the Australians held the line, of the United Nations troops escaping from Kapyong. It was an extraordinary battle. We then come to the Vietnam War and, as my colleague has just said, we have never given that-at least until comparatively recent times-the honour due to it. My personal view is that",158,Statements On Indulgence

202,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (11:39): I rise today to rememberwhen you read about these patterns, and I do read a bit although I do not claim to be a military historian-not like the member for Riverina, who really is up on these matters-you see that in terms of intensity that was probably our most important military engagement of all time. I know there will be military people who will disagree with me. But the Battle of Long Tan went from about 3.40 pm until 7.10 pm. It was on the edge of a rubber plantation. It was not a setpiece battle. The Australian the company had gone out on a normal reconnoitre and had come across scouts from a huge party of North Vietnamese regulars and a Vietcong unit. They engaged on the edge of that rubber plantation in the mid afternoon until late afternoon on 18 August. It was a fierce battle, made all the worse by the fact that it went on in pouring rain. The Australians were hopelessly outnumbered. The exact numbers will never be known because the North Vietnamese took their dead from the field, but from what has subsequently been found in intelligence documents and the number of bodies that were buried on the day it is thought that the local irregulars, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese regulars totalled somewhere in the order of 2,500. They were taken on by 108 ANZACs-105 Australians and three New Zealanders. As I said, it was in the pouring rain. At the height of the battle, Harry Smith, the commander, was lying in two or three inches of muddy water with his New Zealand artillery officer beside him and they were calling down a barrage of American, New Zealand and Australian guns just metres in front. It was incredibly dangerous and of course the shells exploding in the rubber plantation were very effective, and really slowed the North Vietnamese forces down. Eventually, around seven o'clock, after this terrible battle, the North Vietnamese forces withdrew. There is another sideline to this battle. In the middle of all this, the Australians were, as I said before, out on patrol, a reconnoitre-they did not go heavily armed in the sense of going in for a definitive battle-and an RAAF pilot actually flew into the middle of the battle with ammunition, at an incredible risk. There had been intelligence reports that there was a big North Vietnamese unit forming up. Some people scotched it and some people took it seriously, but what we have subsequently discovered is that those 2½ thousand troops had not come to engage the company 6RAR; they had come to attack the Australian base at Nui Dat. On that afternoon, about the same time that the battle was going on, there was a concert with Little Pattie and so on at Nui Dat. Nui Dat was not a heavily defended base, so you can imagine what might have happened had that patrol not engaged with them. Imagine 2½ thousand troops descending on Nui Dat immediately after a concert in the early evening. Imagine the mayhem and the death toll that may have occurred, and yet these 108 guys took on 2½ thousand people and won it. That is the first part of the story. Well might we celebrate that cross and well might we bring it to Australia in this year's Vietnam commemoration. But there are still wrongs to be righted in this dreadful business. Harry Smith was recommended for the DSO and his two lieutenants were recommended for the Military Cross. When the freedom of information documents became available later, Harry discovered-30 years on-that his DSO had been downgraded to a Military Cross and that the Military Crosses of his two lieutenants had been downgraded to be Mentioned in Dispatches, whereas the commander back at Nui Dat accepted a DSO, a commander who did not visit the field until after the battle. I find that absolutely appalling. There was one review by Tanzer in 1999 that recommended there be a long-term review. That was opposed by the generals and, in fact-and this is not said to denigrate the man in any way-Angus Houston said at the time: 'Note that I do not agree to any proposal for additional awards or a unit citation for the force elements in operation Smithfield August 1966 (Long Tan).' For years these guys have been struggling not just to have their personal awards reinstated but to see that their men were recognised. Eventually Harry Smith was upgraded to the equivalent of the DSO. He got the Star of Gallantry-I am not as familiar with the awards as I should be-and his two officers, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall, the Medal of Gallantry. In fact, it was my pleasure to be at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane last August to see the Meritorious Unit Citation for Afghanistan presented and also to see the former Vietnam soldiers from D Company, 6RAR receive the Unit Citation for Gallantry that had been denied them. Both those awards were presented before the Governor General at Enoggera Barracks last year. Twelve of those soldiers who were there that day were recommended for awards. I have told you the odds that there were on that day and the absolute gallantry of the officers who led that event. Eighteen Australians were killed and 24 were wounded. Harry Smith recommended 12 people for awards. Two of them have died. One of them was Gordon Sharp, who was recommended for a posthumous award, and more recently Ron Brett has died. The other 10 were Bill Roche, Ian Campbell, Geoff Peters, Barry Magnussen, Neil Bextrum, Allen May, Noel Grimes and Bill Moore from the unit and, from an APC reaction force that came up to support the troops later in the battle, Adrian Roberts and Frank Alcorta. The late Ron Brett was also part of that group. Again, this is not said with criticism of any of the people involved, either in the Howard government or in the Gillard government; there is no criticism applied to individuals. But we have now invoked a valour inquiry part 1 and we are currently in the throes of the valour inquiry part 2. I think it is very important that these 12 men be recognised. Harry Smith tells me he has had a difficult time getting this up, because it will require the approval of the minister before the matter can go before the valour inquiry part 2, which is working from now till the end of the year and is being chaired by Alan Rose. SoI appeal to the government: in celebrating this event we have to do more than go to the memorials, put our hands on our chests or beat our breasts and say what a marvellous thing it was, how great it was and what marvellous things they did for the Australian psyche and then be so mealy-mouthed-so incredibly mean-as to say, 'But we will not decorate you guys, despite all the evidence and despite you being at the very forefront of the definitive battle of the Vietnam War,' because some records and evidence were lost, even though there is plenty of evidence that can neutralise that. Another general said it would open a can of worms. There is all that stuff, but no-one is going to the core of it: that these were 12 incredibly brave men, 10 of them still alive. We treated the Vietnam troops in general abysmally after the war. Thank God, over the last decade or so that has changed dramatically, and many of them have moved into the RSL. The president of the RSL in some towns is now a Vietnam veteran. So a lot of that healing has gone on, but these guys were on the front line. These people did our country proud. These people faced an incredibly superior foe. These people won the battle. These people probably prevented a bloodbath at Nui Dat. As my salute in the Vietnam commemoration, I salute these 12. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:55): I commend all those who have spoken so far on this motion amidst all of the very important and fine sentiments that this day was created to reflect. Certainly, it is has been wonderful to have this opportunity every year to add new dimensions to that, to recognise new aspects of the entire conflict of the Vietnam War, and that we centre the recognition around the Battle of Long Tan. Many people have described a lot of the detail of the battle so I will not go into that detail again, but it is quite correct to recognise the key significant salient points about that, being the effort of the troops against such overwhelming odds. At various points of this battle it was actually a mere platoon that was facing, effectively, the brigade-size strength of the enemy. But there were other units and subunits that were engaged that day that we should also recognise. Apart from Delta Company of 6RAR, there were, of course, the sterling efforts of the 9th Squadron (RAAF), who really risked life and limb to get the resupply happening to the isolated troops in terrible conditions and under significant fire. Of course, the 1st Field Regiment, with its 161st New Zealand battery, a true ANZAC effort that effectively kept those troops alive and prevented them from being overrun, laid down the steel curtain that really saved the day for the survivors of that battle. There was a very significant barrage that was added to by our US allies as well, which we should acknowledge too, and also some air support. There was also the cavalry arriving literally towards the end of the battle and the 3 Troop of the 1st APC squadron and all of the legendary names that have emerged from that battle that really shaped the folklore and the heritage that I inherited when I first joined the Army. One of the things I would like to pay tribute to is that the people who trained me when I first joined the army were all Vietnam veterans, and I owe a great deal of gratitude and debt to those men, because the skills and things they taught me stood me in good stead for many years afterwards in many situations. They provided us with a wonderful heritage as young officers and soldiers in the Defence Force at that time. We were the immediate postVietnam generation and we used all the same gear and equipment as that generation. It was all the same vintage-all stuff from the sixties. There were SLRs-everything. So, we really had an empathy identified. The legendary Buick, Sharp, Kendall, Sabben and Smith were all fantastic people who would come and speak to us and teach us lessons about that battle and many others in Vietnam. We should acknowledge not only them but also the Kiwis who helped us in that battle, and particularly the forward observer Stanley, who died not long ago. One of the most rewarding times for me in parliament is that we were able to address a number of these issues from Long Tan. I personally weighed in on one aspect of that, which was the South Vietnamese declaration of the Cross of Gallantry, which had been denied our troops because, at that time, it had been a policy to reject many of these foreign declarations. Subsequently it had been rejected as being awarded because it could not be established that that had been the intention of the South Vietnamese government and people had effectively given up and walked away from attempting to establish that. Working with the historian Paul Ham, I was able to establish that there was actually signals traffic from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was a place nobody had actually looked before, specifically rejecting this offer from the South Vietnamese government. So we could establish that that declaration had been offered but instead, at the time, the soldiers were issued with Vietnamese dolls, which was not quite what they were looking for in recognition of their efforts. So we were able to establish that and then go ahead and issue those declarations. Many, as has been mentioned, were elevated in the gallantry declarations that were awarded, so that was a very pleasing thing. The other very satisfying aspect of my involvement as a parliamentarian was bringing home the remains of our last two missing servicemen, Michael Herbert and Robert Carver from No. 2 Magpie squadron. Being there with their colleagues from the squadron and their family was very special. To be able to say that we have brought everyone home is a unique claim to be able to make in a conflict like this. What was special was the reception, the assistance, the spirit of cooperation and the camaraderie that we experienced at the Vietnamese end while we were over there in Hanoi. It was a very warm and wonderful experience. We should put it in the context of the fact that the Vietnamese still have 300,000 missing personnel from that conflict. One of the heart-warming things about our modern relationship with Vietnam is that our Defence Force and our experts are currently assisting the Vietnamese authorities to pursue the continuing identification of those missing personnel. It is very heart warming indeed. It is wonderful to see so many young Australians, young Vietnamese and others moving backwards and forwards in education and tourism. We really have built a wonderful and close bond with that country out of the ashes of such a bitter conflict, and that is wonderful to see. There are quite a few Vietnam veterans from Australia living in Vietnam. Some of them are involved in maintaining the Long Tan battlefield. That is a positive to have taken out of this. We always have to look for long-term meaning out of these sorts of conflicts and tragedies. One of those things is the relationship that we have built with the Vietnamese people, on a people-to-people level. Mention has been made of the Long Tan Cross. That is very special. I know that the veterans have appreciated having it here. This is something that we can take special note of on this particular Vietnam veterans commemoration. I am very pleased that we have launched the Vietnam Vets Family Study to look into the impacts that there have been on the families. It has been noted that these veterans were treated very badly by all shades of politics and the community in general. That exacerbated the psychological impact of the experience of our veterans in Vietnam. Of course, much of that ends up being passed on to families as it is projected and played out in many domestic homes around Australia. This study is well overdue. I am very pleased to see that we initiated it and that it will be completed, hopefully, by the end of 2012. We use this day to commemorate the whole of the Vietnam experience. There were many other major confrontations and battles and a lot of loss in the context of that conflict. I think of 5RAR's experience in Bin Ba and the 8RAR operations in the Long Hai hills. Those battles were very difficult and costly of personnel. The major battle that we were involved in over there was the Battle of Fire Support Bases, Corel and Balmoral, where we suffered more casualties in the course of a more extended period of time. The focus was on 1RAR and 3RAR and 102 Battery, which was nearly overrun in that battle. It was one of the last times of any significant scale where our troops were engaged in fixed bayonet fighting. There is no more terrifying, more personal or more horrifying experience than bayonet fighting. That was the last time that was really experienced on that level. We should acknowledge those conflicts. There were also the incredibly tension filled days of 7RAR, 2RAR and the Horseshoe. All these names will resonate with our veterans. There were the booby-traps and minefields that they had to navigate and they experienced extreme tension in relation to that. You never knew whether that day, when you were out patrolling, would be your last on two legs. We suffered quite a large number of casualties needing amputations. I was recruited into the army by a great hero of mine, Brigadier Rolph, who lost both legs in Vietnam. He was a young platoon commander, straight out of RMC, who went straight over to Vietnam. It was just about his first operation, his first day out in the paddies, and he lost both legs. We should remember those who carry the scars, not just those who lost their lives. We also have the experiences of 4RAR and 9RAR in Bien Hoa and the battle of Nui Le. There are quite a lot of things that we should remember that occurred alongside the sterling efforts of our troops in Long Tan. We commemorate the entire experience of our people in that long war. Just recently, we have experienced around this country wonderful celebrations on Vietnam Veterans Day. I particularly want to congratulate the organisers of the event at Batemans Bay that I attended, the Eurobodalla Vietnam Veterans Peacemakers and Peacekeepers Association, particularly the secretary, Helen Kop, and the president, Tony Herbert. They produced an excellent day. WhatI particularly loved about the day was that in attendance and participating in the parade were Vietnamese veterans from the South Vietnamese Army accompanied by a wonderful troupe of Vietnamese women, beautifully decorated in their traditional dyed dresses. It was so wonderful to have them included. They spoke at the ceremony and went back with us to the Soldiers Club at Batemans Bay for a wonderful gathering and lunch. The spirit in which these events are being commemorated is wonderful, too. As I mentioned, the important thing is to take lessons and motivation out of these things. We had Sandy MacGregor, former colonel and engineer, speaking to us at Batemans Bay. He had been in Vietnam during the time of the Battle of Long Tan. He lost members of his troops in the lead-up mortar fire that preceded the battle itself. Sandy is a wonderful bloke and has himself tried to take a lot of meaning out of his experiences in Vietnam, as a lot of veterans have. One of the things they have done is to set up MiVAC, which is the Mines Victims and Clearance Trust, established by Australian Vietnam veterans. They raise funds through the trust and I strongly suggest that all people who want to really make a practical impact and recognise Vietnam Veterans Day contribute to the fund because they are doing wonderful work in clearing some of the thousands and millions of unexploded ordnance and mines that still plague that part of the world. In fact, the most bombed country in the world was not Germany, Japan or even Vietnam; it was the little country of Laos, so a lot of the collateral damage that occurred from that war and the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos et cetera has left a terrible legacy which continues to maim and kill many, many people. So it is wonderful to see people like Sandy MacGregor and others who have rallied to do something about that by raising funds, getting out there and, as engineers, deploying their expertise to clear these terrible legacies of war. It resonates very strongly with me because I was involved in the landmines treaty process. I was in Oslo for that process working with my engineer colleagues and others to produce a good outcome there and advance the cause of clearing up these 110 million landmines scattered across the forgotten battlefields of the world. I pay tribute to Sandy MacGregor for his wonderful work in leading the charge and making something positive out of Vietnam Veterans Day. I encourage people to donate to that cause. We also had Ron Richards from the sub-branch at the event, who was a veteran of the Battle of Long Tan as well, so we salute Ron's service in that battle. This is a great opportunity for us to continue to right the wrongs and to recognise all the dimensions of this conflict and its impact on our country, on the families of the veterans and on the regions which we fought over. And we must remember that our Vietnamese brothers and sisters also endure a continuing legacy. That is a relationship we must continue to build, taking something positive out of this whole experience. I commend members for participating in this motion. I salute the service of all those veterans who gave their lives, were wounded and provided me with the training, the legacy and the heritage that has meant so much in my service and the service of so many of my brothers and sisters. Monaro and the member for Hinkler. I concur with their words. Last SaturdayI was honoured to attend the Sydney chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club for their Long Tan Day ceremony at their Menai clubhouse. Everyone in attendance was privileged to hear a most moving prayer delivered by Pastor JohnM 'Gunner' Wickline of the Faith Baptist Church of Dundas Valley. Pastor Wickline was given the name 'Gunner' as during the Vietnam War he served with the American forces as a machine-gunner on a helicopter. AlthoughI could never match the eloquence of Gunner's delivery, I would like to take this opportunity to read his prayer into Hansard so that others may have the opportunity to read his magnificent words: Lord God, our Maker and our Saviour, we ask today your presence, your blessing, and Your divine enablement, as we gather here, to remember the occasion of the Battle of Long Tan. More than four decades have now passed since then. And, though the victory that was won there, against overwhelming odds, received scant notice here and elsewhere, for those of us who served in Vietnam, it was a defining moment, an occasion that showed irrefutably the courage, and resolve of the Australian Defence Forces to fight to preserve freedom and the values of our nation. We remember today especially those 18 who paid the ultimate price there on that day, and, indeed all the 501 of our brothers who gave their lives in Australia's service during the war in Vietnam. And, Lord, we pray for those brave young men and women who are at this very moment serving in our Army, Navy and Air Force. Lord, we ask that you will grant them safety, that you will preserve their lives, and give them victory as they fight against forces that would attack our way of life and indeed the freedom of all men. And we ask too that, when they return home, they might receive the gratitude and respect of the nation for whom they have sacrificed so much. We pray also for Australia, and all its people who have been brought to this Southern Land. We are thankful for the bounty that you have given to us, and for the liberties that we enjoy.",160,Statements On Indulgence
203,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (12:08,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for EdenHelp us to live as to honour you, and to be ever vigilant to preserve the marvellous gifts that you have entrusted to us. We ask that the bitterness of war, though never forgotten, will be eclipsed by the grace that you have showered upon us and our nation. We ask these things, and we offer our thanks in Jesus' name. Amen! Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (12:12): The 18th of August is Vietnam Veterans Day. It was formerly called Long Tan Day. It is the day when we pay tribute to the men and women who served in the war in Vietnam. This year is indeed a significant milestone because it marks 50 years since Australian soldiers were sent to fight the war in Vietnam, and the Battle of Long Tan represents a very important turning point in the war. It is often called a defining moment in our involvement in the conflict in Vietnam. It was on 18 August 1966 that this famous battle took place-a battle between an Australian battalion of just over 100 men and up to 2,000 enemy troops. Sadly, Long Tan is remembered as the place where Australia lost the most men in one operation. As we have heard today, the Governor General last week officially unveiled a cross that was first erected after the Battle of Long Tan. The cross has been loaned to the Australian War Memorial by a Vietnamese museum, which shows how Australia and Vietnam have overcome the conflicts of the past and worked towards a long-lasting and close friendship. On Saturday, 18 AugustI had the privilege of attending a Vietnam Veterans Day remembrance service at the beautiful Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial on ANZAC Parade. I attend every memorial service I can get to and am always in awe of the wonderful memorialisation we have of those who served and those who died in war here in Canberra, particularly up on ANZAC Parade. I have spoken in the House before about the beautiful Australian Hellenic Memorial that is just up there on the corner of ANZAC Parade. It has the islands of Greece all around it-with the mosaics, which are not terribly good for the high heels, particularly when it rains! But it is a beautiful memorial with the Corinthian pillar, and I have enjoyed many a service there and look forward to many more in the future. I want to take this opportunity to talk about the Vietnam vets memorial on ANZAC Parade because it is a unique and beautiful structure. It was inspired by ancient standing stones, and it is constructed of three twisted, tapered and inclined stelae rising from a triangular shaped base surrounded by a moat. In front of it is a ramp inviting entry into the interior. It is a place for contemplation and remembrance. There is an altar showing the three service badges. So you actually go into this area of contemplation and, in a way, sanctuary. The rear wall has a photo engraving depicting combat troops awaiting helicopter lift-off, and the right-hand stele has 33 phrases typical of the Vietnam era. Above is a suspended ring of granite blocks, one hollowed out and marked with a gold cross, and that contains a scroll with the names of those who died. Outside the memorial are three flagpoles representing the Navy, Army and Air Force, while three memorial seats commemorate those six members listed as missing in action. The service I went to last Saturday was attended by the Governor General and by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. WhatI really enjoyed about the service was the fact that it brought together Vietnam vets from the ACT community and New South Wales and, I understand, from other parts of Australia-and to the member, I did go looking for your constituents. I could not find them, unfortunately. It was a moving service, as it always is. Vietnam veteran Pete Ryan, the Vice-President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia ACT Branch, gave us the introduction and welcome. There was a moving speech by the Governor General, and then an address by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Most importantly, there was also an address by Vietnam veteran Adrian Clunies-Ross, talking about the Australia Army Training Team in Vietnam. He was there in 1962-63, but he was talking about the training team. One of the most poignant elements of it was a deeply moving speech by Cong Le, who was representing the Vietnamese community. He spoke about the Battle of Long Tan. He was only a child when the battle took place. He lived in a village nearby. He recounted the stories of the bravery and the courage of the Australian troops that had been passed down to him by earlier generations-or 'seniors' as he called them. It was really moving to hear from another perspective, a Vietnamese perspective, about the bravery and courage of our soldiers. That for me was one of the real highlights of the commemorative service. As I said, these events have many highlights, but it was a lovely gesture to have someone there from the Vietnamese community recounting their experiences and what they had heard from older generations. There were many members from the Vietnam vets and the Vietnamese community there. We also heard a prayer from Vietnam veteran Ian Thompson who was with 9 Squadron RAAF. One of the highlights of the day and of the service was the honour roll. Ten soldiers who had lost their lives in Vietnam were honoured. Next to the beautiful memorial are the letters of Vietnam spelt out. On the day they had 10 soldiers standing behind each letter, and a gun behind each letter, and as the person who was paying tribute read out the honour roll of the fallen soldiers each soldier stepped forward, saluted and then put a hat on the gun to commemorate those who had lost their lives. I thought that was a fitting tribute and a deeply moving tribute. This was a very special day and I congratulate the ACT and district Vietnam veterans for a very successful event. They were generously assisted, as always, by the ADF, Australia's Federation Guard, the RMC Band and Vietnam veteran 'Major Voice' Robert Morrison, vets affairs, the NCA, the AFP and ACT Policing. It is more than appropriate that we pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in terms of their lives, and also to those who served during the Vietnam War. We should not forget those who were left behind during the war. I am talking here about the wives and the children of the Vietnam vets. My husband is the child of a Vietnam vet, and it is interesting-his father does not talk much about the war. As you know, and as we have heard from many here in this place today, it was one of those wars where people did not come back to any parades; they did not come back to any acknowledgement; they just came back to, in a way, a sense of shame. So his father never talks about it. There was one occasion where he started to talk about it, but that was a very rare event and it was some time ago. When I go to these events honouring those who sacrificed their lives and also the men and women who served, I also think about those wives-because they were mainly wives at that stage-and children who were left behind and I think about the stories that Chris tells me. He has vivid memories of his father sending reel-to-reel tapes back to the family. They would all sit around in the lounge room and listen to the tapes, and here is Chris's mum-bless her heart; she has passed away-with four boys and one girl, at that stage, on her own, sitting around the tape listening to the stories from their dad, which arrived very irregularly. There were also very infrequent phone calls, when he managed to get a chance. I just contrast that to now-I know it is still tough for the men and women who are left behind, whose husbands and wives and partners are serving in Afghanistan and throughout the world, but at least they have got Facebook and other ways of communicating and keeping in touch, whereas then it was very infrequent and sporadic. The thing is that the loneliness of Chris's mum was really underscored the other night when we were talking about this speech and my experience of the Vietnam vets day and he was saying that he had a very vivid memory of his mum; she was putting out the bins one night. Traditionally his father had put out the bins, and this was a dark night and Chris was there in his bed, looking out the window, and he was really worried about his mum, out there in the dark night on her own, putting the bins out-just one of those little childhood fears that you have, but I think it highlights how those women did it on their own. They did it bravely. They did it silently. And the children also did it bravely and silently as well. Chris has also told me about another memory he has from when they were living in the Adelaide Hills, in Woodside. I have spoken about it before in the House. Woodside is in Inverbrackie in the Adelaide Hills. It was during the war-this was 1970-and at that stage it had reached a bit of a pitch in terms of the moratoriums and the protests against the war, and the Army community, or the housing community, had got word that there was going to be a march on the camp, and they were all pretty scared. Normally these sorts of base camps, particularly with the mothers, and the children running around, are pretty benign-they have got guards, but it is all pretty benign-but for the first time ever the guards actually took up pick handles and were wandering around with these pick handles while the kids were playing cricket and footy, just in case someone came in to attack the camp. That did not actually eventuate, but it was, again, one of those things where the kids had no understanding of what was going on; this global geopolitical trauma was playing out and they were, in a way, just caught up in all that. Chris also tells of his experiences at the local school where there was a lot of hatred towards this war, and, unfortunately, anyone who was associated with the warincluding the wives of the vets as well as their children-was often vilified and abused, and that is what actually happened to him at school. So, in saying this, I want to pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice and the men and women who served in Vietnam, but I also want to pay tribute to those who were left behind, who very silently and very bravely put up with a lot of hardship, and also, in some cases, abuse because of the situation that was happening in Australia in terms of the views of the war. I want to pay tribute to those, particularly women and children. Many women got husbands back who were very different from those who left and they just got on with it. I salute them and pay my respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice-the men and women who served in Vietnam and, importantly, their families. Lest we forget. Canberra for that thoughtful speech, with some personal reflections as well. Like all of us in this House, we have rightly been with our communities this past weekend for Vietnam Veterans Day.

In Yarra Glen a large number of veterans, their families and members of the community met at the Yarra Glen RSL for a service that followed a mid-morning march. I want to pay tribute to the president of the Yarra Glen RSL, Ted Bowling; the secretary, Mr Ed Bartosh; and all of those at Yarra Glen who organised what was a fantastic service. We had a guest speaker, Brigadier Michael Phelps, who spoke magnificently. The tribute I Was Only Nineteen was performed by Paul William Ray. Pastor Michael Baimbridge was there and, as you would expect, the Yarra Glen Primary School choir was there to sing the national anthem. Tom Steele, the bugler, a local from Dixons Creek was there. The Croydon Citizens Band, and as I have said, the Outer Eastern Melbourne Sub-Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association were there, and many more were there for a poignant and moving service. As the previous speaker-and, I am sure, speakers earlier in proceedings today-has indicated, the Vietnam War was a very hot spot in a long Cold War. It was a 10-year-long commitment that saw over 60,000 Australian troops serve their country, 500 losing their lives and thousands physically injured, and we know that many, many more came home with the unseen emotional scares of that war. We reflected on Vietnam Veterans Day on the Battle of Long Tan, because it was the 46th anniversary of that significant battle that symbolised so much about the service of Australian troops in Vietnam. In the late afternoon, in torrential rain in a rubber plantation just off the Australian base at Nui Dat, Australian troops, significantly outnumbered against the odds, prevailed in that battle. One person who was not with us this Vietnam Veterans Day was one of the chopper pilots, Cliff Dohle, a local who performed with courage and valour in the Battle of Long Tan. Unfortunately, he passed away just a few years ago and, like all of those in that battle, did not receive due recognition until recently. As previous speakers have indicated, for the Vietnam veterans the war was painful and coming home was painful. I think former Prime Minister John Howard summed it up five or six years ago when he said with candour that the entire Australian community failed our Vietnam veterans. As the member for Canberra eloquently just said, those veterans, their families and their children sometimes suffered vilification and abuse. Although the war was a controversial war-and it surely was-that was so unfair, because the quarrel was with the government of the day, not the troops who were doing their duty. It also has to be said that what also hurt was the general lack of support in the community for so long. I do not say this to rake over past events, but if we as a nation, in our local communities and in our electorates, can in a combined way resolve that that will never happen again then we will have gone a little way to helping with the healing.

208,Mr Melham (Banks) (12:31,"I move:Mallee Electorate: Digital Television on the outcome of digital television conversion in my constituency. When I was first elected in 1993, I realised just how significant access to television really is. At that stage I inherited the broadcast facilities at Mildura, which is the strongest community centre of my whole electorate but at that stage had only two television channels: the ABC and a commercial channel, which was left over from what was a locally owned television channel at that time. Mildura missed out completely on aggregation in the 1980s. I worked very hard with what was then the Australian Broadcasting Authority and succeeded in ultimately getting all five channels that the rest of my constituency had access to. One of those channels had a very unique ownership between the Nine Network and the Seven Network, who joined together to present the Channel 10 Southern Cross signal-a very unique occurrence in Australia. What that meant was that there was a very high concentration of digital set-top boxes in Mildurathe highest in the nation, with 80 per cent penetration. So in late 2009, when the government announced that my constituency was going to be first, I did groan, knowing just how serious an issue television access is. But, to the government's credit and the credit of Senator Conroy, the minister-I know he worked extra hard, because the whole nation was watching what would happen at Mildura-the outcome, despite considerable teething problems, seems to have settled down. But it has left me with television access problems in the remote locations of my constituency. There were five-or really six-principal transmission sites: one at Yatpool, just near Mildura; one at Goschen, near Swan Hill; one at Mount Lawloit, halfway beneath Nhill and Kaniva; and one at Mount Arapiles, projecting a signal into Horsham. Then the eastern edge of my constituency had access to television out of Bendigo and Ballarat. I gauge the success of this on the level of complaints I receive, and I say to the people of Mildura: the complaints have settled down, but if you do have a complaint then first get the best technical advice you can. We have learnt a lot. I note the anxiety that many of my New South Wales colleagues are enduring now as they run through the same battle that we had way back in 2009. Get in touch with Emma Dawson, who is one of Senator Conroy's principal officers. She is a brilliant officer and I give her all the credit. She is just so keen and so committed to the task and was an enormous success and enormous support through the dramas that I had, and she continues to be so because we still have some problems on the eastern corner at Barham and Koondrook with the new transmitter there. There were seven transmitters and we now have double that number, but it just does not seem to have worked at Koondrook because of the deficiencies of the digital signal. It just does not have what the analogue signal gave us, which was good geographic coverage. It had the capacity to go around wet gum trees, which the digital signal does not, so ongoing problems exist at Koondrook. It is not sufficient to say that they can have an alternative service via satellite. They used to have good television prior to the conversion. The other deficiency I am having is along the Henty Highway between Hopetoun and Beulah. I think I might have to concede for Beulah and have to recommend that they take the opportunity to utilise the satellite system that the government has set up under VAST-that is, Viewer Access Satellite Television. It seems to be the only solution that will come for Beulah. Hopetoun is a different kettle of fish. There are now two transmitters sending separate signals",170,Adjournment

This was a great opportunity at the Pitruzzello Estate in Sunbury to meet 18 of the most beautiful young adults as they came out and made their debuts. It was a fantastic night, the surroundings were sensational and I really appreciated the support from the school council president, Jeanine Furey, and principal, Joanne Nolan. The 18 wonderful young adults at the debutante ball were: Amelia Law, Chris Todarello, Ashleigh Ferguson, Daniel Sievers, Caitlin Martin, Meyrick Bowater, Jessica Scott, Ashley Wallin, Lucy Gaschk, Ethan Johnston, Samantha Todarello, Ben Forde, Sharney Tringrove, Jesse Hector, William Martin, Nicholas Allen, Daniel Wright and Jezreel Flakemore. You have never seen 18 more beautiful people in all your life. What magnificent young adults they are and a credit to their families. I also went to the Vietnam Veterans Day commemorations in Seymour on Sunday 12 August, where I was extremely pleased to join with Vietnam veterans and the community to commemorate Vietnam Veterans Day and the 50 years since our first involvement in Vietnam. It was 50 years ago on a hot, humid Friday afternoon in early August 1962 that the main body of the Australian Amy Training Team Vietnam walked down the steps of an aircraft on a hot, sticky tarmac at Tan Son Nhut Airport, Saigon. Led by Colonel Ted Serong, a very experienced leader in jungle warfare, 'The Team', as they became more simply known, was Australia's first commitment to the escalating conflict between North and South Vietnam. Those 30 men were the vanguard of Australia's decade-long involvement in the Vietnam War. More than 62,000 Australians followed and served in our name with distinction and honour. Vietnam Veterans Day is remembered on the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, which occurred on 18 August 1966, when B and D companies of 6RAR fought what has become Australia's most well-known engagement against overwhelming opposition, and prevailed. The first Australians undertook the arduous tasks of patrolling, duty at firebases, flying Caribou transport, serving on the destroyer gun line and keeping the Vung Tau Ferry steaming into South Vietnam and back. All of this was crucial to ensuring that troops were prepared and supported when engagements and battles inevitably came. The Seymour district has a long link with so many of our veterans, both Nashos and regulars, who served and fought together through the time they spent training before their passing out parade at Puckapunyal. That is why it is fitting that Seymour is developing a Vietnam veterans commemorative wall which will serve as a tribute to the 62,100 Australians who went to Vietnam and who served in our name. This includes the 521 Australians who",171,Adjournment

The names of all those Australians will be on a DigiGlass wall and will be the central feature of the wall. There is nowhere else in Australia where the names of everyone who went to Vietnam will be listed in such a way that the public can come and honour them. We need to do that. This is an act of public acknowledgment and in some respects reconciliation. It is no secret that the Vietnam War and Australia's involvement in it caused division at home, in Australian society, especially in the latter years. It is one of the poorer episodes of our nation's history that young men who did nothing but go to where they were sent to fight a war-a war the government committed them to-were somehow held responsible for the political decision to enter that war. But what is now universally accepted, as it should be, is that the service of those who went there should be publicly recognised and lauded. Australians served with professionalism, skill and compassion in Vietnam-a fact acknowledged by their former foes today. I visited many of the locations in Vietnam where Australians soldiers lived, worked, fought and died. I was guided on my visit by a gentleman named 'Breaker' Cusack, an ex-6RAR man, who conveyed to me all the information with great respect to both sides who fought in that battle. Just being able to walk in the footsteps of those who went before me-albeit in far friendlier times, years after the war-was a haunting, emotional and overwhelming experience. It was my personal chance to pause, to reflect and to pay my respects to the brave Australian generation before my own who went to Vietnam in Australia's name. We need to ensure that these men and women are never forgotten. A book that I first read many years ago told the story of a Vietnam veteran. It was titled 'Well done those men'. It detailed the lives of those who went to Vietnam and the after-effects of that on their lives. I and my community say to the 5,500 Vietnam vets who live in McEwen, 'Well done those men, and thank you for everything you have done.' Moncrieff Electorate: Gold Coast States with the new mayor of the Gold Coast, Tom Tate. The mayor and I went to two locations while over there. We went to Las Vegas and Miami. Although Las Vegas is very topical at the moment with Prince Harry's antics, I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that there was no naked cavorting by the mayor or I while we were there. Having put that on the record, we did learn a number of things. TodayI would like to particularly focus on what we learned when we travelled to Miami. In many respects, Miami is like the city I come from, the Gold Coast. They share an incredible wealth of similarities, including common topographies and demographics. Also unique to both cities has been the way in which the property market has performed through the GFC. Miami, it is said within the United States, was the epicentre of the property bubble bursting in that country. Certainly, when we spoke to locals there, they highlighted to us that there were 24,000 condos, or what we would call apartments, left as surplus stock in Miami. It is a story that is not dissimilar to the state of surplus apartments that are now available on the Gold Coast as a result of the number of developments that took place at the height of the GFC. There is, however, one fundamental difference. In Miami they adjusted rules so that foreign investors could purchase these surplus apartments. They allowed foreign investors,",172,Adjournment
212,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (12:42,"RecentlyI had the opportunity to travel to the Unitedpredominantly from South America-places like Brazil, Chili and Peru-and other countries, the opportunity to invest in the 24,000 apartments that sat in Miami. And they did, in great numbers-so much so that there are now no longer any surplus apartments in Miami. In fact, they have new projects underway to help drive jobs locally. That is a point of contrast to the Gold Coast and, indeed, to Australia. TodayI say that the time has come when we should make a concerted change to policy so as to enable foreign investors to purchase strata titled apartments and also to purchase both new and resale strata titled apartments. The policy change is this: currently foreign investors are permitted to buy off the plan a new apartment if it has FIRB approval. However, they are not permitted to purchase on a resale. The argument that has historically been put is that to enable a foreign investor to purchase on a resale of a strata title apartment would push up prices. In my city, where prices are off between 50 and 70 per cent, I think the last thing we need to be concerned about is foreign investors pushing up strata titled apartment prices. What is more, this argument that foreign investors purchasing strata title are going to push up prices completely fails to recognise that there is a natural price cap on apartment prices. The reason there is a natural price cap is that apartments have zero scarcity value. The moment the price of an apartment reaches a certain level it becomes economic to develop another apartment. The moment an apartment value reaches a certain level, it becomes economic to capture a new footprint of land and to build another tower. Because there is no scarcity value and because it is completely different to freehold, there is no sustainable argument as to why you would stop foreign investors from having the opportunity to invest their capital into the Australian market. For a city such as the Gold Coast, which is being absolutely hammered by the poor tourism policies and other policies of this Labor government, we need a policy change like this to ensure that we can help to drive our city and our region forward. This creates opportunity to ensure that we can drive foreign investment into our city, which will help to drive new projects; help to make them economic; help to put a floor underneath the decrease in values that we have seen on strata title apartments; and help to create jobs in the construction industry, which has been our second biggest employer on the Gold Coast after tourism. We know that if foreign investors buy investment properties on, for example, the Gold Coast they will come and holiday there as well. That is also good for tourism. The time has come for there to be a policy change. We need to allow foreign investors to buy not only new stock but also resale stock. There are hundreds, if not arguably thousands, of examples on the Gold Coast where, in some instances, Australians have bought properties, including strata titled apartments, which they have only held for a short while and now wish to sell. We have opportunities to resell those properties back to foreign investors to build up demand and, as I said, to put a floor there, to create new projects that will be economic, to help drive jobs and to help drive investment, because that foreign capital flowing into the country is good news for all of us. Vietnam Veterans Day Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (12:47): I chose not to make a contribution to the Prime Minister's statement on Vietnam Veteran's Day; rather, I thought that I would use the opportunity of my adjournment speech to pay tribute to all those veterans who fought in Vietnam. To my local veterans' community, particularly those in the Hunter; to the Hunter Vietnam Veterans Association-the president John Pollock and the secretary Greg Jehn both come from the Shortland electorate. Both of them have been very instrumental in keeping me well informed of the issues that are important to local vets and, in particular, to Vietnam veterans. The war in Vietnam was a war like no other war. It had an enormous impact on the lives of those who were involved in that conflict. Each year, on Long Tan Day, Vietnam veterans are recognised throughout our communities and in this parliament because of that particular conflict, a conflict that the veterans were involved in. The veterans returned home but were not welcomed in the way that veterans usually are. They were people who were out there fighting for their country because their government asked them to do so. That was very much the case with Vietnam veterans and the young men who fought in Vietnam, some of whom I actually went to school with. In addition to the commemorative service that was held in Newcastle, in the electorate of the Deputy Speaker, I attended another ceremony or a remembrance service down on the central coast at Doyalson RSL. I want to pay tribute to the Doyalson RSL's sub-branch and all those ex-servicemen who are involved in that sub-branch. The services held at the Doyalson RSL are a little different. Not only do they commemorate Australia's involvement and the involvement of our veterans in the Vietnam conflict but they also commemorate the victory in the Pacific. Each year I make a contribution to that service where we remember the Second World War and the contribution made by the veterans involved in that war. The Second World War was like most wars that Australia has been involved in-a war that defined our place in history. The Second World War was the first time that Australians actually had to defend their own shores because Australia itself was under attack. Gallipoli was the first time that Australians came together and fought as a nation; in the Second World War we protected our own country. It was a time that brought about a lot of change in our society. We saw massive industrialisation. It was a time when the role of women in our society changed. Women had to take up the jobs that were performed by many of the men before they were required to go to war. It was a whole-of-nation effort. Everyone joined together. Those who were left in Australia provided the food, the ammunition and the clothing for those who were fighting on the front in Europe or in the Pacific, in New Guinea, where the terrain and the conditions were such that no Australian had ever been subjected to before. These are both major events in Australia's history and it is important that we remember the Victory in the Pacific on 15 August and Long Tan Day on 18 August. Both events played a very important role in Australia's history and both events were defining as far as our nationhood is concerned. Peak Downs Highway the Central Highlands mining towns. It is a vital link in the resource sector that is keeping this country afloat, but my constituents are dying on that road. Mackay families wait at home, hearts in their mouths, as the breadwinner of the family heads to work at the mines or returns at the end of the shift. The Peak Downs Highway was never designed to cope with the volume of heavy traffic that it now carries. The Road Accident Action Group believes it will cost about $400 million to upgrade the Peak Downs Highway. There was a time when the Labor Party wanted us to think they would do something about it. Going into the 2010 election they",173,Adjournment
213,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (12:52,"The Peak Downs Highway connects Mackay topromised, amongst other things, to upgrade the Peak Downs Highway to the tune of $120 million-about a third of what is actually needed. Since they made that promise, the Labor Party have tried to link the project to the mining tax, using it as some sort of bait to fool people into thinking that taxing our golden goose to death is somehow a good idea. Last week the Treasurer sent press releases into Liberal-National Party electorates in regional Queensland, making the false claim that the Liberal-National coalition was going to cut funding to local infrastructure projects, like the Peak Downs Highway, if we got into government. Yet a few days later, on 18 AugustMr Perrett interjectingquoted in the Weekend Australian as threatening to dock infrastructure funding tied to the mining tax if Queensland raised its royalties for the minerals that they actually own. The Treasurer said, 'Major investments in infrastructure in regions like Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Gladstone and Ipswich will be put at risk.' That means that the Townsville Ring Road, the Peak Downs Highway upgrade, Rockhampton's Yeppen Bridge and roundabout, the Gladstone Port Access Road and the Blacksoil Interchange are all under threat of being cut by the Gillard Labor government. This was confirmed on Tuesday this week in the Mackay Daily Mercury when Wayne Swan's 'spokesman' refused to answer when asked if Mr Swan could guarantee that the Peak Downs Highway would be delivered by the Labor government. There you have it. Now the transport minister has issued a press release saying that he has approved the release of $13½ million to do planning work for the Peak Downs Highway upgrade. Well, $13½ million for another study-and this one, we find in the press release, will take two years to complete. They have pushed the start of the construction back so far, way beyond the next election, so that they will never, ever have to worry about it. There is no intention to deliver, because they know they cannot. The mining companies have come out and said that they will not be paying any of this mining tax for the next 10 years. The money was never going to be there and the final nail in the coffin for them is their acceptance now that they have actually killed the golden goose. The mining boom is over, according to the Minister for Resources and Energy. In recent times in my region we have seen closures at Blair Athol and Norwich Park mines, and now Hay Point Coal Terminal is talking about costcutting. That means job losses. Why? Well, back in June, BHP head Marius Kloppers hit the nail on the head when he said that things like increased operating cost, carbon taxes and so on 'have all conspired to turn this from a fairly low-cost environment and therefore competitive to a higher cost environment'. The Labor-Greens carbon tax is bludgeoning our golden goose to death. In Labor seats like Blair and Capricornia, the local members need to stand up. The member for Blair must say whether he will hold the Treasurer to account and make sure the Black Soil interchange is completed, no matter what, as Labor promised at the last election. The member for Capricornia must hold the Treasurer to account and make sure the Yeppen Bridge and roundabout will be completed, no matter what, just as they promised at the last election. She must say whether she will hold the Treasurer to account and make sure that the Peak Downs highway upgrade will happen, no matter what, as they promised at the last election.",175,Adjournment
214,Mr Christensen,"Wait a second; you will hear something good-the Treasurer wasThe Treasurer must say unequivocally whether the promised funding for these infrastructure projects will happen, and whether the Townsville Ring Road will go ahead as promised, no matter what. Whether the Yeppen Bridge and roundabout will go ahead as promised, no matter what. Whether the Gladstone Port access road will go ahead as promised, no matter what. Whether the Black Soil interchange will be finished as promised, no matter what. Whether the Peak Downs highway upgrade will go ahead as promised, no matter what. He must guarantee funding, no matter what. No matter whether there is no money in the mining tax, no matter what the state government does with its royalties, he must guarantee that funding will go ahead. There must be no more broken Labor promises, especially not on the Peak Downs highway. Hearing Awareness Week couple of games of sporting activities that were a little bit different. I played netball on Wednesday morning and touch football this morning. I did so with Australia's first ever Olympian who is deaf, Dean Barton-Smith, who competed in the decathlon. Obviously, he has many skills as a decathlete but one of them is obviously not goal shooting, because he is not the best goal shooter when it came to playing netball. I also played with another international athlete, David Brady. Because this is Hearing Awareness Week, the thing that was different is that when we played there were no whistles, and all of the players who were not hearing impaired-like me-had to wear earplugs. So we were not able to communicate and we were not able to yell for the ball or anything like that. It was quite an experience. I have an email here from David Brady, General Manager, Business Operations, Touch Football Australia. He says: Hi, Graham, I would like to thank you on behalf of Deafness Forum of Australia and Deaf Sports Australia for coming down to the sports fields over the past two mornings to try out netball and touch football with a hearing loss twist. I hope that you had a great experience and it provided you with a small insight into what many Australians experience every day if they are permanently affected by a hearing loss or impairment. They were great activities to be involved with-both the exercise and the Hearing Awareness Week. There were people from all sides of parliament. I noticed Minister Butler was down there playing netball and also Senator Bridget McKenzie from Victoria. After that event we decided to get a politicians' team together to take on the fourth estate, the press gallery. That is a game we will organise later in the year. Obviously, people all over Australia wear earplugs on a daily basis at their work sites to give them protection so they do not lose their hearing. The ear closing experience was certainly an eye opener for me, because it gave me an insight into how tough it is. Nevertheless it was an enjoyable experience. David Brady is someone in point. He has refereed and played touch football down on the Senate oval over years. He wears two hearing aides and is a great touch player and a great referee. It does not hold him back; it is just a different experience. Hearing Awareness Week provides an opportunity for the 22 per cent of Australians aged 15 and over who are deaf or have a hearing impairment to share their experiences and their knowledge and help to create a greater understanding of their needs, aspirations and the",176,Adjournment
215,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12:57,"It was my great pleasure this week to partake in acontributions that they still make to our nation. One in six Australians is deaf, hearing impaired or has a chronic ear disorder. We have a former Prime Minister, Prime Minister Howard, who never let that hold him back in any way, shape or form. He was quite an inspiration to deaf people around Australia, and I think he might even be a patron of some of the national organisations. Our hearing is fragile and, unfortunately, damage cannot be reversed. So to all of those young people listening to your iPods-turn it down! If you cannot hear your fingers click when you have your iPod in, it is up too loud-that is the rule of thumb. Hearing health is crucial to our enjoyment of life, and for most of us here in the chamber it is something that we take for granted. But Hearing Awareness Week is a reminder that we need to regularly have our hearing tested. When I joined the RAAF ReserveI had to have a hearing test, and it was a bit of a shock to me that during all those years I spent playing in bands I probably stood a little bit too close to the speakers. Damage to our hearing is often a gradual process. Some of the early warning signs are you can hear but not understand, you find it hard to hear in noisy situations or where there are groups of people, or you think people mumble. I see the member for Banks here and I have seen him chair caucus meetings that are often quite noisy. He does his best to make sure that the hearing-impaired people are accommodated, but it is a tough job. Hearing impairment, while affecting one in six people, is a disability that often creates inspirational people, such as Dean Barton-Smith, who I met this morning, who became Australia's first deaf Olympic athlete in the decathlon. He is certainly an inspiration to the deaf community, as are, as I have said, Brett Casey and John Howard. The National Week of Deaf People is also coming up in October. It is a special time to celebrate the achievements of Australians whose first language is Auslan, and I would particularly like to acknowledge Deaf Services Queensland, which resides in my electorate of Moreton, in Annerley, and thank them for the excellent work that they do in our community.
