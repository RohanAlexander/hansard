As I have just identified, present to hear this-we raised $14,848m in we know that we will have increased taxation. indirect taxation. Of course, this sales tax adds to indirect taxation. This year, in 1986-87, we talked about option C, the need to rationalise are raising $20,080m-a substantial increase. Of the Australian tax system, to have consistency course, this means that over 30 per cent of all and a comprehensive policy.

The Government taxes the statutory authorities and then says: 'Blame We have had what the Treasurer euphemistiTelecom because it has put its prices up'. The cally describes as a progressive broadening of the Government does not have the courage. It tells wholesale sales tax base.
