The Postmaster-General has ascertained that the ruling rate for such work in Perth is 8s. per day, and he will give instructions that that rate is to be paid in the future. General, upon notice1. Has it been the practice of his Department low:to allow its officers certain holidays, and, in cases when it was not convenient to allow officers off duty on those days, then to permit them to take other time off in lieu thereof, and, if desired, to permit such time off to accumulate and to form an addition to annual leave? 2. Is it a fact that officers are now being charged the cost of relief for days taken from duty in lieu of holidays worked? 3. What is the objection to allowing days off in lieu of holidays worked to accumulate and be taken with annual leave, especially in the case of back-country officials? lowing information has been furnished by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, in answer to questions 1 and 2 :1. It has always been the practice of the Department in this State for as many officers as possible to be allowed off duty on public holidavs. In cases where they are compelled to work on such days, time off in lieu of holiday attendance is permitted. Prior to 1906 officials were allowed to accumulate days in lieu of public holidays worked, and add them to the statutory annual leave. 2. It is not a fact that officers are being charged with the cost of relief for days in lieu of public holidays; but some officials who have asked to'be allowed to employ casual assistance at their own expense during their absence from duty in lieu of certain holidays worked before the present rules came into force, have had their applications acceded to. The reply to question 3 is3. The practice now is to require officers to take leave in lieu of holidays during the year when a Return showingthe public requirements and the convenience of the Department permit. To add to the statutory portedleave days for holidays worked would largely increase the cost of tlie service, encourage unnecessary work on holidays, and,, where there is a large number of officers, make it difficult, if during each of the last two years. not impossible, to arrange for relief if an indefinite number of days were added to ters produced in Australia during each of the statutory leave. Officers in remote districts are last two years. allowed an extra week's leave per annum, and can accumulate leave for two, and, in special ters exported from Australia during each of the crises, three years. and Customs, upon notice1.

The conflict of opinion which has occurred in regard to values is well known, and seems likely to last indefinitely.

Under these circumstances, we consider it fair to impose a fixed duty.

They point out that it is distinctly Australian in origin, ancl that the local manufacturers have a special claim upon the people of the Commonwealth. mission does not show that the machine is of distinctly Australian origin. the Chairman sets out that fact, and the report of the dissenting members of the Commission does not, in any effective fashion, traverse it. particular circumstances of the case we are Tariff.

This is in accordance with the report of the Commission, and is to be embodied in the Bill. one part of the report, but not with the report of the Commission. learned member is quite correct.

It was alleged that certain industries were languishing, and that unless they received, at the earliest possible moment, an increased measure of protection they would collapse. That is why the Tariff Commission was appointed. Its purpose was to inquire into the facts connected with particular trades, to ascertain whether those trades were languishing, and whether it was necessary to grant them extra protection in order to keep them alive. In the case of the distilling industry with which we dealt a few weeks ago, it was conclusively proved -bot h to the Commission and to this Committee-that unless some measure of protection in excess; of that which they alployment in any industry, we may fairly ready enjoyed were granted to the manufacturers they could not continue operations. Consequently a unanimous report from the members of the Commission was presented to this House. But so far from the sworn evidence tendered to the Commission disclosing that the industry which we are now considering is a languishing one, an examination of that evidence reveals that it is one of the most virile and prosperous industries, from an employer's stand-point, that exists in the Commonwealth. At this stage, I intend to saynothing regarding its position 'from a wages point of view, because there are honourable members in this Committee who are entitled to speak with more authority on that subject than I am. But from an employer's stand-point the manufacture of stripper harvesters is one of the most proV. McKay, of the Sunshine Harvester fitable and growing industries that Australia has yet seen. ' Let us examine the position from the point of view of the growth which has taken' place in the manufacture of agricultural implements. I take my information from the latest Victorian figures which were published only a few days ago. Of course, these figures do not differentiate between the persons who are engaged in the manufacture of stripper havesters and those who are employed in [139]2 the manufacture of other agricultural imI t is about two years plements. I find that in Victoria in 1902 there were 789 hands employed in the in-, dustry; in 1903, 1,114; in 1904, 1,496; and in 1905, 1,624. Thus, in an industry which is alleged to be languishing, and to have been more or less strangled through the want of adequate protection, there has been an increase in the labour employed within the short space of four years of more than 100 per cent. that number of hands employed in Victoria. lating to Victoria in my possession. I am not like the honourable member, who relies upon his memory for his facts, and upon his imagination for his original illustrations. I hold in my hand the official re-, turns compiled by the Government Statist of Victoria. I find that in 1905 there were in Australia 2,799 persons employed in the agricultural implement tradea distinct advance upon the number of those who were engaged in the industry prior to that year. When we see such a steady growth of emconclude that it is progressing. But I would point out that there has also been a steady growth in the number of these implements exported. According to the figures supplied by the Prime Minister, there were 418 stripper-harvesters of Australian origin exported ""in 1905, whereas during the first six months of the present year no less than 484 of these machines were exported. I come now to the production and sale of the locallv-manufactured harvesters. Why does not the honourable and learned member give us the figures relating to them ? able member will permit me to develop my argument in my own way.

These figures evidence a steady, growth in the sale of Australian harvesters, and show that since 1901 the and his compeers in the trade has increased threefold. learned member must know that the machine of which he is speaking has displaced another machine, which was doing practically the same class of work. has almost annihilated the stripper, and that it has superseded the binder in a great many directions. honourable and learned member is quoting refer to the total output of machines by all makers? growth in the sale of locally-made harvesters is an evidence that the industry is progressing, as is also the fact that more hands are employed, and that more machines have been exported. which I have quoted relate to locally-made machines only. There were no machines imported prior to 190T or 1902. wish also to point out that the manager Tariff last vear he turned out 1,930 of these machines. That fact proves that the manufacturers engaged in this industryhave not been doing too badly. These figures effectually dispose of the claim that agricultural implements which were imthe industry is a languishing one. They show that it is a progressive and virile in^ 4 3 ..ooo. dustry, and one of which we ought to be proud. In regard to the sales of imported machines, I find from the figures which were presented to the Tariff Commission that in 1902-whic h was the first year during which they were imported in anv quantity-ther e were 160 brought in . In 1903 there were 500 machines imported; in 1904, 1,700; and in 1905, 1,730, of which between 1,350 and 1,400 were sold. If honourable members will look at the imports for 1902 they will see that out of every four machines which were sold only about one was an imported machine. A perusal of the figures relating to 1905 will show that the same proportion is still preserved. Out of every four machines sold, last year only about one was imported, the other three being locally manufactured. I am well within the bounds of accuracy when I say that practically 70 per cent, of the harvesters sold are machines of local origin. The statistics which I have quoted establish the fact that there has been no displacement of locally manufactured harvesters. The machines which have been imported were brought in to supplement the output of the local manufacturers, and were not supplanting them. The fact that the output has trebled within the last few years conclusively proves that the Australian industry has not been supplanted', and it also evidences that the machines imported I am aware that it were introduced to supply the demand which existed for them. In the absence of a demand there would not have been that importation. The trade of the local manufacturer has trebled within the last few years, and the importation of harvesters from Canada and America has been the means of supplementing the output of the trade, and of giving those upon the land a wider range of patterns from which to choose. the value of the harvesting machinery which The figures was imported in 1900 outside of binders?

I think that an examination of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that, not only has there been a large number of machines made locally, but that their manufacture has proved exceptionally profitable. After reading the evidence I venture to say that there have been of late years few industrial concerns in Australia that have proved so profitable as has the manufacture of harvesters. If honourable members will bear with me, I think that I shall be able to substantiate this statement. There is no evidence whatever that the local manufacturers are not making a profit-ever y shred of evidence is in the opposite direction. In said, "" I can frankly admit that business has increased substantially."" Mr James Moore, manager of Robinson and Co., also said that ""none""-meanin g the local manufacturers"" that I know of are losing.""

All this evidence' shows that the trade is a profitable one.

If any honourable member could secure such a profit within that space of time, I am quite sure that he would be content to "" languish."" his evidence before the Commission, was about 300 machines, and to-day it is somethink like six times greater. His manager says that his output last season consisted of about 1,930 machines. If with an output of less than 500 machines per annum MrÂ£ 1 8 .

If these machines were sold at Â£ 5 0 or Â£ 5 5 each, there would be no necessity for the firms concerned to advertise extensively, because it is the price after all that tickles the public fancy. With a reduction to something like Â£ 5 5 per machine a large proportion of the cost of selling incurred by Air. McKay and others would disappear. They would secure the whole market, and it would be unnecessary for them as at present to publish large advertising cartoons in the Sydney press, or' interviews and paragraphs in every country newspaper. It would likewise be no longer necessary for them to employ artists of greati ability to draw, (excellent advertising pictures, and in other directions the selling cost' would be cut down. If the price were reduced in the way I suggest, there could be a great saving in advertising and other selling expenses, because the reduction would give a most effectual advertisement for which nothing would have to be paid. If the manufacturers were satisfied with a 'profit of Â£ 5 on each machine sold, the sale of 2,000 -whic h is the present output of one maker --woul d yield a profit of ,Â£10,000 per annum. Most of us could exist on an income as large as that. In my opinion, it is possible to reduce the prices of the locally-made machines enormously, and yet obtain a profit of Â£ 5 each. That is shown by the particulars as to cost of manufacture revealed by one maker. The cost of selling was variously estimated by several witnesses, but if the mean of the amount so stated is taken, and added to the cost of manufacture, it will be seen, on deducting the total from the price charged to the farmer, that the profit obtained is entirely disproportionate. The evidence put before the Tariff Commission shows that 99 per cent, of the Australian business could be secured by local makers without the aid of additional duties, and even without duties, if prices were reduced to a level which would give farmers the implements they need at a reasonable cost, and would return a substantial profit to the manufachis output was only 300 maohines, and the expansion of his industry has taken place under a duty of Â£ 5 4s. 7d. a machine. This shows that the local manufacturers could get practically the whole of the Australian trade into their hands and drive getting the duties increased, or issuing a paper called the Dairy Farmer and branding it "" O.HMS.,"" or resorting to any other devious method, by taking the straightforward course of reducing their prices to amounts which would give them a fair profit. The Minister of Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister repeated to-day that prices are to be reduced. They spoke of this reduction as something wonderful, which would greatly benefit the farmers. the manufacturers say that they cannot face it. they faced it in the past. The Prime Minister says that the cash price must be re duced to a certain sum, and I therefore ask him what he will do if , of . twenty manufacturers, fifteen reduce their prices and the remaining five do not? Will the duty be increased ? Or will it be reduced ? Or will it remain as it is? have not thought of that yet. attendance of the Minister of Trade and Customs when matters affecting his Department are being discussed, because we are entitled to know whether the Government have a scheme to meet this difficulty. What steps are to be taken if some of the manufacturers refuse to reduce their prices? Then, again, suppose that one manufacturer goes a mile or two beyond Braybrook, and evades the conditions imposed by the Victorian Wages Boards, what is to be done? Is the duty to be reduced or is it to be increased ? le'arned member is looking round for trouble. the baits which are being held out to the farmers and workers respectively are merely sprats to catch mackerel, because any spry, progressive manufacturer, capable of writing the interviews I have here, could gallop through the proposed restrictions.

The majority of farmers buy on time, and there is nothing in the proposed conditions to benefit those who have to pay in two or three instalments. orable member is in the happy position of being able to write a cheque for what he buys; but there are many farmers who have to get promissory notes, and to obtain fifteen to eighteen months' terms when they purchase machines.

If he did, he would not make that statement. dealing with cash prices throughout. learned member know that the reduced prices are in force to-day? price lists which will show exactly what the present prices are. The Minister, when endeavouring to show that I knew nothing about this matter, read from the price list of Hugh Lennon, which he said bore out his statements, though, as a matter of fact, it bears out mine. Mr Lennon's price for a 5-ft. machine', type A, is Â£ 7 5 if paid for by a promissory note, due March, 1907. That' was the price the Minister quoted; but he failed to read a footnote stating that if cash in full settle ment is paid the day that the harvester is started a reduction of 5 per cent, will be made; which makes the cash price Â£ 7 1 ss. Then he told us that the price for 5 f t . 6 in. machines was Â£ 8 0 ; but a similar reduction for cash brings it down to Â£ 7 6 . The cash price of a 5 f t . machine is to-day therefore ,Â£71 5s., and the Minister next year is going to bring it down to Â£ 7 0 , a saving of the immense sum of 25s.

In 1901, when the manufacture of harvesters had not assumed anything like its present proportions, and when the methods of production were more costly and the article was not so good, Messrs. Martin and Company, of South Australia, advertised in the Kapunda Herald that they would sell their machines for Â£ 7 0 cash. They also quoted to the Murtoa Farmers' Uniona union composed of farmers only different machine. machine had since been improved. manufacture has also been reduced. Messrs. Martin and Company offered to sell their machines to the Murtoa Union at Â£ 6 3 each, if three machines were taken. Their price was Â£ 7 0 , less 10 per cent., or Â£ 6 3 . The lowest price, quoted by the Minister as that which would be reached in years to come is, therefore, higher than the lowest price charged in the past. In other words, the lowest price to be charged two years hence is Â£ 2 in advance of the lowest quotation of two years ago. Thus a nice sop is being offered to the farmers. The attempt to curry favour with them is absolutely farcical, because no reduction whatever is being made in the cost of the.machines. If the object be to confer benefit upon the farmer, the price of the 5-ft. ma. chines should be at once reduced to Â£ 6 5 , and in the two following years, to Â£ 6 0 . t and Â£ 5 5 respectively. Commission say that the standard price was Â£81? the time they were taking evidence the machines were being sold for Â£81. Â£ 8 1 was a monstrous price. that each and every one of the statements that I have made, except those relating to the quotations from two or three price lists, is supported by the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission. One of the price lists was quoted by the Minister of Trade and 1 Customs, and can, therefore, be accepted by members on both sides 'of the Chamber. But, according to the price list We find, upon examination of the evidence ' to. which I refer, that the imported machines have not supplanted the Ideallymanufactured article, but have merely supplemented the supply furnished by Austra-lian manufacturers, and, further, that the importations have not crushed the local manufacture, which is rapidly advancing, and has been doing so for years past. I think, moreover, that the evidence establishes beyond any. chance of contradiction that the importation of harvesters could be absolutely prevented by a substantial reduction in the price of the Australian machines a reduction which could be made without, precluding the manufacturers from deriving a good profit. the Australian machines sold in Argentina ? question to answer. The natural protection on stripper harvesters is very substantial.

150,Mr Robinson,"Exactly. . WhetherTariff. A In the first place, I desire to compliment the Prime Minister upon the very moderate and business-like manner in which he initiated thjs discussion. I am sure that the cause will not suffer through being in his hands. It is not my intention to make such a long and elaborate speech as that which was delivered by the honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat. fan be urged in favour of the recommendations submitted by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission are fully set forth in their report, and I certainly could not improve the statement which is there presented by any speech which I might make here. It is naturally my determination and that of my colleagues who signed that report to stand by it, and to defend it in every legitimate manner. I would point out that' the report in favour of levying an increased duty on harvesters was signed by myself as Chairman of the Commission representing Victoria, by Mr Frank Clarke representing New South Wales, by Senator Higgs representing Queensland, and by Senator McGregor representing South Australia. members of the Commission. I ' would point out that our recommendations commenced with the paragraph in which we suggestThat in trade between the States and with other countries combines and agreements between sentatives, certifying to the foregoing effect, by importers, manufacturers, and dealers in machinery and implements in restraint of trade, and fixing or regulating selling prices, be deas ni iv be deemed advisable. clared illegal, and made a criminal offence. The reason underlying that recommendation is that in the course of our investigations we found that during 1904-5 there was, an agreement signed by the leading manufacturing firms in Australia, and also by the International Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris Company under which the selling price of harvesters was fixed at Â£ 8 1 . The effect of that agreement was to raise the price of harvesters in some cases from Â£ 7 0 to Â£ 8 1 , and in one case to lower it from Â£ 8 5 to Â£ 8 3 selling his machines at a little higher price than the standard fixed by the combine. We found that that agreement was calculated to be prejudicial to the interests of the public, and the recommendation which I ' have read was written long before *he initiation of the Australian In[REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. . _ dustries Preservation Bill by the Ministry. As honourable members will recollect, I strongly supported a clause in that Bill which makes the establishment, of combines in restraint of trade an illegal act. Our second recommendation was(b) That the duty on stripper-harvesters be as follows :. Stripper-harvester, existing duty to remain unaltered, ad valorem, 12^ per cent. Additional duty per machine, subject to conEverything which ditions hereinafter provided, ad valorem, 12% per cent. That was arrived at by a consideration of the protective duty which was levied under the Victorian Tariff at the time of the establishment of the Federation. Speaking upon my own behalf, I say emphatically that I am not prepared to support a higher duty than 25 per cent. ad. valorem 0 upon the Â£ 3 8 machine. This proposed increase of duty was to be accompanied not only by the prohibition of combine agreements, but also by other conditions which read as follows:Provided that if , within two years after the passing of the Act, the retail price of stripper harvesters made in Australia has been raised above Â£ 8 1 ; or if , after the expiration of two years from the passing of the Act, the retail price of stripper-harvesters made in Australia We are the four protectionist has not been reduced to Â£ 7 0 ; or if , after the expiration of one year from the passing of the Act, the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters in Australia are not paying their workmen a fair and reasonable rate of wages, the Governor General may, upon the receipt of a joint A d dress fiom the Senate and the House of RepreProclamation, suspend the collection of such, additional duty of 12^ per cent, for such perio-i In the first place there is a condition that there shall be no increase at any time above the price mentioned in the combine agreement, namely, Â£ 8 1 . existence ? solved towards the end of 1905. But I would point out that, under our recommendations, if the manufacturers at any time proposed to increase the price of these machines above Â£ 8 1 Parliament; could intervene to prevent it. But in addition to the prohibition against an increase in the price, a distinct condition is-imposed that there must be a reduction in the selling price of these machines withintwo years after the passing of the Acta reduction from Â£8.1 to Â£ 7 0 .

They voluntarily agreed to do so, and some of them offered to sign a bond to that effect. The reduction in question is not a mere arbitrary invention upon the part of the protectionist members of the Commission. We took the manufacturers at their word, and we made our recommendations conditional upon certain guarantees and concessions being made to the users of these machines and to the workmen who are engaged in their manufacture. 1 learned member going to bind the manufacturers to such conditions? that aspect of the matter presently. dition imposed? and reasonable wage should be paid by the manufacturers to their workmen ; otherwise, upon the adoption of a joint address by both Houses of Parliament the additional duties might be suspended. firm of manufacturers paid fair wages whilst other firms did not? liament would not agree to continue the collection of the additional duties if it found that fair wages were not being paid to their employees by the bulk of the manufacturers. If Parliament, upon inquiry, found that the majority of those engaged in the trade were not being paid a fair and reasonable rate of wage, and that the duty was being pocketed by the manufacturers, it would pass the joint address to which I have referred. I assume that we should take a common sense view of the matter. I now wish to draw attention to a few. paragraphs in the report, in which the reason underlying the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Commission are summarized. The first reason will be found in paragraph 8 of our conclusions, which readsThat both the Canadian and American companies have imitated and copied Australian-made stripper-harvesters; that, in so doing, we cannot find any evidence that they have violated any patent rights. It is proved conclusively that the stripperharvester was invented in Australia-that it was evolved as the result of experience of, and the expenditure of money by, Australian agriculturists and inventors, and that it was copied by the representatives of American and Canadian manufacturers. We found that, as a matter of fact, these foreign firms did nothing illegal in copying these machines, and that there had been no violation of patent rights; but that, since they had taken this action, the Legislature might be fairly recommended to discriminate in the imposition of Customs duties in favour of the local manufacturers of machines that were invented and brought up-to-date here. The next reason for our recommendation will be found in paragraph 18, which reads as follows :That notwithstanding the heavy importing expenses, in addition to the duty which the Massey-Harris and the International Harvester Companies have had to pay in order to place their machines on the Australian market, it is quite evident they have been able to enter the field of Australian competition. That they have competed successfully with the Australian stripper-harvester makers, that Ihey are graduallygaining ground, and increasing their hold on the Australian market, are shown by the heavy increase in their imports of stripper-harvesters, which in 1900 were n i l , while in 1905 they were 1,730. That the explanation of such successful competition is the more favorable industrial conditions in the United States and Canada than in Australia; that in those countries labour, although in some instances more highly paid, is in reality cheaper, being based upon a system of piece-work, or payment by resultsWe then go on to show that the raw materials are also cheaper in Canada and America than they are in Australia. The next reason for our recommendation appears in paragraph 20That we are of opinion that the MasseyHarris and the International Harvester Companies make stripper-harvesters at a cheaper rate than the manufacturers in Australia, ancl that they are able, notwithstanding the natural protection of distance and shipping charges, as well as the duty, to go on increasing their imports to swamp, and eventually capture, the whole of the Australian trade in stripper-harvesters; that such a result would be a great calamity to Australian trade, commerce, and industry, and would in its ultimate consequences be most injurious and disastrous to .farmers, who would thereby be placed at the mercy of foreign organizations for their supplies; that such organizations, after having effaced local factories ancl industries, would be able to dictate terms and to name their own prices without the health) check of local competition; that we are, therefore, of opinion that the existing duty of i x i per cent, not having proved sufficient to shut out or limit the growing volume of importer! implements and machinery, it is desirable thai there should be an increase in the present duty : at the same time such increased duty should be accompanied by safeguards and securities foi",28,Exports

160,Sir John Quick,"I assume that Parthe protecting of the interest of farmers as well as for the protection of workmen engaged in the manufacture of implements and machinery in Australia. The last reason is as follows: That we are of opinion that .the result of the proposed increased duty will be to reduce importations and to augment local production and output; that the greater the local production and output the less will be the prime factory cost; lhat therefore the selling price of stripper-harvesters will not necessarilyj and certainly ought not to, be raised by local manufacturers by reason of such increased duty. They say they do not hope or desire to take advantage of the increased duty, or to raise the price of the stripper-harvesters to consumers. I do not wish to repeat these arguments. They are already in black and white, and I merely draw attention to them as indicating the reasons on which we arrived at the conclusion that there should be an increased duty. Such being the case, the question arises as to whether the increased duty should be an ad valorem or a fixed one. We arrived at the determination that there should be an ad valorem rate. I frankly admit that the question is a debatable one, and I should not quarrel with the Government for proposing an alternative fixed duty, provided that it was based upon the ad valorem equivalent, and that there was no augmentation of the proposed protection of 25 per cent, ad valorem. The point that we have to consider is whether or not the duty of ,Â£16 per machine proposed by the Minister is equal to an ad valorem duty of. 25 per cent. I am. strongly of opinion that it is not. The Minister, whilst accepting our recommendation as to an ad valorem rate of 25 per cent., has refused to adopt our finding that, as a matter of fact, the value of these machines in the country of origin-and that is the Customs test-is ,Â£38 odd. Twenty-five per cent, on that valuation, with 10 per cent, added, yields, approximately, Â£ 1 0 per machine. I am prepared to accept a fixed duty of Â£ i o , which is equivalent to the ad valorem rate. I understand, however, that the Minister, while agreeing to the ad valorem rate of 25 per cent., does not accept the valuation of Â£ 3 8 'arrived at by us, and wishes the Committee to adopt his own estimate of Â£ 6 5 per machine. There was not a scintilla of evidence given before the Commission to sustain that rough and ready estimate arrived at by the Minister. of departmental garrotting. Sir John Quick. upon a bare suggestion made to the Minister dence. As a matter of fact, that suggestion has been absolutely refuted by positive evidence. I believe that he told the Minister that machines! were being sold and delivered in Italy by the Massey-Harris Company at Â£ 6 5 ; that statement was embodied in an affidavit which! he filed in the Department, and another affidavit was also made to the effect that Messrs. Moore and Tudor, of Buenos Ay res, had bought a machine from the Massey-Harris Company at an invoice price of Â£ 4 6 4s. 8d. These statements were fully investigated by the Commission, and documentary evidence was submitted to it to the effectthat the Italian selling price of Â£ 6 5 represented what is called the c.i.f -the cost, insurance, and freight-pric e of the machine delivered at Genoa, whereas the cash equivalent at the Toronto factory of that same machineand only one machine was sold as an experiment-amounte d to only Â£ 3 8 os. 3d. That evidence was given on oath, and was not successfully refuted. than that of a representative of the company concerned tendered to the Commission in connection with this question? could be only within the 'knowledge of a representative of the company. It is obvious that Â£ 6 5 is not the price in the country of origin. The true test is the price in the markets of the country of origin, and we have evidence on oath that it is Â£38. We also discovered that the invoice price of Â£ 4 6 4s. 8d., at which a machine was sold and delivered to Messrs. Moore and Tudor, of Buenos Ayres, was the firm's price, f.o.b., at New York.

I have (riven two instances of the way in which the Minister's estimate was arrived at, whilst another relates to the price at which machines were sold and delivered to Messrs. Clutterbuck and Co., of Adelaide. It was stated that they had bought machines for Â£ 4 0 15s., and that was represented as the value in the country of origin. transpired, however, that the cash equivalent was only Â£ 3 9 14s. 2d., and that the difference between that amcjunt and the Â£ 3 8 standard represented the profit of the Melbourne agency. Therefore, it appears that in these three cases, in respect of which the Minister had probably been misthe factory value of the machine amounted approximately to Â£ 3 8 . The next important piece of evidence submitted to the Commission was statement, McMichael, chief inspector of the Customs Department, at Ottawa, Canada. An application for a valuation was made to the Canadian Commissioner of Customs, letter dated 20th October, 1904In respect to the values shown in the invoice attached to the file, viz., 183 dollars, with 2 dollars extra for poles and adjustments, it appears that such values represent the price at which the machines in question are sold at wholeprotection .should be given to allow local sale by the Massey-Harris Company to such countries as require machines of this character, and that this wholesale price has been arrived at on a basis of similar percentage of advance over factory cost as in the case of other machines a fixed duty of more than Â£10 each on manufactured and sold by the Massey-Harris Company to Great Britain and other European countries, South Africa, South America, Manitoba, and the Canadian and Western territories. Upon careful investigation and examination of the books of the Massey-Harris Company, I am satisfied that the invoice price for stripper harvesters, viz., 183 dollars, with 2 dollars extra for poles and adjustments, represents a fair wholesale market value of these machines. In British coinage, $183 represents Â£ 3 8 2s. 6d. The statement which I have just read seems to supply prima facie evidence that the valuationof harvesters for duty here should not exceed Â£ 3 8 plus 10 per cent., and therefore the members of the Commission are unable to acquiesce in the Minister's valuation of Â£ 6 5 , which is evidently based on inaccurate information. He may be legally justified in what he has done, and may have acted in accordance with his lights. I believe that he has in1 vited the-companies affected to take action against the Department with a view to testing the accuracy ot his valuation, and that the, High Court or the Supreme Court of Victoria has ordered a commission to be issued directing an examination into the subject in CanadaI t is obvious that unless on cross-examination the information which I have placed before the Committee is upset, tlie valuation of Â£ 3 8 must be accepted. A duty of 25 per cent, would It be equivalent on that valuation to a fixed duty of about Â£ JO a machine. The Tariff Commission sav in paragraph 22 of their conclusions thati f the duty be raised from 12^ to 25 per cent. ad valorem on the invoice value of stripper harvesters, then an invoice value of ^38 odd will yield a duty of Â£ \ o gs. 2d.; but if the present valuation for duty fixed by the Minister of Customs at ^65 be sustained, which now yields a duty of Â£& 23. 6d., this, at 25 per cent., will give Â£16 5s. per machine. a declaration, or A fixed duty of Â£16 per machine is equimade by Mr F. W. valent to an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, on a valuation of Â£38, which is practically the Minister's proposal. I, for my part, decline to follow his lead in this matter. With all respect to him, I say' that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission whose conclusion I have read have investigated the subject even more closely than he has done. We heard a great deal of evidence, and formed the opinion that, whilst fair and substantial manufacturers to keep the Australian market, the duty should not be. made excessive.

Yours truly, WM. I think that the proposals of the Tariff Commission may be submitted in the confident belief that they will not result in in creasing the price of harvesters to the consumers. If I thought that the prices to consumers would be increased, I should not have been a party to the recommendation which has been made. I have done my best to surround the concession to the manufacturers with safeguards for the protection of the farmers as well as for the protection of the workmen engaged in the industry. If the recommendation of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission is accepted by Parliament, the local manufacturers will be put on their metal, and it will demonstrate that protective duties properly adjusted and safeguarded 'do not tend to the increase of prices. rounded with a lot of barbed wire.

188,Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.55],"I was very86 true, as the honourable and learned member for Illawarra has stated, that we should first consider those industries! which do not at present enjoy any protection. Some honourable members seem to entertain the idea that manufactures alone form the basis of industrial prosperity. What, however, would be the position of our manufacturers! if a serious blow were struck at our agricultural industry, or at our pastoral industry, as the result of reciprocal Tariff arrangements or other conditions? Honourable members must agree that it is to our primary industries we must first look for any stimulus to our industrial prosperity. No protection is now afforded to them, although some pretence has been made to confer a benefit upon them by the imposition of import duties. We have an overflowing supply of wheat, and yet a duty is imposed upon that product, which becomes operative only when it ""ought to be suspended, namely, when famine prices prevail. contribute thousands of pounds by way of a duty upon wheat. a wheat or fodder duty becomes operative only when it should cease to exist-whe n a few members of the producing interests derive an immense profit at the expense of the bulk of the consumers. I say, therefore, that we ought not, while desirous of considering them, to be always hammering away at the interests of the manufacturers only. Some honourable members appear to think that the only barometer to the industrial state of the Commonwealth is supplied by the answer which is given to the question "" How are the manufacturers of Victoria getting along?"" For instance, in reference to the firm in this State whose operations have been frequently mentioned by honourable members, the question has been asked, "" Why should not its members make a big profit ? "" -Why should Parliament be asked to make them better off than they are at the expense of the rest of the community? To my mind, the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that a trial ought to be made of a sort of compromise duty of about Â£ 1 0 per machine is a very sensible one. gests that a lower duty should be imposed, and if the honourable member will move in Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. that direction I shall support him. But in all these matters it seems to me that we must act in a spirit of compromise. orable and learned member admits that the increased measure of protection proposed learned member for Bendigo cannot justify the position which he has taken up. the suggestion as one which he has made in a spirit of moderation. evidence which would justify his suggestion. have had thrown upon the question has been gained by a perusal of a portion of the evidence tendered to the Commission, and by a careful reading of the two reports which have been presented. It seems to me perfectly plain that the variations of prosperity which have been experienced by the agricultural implement manufacturers are entirely due to the seasons. Since the establishment of Federation, they appear to have done very well. From one of the reports of the Commission dealing with agricultural implements and machinery, including harvesters, I find that whereas in 1899 the total number of hands employed in the industry was 1,580, in 1905 it was 2,799. In South Australia, where some of the electors are pressing for the imposition of a higher duty, there were, according to the report, only 242 hands employed in the industry in 1899, as against 723 last year. It is significant that in South Australia the increase in the number of hands employed has been most marked since the duty upon agricultural implements was reduced from 15 per cent, to 12 per cent. That1 fact, I think, proves that the reduction, if the relation of cause and effect can at all But -the real point is be alleged, has produced an increased prosperity rather than an imaginary decay. These variations of prosperity are really due to the state of our primary industries. The local manufacturers of these implements, like the importers, experience better times when we enjoy good seasons. I think that the figures which I have in my possession sufficiently indicate the reasonableness of my remarks. That the state of the primary industries is the principal index of the prosperity or otherwise of the manufacturers of agricultural implements is evi-",33,Exports

Consequently, its distribution of these machines depended not upon the variation of the fiscal duty, but upon the demand created by a good harvest. celled the orders. tions in our imports follow the state of our agricultural and pastoral prosperity. For example, whereas the value of the Victorian' imports of agricultural implements increased from Â£111,880 in 1899 to Â£252,256 in 1904, it declined in 1905 to Â£118,370. favour of the imposition of higher duties upon agricultural implements appears to have been given by some Victorian manufacturers. Sir turers in South Australia and New South Wales. The evidence in favour of an increased duty was obtained in three of the States. ment of the honourable and learned member. I read the evidence given by Mr Moore, and a portion of that tendered by Mr pany 125, and the McKay Brothers 975. McKay. Mr Moore, of Messrs. Robinson and Company was put forward as the representative of the manufacturers of Victoria, if not of the Commonwealth. His evidence justifies the following summary of the position of the Victorian implement makers, which will be found upon page 11 of the Fifth Progress Report of the Tariff Commission. Victorian implement and machinery makers have derived a great benefit and advantage by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. S'nce rgor the transfer of manufactures of this kind, of Victorian origin, from Victoria into the States of the Commonwealth, has increased by leaps and bounds, and has largely exceeded transfers into Victoria of similar goods from other States. There is an array of figures given in proof of that statement which I do not intend to quote. They show that in 1899 the value of the Inter-State transfers of agricultural implements into Victoria was Â£3.301, whereas the value of the transfers from Â£92,861. They further show that though the value of the Inter-State transfers into Victoria in 1905 had increased to Â£23,563, those frpm Victoria were valued at Â£157,689. These figures show a rapidly increasing prosperity in the manufacture of agricultural implements. The report which I have quoted deals with harvesters, but I have been supplied with some figures which 'are not contained in that report. They were submitted to me by a person upon whose accuracy I think I can rely. The figures show that if the South Australian manufacturers entertain any fear of competition it is not the competition of the importer that they need apprehend, but that of the manufacturers in the other States. The South ^Australian manufacturers, it seems to me, need not fear Inter-State competition, because whilst it is true that a great many machines are The principal evidence in sent into their State from Victoria they in turn also export to the other States, and, for enterprise and efficiency, are able to hold thekii own under conditions of InterState free-trade. The total number of JOHN QUICK -And by manufacstripper-harvesters sold in South Australia during the years 1900 to 1905 inclusive was 2,972. Of these the South Australian manufacturers supplied 540, the importers 969, and the Victorian manufacturers 1,463. In those years the Massey-Harris Company sold in South Australia 844 machines, the International Harvester ComWe are constantly hearing of the competition of the International Harvester Company, which supplied only 125 machines. In view of the proposals which we shall shortly be called upon to consider regarding preferential trade, the circumstance to which I have referred is a very curious one, because we must recollect that duties of this character will strike at the MasseyHarris Company rather than at the International Harvester Company. I will leave it to the Government to reconcile their policy with thefigureswhich I have quoted. What really does handicap some of the exporters of these machines, as between State and State, and particularly the South Australian manufacturers, are the heavy shipping freights between the various ports. For instance, the freight which is levied, say, between Fremantle and Melbourne is actually more than that charged between New York and Melbourne. I know from inquiry which I made about a year ago this State to others was that the South Australian manufacturers are subjected to a very severe handicap by reason of the stiff freights which are charged by the shipping companies engaged",34,Exports

202,Mr Glynn,"I quite accept the statein our coastal trade. If , under a duty of 12I per cent., which represents upon a Â£38 valuation of these machines, conditions of prosperity have been realized by the manufacturers of agricultural implements during the last five or six years, and if those conditions have been maintained even though the imports were slightly checked under the' operation of a similar duty upon a Â£65 valuation, which is equivalent to a charge of Â£8 2s. 6d., it seems to me that we do not require to levy a specific duty of Â£16 upon them. ought, I think, to compliment the chairman of the Tariff Commission upon the fairness of his views as a protectionist. I do not say that his proposal represents the proper deduction from the evidence as to the duty that should be levied; the honourable and learned member for Illawarra has had something to say on that point. But we must compliment the honourable and learned member for Bendigo upon the reasonableness of his suggestion that, even from the point of view of the protectionists, the duty ought not to exceed Â£10 per machine. Since, on a. valuation of ,Â£38, 12 per cent -the duty prevailing 1 prior to the introduction of these proposals -would 'amount to Â£5 4s. 6d.; and, on a valuation of Â£65, would amount to Â£8 2S. 6d., surely the members of the protectionist party will not object to the proposal that a specific duty of Â£10 shall be imposed. I cannot understand on what ground any reasonable protectionist could object to the amendment suggested by the honourable ancl learned member for -Bendigo, although, as a free-trader, I should prefer a duty approximating more nearly to free-trade views of what the evidence suggested. to-daythat the Minister was forced to propose a specific duty, owing to difficulties experienced in arriving at a true valuation. Those difficulties have been removed by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission who points out that, according to the evidence, the valuation of Â£38, which was challenged by the Minister of Trade and Customs, ought to be adopted. If the difficulty experienced in arriving at a true valuation is responsible for the action jÂ£i4 12s. 6d., then a duty of Â£ 2 5 , -plus of the Government in proposing a specific rather than an ad valorem duty, why do they not say that they will take the local cost of production as an approximate indication of the cost at the American or Canadian port of exportation ? They could do Mr Glynn. so if they secured the co-operation of the 4s. 7d. local manufacturers. Why should notthese manufacturers-som e of whom are very anxious to supply the Minister with what we are now told was mistaken testimony when their personal interests are strongly involved-in the interests of the Commonwealth, afford some guidance to the Government? We are led to understand that one of the McKay Brothers supplied the Minister with an affidavit suggesting that the value of these We imported machines in the country of origin is Â£ 6 5 , less the 10 per cent. Let him give the Prime Minister evidence as to the local cost of production. According to the reports now under consideration, the conditions of production here are not so different from those prevailing in Canada or the United States that they cannot be taken as an approximate guide. We are not driven from sneer necessity' to 1 adopt the Government proposal. By taking the cost of local production, we can arrive at an approximately correct basis of valuation, and if that were done we should also have the advantage of knowing something of what was ""oing on locally. I am afraid, however, that we shall not obtain this information. I would again remind the Committee of the fact that if we strike an average of the duties prevailing prior to the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff of 1901, we arrive at a rate much lower than the specific duty of Â£ 1 0 which has been suggested. I need only refer to the evidence upon that point supplied by the two reports now under consideration. In South Australia the'duty was only 15 per cent. ad valorem, whilst in America and Canada The Prime Minister said the rate was 20 per cent. It would be unfair, however, to refer, for the purposes of comparison, to the duty prevailing in the last-named country, since these machines are not used there, and there is no importation for local purposes. Evidence was given showing that if the duty of Â£ 2 5 were accepted, it would mean prohibition. If the cost of landing these machines in Australia from the ports of exportation on the American Continent is that cost, would give a protection of practically Â£ 4 0 in respect of machines which, according to the best evidence before us, can be manufactured locally for less than Â£ 4 0 each. That is a class of protection which, if we were willing to impose it, the farmers would not relish. At page 21 of than a weakening under foreign competithe report, it is shown that it was admitted that some of the specific duties duties.

241,Mr Ronald,"If we cannot controllistening to some of the arguments put forward in support of the Government proposal, I am impelled to condemn it as a scheme for robbing the taxpayer. It is proposed to perpetrate a diabolical outrage upon the primary producers of this country -^-to commit absolute daylight robbery. member must not refer to proposed legislation in those terms. principle which underlies the proposal, namely, that of taking money from the pockets of one section of the taxpayers, not for the purpose of paying it into the Treasury for public purposes, but with the object of enriching' another section of the community. That is tantamount to robbery. honourable member to say that the proposal of the Government would amount to robbery. The honourable member must .not refer to pioposed legislation in that wav. be unparliamentary to express myself in that way, but my opinion and the facts remain unaltered. Such a proposal could not be justified, even if the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, for the appointment of which some members of the present Government loudly clamoured, showed that the harvester manufacturing industry was in a languishing condition. Ministers have not been even content to adopt the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Commission-and even those recommendations were made in the teeth of the evidence-bu t have brought down proposals for which not an atom of justification, can be found. It is apparent that the desire of the Government is. not to assist a languishing industry, but by hook or by crook to increase the Tariff. Notwithstanding the fact that they have not the slightest pretext for doing so. that the evidence shows ever increasing expansion of business, they are piling up the taxation upon a section of the community which, above all others should receive the utmost consideration at our hands. I am speaking of our primarv producers, who are necessariliy the backbone of the country. Thev have to produce under the most adverse conditions; and they are not able to participate in many of the advantages conferred by civilization-advantage s which are within the reach of the secondary producers. If consideration is to be extended to any section of the community, it should be extended to the primary producers. land tax? man would rule.me out of order if I pursued that paint, I could easily show the Vice-President of the Executive Council that under an equitable system of land values taxation, coupled with the reduction of other taxation and railway fares and freights, the farmers would reap a distinct benefit. At the present time, however, I am pointing out that, whilst pretending to be most solicitous for the welfare of the primary producers, the Government are anxious to pile fresh burdens upon them. Apparently, they wish to increase the cost of agricultural implements to the consumers. Why? Is it to confer a benefit upon the rest of the community? Certainly not. They merelv desire to benefit a small section of the communitya section which is almost confined to Victoria. These proposals are intended chiefly to advantage Victorian manufacturers at the expense of the other States. It is high time that the representatives of the other States raised a united protest against legislation of this character. Personally, I shall never cease to raise my voice in opposition to it. We are to be asked to pay through the nose all the time for the gain of Victorian manufacturers. greater sacrifices as the result of Federation than has Victoria. honourable and learned member. New South Wales has made greater sacrifices than any State, and Victoria has benefited more than has any other State. The consumers in the other States, and particularly in New South Wales, are continually being bled in the interests of Victorian manufacturers. I sincerely hope that the people of the State from which I hail will speedily awaken to a proper appreciation of their position. Personally, I shall not hesitate to put that position before them in the plainest possible language. The agricultural implement industry has been represented by honourable members opposite, and particularly by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Attorney-General, to be in a languishing condition.

For instance, "" I find that the total number of hands emThe following return prepared for the Commission by the Government Statist of Victoria shows the number of hands employed in the manufacture of Agricultural Implements and Machinery in the several States of the Commonwealth from the year 1899 to 1905 :Year. 189!) 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 .1905 Honourable members will recollect that 1:901 and 1902 were years of droughtyears in which the farmers experienced severe reverses. Consequently it was not to be expected that during that period there would exist a great demand for 'agricultural machinery. But in T903 and 1904 good harvests were experienced, with the result that the demand for this class of machinery increased to such an extent that the local manufacturers were unable to supply it. The result was a considerable increase in the importations of agricultural implements. manufacturers were unable to meet the demand ? based upon the evidence which was submitted by several farmers and others to the Tariff Commission. The excessive importations which took place in 1903 and 1904 were due to the increased demand, and were supplementary to the output of the local manufacturers, which in no way suffered the slightest diminution from such importations. Since those years the local manufacturers have been adding to their plant, and increasing the number of their hands. That fact can be seen by a glance at the table which I have quoted, and imports have declined. Last year the total number of hands employed in the industry ployed in the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery in the several States increased between the years 1899 and 1905 by 1,219. in Victoria. member will turn to page 8 of the Tariff Commission's Progress Report, No. 5, he will find these particularsN.S W.

As a matter of fact, it has been shown conclusively that proposals have beer* submitted by the Government-is now making a clear annual profit of about Â£30,000. It is an absolute outrage that we should be asked by a Ministry which has not a straight-out following strong enough to give it an independent majority, to impose these duties, on the eve of a general election, in order to bolster up this industry. Not the slightest reason has been shown by the Government for legislation of this kind, and the electors may well be afforded an opportunity of saying whether they are prepared to still further bolster up an industry which is at present in such a flourishing condition. I propose to show by reference to the evidence, given very unwillingly by the manufacturers themselves, and first of all to that given by MrH . V. iMcKay, that they are doing a satisfactory business.

270,Mr Johnson,"What is McKayalleged letter was sufficient to justify him in increasing the valuation of imported harvesters, and in proposing an increase of duty which will further entrench McKay in the monopoly which he enjoys at such great profit to himself and at such an immense disadvantage to his customers. I believe that an Australian harvester combine or trust was for a time in existence, and that both importers and local manumembers of it. It was through his agency,' I understand, that the price of harvesters was increased. The trust came to an end because one firm left it, and then the price of harvesters was reduced again. Yet we are asked to pass legislation to assist McKay, who was one of this ring to put up prices to the farmer. With regard to the charges of piracy which have been made against foreign manufacturers, the evidence placed before the Tariff Commission shows that if there has been any piracy, it has been on the part of the Australian manufacturers, who have copied foreign inventions. it is alleged that harvesters of some kind were in existence at the time of Julius sion's report quotes a passage from Pliny, in which an invention of the kind is mentioned. I do not blame Australian manufacturers for taking advantage of the brains of the world. But what I do object to is that whilst they are copying the designs of manufacturers in other parts of the world, they are accusing them of appropriating inventions to which they have a prior claim. They are arrogating to themselves the exclusive right to manufacture certain machines, whereas the improvements which they claim as their own existed before they entered into business. Therefore, if there is any piracy, it is on the part of the local, rather than the foreign, manufacturer. Mr Weickhardt's evidence showed that the labour conditions that anything but satisfactory. It is well known that, in order to escape from the operation of Wages Boards. Mr tion, according to Mr Weickhardt, carries McKay removed his factory beyond the sphere of their influence. Did he do this with a view to increasing the wages of his operatives? Certainlv not. He, wished to escape the necessity of complying with fair and reasonable conditions of employment. I propose to quote one or two passages from. the statement made by Mr Weickhardt, given at page 1826 of the minutes of evidence. Mr Weickhardt says:To show how McKay crushes opposition, and gets other people's brains, I also want to show the Commission the manner in which the farmer has been victimized in being charged extortionate prices for a stripper-harvester, and the way the men employed have been sweated. This evidence is supposed to have been contradicted by Mr Bu'lt, and also by Mr Porteous, but if their carefully-prepared statements are examined, it will be found that the main charges levelled against Mr hardt continues:The tools and the plant are up-to-date in all respects at the Sunshine Works. Ideas are seized on, no matter what source derived from, and no thanks or recompense to the inventors, so far as my experience goes. For instance, four men employed making cups or buckets for l if t ing grain at 8s. per day; one boy placing on belts, ios. per week. I invent a machine to make same on-dispens e with the services of three men and the boy, ancl make the man accept 20s. per week. His name is Francis, sole supI understand that port of widowed mother.

Take his idea-sac k him, and get them done by a boy, young George Lamprell, at 6s. a week, and a man has to solder them in, and do his own work also. I also had the cups cut nut by the bull-dozer, which did more in one day than a man could do in a month. This machine is also the result of another man's brainsMr Moule, who was head pattern maker for MrH . V. McKay, attends to all classes of labour-saving appliances and ideas conveyed to him. The Massey-Harris grain box, now in use on the Sunshine harvesters, I made by copying from Massey-Harris machine, at the instigation of H . V. McKay himself, and Mr Moule* assisting me. Yet this is the man who has the audacity to accuse others of piracy. The statement proceeds:Re the men and boys employed, a finer body does not exist. They are smart, active, and intelligent, and the system at McKay's is equal to any American factory. It is not exactly a wages system or a piece-work one-bu t the cruellest and most daring robbery of human life that could be devised, and shows the need that exists for factory legislation.

This statement was evidently prepared by Mr Weickhardt without any assistance, because the language is such as to indicate that it was not the production of an educated man. On the other hand, statements made by Mr Bult, the manwere carefully prepared; but they do not touch Mr Weickhardt's main indictments. NowI wish to refer to the price of the local harvesters. They are sold to the farmers for Â£ 8 1 cash. If the purchaser wants termSj he has to pay a higher price, according to the accommodation that he recarries on a very large export trade, and that, after paying freight and insurance, and other incidental charges, he is able to sell his harvesters in Argentina and other parts of the world at lower rates than those charged to local farmers. He has to reduce his prices in other countries to meet I prefer to rely upon foreign competition. It is reasonable to assume that he makes a profit upon the machines that he exports, and to the extent to which he demands a higher price than that receives for the exported machines he is imposing on the Australian farmer. Now, what is the cost of the production? Details are given upon this matter on page 1826 of the Minutes of EvidenceI t is shown that the harvesters do not cost more than Â£ 3 0 each. If we allow the large sum of Â£ 2 0 for selling expenses, the gross cost of the machines to safe to assume that they do not cost anything like tliat amount; but, even if they did, there would still be the enormous profit of Â£ 3 1 made upon every machine that was sold.

But the Government, without the slightest attempt to justify their action, now propose to increase the rate of duty from Â£ 1 0 to Â£ 1 6 per machine. In this way are the interests of all classes considered in this Parliament. It would almost seem as though we were playing with toys instead of dealing with the interests of Australia.

Last week, when we were discussing matters which did affect that State, he sang a very different tune. In my judgment, the proposals of the Government are wicked and scandalous. The Ministry has decided, despite the evidence which was tendered to the Commission, to levy an impost of 40 per cent, upon one of the tools of trade of our primary producers. The fixed duty which they suggest is equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent. estimated it. It works out at 42 per cent. the honourable member for correcting me.

The operation of the duty proposed to be levied upon these machines will not affect me personally.

I am speaking purely in the interests of others than my own constituents, and I deem it my duty to enter my protest as emphatically as I can against what I regard as a wicked imposition attempted to be practised by the present Government I venture to upon the farmers of Australia. So far as we have seen, throughout this Parliament there has been a steadfast adherence on the part of the Government to anything relating to the great centres of population, and a careless, reckless disregard of the primary producers of Australiai who, after all, are the backbone of the Commonwealth, and furnish the basis of all our expanding prosperity. The primary producer in the back-blocks seems to be the very last person thought of by the Government. A ll their proposals seem to concentre in the interests of those in the centres of population. If there is an industry in Melbourne employing a dozen hands this Government is He readv to rush to its rescue. All that the manufacturers have to do is to say that they want more duty. There is nothing easier than to ask and to receive at the hands of the Ministry. Manufacturers have not even to make out a good case. I believe that no case has been made out for disturbing the duty imposed on harvesters prior to the introduction of. this motion.

There is nothing to show anything, but that it is prospering steadily and growing with the increase in the natural prosperity of the country. There is nothing to warrant the imposition of an increased duty of even one farthing upon harvesters. The local manufacturers alreadv enjoy a duty Â«f 2 per cent.j together with the natural protection, which is a very large item when spread over the importation of these machines. What we have been able to gather furnishes the best of all reasons why no further impost should be placed on them.

The moment a firm like that of the McKay Bros, begins to export, and to export successfully-and the number of machines which it is sending away is increasing almost every month-it affords the best of all reasons for the conclusion that it is doing well, and that we ought to let well alone. of this proposal ?

It will be found that a. very large number of tools of trade connected with industrial enterprises are on the free list. House decided almost uanimously that they should not be taxed. I should like to inquire what is a harvester but a. tool of trade 1 to the farmer ? Does the size of such a tool make a radical difference in the principle to be applied? If small men are to have their tools of trade exempt because they are small, the farmer has a still stronger claim to have his tool of trade, which is large and expensive, and to procure which involves much trouble, free of duty. I wish to revert to another preliminary inquiry : What were the terms of this Commission which was sent upon its duty something like two years ago? It was charged to inquire into the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff on Australian industries and the working of the Tariff generally. That was the inquiry which it was specially appointed to make. I should like to hear some of the members of the Commission deal with this point. One wonders why, among the first of their reports is one concerning an industry which, at the outset, was obviously neither strangled nor laguishing. toria to be languishing. was. That is where the trouble begins. only a section of the Commission.

The facts show that nothing of the kind is taking place. On the contrary, all the evidence we have is to the effect that McKay's business is in a very flourishing state, and that he is doing exceedingly well. I believe that, according to his own sworn statement, he, in 1897, manufactured 75 machines; in 1898, 150; and in 1.899, 301. Then came Federation, and, in 1904, his output was 1,500, and, in 1905, 1,930. Those figures do not show that his industry is being strangled. In fact, he seems to be outstripping his competitors.

Mr JamesB . Garde, representing the Australian Implement Manufacturing Association, showed that upon some lines there has been a great increase since 1899, and Mr Rees Rees gave similar evidence. Indeed, the members of the Commission had to admit that there has been a great expansion of trade. The facts are so clear of doubt that they were compelled to do so. However much the protectionist members of the Commission might have wished to make out a case for protection, they were compelled to recognise that this business has expanded and is successful. When the Commission was appointed its investigations were intended to discover what in[140]2 dustries were languishing and being strangled, with a view to their relief, but their inquiries proved that the agricultural implement industry is prospering almost beyond the dreams of avarice. Any fluctuations in trade have corresponded with fluctuations of season. When times have been prosperous the demand has increased, and the falling off in output has been due to bad seasons. Increase and decrease have corresponded with the prosperity or adversity of the primary industries, which shows that the Tariff has not injured this business. On the contrary, there has been a continuous expansion of trade. Mr J. Moore said that there have been more hands emobtained since the Federal duties began to Mr John Mitchell admitted that his trade, taken as a whole, has expanded greatly under been quoted to-night to show that the increase of hands in this industry has been considerable.

In spite of the fact that there is a wide difference between the values of the harvesters imported, they are all deemed to be of eoual value for the purposes of the duty. Why should a machine valued at Â£ 2 0 be subjected to the same fixed duty as one valued at Â£ 3 0 ? of the standard value. that the evidence bears out that statement.

It was I wonder why there should not so twelve months ago. However, I do not wish to lacerate the honourable member's feelings. This is a proposal to make equal those things which are unequal. Machines of different value are to be regarded as of the same value for the purposes of levying the duty. The trouble with all fixed duties is that however the price may decrease, the duty remains a I do not know fixed quantity. It may seem paradoxical, All that has been urged is but a fixed duty is a constantly increasing duty. As the^prices of goods decrease, the fixed duties Increase ad valorem. That, of course, is an argument against all fixed duties. When we were discussing the Tariff, we abolished fixed duties as far as we could, and adopted percentage duties which would rise and f a ll in keeping with the fluctuations in value.

Since the valuation of these harvesters for Customs purposes was arbitrarily fixed by the Minister at ^65, nobody has been able to obtain from him an explanation of the reasons which prompted his action. I do not believe that he has one to offer, except that which he gave to the newspaper representatives when he said that he intended to make the importers of foreign harvesters sit up. I am surprised at the action of the Prime Minister in allowing his colleague to ride rough-shod over the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and over the sworn evidence which that body has collected.

But when he was questioned as to the reason why he could not compete with them, he replied that he was not at liberty to say.

There is the deliberate statement of Mr McKay that he produces a better article than can be produced elsewhere. That -is the evidence of a man who, in the same breath, asks for further duties.

To that he repliedI would details. E v i d e n t l y it might have been a very bad thing for ""him to do so. Evidently he had something which he desired to keep back from the Commission. Every other witness who appeared before that body gave the totals of the cost incurred in distributing these machines. McKay was askedIs there any reason why you should be. more reticent than other witnesses have been? His answer wasI do not think it is fair that I should expose the whole of my business to this trust which wishes to smother me. Only a little while previously he had informed the Commission that he had the trust beaten because he produced a better article. To my mind, his statements are not only inconsistent but contradictory. After all this questioning; the Chairman of the Commission inquired of Mr the imposition of protective duties is that McKayI presume that you will prime cost? His reply wasI would rather not. He wanted the increased duty all the same. fectly within his rights in declining to expose his business, but we are acting equally within our rights in refusing to give him the advantage of increased duties unless he first establishes his case. The Government, it appears, do not require him to do that. statement that he requires higher duties, and, hey presto, the thing is done. There will be no difficulty in giving effect to his wish in a House constituted as this is. Honourable members have merely to sit tight. I wonder, after all, whether ter and his Government confidentially with a statement as to the primary cost of producing these harvesters. Maybe there have been interviews between Ministers and private individuals, upon the strength of which these proposals are made to the Committee. obligation is upon the former to advance some reason to justify their proposals. I Later do not wish to pursue this matter any further. There is abundant evidence to show that no -further duty is required upon harvesters, which already enjoy a very high measure of protection. I understand, from the evidence given before the Tariff rather not go too closely into Commission, that the natural differentiation in favour of Australian harvesters averages about ,Â£14 ios. per machine. That is to say, the cost of landing, harvesters in our market amounts to that sum. tection. In addition to that, under the existing Tariff he enjoys a protection amountAccordingly, Mr ing to Â£>5 4 6d. per machine. In these s circumstances he and the rest of the Australian manufacturers of harvesters enjoy a protection of Â£ 2 0 per machine. It that is not sufficient, I for one shall not grant any increase. I do not willingly consent to grant him an increase of even ' one halfpenny in the protection he enjoys. We must remember that the Australianmanufacturers of these machines are not competing against the"" pauper labour of Europe. One of the strongest arguments repeated almost ad nauseum in favour of in other quarters of the globe many gocds are produced under sweated labour condinot tell me your tions. Honourable members may gram,Jf_. they please, that our civilization in these southern seas demands some protection from the products of such inferior industrial conditions, but evidence was given before the Commission that the wages paid in the manufacture of these machines in Canada are higher than those prevailing in Australia. Evidence was given that the cost of iron and steel is not less in Canada than it isi here; that on the contrary the cost of the raw material, and of the workThey are content to accept his manship is higher there than here. Under these conditions, and having regard to the fact that the local manufacturers enjoy a protection amounting to Â£ 2 0 per machine, what possible excuse could there be for increasing the existing duty on a machine which is of vital importance to the farmers of Australia? I do not see my way to subscribe to even a fractional increase in the existing duty. If any case has been made out it points to the necessity of reducing, rather than increasing the duty. When we remember that the The whole of the grain raisers of Australia have to do with these machines, and that they vitally affect their industrial occupations",54,States

I know that a limit is to be imposed upon the price of these machines. But we have had evidence this afternoon that the price proposed to be fixed from the beginning of next year is that at which they are actually being' sold by some traders at the present time. Some are selling these machines at only a small fraction in excess of the maximum_ price which we propose to provide by legislation shall be charged from the beginning of next year. This price is to be maintained apparently for all time; the farmers of Australia are not to be allowed to secure these machines ""JUfe anything below it . Meantime, the local manufacturers will enjoy a duty, if the Government proposal be carried, amounting to 42 per cent, plus Â£ 1 4 . ios., the cost of landing a machine here from the American continent. The farmer has to fight his way in the markets of the world without any of these advantages. the rates prevailing in the markets' of the world can affect the price which he secures for his exports, arid yet a Legislature which is supposed to have regard to his hi^ier and better interests is to fix the price _whch he shall pay for the implements necessary to enable him to produce his goods at the cheapest possible rate. The sooner a stop is put to the cant we hear about helping the primary industries of Australia by this Government the better.

After all, he is at the bedrock of our social and industrial prosperity. If he is all right, we may very well be certain that our secondary industries are also right, because we may be sure that they, too, are healthy and are expanding in proportion to the expansion of his* industry. He is building, broad and deep, the base of the industrial pyramid, and we should not hamper him with any of these fettering imposts whilst he is engaged in the work of erecting the national superstructure. Let us leave him alone, so far as proposals of this kind""are concerned; let us make his tools sharper rather than blunt them by these unnecessary duties. If we make it more difficult for him to get nearer the range of his market and of his competition in regard to all those things from which he derives his profit, we practically blunt his tools, since he has nothing to protect him from the competition of the world in relaNothing save tion to his, finished products.

505,Mr Henry Willis,"The honorablethe Government have in view in making these proposals has already been secured. As a matter of fact it has not. The card which he exhibited is really a list which was published after the recommendations of the Commission had been made public. It was known at the time that the Commission had recommended that a higher duty should be imposed, with a view to conserving the market for the Australian manufacture. The publication of that price list bears evidence that the local manufacturers are going to give the farmers some of the benefits which will accrue from the opportunity promised to them to specialize in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Pointed reference has been made to the position in which the Australian farmer was placed when he 'had to rely for his supplies entirely upon the foreign manufacturer. I wish to put before the Committee my own personal experience, when, years ago, I used a reaper and binder. I found at that time that a man who attempted to build up a reaper and binder by acquiring duplicate parts had to pay nearlv four times the price charged for the complete machine. The same policy is being pursued by the firms who import harvesters to-day. On the other .hand, the Australian manufacturers of those machines and other implements practically supply duplicate parts at the rate charged for those in the original machine. I propose to give some figures, which cannot be questioned, showing the prices charged for duplicate parts by the Massey-Harris Company. If the farmer wishes to replace the three carrying wheels of one of these imported machines, he has to pay, according to the catalogue issued by the Massey-Harris Company, Â£ 2 0 5s. for them, whereas the price for exactlv the same duplicates for the Australian machine is Â£ 1 4 The evidence of farmers-free-trader s and protectionists alike-wh o appeared before the Commission was that the Australian-made machine is the better ..one. ment in favour of its use? with that point. member, there is a difference of Â£ 6 between the price charged for duplicate carrying wheels for an imported machine and that charged for the same parts of an Australian-made machine. the evidence of the representatives of the company in support of that statement. The foreign manufacturers say, "" Let us send our surplus stock of binders, cultivators, and ploughs to Australia; our home market is conserved to us by means of a duty, not of 12% per cent., but of 40 per cent.'' turers charging a higher price in foreign markets than they charge here ? tion under consideration. The foreign manufacturers say in effect, ' We have our 1 home market conserved to us. Let us sell our machines in Australia at the bare cost of manufacture, and we shall make our profit out of the sale of duplicate parts to the Australian farmers."" through that device? but what will be his position when we have no local manufacturers ? Honourable members opposite, who cry out that they are anxious to conserve the interests of the farmer, forget where they are leading him. m anuf actures South Wales used to a large extent get his implements from Victorian manufacturers. might have done so, but those in other parts of New South Wales did nothing of the kind. then they obtained the same class of implement that the Victorian farmer secured prior to the establishment of the local industry-a n implement which made it impossible for him to keep in the van of industrial progress. I wish, however, to give some additional figures in regard to the cost of the duplicate parts of these machines. An intermediate spur wheel for the imported machine costs Â£ 1 . whereas such a part for an Australian machine costs 12s. 6d. A spur geair wheel for an imI shall deal later on ported machine costs 25s., as against a charge of Â£ 1 made for exactly the same class of duplicate for an Australian machine, and a comb, complete, for the imported machine costs Â£ 5 , ' whereas the charge in the case of the Australian article is Â£ 4 ios.

I wish now to refer briefly to the practice of those engaged to-day in importing these machines. A good deal has been said as to the way in which Australian inventions have been pirated. Machines have been manufactured abroad from pirated designs, under conditions that are not entirely Australian, and sold here as surplus stock in competition"" with Australian productions. As one ""who is engaged in farming putsuits, I say without fear of contradiction, that cereal cultivation as we know it in Australia to-day would not have attained its present proportions but for the inventive genius, and the enterprise of the Australian manufacturer. local manufacturers require such high -duties ? that cereal cultivation, by means of up-todate mechanical appliances, in the drier parts of our territorv. was rendered possible only by the establishment of the agricultural implement industrv in Victoria and South Australia. As to the standard of morality of those competing with the Australian manufacturers, what do we find?

An Australian designed and Australian-made machine was taken to America and copied there, and the firm which copied it had the audacity to send the copies back to this market under the same name as that of the Australian machine, accompanied with a catalogue which was an exact copy of the Australian catalogue. their design originally from America. The Commissioners draw'attention to that fact in their report. member is in ignorance of the true facts. In this catalogue are the printed testimonials obtained by the makers of the Australian machine, it being made to appear by the makers of the American machine that the testimonials relate to that, and not to the Australian machine.

I ask however, what was the value of importations of harvesting machinery apart from reapers and binders, in 1900? Notj Â£ i worth was imported. do with the point at issue? that the Australian agricultural implement industry is developing. say so-McKay and the others. harvester was not generally used in Australia; but the inventive genius and ability of our people has so perfected that machine that to-day no farmer has any doubt as to its adaptability to his requirements under given climatic conditions. The old method of harvesting has consequently become obsolete and there has been a considerable expansion of cereal cultivation in Northern Victoria and Southern and Western New South Wales. within the last twelve years that the production of wheat has increased in New South Wales. That is due to the improvement of agricultural machinery. Although it has been said that in the pre-Federal clays the Victorian farmer was impoverished by protective duties, the wheat prcduction of Victoria was greater then than that of New South Wales, notwithstanding that (he latter State has the larger area of country suitable for the growth of wheat. New South Wales were able to make money in other employments.. cultivation has been brought about largely by the improvement of harvesting machinery. As soon as foreign firms, whose W h a t the honourable distributing organizations were largely developed, found that there was a field for their enterprise in Australia, they sought to take advantage of it . The literature of the world relating to protection contains no statement more strongly supporting the The statement that beneficial effects of that policy than a proposal made by the Australian representative of the Massey-Harris Company in 1902. It was put forward in connection with an attempt to bring the manufacturers into line. I do not know that it is necessary M u c h stress has fo? me to read the whole of it, because it is printed in the minutes of evidence at page 1853, and is embodied in a letter which was forwarded to Mr Lennon upon some business matter. It contains the following statement: The manufacturers in the countries from which Australian competitive imports are drawn, have already established facilities sufficient for producing all their home requirements that 10 in seven or eight months of the year. They have also taken advantage of modern combinaI t has been said tion, complete organization, abundant capital, convenient and cheap raw materials, long working hours, extensive factories, and the latest labour-saving machinery and appliances, consequently the necessity for seeking new markets, where they can dispose of their surplus stock. Unfortunately, these facts are not generally T e n vears ago the known. Under these circumstances, Australian manufacturers, occupy an unenviable position, and need not hope to retain their limited trade, to say nothing of expansion or foreign trade, unless their competitors are checkmated without delay. The great masses of the people have little knowledge and no means of ascertaining the true effect of recent economic changes in rival countries. The people are trusting the daily press and their representatives in the Federal Parliament to watch the course of events in the outside It is only world, and to indicate and frame legislation required to safeguard Australian interest. The Australian people, however, occupy a unique position, and now have a splendid opportunity for leading the world on a home productive policy, before the baneful effects of the all-absorbing and unrestricted combines and trusts are felt and established on our shores. This statement was annexed to a proposal submitted by the Massey-Harris Company before the formation of the International Harvester Company. of the Massey-Harris Company was atT h e increase of tempting to form an Australian combine for manufacturing purposes, with a view to forestalling the American combine, and controlling the Australian market.",64,States

585,Mr Kennedy,"T do not look at theper cent., but for whatever duties will have that result. member believes in the establishment of monopolies ? sight and judgment of the Government, we have on the statute-book a measure which will enable us to deal effectively with any monopolies that mav arise in Australia. who say that the proposed duty will increase the cost of harvesters to the Australian farmer to prove the statement, and to show that the result of the action of the Government will not be to reduce the price. That has been the experience of protective duties in Victoria, and all over the world. I ask those who wish to develop that national sentiment by which alone a great people can be welded together to consider .this auestion from every stand-point. The alteration of a Tariff ought not to be and cannot be undertaken in every session of Parliament. Australia have attempted to create ideal conditions for our industrialTCpulation.I understand that the Australian worker is in an even better position than is the Canaconsumer being increased. We must, howdian worker, his hours being shorter, while the task system is practically unknown here, in the agricultural implement manufacture at least. We desire to do all that is possible to improve the conditions of life in Australia, and to make the country attractive to our people. The experience of the world shows that most progress is being made to-day, even in agricultural production, by protected countries. If we are to develop, we must diversify the avenues of employment, both on the land and in the factories, and give fair conditions to those who embark their capital in manufacturing enterprise. sidered the interests of the manufacturers, the workers, the primary producers, and the consumers inrelation to the proposal of the Government, I feel that I have ample justification for supporting it not desire to give a silent .vote upon this question, because of its great importance to the people whom I reuresent. ' Like the honourable member for Moira. I represent a farming division, and have done so for the last twenty-one years. time. I have had to fight many elections, and have always been opoosed by free-traders. I dare say that I could at times have won more easily as a free-trader than as a protectionist; but I have always found the honourable the farmers ready to concede reasonable protection to the manufacturing industries, even when their own supplies were affected, although it has always been felt that, as the primary producers do not benefit by protection as largely as do other consumers, high duties should not be placed upon their implements and tools of trade. The obligation rests upon thos.: Under the Victorian Tariff the duty nn agricultural implements was 15 per cent., and in New Zealand, so careful have the authorities been that no burden should be placed on the farmers, agricultural implements are admitted duty free. When it was feared that foreign competitors would monopolize the local ' market, the late Mr Seddon would not propose a protective duty, but, instead, gave bounties to the local implement makers. The point upon which the whole discussion has turned, and the one that we shall have to settle, is: what is the value of the stripWe in per-harvesters? The honourable member for Moira stated that it did not matter what duty was imposed, provided that precautions were taken against the price to the ever, remember that if we impose a duty upon one set of farming implements, and protect the farmer against an increase in price, we may be called upon to levy higher duties upon other materials also used by farmers, but in regard to which we cannot protect them against an increase in the cost. I desire to hold the balance fairly between those who make implements and those who use them. I agree that invention should be stimulated, and that our manufacturing industries should be encouraged, so that we may be able to find employment for our youths. If we adopt that policy Having con. we shall provide a larger market for the products of the soil, and thus give our primary producers that which they most need. The experience that I have gained during my recent travels leads me to the conclusion that those countries which have adopted a protective policy are the most prosperous, and have less poverty within their borders than is to be found in those which .are still adhering to the principle of free-trade. I was inclined early this evening to agree with the Government proDuring that posal to impose a fixed duty, but such _ a wide divergence of opinion appears to exist ' as to the value of the machines that I am beginning to doubt whether that would be",68,Willis Th E People Of Point

588,Mr Mccoll (Echuca) [11.17],"I dothe best course to adopt. We should have some idea of the value of the article which is to be made the subject of the duty before levying a specific impost. The Minister of Trade and Customs rather arbitrarily assessed the value of imported harvesters at ,Â£65, whereas the sworn testimony given before the Tariff Commission would lead one to the conclusion that the valuation could not be fixed at more than ,Â£41.

Honourable members will not be able to get out to the show and meet their friends if the House meets at the usual hour. External Affairs [11.27] I should have been very glad to agree to the suggestion of the honourable member, but I would point out that a number of honourable members do not desire to attend the show, and that it will not be necessary for those who wish to go out to the Agricultural Society's grounds to attend here before half past 4, because a division is not likely to take place before that time. promise that? safely do so.
