They think that may indeed even lead Australia Post to remove its post office from to the end of their post office full stop, and be the place where it presently is, in the main privatisation by stealth. That is something that street of the town, and take it along to the the Healesville community is rejecting. I hope Coles Myer redeveloped area. Of course, that the government, through Australia Post, securing the Healesville Post Office as a key is prepared to revisit this issue and do the tenant increases the resale value of that right thing by the Healesville community. complex when the Coles Myer property development is put up for sale. Nevertheless, A second issue which is addressed in this it is a move regarded by the Healesville legislation concerns what might best be people as anti-community and anti-rural described as food anomalies. The first of Australia and as a sign that Australia Post is those is that still water will be GST free, turning its back on a community that has irrespective ofÂ· the packaging in which it is funded it for generations and that, instead of sold. Currently, the legislation specifies that allying itself with the small businesses in the only bottled water is GST free, making water main street of Healesville, it is allying itself in a 4-litre cask subject to tax. This is an with a large and powerful chain, to the detriabsolutely extraordinary situation where, if the ment of the local community. still water is in a bottle, no GST is applicable but, if the water is in a cask, it is subject to GST.

I would like to read into the parliamentary record a few paragraphs that she has written. She says: Dear Mr Sawford You are weIl aware that our Public Hospital System is literaIly ill and the future diagnosis would suggest that under the Federal and State Coalition policy things for 'the battlers' will only deteriorate further ... I write to you as a 'survivor' who recently underwent 2 separate heart bypass operations in the past 12 months. My experience is similar to the many other working class of this State in that I suffered what I consider unnecessary stress, inconvenience and exaggerated delay before eventuaIly receiving what is surely the basic right of all tax payers-good Public Hospital treatment on a needs basis. Can you possibly imagine the tonnent I went through, foIlowing a complication with my initial heart bypass operation, to have to wait for 7-that's correct, 7 weeks to have a second procedure? During that difficult time. I was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with angina pain a total of 5 occasions-the Doctors apologising for not admitting me for more intense treatment but having to release me, at some degree of risk, for want of a lack of bed space. My procedure has now been successfully perfonned at Flinders Medical Centre ... In the course of my treatment I was infonned on numerous occasions that if I had private medical insurance my bypass procedure/s would have been perfonned within a matter of days! Isn't that a great shame? She continues: As it was, apparently my operations were perfonned ahead of the nonnal wait, which at this time is something approaching 7 months . . . For this to happen, there must be a urgent reversal in the current health policy of both Canberra and Adelaide so as to meet the needs of ALL AUSTRALIANS-not one for the wealthy/self insured and a second class public health system for the 'rest'. This is nothing short of playing ideology ahead of the lives of Australian battlers, the people you are elected to represent and provide the basics of health, well being and education. By the way, you'll no doubt be interested in the knowledge that the Coalition tactics have forced me through fear to take out private Medibank insurance currently costing $34-36 a fortnight from my Social Security pension. So it's good bye to the occasional 'luxuries' previously enjoyed such as vacations visiting my family and the odd night out as I seek to gain peace of mind through fmancing my future health risks-a disgraceful state of affairs given that I am already through Medicare and taking into account the social responsibility of Government. Mr Sawford, as our local Federal member, I appeal to you to take up the plight of myself and fellow battlers to ensure that we again enjoy our right to public hospitalisation when we need it and not when through the Coalition's manipulation they deem it appropriate. It is very sad that we have a two-tiered hospital system in this country and it is to the shame of all of us in this House. (Time expired)",144,Pairs Aspersion On The Minister For Health And Aged

355,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide},"I have a letter here from Mrs Veronica Nixon in myWednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12051 Change Management Mr St CLAIR (New England}-I believe that we in this House, as leaders and major decision makers in this country, need to be strong advocates for change. We need to support, encourage and embrace change in our communities, in our electorates and in this country as a whole in a positive effort to keep abreast of worldwide trends and technology advances. Under whatever name-re-engineering, resizing, cultural change, restructuring or tumaroundchange is undertaken almost inevitably to help the changer cope in a new or more competitive and challenging marketplace. I have been involved in making necessary changes in order to compete, both in business and in public life. I know that change is not something that is easy to achieve. I have been fortunate enough to have obtained a copy of a paper by John P. Kotter entitled 'Leading change: why transformation efforts fail', which has been of considerable assistance to me in playing the role of a leading figure in the change process as it is required today in business and particularly in rural communities. In this paper, the author identifies eight major steps to successful change, and I take this opportunity today to share them with honourable members. Step1 is establishing a sense of urgency. This involves removing those involved in the change from their comfort zones in the current system and facing the realities of the future. Step2 is the formation of a powerful guiding coalition. It involves assembling and encouraging a group with the power to lead the change required. In a business, this group may be a mix of management and workers. In a community, you need to choose innovative, progressive people from different groups within those communities. Step3 is to create a vision by deciding and defining where you want to go with the change-a direction and a strategy to get you there Step4 is to communicate the vision to those whom it will affect. Step5 is to give others the power to act on that vision, getting rid of obstacles to the change and encouraging risk taking and non-traditional ideas and actions-thinking outside of the square .. Step6 to successful change is to plan for short-term wins and to reward those who achieve those wins. Step7 is to consolidate the improvements and to produce further change by changing systems that do not fit that vision and encouraging those who prove capable of implementing the vision. Step 8, the final step, is to institutionalise the new approach, making and reinforcing connections between new behaviours and the success achieved. Follow these steps, ensuring success at each level, and more success through change is guaranteed. It has proven to be a method that works as well for small business as it does for a whole community or a multinational company. Victoria: Election Result Labor Party for their election result and, as I understand it, the swearing in today at 11 a.m. of the first Bracks Labor government. I have to admit, though-and I may have said this in the chamber before-I was surprised, one could almost say shocked, at the extent of the swing against Jeff Kennett and the Victdrian coalition. I certainly did not expect to see Labor in power in Victoria, and I say that with no disrespect to the various players involved. I certainly thought the swing was much too much to be expected on one occasion. In the lead-up to the election over the last year or two, the public perception of the Kennett government was such that I though t-ey were unassailable. However, with the benefit of",146,Representatives Main Committee
356,Mr Griffin (Bruce),"I rise this morning to congratulate Steve Bracks and the Victorian12052 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 hindsight, we can all start to understand what happened and speak with the wisdom of age that comes to all of us as we rejustify what we said in the context of what actually occurred. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, many of us are getting better and better at that over time, particularly when we have to explain results such as those in Victoria. But, in the context of what did happen in Victoria, I think there are some lessons for politicians of all persuasions that need to be looked at. Jeff Kennett certainly tried to project an image of being absolutely unassailable-totally in control, totally in charge-but, in the process of projecting that image, in his own way he was also totally out of control and out of anyone else's influence-other than the big end of toWlland certainly in a situation where he appeared to be very much running his race rather than anybody else's. So that issue of actually being seen to be representative of the people and in touch with their feelings, aspirations and needs was something that was missing, as was the capacity to be able to govern for all Victorians rather than for just some Victorians. The issue of major concern to the coalition nationally is the rural and regional base of the coalition in Victoria, which effectively deserted them. This follows the situation in the last state election in New South Wales where, again, in rural and regional New South Wales the coalition was deserted. When we look at Queensland and the circumstances surrounding the phenomenon of One Nation, we see there was a serious problem for the coalition in what would nonnally have been their base. Some years ago John Howard talked about the battlers-the battlers who were, in John Howard's view, Labor voters who were feeling betrayed and deserted by the actions of the federal Labor government. I suppose we are now seeing an extended variation on that theme in tenns of the bush battlers-the bush battlers who have historically been very strong coalition supporters and who have now started to realise that in fact the coalition is not delivering at all in tenns of the needs of their community. That raises an issue for not only the federal coalition but also the remaining state coalition governments, of which there are now very few. (Time expired) Petrol PricingI wish to raise a matter which is of great concern to my constituents-my electorate being on the Gold Coast-namely, petrol pricing. Along with all other members, r have received, unbidden, some written material from petrol companies in recent times-a letter dated 11 August from Shell and a media release dated 2 September from Caltex. In both of these communications the petrol companies were trying to justify the sharp rise in petrol pricing and saying that there was no opportunism in it. I have previously corresponded with petrol companies on the subject of the pricing of fuel on the Gold Coast where, typically, prices rise on Wednesday or Thursday and stay high right through the weekend in order, one assumes, to exploit the tourists. Various responses have been received by me when I have said this to the fuel companies. So, to put it beyond any doubt, with some assistance I have managed to put together the morning and afternoon prices of nine petrol stations on the Gold Coast over a five-week period. I shall shortly be seeking leave to incorporate the table in Hansard as a record of how fuel prices vary on the Gold Coast. One of the particular beefs I have had-and I stated this in a letter to the Shell company in August this year-is that, on any day of the week, fuel prices vary significantly, and",147,Representatives Main Committee

For example, I made a trip to Nambour in April on a Tuesday when petrol prices on the Sunshine Coast highway were all 5c per litre lower than the prices being charged on the Gold Coast on that particular day. There was a time-over a period of 10 years-when I visited Brisbane every Sunday. You could always buy your fuel for several cents per litre cheaper in Brisbane on a Sunday than on the Gold Coast. I want to refer to some of the justification that was used in Caltex's media release. They say: Pump prices often appear to jump up together after they have been discounteq heavily for several days. In fact, the prices do not jump together but closely follow each other. Both the discounting and jumps are the result of a highly competitive market when competitors' prices are readily visible on price boards.

This mountain is on the outskirts of Queanbeyan and is visible from Parliament House. It has never been logged, cleared or grazed and, as a result, its environmental value is extremely high. Indeed, in 1992, as a result of its botanical diversity, the Australian Heritage Commission listed it on the Register of the National Estate. It noted its significant stands of rare and vulnerable native plant species and their communities. It is a beautiful place--a beautiful place, however, which is being cleared for residential subdivisions. Regrettably, it is privately owned and, even more regrettably, it was the subject of.a dodgy residential rezoning going back to the time of the New South Wales Greiner Liberal government. I cannot believe or accept that there are no other alternative places for new residential estates. Given the abundance of land in the Queanbeyan area which has been cleared and therefore no longer has much environmental value, surely it is nonsense to suggest that Mount lerrabomberra has to be carved up to give people somewhere to live. I realise that, in order to protect the mountain, it needs to become a publicly-owned asset. I have spoken to Mr Steve Whan, who is Labor's key activist in the Queanbeyan and Eden-Monaro areas. I agree with his view that perhaps the best way forward for Mount lerrabomberra may lie in a joint venture between the federal government-using some of those billions of dollars the Natural Heritage Trust now has as a result of selling half of Telstra-the New South Wales state government and the Queanbeyan Council.",149,Representatives Main Committee
360,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills),"A week ago I took up an invitation from the MountWednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12055 I have been infonned that clearing has been resumed at Mount Jerrabomberra for even more residential subdivisions. This is not good enough and has to stop. Australia really ought to be an environmental showcase, a beacon to the rest of the world, but this is being threatened by reckless and short-sighted land clearing, of which Mount Jerrabomberra is a classic example. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service opposed development of Mount Jerrabomberra back in 1988. It noted: The potential impact on fauna will be severe. The bird list appears comprehensive with a surprisingly large number of native bird species so close to a settled area. It would indicate that the area is highly significant for wildlife conservation both locally and regionally, not just for resident species but also as a ""resting spot"" for migrant fauna. It further observed: The difficulty of finding another site as suitable as this, with a natural community virtually intact and with such good public access, is hard to over estimate. I believe it is necessary that this clearing stop and that the Queanbeyan Council, the New South Wales government and the federal government work together to try to protect what is clearly an asset of considerable value for people in this area and for the nation as a whole. Northside Chronicle Business Achievers Awards Ms GAMBARO (Petrie}-I am very pleased today to congratulate the winners of the Sixth Annual Northside Chronicle Business Achievers Awards, which were recently held at the Kedron Wavell Services Club in my electorate. The finalists and the winners representing our hard working and dedicated small business community need to be commended. Some 400 people attended this particular event, and businesses and their employees were represented at the awards. The evening was highly successful and professionally organised by Quest newspapers. While I am speaking about Quest newspapers, I think it was highly discourteous of them to, four years in a row, not invite me as the federal member for Petrie who represents half of the businesses in attendance. However, they did have the courtesy to invite the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, despite the fact that half of the businesses represented were from my electorate. I did get an invitation from my hairdresser, which is the only reason I attended these awards. My hairdresser has won an award two years in a row. Unfortunately, this year he did not win. So Brett Roberts and all of those from Making Headlines, keep trying. I want you to go into the hall of fame, and I am sure that you will. The reason for my rising today is to congratulate those fme businesses from my electorate-despite the Quest's obvious overlooking of the fact that I am the elected representative of that particular area. I would like to congratulate the Yuen family from the Master Health Club. These days, with this job, it is a bit difficult to get there but, on the occasions that I have been there, I have found it to be a wonderful gym and I must praise its professionalism. Congratulations to Robert and Noel Percy from the Aspley Nursery, which is just round the comer from where I live. Ron Payne has the freshest fruit in Aspley and I want to congratulate him for winning that particular section. I also want to congratulate Danny Liddel and his team from the Bracken Ridge Natural Health Therapies, Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon, and also the Bracken Ridge Tavern run by Michael and Jenny White, who do a fabulous job. I was present at the hoteliers award when they took out the award for the best establishment in the gaming section. So congratulations 12056 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 again for achieving two awards in one year. In the real estate section, Chris Herron and her team from Raine and Home Carseldine-Bracken Ridge deserve a very special mention.

Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 September, on motion by Mr Hawker: That the House take note of the paper. defence establishments in northern Australia by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. AlthoughI did not participate in the tour, this gives me the opportunity to make some comment on it. One of the reasons I did not participate in the tour at that time was that I was not a member of the subcommittee-a situation that has since been rectified. But I am very familiar with the establishments visited because I have been a member of the Public Works Committee of this parliament since 1985, and I was chair from 1987 to 1996. I have been involved in developments at all the establishments visited and at many other establishments. Recent events to our north have shown that it was a correct decision to move our forces to the north. That is a process that has been going on over a number of years and it is a process that the Public Works Committee over the years has been very involved in. The group visited Tindal, which is part of the arch of northern air bases from Curtin in the west through to Scherger on Cape York Peninsula. This provides a very important arch in the defence forces of Australia. Robertson Barracks, which was visited by the group, is an establishment of which I am especially proud. I have watched the development of Robertson Barracks over the years. I remember being first taken there by a bus during the dry season. As so often happens in the north, there had just been a fire through that very scrubby and, at that time, very unattractive land. It was pointed out to me that over the years this was going to be the headquarters of the APIN, the movement of Australian forces to the north. I lookedÂ· at the area and did not say very much, but I thOUght quite a lot. I wondered, 'What could happen there?' Every time. I go to the north, I have a look at Robertson Barracks. I have watched its development over the years. One important thing about that is that, right from the very first, the landscaping went in with the buildings. So when the troops were first moved up there, they did not go into a bare area; they went into an area where trees and shrubs were already growing and sporting facilities were already there. That has been developed over the years, as more and more tanks and other elements of the brigade have been moved up there. A lot has been achieved. The facilities there are first-rate, as indeed are the facilities at Larrakeyah Barracks, which were also visited. The Public Works Committee has recently approved work at the naval base.

The decision was made to keep it in Darwin near Stokes Hill Wharf and to expand it. I think that was a very important decision and it is a decision that I would say the subcommittee would agree with, having looked at it there. I do not think members always appreciate the work of the Public Works Committee and the way we have encouraged defence establishments and defence work. We have been doing work under different heads-not only when I was chair but when the present Speaker took over from me as chair, when the current minister for forests took over and when the current chair, the member for Pearce, took over. We have all come with great encouragement for the work of the defence forces, especially the defence forces in the north because we have witnessed that movement of forces to the north. I think that has been a correct decision, which has been supported by both sides of the political fence. A couple of years back we had an inquiry into the range at Bradshaw. I think that is very important. That fits in with the Delamere range just outside Tindal. Those two areas will link up and that will be one of the most impressive ranges anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, there has been some delay in the work at Bradshaw. I hope that difficulty will soon be sorted out. So, as I say, we did recommend that work. Although the subcommittee did not visit Bradshaw, they did have a look at Delamere and the work that is going on there. The decision to move our forces north has been a correct decision. Related to this work has been the Defence Housing Authority. What we were able to do on defence housing is one of the icons of the Labor government. There has been talk in recent times about privatisation. I urge the government not to privatise the Defence Housing Authority. It is a good organisation and it works well, but more importantly it delivers to the forces. It is giving our forceswhether they are in the north or wherever they are--decent accommodation, which for so long was denied the defence forces. If we are going to make these calls on our defence forces, it is appropriate that we have them housed in adequate housing. I first saw the Scherger base, like Robertson Barracks, when it was only an idea and a plan. We went up there and carried out an inquiry. A couple of years later I was delighted to be invited to the opening of Scherger. That base completes the bases going from Curtin in the west, across through Tindal to Scherger. It was an expensive facility but nevertheless an important one. I note that the subcommittee recommended that consideration be given to the conditions of the caretakers on all those bases, and that is a recommendation which I agree with. The subcommittee also visited Townsville. So much defence expenditure has been put into there over recent years because there are elements of the three arms of the services there. Both local members-formerly a Labor member and now a member of the current governmenthave always given tremendous support to the expenditure, which I suppose is only natural. They both have a very strong commitment to the defence forces. I was a little bit surprised that the committee did not visit what I referred to as the old 'Ten Terminal Regiment' which is now actually the Ten Forward Support Battalion. This is the amphibious arm that gives such strong maritime support. It was moved from North Sydney up to Townsville, which was more logical as it was there as part of the support group. Incidentally, in my next speech I will be speaking about Bougainville. The honourable member opposite and I both know, from when we were in Bougainville earlier this year, about the 12058 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 tremendous work that the people from that regiment in Townsville do up there. They did us a great service ferrying us around for the very important parts of what we were doing up there. There has been a lot of money put into defence over the last few years, althougp some would say not enough. It is generally accepted that more will be needed which will mean more work for the Public Works Committee. Another aspect is how quickly events change. It would be a very different tour of the northern establishment if it was conducted today than it was in July, even though that was only a couple of months ago. I suggest that no-one can visit our facilities-not only in the north but everywhere-and fail to be impressed with the professionalism of our forces. They are a dedicated force from the most senior officers to the newest private. We ask a lot of our forces. Perhaps we do not appreciate them fully until they are called on to do what we ask them to do, as we do currently in Timor. I suspect that this subcommittee will be visiting the north more frequently. The defence subcommittee is very important to this parliament. Parliament must be kept aware of what is happening in the defence field. It is a difficult line between being informed and being too intrusive but the parliament has to be aware. We can only be made aware through the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and, especially, its defence subcommittee. Many of the personnel from the establishments visited are now involved in Australia's effort in support ofINTERFET. Australia is grateful to them and we wish them a safe return. There is no doubt that there will be changes to our defence forces. We somehow felt conflict was something that happened a long way from Australian shores but, far from this being a peaceful part of the world, we are currently in perhaps the most volatile part of the world. It is a very unstable area. There is great uncertainly in Indonesia. No-one knows what is going to happen. Attention is focused away from PNG at the moment but we hope that, with the new government, stability will be maintained. Nevertheless, it is always a worry. Only two months ago we saw what was in effect a civil war in the Solomon Islands, and who knows what the result will be in New Caledonia. We have to have a well-trained and well-equipped defence force. If that costs more, then perhaps that is a price we have to pay to enjoy the security that we do. Australia can be proud of our defence personnel. We must make sure th-t we, as politicians representing the people, do not let them down. The East Timor crisis has presented Australia with its most difficult foreign affairs and defence challenge of recent times. So far we have responded well, but some questions have to be asked. Is our budget enough for our defence forces? Do we do enough? We have also got to think about what will happen with the troops after East Timor. There are a lot of questions in the defence area. They are questions that the defence subcommittee of this parliament is well across, but we must be kept informed about what is happening. I commend this report to the House. It is a good report, and I most certainly will be a member of the next visit that goes north. DrSOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.11 a.m.}---I was pleased to hear the member for Throsby's concluding remarks because one of the disappointing aspects of this visit was that there were not more members present. We do have a lot of Labor members on the defence subcommittee but, unfortunately, only Senator John Quirke was able to accompany the subcommittee for the entire visit, and the member for the Northern Territory did attend for the visits to Tindal and Darwin. It was disappointing because when we met with 1st Brigade and 3rd Brigade, they Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12059 had gone to a lot of effort with the static demonstrations and the parades displaying their capabilities. I felt it would have been better had we had more people on that trip. I want to touch briefly on a couple of points that are raised in this report on the visit by the subcommittee to our defence establishments in northern Australia at the end of July. There were two overwhelming things that I remember from that trip which have had much more relevance in recent times. Firstly, there was a meeting with the commander of the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters, Major General Peter Cosgrove, and we discussed with him the communications capabilities and so on resulting from establishing a peacekeeping force in a place like Bougainville. We were talking specifically about Bougainville, but within a couple of months he was commanding INTERFET in East Timor. Secondly, I was present at the opening night of Exercise Kakadu IV, a naval exercise involving the navies Of Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore and Australia. We were there on the opening night and we got to meet with naval personnel from Singapore and the TN!. A lot of water has passed under the bridge in the last three months regarding Indonesia, but I do express the hope that we will be able to repair the relationship between Australia and Indonesia because it is an important relationship for Australia. We did mix with those officers from the TNI, who were based in Surabaya, and they enjoyed very much being in Australia. And Senator Ferguson had just been in Surabaya for the Indonesian election. We visited RAAF Base Tindal and saw a static display of an FA18, and we had a briefing on the Delamere air weapons range. We did not see the air weapons range but, from the overhead photographs we saw, it is a very outstanding facility. It is one of the few facilities of its type which allows aircraft to target things on the ground. While we were there, the bunkers were being used by the US Marine Corps. That was an example illustrating how both the Delamere air weapons range and the base at Tindal are -sed by overseas military forces from time to time, and on a commercial basis. We also visited Northern Command. One of the continuing themes of the trip was the involvement of military assets in the prevention of illegal fishing, immigration and crime. We .did touch on that in our report and mentioned that there is some legislation that is looking at harmonising the role of the Defence Force. It is thought that the Defence Force does playa very useful role in surveillance, but perhaps if there is a greater need for interception, that would be best left to civil defence. We visited HMAS ANZAC, the ANZAC class frigate, and were present on the opening night of Exercise Kakadu IV, as I have said. The next day we visited Norforce, which is involved in surveillance and reconnaissance in Northern Australia, It is a locally based and locally raised force which has a history going right back to World War II. Especially in,the wet, it has very difficult areas to undertake surveillance and reconnaissance in. We met with the 1st Brigade. Another thing that came out of this trip was how impressed we were at how much progress 1st Brigade had made since they had had their 28-day readiness notice in March. That, of course, had led to an expansion in personnel, equipment and facilities which is still ongoing. The 1st Brigade has been moving from Sydney to Darwin since 1992 and the move is scheduled to be completed next year. The 1st Brigade provides the ADF with its mechanised warfare capability, so that is where we saw the ASLAVs and also the Leopard tanks. We went to RAAF Base Scherger, which is one of the Air Force's bare bases-we have three: Learmonth, Curtin and Scherger. It was opened last year and it really is quite an 12060 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 impressive facility. It is near Weipa, but in the middle of nowhere. It has a massive runway with secondary runways. It is all ready to work as a full-scale aerodrome, but completely deserted. There is a caretaker staff-just one sergeant and two corporals. There is one base activation a year and one aircraft transition per month. They already have all the fuel that they will need on the base, and that does raise problems with fuel going off, so they have to make sure that circulates. We went to Townsville and saw the 3rd Brigade, which is the unit at the highest degree of readiness in the ADF and a major component of the ADF's Ready Deployment Force. We met with I RAR and 2 RAR. Of course, they are units which are now up in East Timor serving as part of INTERFET. A good friend of mine who did medicine with me is a doctor with 2 RAR and is now serving on the border in East Timor. I wish him well. We also saw the Black Hawks of the 5th Aviation Regiment and also the Caribous, which are available for tactical mobility. Another point I would raise from this trip is that one of the expertises that the ADF has, with its ally, the DSTO, is in maintaining our military hardware. We have expertise in things like wing stress for the FIlls. America does not fly FIlls. We are now planning to have an operational life for the F Ills of 50 years. The Caribous provide a very specific capability and have been available since the 1960s. Two members opposite, the member for Chifley and the member for Throsby, would remember that when we went up to Bougainville we flew in Iroquois helicopters. One was in service during the Vietnam War and one was in service shortly afterwards. We are happy that they are maintained. One of the problems they found at Townsville was that operating the Black Hawks close to a saltwater environment did create a lot of problems with corrosion. Perhaps the member for Throsby, as a member of the Public Works Committee, has seen the very impressive facility in Townsville. After they have finished with the helicopters, they wash them and they are kept in a vacuum-sealed hangar. It is very impressive; no other country does anything like it. That is the economical approach that we apply to our hardware in terms of getting the maximal life span. For the 3rd Brigade, mission essential tasks include peace and humanitarian operations, as well as operations in a conventional setting. When we met with them in July, I do not think anyone anticipated how soon they would be serving in East Timor. We were also lucky enough toflre the Steyr rifle at the Mt Stuart range. That was a big thrill. We saw the weapon training simulation system which allows soldiers to have a virtual simulation of combat, and also to get a lot of feedback on what their rifle is doing while they are lining up and so on, and on how accurate they are. So it is very useful for training. As I said before, at the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters, we met the Commander of 1st Division, Major General Peter Cosgrove AM, MC. The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters includes two regular brigades, one general reserve brigade and one integrated task force. One of the things that I remember about that meeting was talking about the communications requirements for the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters. It is not like a traditional divisional headquarters; essentially, it is technology based. What they need to do, no matter where they serve-and obviously they were considering serving in the northern arc above Australia-is to maintain access to global data from the national support area. We talked about Internet access. We talked about the experience in Bougainville-how they had gained communications and Internet access there. It is now all available. I recently sent Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12061 an email to a friend of mine in INTERFET. You send the email; you get it back straight away from Dili. They get it printed out and supplied to them if they are away from Dili. We talked about things like the ADF's Parakeet satellites, the footprint of the satellite assets, and also the bandwidth of the communications channels. Lastly, at Enoggera, we saw the 7th Task Force, which is different from the previous three brigades, which are all full time; this is 67 per cent part time, 33 per cent full time. The 7th Task Force is an outfit which possibly could be expanded for the rotation of INTERFET. I believe that the 7th Task Force, in Brisbane, would be a very good model to apply in my home state of South Australia. I think we all understand the logic behind the Army presence in the north and the shift to the north of all military assets. But what it means, for example, in South Australia, in terms of regular ADF personnel, is that we have the Orions based at Edinburgh Air Base and an anti-aircraft battery based at Woodside. We have the ongoing submarine project, which is based in Perth. Then there are the reserves-9/9 BASB. So most of the army personnel there are reserves. If the ADF were to look at expanding the number of personnel in the ADF, I think it would be worth looking at having units that are close to major recruiting areas, which would be capital cities. Lastly, I want to touch on some issues which were raised and which I think are important. The issue of fringe benefits tax on group certificates was raised during this trip. I am happy that it has now been addressed and, I think, resolved. Another issue that is raised from time to time by members of the reserves is the matter of reserves being able to serve in peacekeeping forces. In medical roles, that is actually the norm. For example, in Bougainville we met an anaesthetist from a Brisbane hospital. He was a reservist but he was up there on a two-week attachment. I am told by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that, in Bougainville, 20 per cent of the Peace Monitoring Group are reserves. In Canada, the level is also about 20 per cent-not including the medical staff. I understand that is being looked at for associated with reservists serving overseas, of joining up for three months, six months or for whatever time they are wanted. Defence leave as an allowable condition is an issue that has been raised as well. As previous speakers have said, I think it was in only about 150 of 3,000 awards. A number of companies-Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank, I think, from memory-include them in their agreements. It is illegal for s.omeone to be discriminated against for taking defence leave. Another issue relating to the reserves is the common induction training, and I understand there are a number of options being looked at. Instead of having six weeks common induction training, perhaps it could be broken up into two-week slots and some modules could be done by correspondence. I know there is a review going on about the role of the reserves, which should be made public soon, and I am hopeful that that will have a lot of encouraging things for the reserves because we do need to do more to boost the role of the reserves. the northern defence bases by the defence subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The honourable member for Boothby, who has just spoken, has forced a mea culpa out of me; that is, of the three government members and the two opposition members who attended, my name, unusually, did not appear. I do want to apologise to the House: I was serving on the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. The trip occurred during the now notorious report consideration, and I was faced",152,Representatives Main Committee
363,Mr Price (Chifley) (10.26 A.m.},"-I am very pleased to speak on this report on a visit to12062 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 with what I might call an extreme dilemma. I, regrettably, did not participate. That does not mean that, apart from Scherger, I have not seen all the facilities which were visited on several occasions in the past. SoI do apologise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, and to all honourable members about that. I think I need to set the record straight for the defence subcommittee and say that, although people like the former chairman Senator MacGibbon have given much lengthier service than I, ever since I have been a member, one of the tasks the defence subcommittee has taken on is not a specific inquiry but actually getting out there and having a look at facilities, talking to commanding officers and informally discussing a whole range of issues. I commend this approach of the defence subcommittee to other committees. I think it is a very useful thing that a committee sets itself the target, not of pontificating about matters but of seeking to be informed by the people actually doing the job about what is going well and what the issues are that might be causing some concern. In relation to this report, there was a seamless transfer from the former secretary, Joanne Towner, to the new secretary, Margaret Swieringa. Of course, this is a modest situation compared with the Secretary to the Department of Defence-pity that that had not been more seamless. How extraordinary it is that, in the largest deployment for 30 years, the department would be left without a permanent secretary. I have high regard for Hugh White, the acting secretary; I know he would have done an excellent job. I want to place on the record how delighted I am about the government's appointment of the new secretary, Dr Allan Hawke. He was a former deputy secretary of that department, permanent head of Veterans' Affairs, Transport and I think there might have been one other department-so widely experienced. One of the great things about this committee is that we tend to approach things in the best traditions of bipartisanship, and I think the public can be reassured in the government selecting Dr Hawke for this position. He enjoys the unqualified support of the opposition in his task as secretary to the department. Indeed, Dr Hawke has quite some task, I would have thought. I guess the first thing one might say, in thanking him for assuming the position, is that he can be under no illusions about the competence of his minister. All the more remarkable, I think, for him having taken it on. But on a more serious note, he does need to repair the morale within the department. I hope he addresses this very quickly. The tour actually looked at all those who were going to be deployed to East Timor and I think the fact that they were deployed to East Timor is a very pleasing thing. They have performed magnificently, by the way, and this comes as no surprise to me. At the end of the first week of the deployment, Australian Defence Force personnel made up 92.5 per cent of the deployment. They currently make up 80 per cent. In February next year, it is expected that Australia will have 70 per cent of the forces, Thailand just under 20 per cent and the rest of the world 10 per cent. In this situation, I am really disapPQinted that the argument is advanced that we have a regional interest when Australia has so selflessly served in such places as Rwanda and Somalia and has so generously donated troops there. You might say that, in our hour of need in our region, the response of the rest of the world was really disappointing. But I give full marks to our ADF personnel for all that they have done so far and for what they will be doing in the future. Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12063 I was particularly interested in the comments about the 7th Task Force because this is where our rotational forces are going to come from. You have to understand that 70 per cent of Australia's combat forces are in East Timor. Our latent back-up force is completely denuded. I am one of those who hopes desperately that, in February, when the United Nations takes over, our forces there can further decline to about 20 per cent. I am particularly concernedand the committee has had a briefing on this-about what is going to be required to seal the border between East and West Timor. I am also concerned that we make sure that the United Nations does take over. If we are required to sustain these large numbers of troops in East Timor, we will have a serious problem in terms of rotation. Reference has been made to reservists. The medicos have already established a marvellous tradition of service overseas. I am heartened that a number of them are serving in Bougainville. We have had no explanation from the Prime Minister about why he has called for a report into the reserves-and it is quite unusual for the Prime Minister to call for a report. What was it that prompted his concern so that, as Prime Minister of this country, he called for a report into the reserves? .What is the report canvassing? I have the view that the use of specialists in the reserves in these deployments has been absolutely invaluable. I point out that we make practice payments to medical and dental specialists-that is, we ensure that neither they nor their partnerships suffer any financial penalty by virtue of their deployment or attachment overseas. I do not argue with that; I think that is very reasonable. But why should a farmer, who is a reservist and who may lose farm income by virtue of his service overseas, not be so compensated? We live in a society where enterprises and organisations really cannot afford to lose personnel for periods of time. This was alluded to by the honourable member when he said that in terms of the-joint training, which I think is particularly important, they are thinking of breaking it up into smaller lumps. I think there is a real need for us to re-Iook at the reserves to find a role that is practical for them and where they can be utilised. I do not think any member of parliament, and I am not trying to rubbish the reserves, can stand up in this parliament and say that we are able to utilise the reserves in our current situation to the fullest extent and there are no impediments. There are severe impediments. We really do need to rethink the shape and structure of our part-time army. Hopefully the current inquiry that the defence committee is undertakingbe able to benefit from advice from a whole range of people about this issue because I think that the Prime Minister's request is very timely although, as I say, it is not clear what prompted it. We do, I regret to say, as the honourable mell\ber for Throsby has said, need to understand that in our region, as opposed to areas much further away, we may be called on to make significant contributions. I found surprising the comments of the Minister for Defence that we not only currently could sustain 70 per cent of our combat troops being deployed and our latent force being denuded but in addition to that we could mount, if we were required to, a new and additional commitment. I do not want to question his words too much but I have to put on record that I found that very surprising. If it was true, one could speculate that it would be of the order of a platoon or a couple of platoons. I was surprised that he really made that statement. We will be in a position to know I suppose the exact situation on Friday when the CDF and Chief",157,Representatives Main Committee

365,Mr Price,"When it finally gets-under way, having been given the task in March, it will12064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 of Anny give us their briefing about the capacity that the minister has said that currently we could mount. The issue of fringe benefits was raised. I want to say that we in the opposition welcome the changes that the government has made. But it is also true to point out that at question time, when asked by the shadow minister for defence about the impact of fringe benefits, the Minister for Defence told the House that there was no problem, that all serving personnel would be accommodated by the 1 July changes and that they would be better off. Within 24 hours, of course, his junior minister, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, brought in some changes. As I say, I welcome those changes. I am not sure that we have gone far enough, by the way, welcome as those changes were. I think it would be worthwhile for us to keep a watching brief on what the impact of those changes is. In relation to the challenges that are facing the defence forces, I have mentioned the issue of rotation. I think there is of course a further issue in that the government has announced a new strategic document, hopefully to be finished by the first half of next year. I sincerely welcome that. I hope Dr Hawke will be able to playa useful role in it. I also need to put on the record my hope that it will be more realistic than the government's first effort and perhaps a little bit longer lived than the government's first effort. I for one am particularly looking forward to that. I should also place on the record an issue that the shadow minister for defence is constantly drawing to attention and that is block obsolescence and all that that involves. There is quite a number of equipments that are reaching their use-by dates, will no longer be economically viable to continue in service and need to be replaced. I want to give credit to the government. They saw a need for greater commitments to peacekeeping than hitherto had been espoused by the former government, although we never resiled from any ask about peacekeeping commitments, other than Bosnia. I am quite pleased that we kept out of that. Peacekeeping is going to have significant impacts on this strategic review. It is also going to have an impact on the structure of the any, and a severe impact on the issue of block obsolescence. I sincerely hope that our new Secretary to the Department of Defence, in consultation with the CDF, will be able to fully address these issues in that strategic paper, and I am very much looking forward to its publication, as I am the report into the reserves that the Prime Minister has requested. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Consideration resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Jull: That the House take note of the paper. please that only the member for Throsby, the member for Chifley, and the member for Boothby are interested in this topic. We got late notice that this matter was going to come up today and we have been the more speedy or the more observant of our colleagues and got our names down quickly to speak on this report on the Bougainville peace process. Nevertheless, the three of us have had a long standing interest in the defence topics under discussion. I said in talking on the preceding motion that it is surprising how quickly events change. This inquiry into the Bougainville peace process went over two parliaments, the 38th and the",159,Representatives Main Committee
366,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (10.41 A.m.),"Madam Deputy Speaker, do not get the impressionWednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12065 39th. For most of us the focus of the very short trip that each of us was part of, the three of us who are speaking, was Bougainville. When we were in Bougainville, one of the questions that came up-I think it was asked by the member for Chifley, and he I took a slightly different point of view-was, 'If events in East Timor unfold more or less the way they have now, would Australia's effort in PNG be diverted to East Timor?' I made the rather grandiose statement that Australia had put too much into Bougainville, or into PNG, both financially and emotionally, for us to walk away from there. When we were doing this inquiry, East Timor was coming to .the fore more and more, especially in the latter part of the inquiry. However, it did not have the prominence that it has today. For me the inquiry was a fascinating experience. I do not know if anyone understands present day Bougainville but to even attempt to try to understand it you have to be aware of its past history .. We were made aware of that, but that is in no way to suggest that we, or I personally, understand present day Bougainville. The inquiry, entitled Bougainville: the peace process and beyond, was difficult in many respects. It was difficult in that it went over two parliaments. There was a change of membership on the committee, but the three of us served on the committee in both parliaments. It was also difficult in that the situation in PNG and in Bougainville was constantly changing. There were other players in the field-the New Zealanders and others-but the situation was also constantly changing. And, of course, in the middle of this year the peace negotiations were conducted against the backdrop of acute political instability at the central government level which culminated in the sudden resignation of the then Prime Minister Skate in July. We wish the new government, the Morauta government, every success. All Australians look forward to working with that government. From my point of view, I have been very impressed with the approach that the new Prime Minister has taken in the desire for peace on Bougainville and also for the whole situation in PNG. Everyone wants peace, and to say that those people on Bougainville want peace is stating the obvious. But I do feel that there is a genuine desire for reconciliation. The people are tired of war and destruction and the useless waste of life and personal property. Many people are conscious of the fact-and this was put to us-that at one time Bougainville was the most prosperous of the PNG provinces. I am just working from memory but I think it contributed something like 30 percent to the PNG economy. AmI wrong? to the economy. Not only that, the training facilities and the educational facilities they had there were first-rate. When we went there, we flew around in a helicopter and wherever we went we saw ruin. It was really very sad. It has been put to me that some people say, 'The Bougainvilleans had all this opportunity and they blew it. Why should we in other parts of PNG work towards restoring it?' It was also put to us with regard to Australian aid. People put to us, 'Why should Australian aid be specifically into Bougainville when it was such a wealthy province?' I think a lot of people were frightened that aid would be diverted from other parts of PNG into Bougainville. The healing process will take a long time. It has been put to me that until the grieving commences, which it has not yet, there can be no real progress towards lasting peace. Increasingly, people talk about trauma counselling. I really do think-and we are going to find this in Timor as well-that there is a real need in places like Bougainville, which has gone",160,Representatives Main Committee
367,Dr Southcott,Forty per cent.,161,Representatives Main Committee
368,Mr Hollis,"-I said I was working from memory. But it made a tremendous contribution12066 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 through a tremendously shattering experience, for more and more trauma counselling. I do think that will be very necessary there. Different aspects of our inquiry looked at various things. Our visit to Bougainville was important and was the major part of the inquiry, I guess. There was the question of aid and how it is directed, and whether there has been too much emphasis on large projects. We visited the Bishop Wade school and various other places. Some people say that all the aid had been centred on large projects in or near Buka and it was raised whether there should be much more emphasis on village type projects. This is always very difficult. It is easy for us to stand in Australia and say what should or should not happen. The terrain is extremely difficult, the infrastructure has been destroyed. It is extremely complex. Increasingly, I fmd that in aid projects there is more and more emphasis on short projects where a dividend can be seen. You .can go in there and do some work over a two-month or three-month period and you can write it up and there can be results. I think it is important that we have a long-term approach to some of these aid projects. Of course, there has to be a mix. There is an important place for the large-scale projects, such as hospitals and schools. There is a place for the small, village type projects. But there is also a place for the ongoing and recurrent funding type of project which might go over two, three or four years. It might be four years before we see any tangible results, but it is important that we support those as well. The one thing that is essential-and this was put to us in various ways-is that there should be maximum involvement by the local Bougainvillean people. It is no good, despite how well meaning outsiders are, to come in, take over and run the show. Sometimes with aid projects we have to take a couple of steps back and let people find their own level. It is their country and we have to be prepared to take that step back and have that maximum involvement of the Bougainvillean people. I want especially to highlight the outstanding contribution of the Peace Monitoring Group in BougainviIle. I was very impressed with the work that they were doing there. I was impressed not only with their understanding of the process but also with the other forces that were there. Earlier, I mentioned the people who ferried us around the island on barges. We stayed on an island off Buka. There were people who guarded our place at night to make sure that we were not kidnapped, or whatever happens to visiting politicians in these places. Their understanding of and their empathy with the situation impressed me very much. You have to bear in mind that these people are unarmed. We asked the people who guarded us whilst we slept at night, 'What will happen if someone comes and takes us?' They said, 'Oh well, we will discuss it.' I must say that I had a few worries about whether I was going to be traded off, or something like that. They had been trained in this negotiating aspect, and they are unarmed. There are not only Australians and New Zealanders but also personnel from Vanuatu and Fiji. As I said, I was immensely impressed with the work that they were1ioing there, and I am full of admiration for our defence personnel serving there. I have a couple of points that I would like to make in my concluding moments. We almost stumbled by accident on the Sohano memorial when we were out on a morning walk one day. Someone had told us about this. This is a memorial to allied soldiers, coastwatchers and the loyal Bougvainvilleans who di-d during the Second World War. We were a bit upset that it was almost overgrown. We conducted a simple little ceremony there amongst ourselves. We came back l}Ild made a recommendation that work should be done on the memorial. It would Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12067 not cost very much to mow the lawn and keep that small simple memorial in a reasonable condition. There is another aspect that I personally take credit for getting into the recommendations. This was the recommendation that AusAID examine the possibility of allocating aid funding for projects designed to assist in rebuilding the archives and library collections of Bougainville by locating relevant material held in Australian collections and either copying the records or making them available to the Bougainvillean authorities in some other way. Rebuilding a society, which we are doing in Bougainville and which will be needed again in East Timor, is about more than bricks and mortar. It is rebuilding a people's belief in themselves. It is re-establishing their history and their links, and one way we can do this is through archives. We hold many records in Australia and not only government records. I noticed recently there was an allocation of some of the records of government departments to PNG but we hold many records in this country, as indeed do the churches and companies such as Bougainville Copper. Somewhere there are records of their activity. I believe that for future historians and to give these people this extra sense of rebuilding their society, we should do all we can to assist in re-establishing the libraries. Although they are something that a lot of people perhaps do not take all that much interest in, the archives of any society are essential. I had the honour of serving on the archives council here for many years so I have a particular interest in that. I want to see the archives of Bougainville restored and I believe again it would pay great dividends in the long term at not very great cost at all if we could assist in that. Finally, I want to place on record my appreciation of the work of the committee and especially my appreciation of the work of the committee secretary, Cliff Lawson, and the secretariat staff, who did an outstanding job in assisting us to bring this report to the parliament. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.56 a.m.)-I am very pleased to be able to speak on this report Bougainville: the peace process and beyond. I think that the report stands alone as an excellent reference on Bougainville. I also pay tribute to committee secretary, Cliff Lawson, and the secretariat. The report not only drew extensively on submissions from DFAT, AusAID and the Department of Defence, but we also received a lot of information from Anthony Regan of the ANU. We also have drawn together a lot of information from Sean Dorney's book, from Mary-Louise O'Callaghan's book about the Sandline affair and from clippings and information obtained on our visit in March. If you look at previous reports by this committee on Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, I think they have been very far-sighted. The 1991 report recommended replacing budget support with program and project aid. That recommendation was implemented and, in fact, next year Papua New Guinea will have their last dollop of budget support. In 1994 they concluded there could be no military solution to the conflict on Bougainville and that armed secession was not an option. That recommendation in hindsight has been very prescient and had that recommendation been noted, then perhaps the Operation High Speed II, the Sandline affair and so on could have been avoided. In terms of this report, broadly, the view of the committee is that, on the terms of reference that we were given, we would say we were able to give a tick to those activities. We were looking at the peace process, the activities of the Peace Monitoring Group and also the delivery of Australian overseas aid to Bougainville. In those three areas, I think we would agree that 12068 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 the Peace Monitoring Group brings great credit to Australia in the way they have carried out their activities. The peace process, while it does not move forward at a constant pace, we believe is moving forward. We did raise some of the issues that were raised with AusAID, but we were also able to see some very successful projects. As the previous speaker noted, the infrastructure and economy of Bougainville have been destroyed. For example, in Arawa, which was a town really established by Bougainville Copper, there are whole suburbs where the houses no longer exist. You can see gates and stairs leading up to where a house was and the house has been completely obliterated. Everywhere we were we saw rusted buildings, we saw buildings that had been burnt, the roads were not complete and there is significant Australian assistance being delivered to Bougainville. For example, $6.7 million is being spent on an 84-bed hospital at Buka-and we visited that hospital-while $9.7 million dollars is being spent on the rehabilitation and upgrading of Bishop Wade High School. When we visited the school 700 students turned out to see us. It was a very impressive visit. Another $8.5 million dollars is being spent on small-scale reconstruction, technical assistance and equipment, with $1.5 million on upgrade of the facilities at Radio Bougainville. Very importantly, $2.3 million is going on support for activities linked to the peace process and another $3.3 million is for support for peace related transport. There is also $7.3 million for basic rehabilitation of the coastal trunk road and $5.5 million for construction of wharves at Kangu beach and Mamagota beach. We were not able to travel on much of the coastal trunk road as it had been destroyed. The third point is that Bougainville has now been peaceful since mid-1997. There is widespread support for the peace process on the island. We did meet with most participants on the island and were also able to meet with members of the opposition and Sam Akoitai from the government. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet with then Prime Minister, Bill Skate. The estimated cost of the conflict is the deaths of hundreds of soldiers and 10,000 to 15,000 civilians. The report also does document very clearly the history of the conflict and of Bougainville's and Papua New Guinea's colonial status. It is important to get an understanding of that. Bougainville was initially part of German New Guinea. In 1921, it was a C-class mandate administered by Australia. In 1945, it became a UN trusteeship. At the same time, neighbouring islands like the Solomon Islands were always British Commonwealth and so on. There have been secessionist sentiments raised in Bougainville from time to time. The Panguna mine, as previously mentioned, did provide 44 per cent of Papua New Guinea's exports and 17 per cent of 'government revenue. We found in our travels, and from speaking to people who are experts in this area, that there is no widespread support on the island for reopening the mine. That is something that may change as they gain more autonomy under the Papua New Guinea government's package. When the conflict first broke out in November 1988, the grievances were complex. Initially, secession was not an issue. The committee report has charted fairly well how people's sentiments changed in terms of probably being in support of the BRA and then turning against the BRA. There was also a blockade from 1990 to 1994 which caused a lot of hardship to the island. The Sandline affair is important in this whole thing in that it did provide a circuit-breaker in the thinking in Papua New Guinea. It did sour the relations between Australia and Papua Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12069 New Guinea, but we made it very clear that we were not prepared to tolerate mercenaries in the South Pacific. It was really the Sandline affair that gave impetus to the talks at Burnham. Once the Sandline affair was over, and was unable to be carried out, there was no possibility of any military solution being carried out by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. A sideline to this is that the MI24s, MI17s and rockets have been at Tindal since March 1997. That relates to what we were talking about previously. Australian development assistance to Papua New Guinea is our largest aid program. Twothirds of all overseas development assistance to Papua New Guinea comes from Australia. We will also be spending greater than $100 million on aid to Bougainville in the five years up to 2002-03. This is done in consultation with the Papua New Guinea government -nd recognises Australia's support for PNG sovereignty in relation to Bougainville. The Papua New Guinea economy is commodity based and is subject to external shocks. In recent times they have been subject to the downturn in the East Asian economic crisis, a very severe drought, failed negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank, a decline in the forestry industry, the tidal wave at Wewak in July 1998 and also an obligation to pay $38 million in compensation to Sandline. I have great faith in the new Prime Minister, a former Central Bank Governor, Sir Mekere Morauta, who has confirmed that economic reform and restoration of investor confidence as well as Bougainville will be priorities for his government. As previous stated, we did meet with the Minister of State, Sam Akoitai, who is also a Bougainville MP. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has acknowledged in the committee report that these two individuals were quite flexible in relation to Bougainville and did help to advance the peace process. Under the new government, Sir Michael Somare is the Minister for Bougainville Affairs. Recently this month he announced that autonomy will be given to Bougainville as long as they can come up with something by 25 December. The submission from DFAT, which I agree with, said that most Bougainvilleans were comfortable with remaining part of Papua New Guinea but that they also wanted a greater say in their own affairs than they have so far had. We did have submissions to the contrary, but I think this submission carries more weight. There were a number of parts to the Lincoln Agreement-disarming, phased withdrawal of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, establishing civil police and law, and also a discussion of Bougainville's ultimate political status. There have been delays in the Lincoln timetable, but we did feel that the peace process was moving forward. During our visit in March we met with the opposition in Port Moresby and also with the Leitana Council of Elders, who were echoing similar concerns to the opposition's: everyone supported a peaceful solution, but they were critical of the process and felt that elections proposed at that time were unconstitutional. Since more recent meetings and the Makatana and Oketaina Understanding in April 1999, the then opposition has been less critical and the process has been moving forward. As I said, on 8 October this year-that is, this month-Papua New Guinea offered autonomy to Bougainville, and they now have a 25 December deadline for the new constitution. I think that is something that will be acceptable to most participants. Another issue touched on by the committee was the disposal of weapons. Some progress has been made there towards an agreement for organising disposal. Perhaps that could also be linked with the phased withdrawal of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force-another part of the Lincoln Agreement. We also talked about basic communications, and one of the 12070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 recommenQations related to the provision of satellite phones to participants in the peace process so that dialogue between them could be speeded up. Australia has made an outstanding contribution to the peace process-facilitating the process, providing the bulk of the Peace Monitoring Group and' also assisting with aid. It was encouraging to see peaceful elections in May this year for the BougainviIle People's Congress. While we were on our trip we saw the Peace Monitoring Group in action. I think: this was a New Zealand adaptation, but they had a little hut there which was neutral ground and various participants would come together to talk in the hut. While we were there we saw that preparations for the elections were well under way. We think: the peace process continues to move forward. As previously stated, as well as Australian personnel, the Peace Monitoring Group includes personnel from Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. Their key role is monitoring compliance with the cease-fire and also promoting the peace process. Earlier this year there were 300 members-245 from Australia, 29 from New Zealand, 12 from Fiji and 15 from Vanuatu. The important points are that the Peace Monitoring Group be neutral and be perceived as being neutral. Australia did have some baggage in Bougainville, related to Bougainville's colonial status, Bougainville Copper,and the defence arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea which saw Iroquois helicopters used in Bougainville. I think: that has been overcome. People do understand that the Peace Monitoring Group is not a permanent presence. At Wakunai, when the Peace Monitoring Group explained that they would be leaving, people said, 'We're going to go back into the bush when you leave.' But the members of the group are emphasising that it is not a permanent presence, and I think that they are widely welcomed. We were told that, initially, when they arrived with the helicopters, people would actually run away, but that now, when the orange helicopters arrive, people come out and wave. It is something that you see right across the island. It is important that this is a multinational force and that it is also unarmed. They play an important role in building confidence and trust. We also saw the ADF health element at Loloho in the old tailings shed of BougainviIle Copper. That is a very impressive facility and they have made a number of adaptations-for example, a humidicrib made out of just a bit of wire and Gladwrap and costing about $15,000 less than the commercially available alternative. I also believe that the Peace Monitoring Group should limit its role to supporting the peace process. It should not be proactive. Its exit should be event driven with, possibly, a phased reduction and an eventual withdrawal. this report on the Bougainville peace process of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. There is nothing that the honourable member for Boothby said that I would not want to be associated with. As we have the deputy leader of the delegation to Bougainville in our midst, it would be remiss of me not to compliment former senator David MacGibbon, who led the delegation, and, of course, the deputy leader of the delegation. It was a very successful delegation and I was very privileged to make that trip, as I am sure all were who did so. The general public do not get to understand how valuable these trips are for members of parliament. The delegation was made up of four different political parties. We were able-and do always, I feel-to work constructively to evaluate the evidence and bring forward worthwhile recommendations that are in no way partisan.",161,Representatives Main Committee
369,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.12 A.m.),"I want to make a short contribution to the debate on Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12071 I think that the government has a very decent record in terms of the Peace Monitoring Group. Some may say that Australia got gazumped by New Zealand but, in a sense, whilst that may be true, the honourable member for Boothby hit the mark when he said that Australia has a lot of baggage in Papua New Guinea and, specifically, in Bougainville. So it should be no surprise that a neighbouring country and good friend like New Zealand is in a much better position to take some initiatives in this regard. The truth and the reality is that Australia stepped in behind New Zealand and provided all the wherewithal. SoI am in no way critical of that at all. The most exciting news is the chan-e of government and the platform of the new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir\ Mekere Morauta, and his offer of autonomy to Bougainville. I think this is really breathtaking, given the history of Bougainville. It means that Bougainville can determine all matters except defence, foreign affairs and the police. I sincerely hope that the Bougainvilleans will respond to that very generous offer by the PNG government. There are some lessons for us in some of the trouble spots in that the way to hold a country and a central government intact-and PNG is a good example with a huge ethnic diversity amongst its population-is to focus on human rights and to grant autonomy and allow ordinary people to make important decisions through their local government, in this case, a provincial government of Bougainville. I hope that the Bougainvilleans accept this. I sincerely trust that this approach will prove more successful in terms of devolution than the two previous attempts that have been tried in Papua New Guinea. I also wanted to place on record appreciation for the assistance that the government is offering the new incoming government of Papua New Guinea in terms of the extra $80 million for all the important economic changes and reforms that need to be undertaken in that area. We can only hope that the government will go on from success to success. In relation to the contribution Australia and neighbouring countries are making to the Peacekeeping Monitoring Group, it will come as no surprise that the delegation found that they were doing an outstanding and invaluable job. It needs to be remembered that the conflict in Bougainville over nine years has been extremely bloody and costly in terms of civilian lives. Australia and the other countries took the decision to send in unarmed people. That decision with hindsight has proven to be right on the mark, but I imagine that it must have been a very difficult decision for the Prime Minister. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.18 a.m. to 11.48 a.m. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (11.47 a.m.)-It is a great pleasure for me to speak on this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Bougainville: the peace process and beyond. This report is one of those excellent and seminal reports of the committee which will probably be read many times over the next few years and be used as a reference in relation to these very important matters concerning Bougainville. It is the crowning report on Bougainville from the committee, coming as it does after a number of reports by the joint standing committee over the years in relation to the Bougainville issue. It was mentioned by one of the other speakers that in 1991 there was a report on Papua New Guinea in which there was a section on Bougainville. I was chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee at the time that report was produced. Obviously, that report was concerned about a number of issues in relation to Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. In 1994 there was a 12072 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 further report from the committee which recommended that a military solution to the crisis was not possible and suggested ways of moving forward with a peaceful solution. And finally, earlier this year I had the honour of being the deputy leader of the delegation which went to Bougainville. We have produced an important report as a result of that visit. The members of the secretariat should be congratulated for their work. I congratulate the secretary of the subcommittee, Mr Cliff Lawson, and the many other people who worked to put together this major report. In fact, it is a great document on the Bougainville crisis. Many speakers have mentioned the wonderful role. which our forces are playing in the Bougainville peace process. The Peace Monitoring Group does not get sufficient recognition in the Australian community for the important role which it is playing in this matter. I was so impressed, the whole delegation was so impressed and, indeed, I believe the full committee has been impressed with the great work of the Peace Monitoring Group. They have been able to do their job without arms in a difficult situation and to help keep the peace in Bougainville over the critical period-the last couple of years particularly-when negotiations have been tense and there has been pressure for a break-out of violence once again. Nevertheless, they have managed to do a wonderful job. They ought to be congratulated and the Australian community ought to thank them for this important work they have been doing. Having said that, I think it is obvious that in any conflict of this kind-as we have learnt, unfortunately, by making mistakes in relation to the East Timor crisis-it is very important that we have a process of political negotiation and peace negotiation going on all the time, trying to fmd a resolution of the differences between people. In this situation, what is most important is that Australia not merely backs the peace monitoring process, which it is continuing' to do, but does more to back the peace negotiation process and the development of a constitution for Bougainville. Until we actually have a constitution on the ground which has been agreed to by the people of Bougainville and which fits not only into the general desires of the people of Bougainville but the broader desires of the people of Papua New Guinea and, indeed, the people of the region for a peaceful resolution of this issue, we will not really have resolved this problem. I will talk a bit more about that, but perhaps it is worth explaining why I say that, and I will do that by looking a little bit at the background. If you look at what happened in Bougainville, it was the unknown and unsung civil war. Bougainville was divided, with a very nasty war between its own people, aided and abetted at that time by the government of Papua New Guinea and its forces. We do not know the actual number, but an estimated 10,000 people, probably more, were reported to have been killed. But it was not one of those crises in which the international community took much of an interest. As a result, during those years, and especially between 1989 and 1994, so many people died and there was so much suffering. Indeed, the people of Bougainville were cut off, even to the extent at one point of not having basic amenities such as food and energy. The destruction that took place during that time was also quite awful. Major pieces of infrastructure, the major buildings around the whole country, were virtually all destroyed. Hardly any major buildings were left and people lived in the countryside. A lot of the so-called Revolutionary Army people went to live in the countryside and even in the forests, where they were very difficult to detect, but they were able to carry out an effective campaign for the cause which they believed in. Wednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12073 As other speakers have said, it is very sad that the Bougainville crisis was allowed to reach the point where at least 50 per cent, and possibly more, of the people were thinking of an independent state as the only way to solve the crisis. They wanted independence. And one of the reasons for that was that the central government of Papua New Guinea was not sensitive to the needs of the people of Bougainville, to their cultural heritage, to their economic requests, to their development needs and so on. I think what happened was a tragedy-a very big tragedy-and it need not have happened. It was a failure of diplomacy, not just within Papua New Guinea but also within the region. I have to say that I personally believe-and this is a personal comment only-that Australia at that time could have done more to prevent the breakout of the crisis and the suffering. Indeed, Australia's backing in terms of the Panguna mine was one of the catalysts. What happened at the mine, and all of the events surrounding the mine, was one of the catalysts of this crisis. I think we can learn something else, too, from what has happened since 1997, when we attempted reconciliation. I think the government of New Zealand and the foreign minister of New Zealand ought to be congratulated for their efforts in trying to bring the people together in the various agreements that were made, beginning with the Burnham agreement and then the Lincoln agreement and so on. These agreements have helped to bring the parties together. One of the things that they aid-which was extraordinary even in a world context-was that, even though they had been fighting in a civil war, even though they had been killing each other, even though so many people had suffered, they decided at a given moment to say, 'Stop. No more of this. We are going to fmd peace. Whatever happens we are going to fmd a way forward that unites all Bougainvilleans'-or most of the Bougainvilleans, irrespective-of which side they took in the question of whether to be independent or not independent. . When we went there as a delegation I asked a lot of questions, because I am interested in this matter, about what constitutional arrangements each side had in mind-the side that had preferred independence and the side that had preferred to stay in Papua New Guinea. The thing that came through was that even those who wanted to remain in Papua New Guinea all wanted a significantly increased level of autonomy for the people of Bougainville. In fact, when I asked even the chiefs up in the north of the island, who were against independence, what they really wanted, what they would be prepared to accept, they said, 'We want a lot of autonomy. We want a different constitution for Bougainville within Papua New Guinea.' So it seemed to me from that point that, although there was disagreement on the question of independence, there was certainly a lot of agreement about the desire of the Bougainville province to have significant autonomy if it is going to be a state within Papua New Guinea. This point began to be realised by the previous Prime Minister, Bill Skate, and has also been recognised by the current Prime Minister, Sir Mekere Morauta. He and his foreign minister, Sir Michael Somare, have said that they are prepared to move on an agenda for autonomy for the province-a big autonomy agenda. This is a terrific breakthrough. I refer to a report by Mary-Louise O'Callaghan on 8 October in the Australian, which states: Papua New Guinea has offered to grant autonomy to iJougainville ceding all but the powers of defence, foreign affairs and police to the new state in an effort to cast a lasting solution to 10 years of civil conflict. 12074 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 So what has happened here is that through this patient process of two and a half years, supported by the great efforts of the Australian forces as the monitoring group, we have managed to see a situation where the current government-and I believe probably the opposition of Papua New Guinea as well-looks like it will support a very substantial autonomy agenda in which all sorts of powers will be given to the Bougainville people in their new state parliament. That is very important because, as I mentioned earlier, that is partly what this issue has been about from the beginning. If this initiative is going to succeed, then it will require very patient effort to draft an autonomy constitution for the new province. We the Australian community and our experts can help in this process. If we are able to help the people of Bougainville and the government of Papua New Guinea in the drafting process-and our parliament is very good at these sorts of things-of a new constitution for the state of Bougainville, which accepts this autonomy package, and if we are able to give assistance with constitutional experts and the like, then we will be able to press the agenda forward even further. In that regard, I especially commend to the House the first four recommendations in the committee's report that this peace process be supported by Australia through a number of pragmatic and diplomatic measures. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to now take up this initiative, work with it and give Australia's backing to it. We have invested a lot through the Peace Monitoring Group and our armed forces in Bougainville. We need to now invest in the political side with a diplomatic agenda to help the people of Bougainville and Papua New Guinea achieve this package for an autonomous state of Bougainville within Papua New Guinea and, hopefully, to create peace by resolving one of the most difficult problems of our region. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Andrew Thomson: That the House take note of the paper. it would be all honourable members. I take my responsibility in this place very seriously: the responsibility to represent my constituents both in the forum of the parliament as well as through ministerial and departmental channels. That is the reason people elect us to this place: we are members of the House of Representatives. The second part of that if you like, in a twoway street arrangement, is that we have an important role to find out how and why things occur and to account to the people whom we represent. I think that is a very important responsibility in itself, and there is no better forum anywhere in the world than the forum of parliament to find out exactly how executive and departmental decision making occurs. I know that statement sounds awfully like a lecture in civics-and I do not want to offend anyone by being overly simplistic-but it does strike me on occasions that those in departments resent the fact that members of parliament occasionally seek information and seek justification as to why certain things occur. Often we ask probing questions that take things down to the nth degree. Sometimes all we seek are some reasonable and general assurances that the pattern that is followed by departmental officials in the decisions that they help the",166,Representatives Main Committee
370,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.02 P.m.),"Like all honourable members-and I presumeWednesday, 20 October 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12075 executive make on behalf of the people of Australia and the parliament are the right decisions, that the patterns are the right patterns. All of this is background to my comments about this important report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, a committee that was convened only a couple of years ago by Minister Downer. He announced the reform treaty making process in May 1996. On that day he stated: The new arrangementsthat is the tabling of treaties in parliament and allowing for treaties committee reviewwill apply to all treaties, bilateral as well as multilateral. They also will apply to all actions which amend a treaty if the amendment would alter obligations with illegally binding impact on Australia. In other words, the role of the treaties committee is to ask some pretty straightforward questions: what is in it for Australia, why are we agreeing to this treaty action, how will it affect us, and have provisions of our Constitution which allow for foreign agreements to override domestic law been considered by those who have negotiated the fme detail of these treaty matters? At the time of the commencement of the treaties committee reform treaty making process in May 1996, the minister contemplated only one exception to the rule. That is that the government-read the executive-would reserve the right to take urgent treaty action in circumstances where it is: ... necessary to safeguard Australia's national interest, be they commercial, strategic or foreign policy interests. No-one disputes the fact that there are going to be occasions where reference to parliament may not be possible. I also submit the second part of that particular caveat that, where that particular treaty action was urgent, it would be tabled as soon as possible together with an explanation. In other words, the people would be told. This treaty matter deals with, the extension of a very long-running agreement with the United States over the use of our territory to site the Pine Gap defence installation, which gathers intelligence believed to be of mutual interest to both countries and of strategic importance in both the Cold War era and since. Our concern to find out exactly what does happen was made virtually impossible because of the direct obfuscation of Department of Defence officials. The frustrating part of that was the committee could find out more from talking to a couple of professors, Des Ball and Paul Dibb, who were both very established in their understanding of strategic and defence matters. We could find out more from talking to them and getting a gleaning of their understanding than we could from talking to the Department of Defence. We could find out more by picking up almost any popular magazine or newspaper article that has been written-perhaps in speculative terms-about what happens in Pine Gap than from talking to the officials from the Department of Defence. This goes to the heart of one of our key jobs as members of parliament. We have a role to account to the people as to why things happen. I think it is a very grave development. The worry I have as a very dedicated member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is that, at the end of the day, it undermines the committee and the parliament and the people and their role in this matter. It is a great tension that needs some resolution. The committee rightly came up with a couple of ideas that we have put to government and through the parliament in this report which we 12076 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 October 1999 believe will help resolve the matter. We considered that the provision of information which will enable us to have a finding that the treaty action was in Australia's national interest is not an unreasonable request. We could, as some have suggested, have looked at a different committee and the one that looks at national security matters in particular. That has all the security clearances that are required so that whoever finds out whatever they find out can keep it to themselves. We do not go down that track because we think that undermines what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties should be able to do without caveat, as it was established to cover the full range of treaties. We were particularly disappointed to note that members of the United States Congress are able to virtually freely come and go upon request to this particular installation and find out, from a US point of view, what occurs there. Of course we acknowledge that there are ordinary members of parliament who are also members of the executive, plus the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cunningham, who is the shadow defence minister, who are given full and comprehensive briefings on this particular installation. So to restate that in a different way: only two members of this parliament who know about what goes on there are not members of the executive. I trust the judgment of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the people who know about these matters, and I rely on them to make good judgments on the use of this facility. But as a committee of private members of this place representing the people of Australia, we felt we owed the people a little bit more certainty in our agreement with this treaty. It was always our view that there would be a ratification of this treaty recommended out of the report that we are debating today. It was always our view that all folklore and gut feeling suggested to us that Pine Gap was a worthwhile place. We just wanted to get some reasonable understanding directly out of the mouths of the Department of Defence to be sure about that, and it is lamentable that we could not. I raise these matters because I think it is important to state on the record that members of parliament take their responsibility seriously and that television shows like Yes, Minister spring to mind on too many occasions when bureaucrats hide behind convenient codes of secrecy and do not provide even the basic information that the people of Australia deserve to know. I commend this report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned.

376,Permanent Entry Into That Country To (A) Hlv/Aids Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honour(3) (a) As part of the National HIV/AIDS strategy, mandatory mY/AIDS testing was introduced on 19 December 1989 for applicants who wish to migrate or remain permanently in Australia and who are 15 years of age and over, including prospective refugees and onshore Protection Visa applicants. Younger children who are being adopted by an Australian, or who have a history of blood transfusion or other clinical indications are also required to undergo HIV/AIDS testing. (b) Yes. (4) (aHb) Statistics on the number of applicants, whether refugee or other categories of migrants, who have been refused on the basis of being tested as HIV positive or suffering full AIDS are not available. Privacy considerations constrain my department for the retention of data on persons who have been found to be mv positive of this obviates comprehensive statistics. (5) (aHb) If it is to be inferred from the question that an 'incident' is when a person has been the subject of violence or threats of violence, I am advised that there has been one, unconfirmed, report of an incident concerning an individual involved in carrying on medical test procedures for prospective refugees and other categories of migrants. As this is an unconfirmed report of an isolated occurrence, I cannot divulge comprehensive details, except that a laboratory technician engaged in HIV testing in a non-government institution, was allegedly harassed by government agents, in particular, police. (6) (aHe) I am advised that my department has no record of any recent complaints or representations, either in an official or unofficial capacity, from representatives of African or other governmentsregarding the Australian Government's policy to test prospective refugees and migrants for HIV/AIDS and/or other medical conditions. (7) (aHb) The New Zealand Government does not submit refugees and other individuals seeking permanent entry to New Zealand to routine mY/AIDS tests, although tests are conducted for other medical conditions. The rationale behind the policy and procedures for these tests are a matter for the New Zealand Government. (8) (aHc) Officers from my department have had informal discussions with New Zealand Government counterparts regarding the procedures that the two governments have in place for all medical screening. These discussions are part of on-going contract with New Zealand authorities with a view to achieving greater harmonisation of our approaches to immigration criteria. Ultimately, however, the actual policy and procedures of either country are a matter for each sovereign government. (9) (aHb) The Australian Government does not provide the New Zealand Government with assistance in regard to testing for various medical conditions. Officers from the New Zealand Government have discussed with their counterparts in my department arrangements on the possible shared use of Australian overseas infrastructure for such testing. These discussions are on-going and no final decisions have been made at this stage.
