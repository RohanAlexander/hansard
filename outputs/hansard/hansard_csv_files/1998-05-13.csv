People who have been injured A major concern with the bill has been the and people in need, like those whom I have repealing of part III of the Disability Services described, have been hit very hard by this Act that it seeks to achieve. Part III provides government in its first two budgets, and the guidance as to both the kinds of people who partial privatisation of the CRS is part of an should be assisted and the kinds of assistance ongoing attack against Australians who are that should be given.

Firstly, the legislation as it is because there was no longer work for them to currently constituted does not require that the do.

318,Mr Speaker,"With regret, I am afraid, system is the right of every Australian andWednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3251 Wednesday, 13 May 1998 Main Committee in the second decade of this Parliament House. Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 April, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, which will be finalised today before going back into the main chamber. As we all would know, the human cost of marriages or relationships breaking up, where children are involved, is enormous. Clearly, this legislation aims to provide a more equitable distribution to both custodial and non-custodial parents, particularly keeping in mind it is the children in those marriages that need to be cared for. Today in Australia two out of every three marriages will fail. They may not all involve children, but a large percentage do. Two things are certain: Australia does need the Child Support Agency, but certainly there is room for improvement. Why do we need the Child Support Agency? This was established by the then Labor government on 1 June 1988. Like many Labor initiatives it was a good idea but there was obviously a lot of finetuning to be done, and it still is being done. Before the CSA was established, fewer than 30 per cent of parents were paying or receiving child support. The cost of court access was prohibitive, court orders were at the time difficult and expensive to enforce and ultimately the taxpayer ended up footing the bill. A lot of children missed out on payments that they deserved. The child support scheme aims to ensure a number of things: that parents share the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity; that adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; that Commonwealth involvement and expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure that the children's needs are met; that work incentives for both parents to participate in the labour force are not impaired; and that the overall arrangements are not intrusive on personal privacy but are simple, flexible and efficient. Let us look at some of the statistics regarding the establishment of the child support scheme. A lot of the results have been positive but there have been areas that have caused great concern to many parents, in particular non-custodial ones. I will come back to that theme later. There are nearly a million clients now that use the CSA, and 70 per cent of clients do pay regularly, although there is some debate about the accuracy of that figure. The average child support payment has gone from around $20 a week to around $50 a week, and $1 billion in child support was transferred between parents in 1996-97. Certainly there have been significant savings from the child support scheme to the taxpayer, currently about $320 million. Interestingly, 92 per cent of payers are men and around a third of the recipients have been repartnered. The number of payers who are living with new partners where children are present is estimated to be no more than 15 per cent. At 30 June last year, the CSA had over 439,000",152,Notices Mr Anderson To Present A Bill For An Act To

321,Mr Anthony (Richmond) (10.00 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Child3252 MAIN COMMlITEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 active cases, with around 261,000 opting out of child support and 178,000 opting out for private collection arrangements. Private collection arrangements certainly need to be encouraged. In the electorate of Richmond there are over 3,500 payers and nearly 4,200 payees. There are more than 3,800 lone parents in the area that I represent, one of the highest levels in the country. Over half of the child support cases involve one child and a further third involve two children. It is important to look at the income levels of CSA clients. Over one-third of payers have a taxable income less than $10,000. It is true that in some cases income is minimised to avoid payment, but the bulk of these low income payers rely on welfare and have no child support liability. FromI July they will be paying slightly more, which will be around $2.50 a week. Fifty-four per cent of payers have a taxable income of under $20,000, 87 per cent have a gross income under $40,000 and only one payee in 25 earns over $70,000. As might be expected, the income of payees is slightly lower. Seventy per cent of payees, normally the custodial parents, have income levels under $10,000; 85 per cent are on income levels under $20,000; 95 per cent are on income levels under $30,000 and 97 per cent under levels of $40,000. There was a lot of discussion, of course, about the child support formula which I will come back to later, but it is important that this house recognises the percentages. Depending on the number of children you have, it is 18 per cent for one child, 27 per cent for two, 32 per cent for three, 34 per cent for four and 36 per cent for five. Clearly, there have been a number of problems with the Child Support Agency. There are, obviously, difficulties hecause of the discrepancy in data and in the relationships with many other departments-for instance, Attorney-General's and, of course, the tax office. There are still serious problems when it comes to non-custodial parents and custodial parents alike. I will just briefly skim over the problems because I think that it is more important to come to some of the solutions that have been advocated in the current legislation and I would also like to foreshadow some amendments that will be coming in the House tomorrow. Of course, some of the problems have been the collection rates and enforcement, particularly with the issues of access and delays in payment. There is still an enormous amount of bureaucracy and, particularly when clients ring up the CSA, perhaps because of the enormous workload that the CSA has, perhaps the contact with many, say, non-custodial parents has not been as adequate as it should be. Of course, I have numerous cases, as do most backbenchers, of terrible situations of constituents, whether an ambulance driver in Ballina, or a family in Murwillumbah involving a teacher, or many cases in Lismore, but I would rather not go into those particular details. But there are some solutions and, of course, this is a long road that we must walk down. Some of the solutions are in this current bill and some will be coming tomorrow. The bill before us today aims to rectify some of the problems that previous governments considered too hard to tackle. I would like to highlight the main provisions of this bill and I would also like to foreshadow government amendments which will be brought down by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles), tomorrow. In summary, the bill, firstly, increases paying parents' income by 10 per cent. For 1997-98, the income exempt amount will be $9,907 for single payers and $16,525, plus additional amounts for each child, for payers with natural or adopted children in their care. The bill includes an amount for a shared-care child in the exempt income amount and reduces the Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3253 amount of the payee's disregarded income amount. It lowers the payee's disregarded income from $37,424 to $29,598 by using a figure known as the 'all employees average total weekly earnings' rather than full-time adult weekly earnings. It needs to be pointed out that this reduction will be offset by halving of the rate at which the child support is reduced from the present dollar for dollar reduction in child support once you are over the income limit of 50c in the dollar. The bill removes automatic inclusion of child care in the payee's disregarded income. It allows higher child care costs to be grounds for departure from the assessment and reduces the effect of the payee's disregarded income. It introduces a minimum payment of $260 per year. Child support is to be payable for secondary students until the end of the year in which they tum 18. It includes rental property losses and foreign exempt income to be calculated in the child support. An uplift factor will apply to the base child support assessment on the most up-to-date income of parents only where the parent has not lodged the most recent tax return. It will also no longer backdate child support liability. There are other changes for second families, allowing the credit for child support paid in determining entitlements to family payment for payees' subsequent families. There are also a number of changes which I will quickly highlight in the area of administration. The bill will introduce a formal process to enable parents to object to CSA decisions. No longer will the names and birth dates of relevant dependant children be included on the assessment notice. It will allow parents to agree to collect and pay child support privately at any time, and will require parents to pay and collect child support privately where there is a good record of payment. There will be better alignment of Family Court and child support legislation relating to child care arrangements, allowing parents to end the child support assessment where their safety is at risk and providing support and assistance to parents to collect child support where safety is no longer of concern. The bill provides for an improved notification and disbursement process to reduce the incidence of overpayments, allows child support debts to be offset between parents, and allows estimates of income to be rejected where they do not reflect the actual income. And there are a number of other assessments. In the time. I have remaining, I would like to reflect on some of the input and decisions that have been made by a task force that was convened less than six weeks ago by the Prime where we could make improvements to what is obviously a very difficult area of social policy, where many families, particularly parents, face terrific trauma regarding the income levels that they either have to survive on or have to pay. The first of the areas we looked at-and there will be amendments moved by the parliamentary secretary tomorrow-was non-agency payments. As of 21 April, cabinet agreed to the arrangements for non-agency payments and child support liabilities to become more flexible up to a 25 per cent amount focused on a certain amount of expenditure. This will obviously provide far greater flexibilities and allow payers more choice in the form in which child support is paid by them, while protecting payees and meeting the needs of the children. Those particular items-and obviously there will be further finetuning done by the Child Support Agency-will, for example, be fees charged at a school or a pre-school at which a child is enrolled, essential medical and dental fees, the payment of a lot of utilities, whether it be rent, bond, corporate fees, rates or mortgages, and other costs involved with payment of",153,Representatives Main Committee
322,Minister ( Mr Howard),"I was the chairman of that task force-to look specifically at areas3254 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 motor vehicle costs et cetera. We believe this allows a lot more flexibility and a recognition that particularly non-custodial parents, if they wish to make certain payments to their children or, indeed, to the custodial parent which are not necessarily formalised by the CSA, will have that opportunity to do so up to 25 per cent. It is also important to note, because there has been a lot of concern regarding having access or paying, say, travel costs, that in current legislation you can apply to the CSA and get a departure order, as long as it is over five per cent of your costs, which then, if successful, can be used to offset or help reimburse travel costs, whether you are flying to your children or your children are coming to you. This is consistent with recommendation No. 67 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, tabled in November 1994. The next area where there was a lot of concern which came up in previous coalition government committees and also in the joint select committee recommendations was in relation to persons evading child support by travelling overseas. This proposal gives the Child Support Registrar the power to stop a parent who has persistently failed to meet his or her child support liabilities from leaving Australia. That is done through the issue of a departure prohibition order. This takes up recommendation No. 115 of the joint select committee. Indeed, it goes a bit further, but obviously it has to with those parents that have a demonstrated poor record of failing to meet their child support liabilities. This is only a very small group, but I believe it goes some way to remedying this situation. The third area has to do with transparency and the independent process to depart from the formula assessment. Currently, six per cent of the parents seek to depart from an assessment. Of this, 50 per cent are approved and, of course, the other 50 per cent are not. Therefore, three per cent of parents within the CSA believe they have an unsatisfactory arrangement because they do not have the mechanisms perhaps or they do not feel as though they are getting an adequate hearing to formulate a departure. The Child Support Task Force-and I must thank the members from all the different agencies that came before us-discovered that there was a real need to have a review within the Child Support Agency of the training, qualifications and remunerations of the review officers who determine the departure mechanisms and the administrative assessment. As such, a review will be conducted immediately and will report back to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) by 30 June 1998. The review will looK at those areas within the CSA that we can improve. For many non-custodial and custodial parents, it is not only the amount that they pay through the child support formula that they see as unfair but also the way they are being handled within the actual agency. The Child Support Agency will also be examining the processes to depart from the administrative assessment and developing a range of options that will be very transparent and accountable. Clearly, that time line has to be a bit longer. With regard to transparency and independent process, there is a suggestion by a government member to look at a more judicial process, for instance, going to the Family Court. Whilst it does have some merit, it is the view of the task force that we should look at reforming, or at attempting to reform, the Child Support Agency before we go down a more judicial process because there could be a potential for one agency to be played off against another notwithstanding the merits of that proposal. In the area of access, there is clearly a very contentious issue where non-custodial parents pay their child support arrangements and yet, when they come to pick up their children, access Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3255 is denied because the children are not there either intentionally or accidentally. Nevertheless, the task force has recommended a number of measures to be looked at in pilot schemes-and these will start immediately-on how to better improve or enforce parental compliance to their obligations. A number of small pilot services will be provided across the country. Locations for these are not yet specific. When a contact order is made, they will provide immediate assistance for parents to resolve a conflict over contact as it arises and provide a compulsory program for parents convicted of breaching an order. These programs will be community based. We also hope to run some programs in a more judicial area, so we can compare apples with apples to see which system will work better in ensuring access is complied with because this causes enormous concern for many parents. In that particular area, a report is currently being compiled by the Attorney-General. It is an interim report on penalties enforcement, specifically in the area of enforcement of Family Court orders. This will come down in June. We believe it is important for this report to be tabled and we are waiting to find out what is in it. Pending its tabling, one of our recommendations is for a joint parliamentary committee to look into the area of access. That recommendation will have to be delayed until this report is finalised. Clearly, this is one of the major issues in relation to the child support arrangements and it causes an enormous amount of grief. In the area of the diverse forms of income received and taken into account for child support, the committee has made some other recommendations which will be given in more detail tomorrow. We believe that an interdepartmental committee needs to be established to look at the various sources of income available to payers and payees-such as salary sacrifice, corporate structures, second jobs and overtime. That interdepartmental committee will be instigated shortly and will report by the middle of the year. At the moment, we have discovered some difficulties with the process principally because we have to know about the tax reform package, which will come down in the not too distant future, following the very responsible budget that was delivered last night. We have to know what Ihe landscape is not only in regard to the tax structure but also in regard to the social security structure before we can make some firm recommendations in that area. Nevertheless, progress is now being made and I hope there will be further advances. In conclusion, for all members of the government, and even of the opposition, one of the major duties associated with being a member of parliament is listening to some of the terrible cases that come before us, where families have broken up, whereA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.21 a.m. to 10.31 a.m. up valuable time over the last six weeks to try to progress some of these difficult issues.

323,Mr Anthony,"Finally, I would like to thank other members of the task force who gave3256 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 Child Support Agency is about as popular with many of its clients as the Australian Taxation Office, of which it is a part. Yet despite its imperfections, there is little doubt that the CSA serves a valuable, if a somewhat unhappy, function. Sadly, broken marriages and relationships where children are involved are increasingly prevalent. Just as sad is that so many parents living apart cannot strike a reasonable financial deal between themselves for the benefit of their offspring. For this reason, the Child Support Agency was established and began its operations in June 1988. In 1996-97, the CSA dealt with nearly 450,000 child support cases. In that year, the amount transferred between custodial and non-custodial parents exceeded $990 million. With such large sums of money and, more importantly, the high number of parents and children involved, it is vital that the CSA performs its functions as fairly and as equitably as possible. Given the nature of its duty and the competing interests of divided parents, that has proven extremely difficult. I am pleased to have served on the task force under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) which has looked at the operations of the CSA. Unlike the previous government, which shelved its own parliamentary inquiry into child support, we are addressing some of the inequities in the system. This legislation as it stands today is the second stage of our response, coming hot on the heels of amendments that we introduced last year. That, of course, is not to say that the CSA will now be a perfect organisation, but given the work done within the scope of the task force's charter, it is now moving in the right direction. The third stage will be in the form of an amendment to be introduced when the debate resumes in the main chamber. As a task force member, and as the member for Richmond has already stated, those amendments and the announcements which will be made by the minister will be most welcomed indeed by custodial and non-custodial parents alike. It is a direct result of the contribution by members on the government side that these amendments have been introduced and it is to these announcements which I will direct most of my attention this morning. But it is also important to put on the record some of the changes which are in the current legislation. It is important to recognise that we are increasing the paying parent's exempt income by 10 per cent. We are including an amount for a shared-care child in an exempt income amount. We are reducing the amount of payee's disregarded income. We are removing the automatic inclusion of child care in the payee's disregarded income. We are allowing high child-care costs to be grounds for departure from the assessment. We are reducing the effect of the payee's disregarded income. We are introducing a minimum payment of $260 per year. Child support will now be payable for secondary students until the end of the school year in which they turn 18. These are only some of the changes which are taking place in the second stage of our reform of the CSA. They are welcomed by the parties concerned, but there is still more work to be done. The announcements which will be introduced in the main chamber are a direct result of the work of the task force and its members. The government's Child Support Agency task force was an initiative welcomed by many in this place and by very many more parents out there whose lives are affected by the CSA. There would not be an electorate office in the land without a long list of constituents who have complained about the operation of the agency. I have spoken to custodial parents who",157,Representatives Main Committee
324,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (10.31 A.m.),"It would not be an overstatement to say that theWednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3257 feel their former partner is cheating on income assessment to avoid paying child support. Some have charged that good jobs have been thrown in to escape the clutches of the CSA. There are those on the other side of the fence, the non-custodial parents, who feel they are being ruined by stringent CSA rules and being sucked dry, not for the benefit of a child or children that perhaps they are seldom allowed to see, but for the benefit of their former partner. Many non-custodial parents will contend that access orders should be tied to payment demands. That is a risky proposition because the heart of the matter should always be, first and foremost, the needs of the children. Care of a child and on-going responsibility for a child brought into this world should not be bartered away because of the inability of two mature adults to resolve their post-marital relationship. An important measure to address some of these issues which will be introduced in the main chamber is that of non-agency payments. Through this amendment, the non-custodial parent who makes payments on time and in full will be able to pay for approved items totalling up to 25 per cent of their assessment. While this is technically possible at present, it does require the consent of both parties. Under this legislation, non-custodial parents will feel they have the ability to contribute more visibly to their children's upbringing by paying for items such as child care, school fees, essential dental and medical fees and the like. But' of course, as I mentioned before, there is a safeguard for the custodial parent. The payments must be met in full-lOO per cent-and to a limit of 25 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum there are those who seek to avoid meeting their financial obligations. Going overseas has been a popular choice. A further announcement to be made is the introduction of a measure which will allow the Child Support Registrar to prevent those who have shown a consistent failure to make their payments from travelling abroad. One of the many issues that came to light during the task force's investigations was the questionable standard of the assessment review process itself. The average person in the street will perhaps believe that these assessments are considered and reviewed by senior officers of the CSA or those with some considerable expertise in adjudicating such matters. I think that would be a reasonable assumption. However, I believe further improvement is also possible in order to achieve a consistently high standard. The review process at present involves recent graduates of law schools making their judgments and being paid on a per case basis or, in manufacturing terminology, on a piece rate basis. While I am sure these review officers view their work with all seriousness, I believe the remuneration, selection and training of review officers is essential. I am pleased that a recommendation from the task force to embark on such a review has been accepted. It will be welcomed not only by the custodial and non-custodial parents but also, I am sure, by the CSA agency itself. Certainly one area that also causes some trouble in the assessment and review process is income, with the changing nature of the workplace and with changing methods of delivery of payment for services rendered. Couple that with a complicated taxation system that permits all sorts of deductions, and an individual trying to disguise his or her worth can often be underassessed. In an attempt to cure this ill, an interdepartmental committee will examine ways to consider the many diverse areas of income, so that individuals can be properly assessed for child support. The Child Support Agency exists to ensure that children brought into this world are cared for by their parents, even though they are estranged, separated or alienated from one another. 3258 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 In all our deliberations on the ways we seek to reform the CSA, we must bear in mind that the welfare of the child must come first always. We sincerely hope that our efforts are able to fix some of the anomalies in the system to make it fairer than it is now. I certainly welcome support from the members of the opposition to help us move in the right direction for the sake of those who have been affected by the tragedy of marital separation. We must also remember that the CSA only comes into play when the bond of cooperation between parents breaks down. Given the competing interests of-and, often times, the acrimonious relationship between-custodial and non-custodial parents, we cannot hope to change the CSA so that it meets the approval of all. There will be those out there who will disapprove 01' will believe that we have gone too far with these measures. There are those, of course, who believe that we have not gone far enough. But certainly it is the duty of governments and opposition members to strive to make the process more transparent, more effective and more responsive to needs and to make it a more equitable institution. member for Hinkler( Mr Neville) for allowing me to take his place in the speakers list. I suppose that any consideration of child support legislation has got to focus on one issue, and that major issue is the welfare of the child or the children involved in the situation. I would support that legislation for the child support area is the single most distressing area of legislation that this or any other government has to deal with. It is a reality that, while in many cases the people who are involved in the dissolution of marriages manage it in a harmonious fashion, the possibility of, and the potential for, absolute distress is enormous. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you and all of my other colleagues have a constant flow of constituents coming through their offices and being dealt with by their capable staff, in most cases. You would find, as I do, that the stories one hears are incredibly sad. I would like at the outset, too, to compliment the member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), for his job as chairman of the task force. I also thank the other members of the task force, because they too have done an excellent job. It is always the case that the Child Support Agency is the villain: it is sad but true that in reality there are very few people who see the Child Support Agency or its hard working officers as anything but the villain. But I must make particular reference to a gentleman called Jason Vann, who serves my office and my constituents and is located in the Hurstville office of the Child Support Agency: I commend him for doing an absolutely excellent job. The people who are involved in this issue are ordinary human beings like the rest of us. They do not set out to create problems and have disasters, arguments and all sorts of passionate problems with their former spouses. It should be realised that, while there are organisations, such as Lone Fathers, or DADs-Dads Against Discrimination-for men, there is also a significant number of women who are non-custodial parents involved in the financial limbo that is created for so many of the payer parents. I must mention, too, that in my electorate I have a great deal of contact with a gentleman called John Clarke, who is the national secretary of DADs. I would like to commend him, personally, and his organisation for the balanced and moderate stance they take in trying to secure justice for all parents. That is the essential thing: it does need a balanced, rational and reasonable approach. One cannot allow the passion of things to carry one away; one has to deal with the facts.",158,Representatives Main Commiitee
325,Mr Nehl (Cowper) (10.41 A.m.),"At the outset, I must thank my friend and colleague theWednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3259 The Child Support Act, as it stands at the moment, has a number of shortcomings. The legislation amendments that we are considering right now and the task force recommendations address some of those, but there is still a long way. to go. We should realise that the Child Support Act, as it stands, provides no incentive to payers to work harder. Tax and maintenance costs prevent that incentive being present. In some cases they encourage payers on marginal incomes to become unemployed, and that is very sad. It is very sad for our society, and it is very sad for that individual who feels so oppressed by the financial burden that they retreat from paid employment and become dependent on social security. It is not good for them; it is not good for Australia. One of the difficulties, of course, is that welfare recipients-genuine ones as well as those who retreat from employment-do not really have sufficient capacity to pay child support. There will be a small charge of $2.50 a week starting fairly soon, but those who are dependent on welfare do not have the resources to pay child support. In fact, I believe that the Child Support Act should allow payers to claim children from second families as dependants for Child Support Agency purposes in the same way as they can for social security purposes. To me, this is basic justice. The current bill before the committee will amend the basis of the administrative formula by increasing a parent's taxable income by adding back rental property losses and by including exempt foreign employment income. Unfortunately, this fails to recognise that the payer may have negatively geared the marital home they acquired pre-separation. In many cases the payer's children are taken away from the immediate geographic area by the payee and the payer rents out the matrimonial home and relocates to be close to the children, and of course that touches on a nerve that upsets so many people. I repeat that probably the majority of cases are conducted in a harmonious fashion, but you do get custodial parents who, because of the breakdown of the marriage, because of their absolutely vicious perception of their former spouse, will move away and try to remove the children from legal access to the other person. I would just like to make the point that, as far as the house is concerned, the marital home should be exempt as it would not have been bought as a negatively geared investment in the first place but as a principal place of residence. The existing legislation has a number of improvements, and they include the removal of retrospectivity in relation to the commencement of a liability. That is a major step forward. They also include enhancing the payment options for liable parents and providing flexibility in how information is provided. Another significant and important point is allowing the registrar to offset debts between parents. But when one is looking at legislation and talking about the various clauses, you have to remember that we are talking about a very human face. We are talking about people; men and women whose marriages, for whatever the reasons, have broken down and who are being tom apart. We have to realise, as a parliament, that the people who are in this situation can be in very dire financial straits indeed. I will give you details of the case of one of my constituents-an actual case. This women is the payer, the non-custodial parent, and she lives in a country location in my electorate. She is employed full time; she has two children, aged nine and 12; her relationship with her former husband is good and she has access to her children 30 to 50 per cent of the time, which is very substantial. She has a 13-year-old motor vehicle. 3260 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 Her gross wages are $728 a week. From that deduct taxation of $224 a week. Take away child support of $132.50, which is 27 per cent. She pays $135 in rent, which is, for country areas, fairly reasonable; you would pay much more in the city. For food she allocates $50 a week; for petrol, $10. Car registration for that 13-year-old car costs her $11.50. She has, as anybody in this situation does, things on the Mastercard, because when you have a very limited income you have to use that credit facility, and she is paying off $25 a week on that. Because of a number of circumstances she has got an outstanding solicitor's bill, and she is paying that off at $25 a week. Telephone and electricity cost her $12; clothing for herself costs about $10 a week. I fail to see how any adult male or female can clothe themselves adequately to go and do a job for $520 a year. The cost of having the children on access and of food, petrol, et cetera, in addition to the ordinary petrol, is $25. That gives her an expenditure of $660 a week and a balance of $68. Out of that $68 comes money for motor vehicle repairs, children's clothing, doctors bills, pharmacy, children's birthdays, Christmas and outings with the kids. She has no money for entertainment and no savings for a new car or for furniture or holidays, no emergency fund. Because her youngest child is nine years old, that woman is going to be in complete financial limbo without the opportunity of doing anything that most people would regard as normalgoing for a holiday, having some entertainment-for the next nine years. She will be in that total financial limbo-like the man in the iron mask-for nine years. Another example-this is a notional scenario-is based on a man on the same wage but living in the city. This is a full-time employed, male payer with three children, aged two, four and seven. He has contact with the children 20 per cent of the time, which is pretty good. He has got a lO-year-old motor vehicle, in this imaginary case. The wage is still $728, and the tax is still $224. For three children he pays 32 per cent, $177. He pays rent of $175-1 suspect this notional, imaginary person does not live in Sydney. Food costs $50; petrol, $20; car registration, $11.50; Mastercard, $25; telephone and electricity, $12; clothing for himself, $10. The total costs are $704.50. That leaves my imaginary city payer, with three children, with $23.50 a week for motor vehicle repair costs, children on contact, doctors bills, pharmacies and so on. We as members of this parliament have to realise and be completely aware of the great difficulties that people are being thrust into. I do not know how these people survive. I really do not. I have had contact with a great many of them, both custodial and non-custodial. In so many cases, they are living in absolute poverty because the custodial parent has only very limited income and the non-custodial parent is paying out the child support-and very often has another family at the same time, and they do pretty badly too. I do not know how they survive doing it. I want to praise again the task force which was led by the member for Richmond( Mr Anthony). The amendment to be brought into the House tomorrow will be a distinct liberalisation of direct payment arrangements. It should be noted that, on 21 April this year, cabinet agreed to changes in arrangements for non-agency payments for child support liabilities in order to make these more flexible and allow payers more choice of the form in which child support is paid by them, while protecting payees and meeting the basic needs of the child. Remember, the care of the child is of paramount significance in all of this legislation. Those changes include the acceptance of certain expenditures of up to 25 per cent without the agreement of the payee, provided the balance of the liability has been paid. That is fair Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3261 enough. Special circumstances will no longer be needed for non-agency payments to be credited, and there will be acceptance of non-cash payments. The child support task force, ably chaired by the member for Richmond, considered which payments should be allowed to be credited towards a payer's child support liability up to that limit of 25 per cent without requiring the payee's agreement. The following agreed items will be included in the child support regulations: fees charged at the school or pre-school at which the child is enrolled; essential medical and dental fees; payee rent, including bond and body corporate charges; payee rates; payee mortgage; payee utilities; childcare costs; and motor vehicle costs, including registration, insurance, service, tyres, repairs and panel beating. That is a major step forward. I will be amazed if it does not have the full support of the opposition. It certainly has the full support of all government members. I want to conclude by repeating that the only important factor in all of this is the welfare of the children concerned. That does not mean to say that I do not have sympathy and understanding for the welfare of the payers and the payees. As I have already said, so many of them in both areas end up hving in absolute poverty. Anything that can be done to make it fairer, to have a more just and equitable distribution of the available income between both sides, is something that we should all support. I certainly support the bill before the House. on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. I am a bit of a radical on child support, and I do not say this with any criticism of either the current or the previous governments. I just do not think that we have gone far enough in addressing this problem. I think that we are developing a camel and that the Child Support Agency and its mechanisms have not fully encompassed the gravity or the size of the task we have in hand. When you consider that one marriage in every three now ends up in divorce, you are confronted by the conclusion that whatever we put in place has to be streamlined, fair, accessible, and above all, affordable. I see a lot of abuse in my electorate. In fact, we say in our office-I have not tested this for a while-that we spend nearly 50 per cent of our time on matters related to the breakdown of families, be that in relation to divorce, property settlement, separation, access, pensions, the Child Support Agency, family allowance, and the like. If that is the case in the office of a provincial member of parliament-I imagine the case would be somewhat similar in capital city offices-and you multiply that by 148, you get some measure of the enormity of the task. We see it only at the margins or at the fringes. A lot of the problems are already being solved by the agency. There are about 12 major measures in this bill and I think that some of them are very sensible. I think that the marginal increase in exempt income for payers of child support from $9,000 to $9,900 should have gone further. There is a good case there for having to go to 20 per cent, but I appreciate that there are limitations on what the government can do in any given year. I think $18 million is not a bad effort. Changes to the amount of carer's income is to be disregarded. It has come down from $37,000 to $29,000 in round figures. That, too, is a fair assessment because, instead of being based on the average weekly earnings of someone in full-time employment, it is now being based on the average weekly earning of all employees. That takes into account that a lot of people with part-time work, permanent part-time work and even casual work are paying child",160,Representatives Main Committee
326,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.56 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to wind up this debate3262 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 support and, therefore, I think that is a fairer assessment. It possibly mirrors the sort of income that a custodial parent might be earning. The introduction of a minimum income of $250 in calculating the amount of child support payable I think is a good rule. There are some people who are a bit manipulative. I have had people who have come in to me and said, 'I am going to go on the dole, or I am going to go on the pension-I am not going to support my kids any more. I have had enough of this.' I am not saying that, at times, their circumstances do not call for reassessment. But I think the attitude that you can just throw yourself on the dole or the pension and not only be cared for yourself by the state but expect that you are exempt from all responsibility for your children as well is stretching it a bit far. The token payment of $5 a week is an acknowledgment that there is a financial responsibility in bringing children into the world, no matter what your circumstances are. Whether you are the richest person in the land or you are on a basic pension or dole payment, everyone has the responsibility to look after kids. Allowing payers and payees greater flexibility in reaching arrangements relating to child-care payments-that, too, is a very sensible measure. Addressing the situation where child-care arrangements have changed from that specified in various orders-again, a very sensible measure. Allowing child support to continue to the end of the school year where a relevant child turns 18 in that year-no one would expect that a custodial parent who was putting a child through their secondary education, and that date was perhaps in July or August of that year, should be deprived of child support. The reason for that is that I am sure even the noncustodial parent would acknowledge that there would be no point in both parties depriving the child of getting through to grade 12 and having the best possible opportunity. There are also things such as the introduction of a review mechanism enabling the registrar to initiate a departure from an administrative assessment of child support where the registrar has information pointing to a review process rather than just the word of one parent. There is the inclusion of exempt foreign income and rental property losses in calculating income. I think we have all seen-in fact, I have one classic case in my electorate-that there are potential payers that have anything up to six or seven rental properties and have become very adept in using those properties to avoid paying their just entitlement. There is a provision allowing determinations to be based on more recent years of income instead of having your income assessed at two years ago-and things can change dramatically in two years. It is basically the last ful1 assessment. It also means that the payments can be altered automatically and in a more meaningful fashion. The one that I particularly like is allowing 50 per cent of child-care expenditure to be excluded from the person's income for the purpose of family allowance. That has been long awaited. It also allows the non-custodial parent, in a case where that non-custodial parent has taken on a new family, to receive a more fulsome and reasonable assessment. Returning to the case that I was talking about, it involved a young lady in my electorate who separated from her husband in Brisbane. I live in Bundaberg. It is not a great distance from Brisbane-about a four-hour car journey or fifty-minute plane journey. This triggered a series of court actions of various sorts for the custody of the child and for the requirement for her to live in Brisbane for her former husband's convenience. His was a case where his income was very deftly concealed in a series of family companies and discretionary trusts. Documents that were obtained in a previous court action attested to the fact that he could Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3263 spend anything up to $300 per week in restaurants and $150 per week at liquor barns. Against that background and noting the fact that he drove the very best of cars and lived in the very best style of living, he was paying initially about $360 per month. It went up to about $440. Certainly it was in no way a reflection of his true income. The thing that I found most galling in that particular case was the non-custodial parent, because of his financial capacity to force her into court periodically, aiming to nearly break her. This was going on for two, three or four months; there would be an application for some variation of order or custody. That virtually bled the custodial parent dry. I only have this second hand, but the non-custodial parent had said to her, 'I will bleed you dry; I will bankrupt you.' I felt that was an oppressive use of the law and a circumstance in which the Child Support Agency and the whole Family Law Act did not respond appropriately and adequately in terms of equity and real justice. For that reason, I have a great deal of support for one of the government members who is proposing a private member's bill or some amendments-I am quite sure how he intends to handle this. He proposes the setting up of a child support small claims tribunal, placing between the Family Court and the current administrative process a very simple mechanism where the parties could appear before a magistrate at a fairly low cost and, in most instances, without the requirement of lawyers and experts so that minor orders could be adjusted and justice and equity obtained without any great cost to either party. I see many instances where one or other party has a very just case but they cannot get access to the Family Court. I do not want you to think I am prejudiced either one way or the other in these matters. I have another case in my electorate where a very manipUlative former wife, the custodial parent, finds all methods of preventing her former spouse from seeing the children: she goes away at weekends; she says the children have got colds; and she does not dress the children appropriately, forcing the father to buy new clothes when the children visit him. When the children go back to the mother, she does not wash their clothes, so that the clothes go back to the father a month later in the same condition that they were in when the father had returned the children. Because of that sort of really vicious use of the children as a weapon against the father, I found that particular case really galling. On one occasion the children came back from their mother with quite severe bruising. I actually saw those bruises on the children in my own office, and I have seen a videotape of bruising that occurred on other occasions. Their father became very concerned and my recommendation to him was that he take the matter to the state family services department for an assessment. The recommendation of the department was that he not return the children until a bit more investigation could be carried out. The thing that surprised me was that within four days of that happening the custodial parent had got support and a court action demanding the children's return, despite the fact that on every occasion when she had breached orders the father could not get legal aid. There is an inequity there. I must add that it applies in both instances-sometimes it is the male and sometimes it is female who is the offending party. I am not saying that I have any particular preference. This idea of a child support small claims tribunal has some merit. It would enable either party to apply for a variation of an assessment. A magistrate would deal with the case based on capacity to pay balanced against the needs of the child. A magistrate could even vary the percentage arrangements. Such a tribunal could be a very good thing, a very inexpensive thing, 3264 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 and it would deliver equity and justice ih a simple manner. These magistrates could be experts in family law, be located in the capital cities and the major provincial cities, and perhaps go on a circuit to country areas. They could also back up the local resident magistrates who could also hear these cases if there was no other magistrate available. What the bill also proposes is that in the case of avoidance the Child Support Agency would be able to make an application to the tribunal to have the potential payer examined. It could subpoena documents, place people on oath, and any failure to attend could bring about an action for contempt. This might bring some of those people who hide their assets in family companies and in discretionary trusts and the like to heel very quickly without the agency going into monumental action in other courts, a very expensive action costing anything from $10,000 to $20,000. Once an order was made in a magistrate's special child support small claims tribunal, deliberate or wilful failure to pay could involve an action for contempt and a penalty. A lot of the people on both sides of the fence who offend now get away with it, and that is regrettable. The fourth matter that I find quite appealing is in the area of deliberate frustration of access. In such a situation a magistrate would have the power to take that into account in varying the quantum of the assessment. I do not agree with the social engineers who say that you can put access to a child and the upkeep of a child in two separate categories. The non-cust,odial parent has a right to participate, albeit at arm's length, in the nurturing and in the upkeep of their child. That parent should have some rights, and access is one of those rights. I very much applaud the work of the task force chaired by the member for Richmond( Mr Anthony). I commend him and the member for Deakin( Mr Barresi) for their addresses this morning. In their recommendations to the government, which I hope will be taken into legislation shortly, they are proposing that expenses that are paid by the non-custodial parent such as school fees, medical and dental costs, mortgage and rental costs, and motor and vehicle costs, to a limit of 25 per cent, will be able to be deducted from child support payments. In a way, that will give the non-custodial parent some discipline and some say in the nurturing of the child. I think that, where the custodial parent will not play ball, is deliberately obstructive, and wilfully frustrates access to the child, that should be linked to the assessment. One very simple rule could apply automatically if the custodial parent deliberately frustrates the non-custodial parent. I have seen lots of cases where they have said, 'The child has got a cold' or 'You can have them for the weekend but you will have to pay for the airfares' or 'You will have to come and collect them', something like that, knowing full well that the noncustodial parent cannot do that. In those instances where the children do not go to the non-custodial parent for the court appointed time the rule should be that the quantum-one-fifty second-for each week deprived should be deducted from the child support payment going to the custodial parent. That would be a good discipline. It would say, 'If you are not sending the kids, you are not going to get paid.' I think those two things should be linked. I support the legislation. I support the task force that is currently doing more work on the matter and I hope things will go further. Motion (by Mr Sercombe) agreed to: That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House. Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 3265 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 April, on motion by Mr Ronaldson: That the bill be now read a second time. fact the one area of transport policy where there is bipartisan agreement between the opposition and the government. It would probably be the only time in my life that the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) and I are speaking in the same debate and agreeing with each other. It is very good to see. The legislation extends the life of the National Road Transport Commission for a further five years. It has already been extended by one year beyond the five-year initial time span that was established when it was created by the Hawke government back in 1991. We are of the view that the NRTC should be made permanent. It is an excellent organisation. It has done tremendous work and has enjoyed the support of both sides of the House. The current government has not really altered its charter or its operations and I would commend the government for that. Having said that, we believe the NRTC should be made permanent. We are happy to see it further extended for five years and we do not wish to quibble with the decision that has been made. The legislation enacts a variety of changes to the NRTC including altering its internal structure requiring it to present an annual strategic plan, which is a proposition that we support, making provision for the inclusion of New Zealand in the uniform road regulation development and allowing for the exemption of the defence forces from road regulations in certain circumstances relating to the weight of vehicles and the like. In very brief summary, the opposition's position is that we support the legislation and commend the NRTC for its work to date. In particular, the NRTC has managed to get all of the various states to reach agreement on such a complex and difficult area as road regulation and to achieve, effectively, uniform road regulation, with some modifications to take account of the fact that there are considerable differences across the various states with respect to the circumstances in which road transport operators function. For example, the types of regulation that are required in the outback of Western Australia or the Northern Territory are obviously quite different from the regulation that you may require with respect to the Hume Highway because the situations faced by operators are very different. That has been able to be incorporated within the uniform structure in a way that gives everybody some degree of leeway without derogating from the basic principle that you now face uniform regulatory structures right across the country, rather than six or eight different regimes with very different rules. The one additional comment that I would make is that it was suggested at the Australian Transport Council meeting-the meeting of ministers that occurred on 24 April-that the NRTC structure should be extended to encompass all land transports, in other words to encompass the rail industry as well. The ministerial council made a decision to examine this and to launch some sort of investigation into the proposition and, again, the opposition would support this idea being very thoroughly examined. The gradual introduction of private operators into the rail industry means that there is a very major change going on in the circumstances which govern the operations of the rail industry",163,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.17 A.m.),"The opposition supports this legislation. It is in3266 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 and, of course, the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, is present today. Our House committee is currently looking at that very question of the changes in the rail industry and the impact that that is having on a range of matters associated with that industry. Certainly I think it would be wise to consider the possibility of extending the NRTC's operations to include rail as well as road. We do have many similar issues there. We have numerous state systems. We have a variety of differences between those systems on things like safety regulation and the like, including a most enjoyable one: the committee was entertained by the different safety jackets that people have to wear in different states. There are various other issues of a similar nature. There certainly is scope for the same sorts of principles to be applied in the rail industry and you do have a very different regulatory environment now with the introduction of private operators. In the past, when you had a single monopoly public sector operator, that operator was its own regulator and, as it was a public sector body, that was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate situation. With the proliferation of private operators, that is no longer the case. You now need an independent regulatory regime which applies equally to everybody, public or private, and you need issues such as uniform access to be dealt with. All of these things are in the process of being negotiated. I think you need an independent safety investigatory body equivalent to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, or BASI as it is popularly known, to investigate accidents and to report and to advise on potential safety improvements. There are a lot of issues there that perhaps were not there several years ago that suggest that it is certainly a good idea to examine very closely the proposition that the NRTC could be extended to the rail industry. It would also be useful as a means of integrating our policy approach to road and rail. One of the great difficulties that Australia has had in land transport policy for decades is the constant tension between road and rail and the competition between them for the favours of government, when in fact really what we need is a comprehensive, integrated approach which takes account of the strengths of both modes and which ensures that the intermodal connections between the two modes are maximised in efficiency. That is increasingly becoming important in transport. Multimodal transport is very much becoming a dominant part of the overall transport scene. I feel we need to move beyond the basic competition or contest between road and rail. There will always be issues of choice between the two modes; there will always be issues of conmct as to how they ought to be funded and what sort of priorities ought to be given. But the overriding imperative, surely, has to be the broad efficiency of the total transport system and, therefore, extending the NRTC's ambit to cover rail as well as road I think would be a very positive step. Naturally, there are a number of issues that need to be considered in this and there may be some difficulties that have to be addressed. But certainly at first blush from the opposition's point of view, this is a worthwhile proposition and I commend the various ministers for agreeing to investigate it. The final observation I would make in that context is that we are disappointed in last night's budget. The government has again cut the national highway funding, which is an issue of some significance to road regulation and road safety, and is what the NRTC's charter involves. National highway funding was $834 million in our last budget in 1995. In the 1997 budget it went down to $697 million and in last night's budget it has gone down again to $675 Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3267 million. The bulk of the cuts are being borne by maintenance. That means that we have a serious problem building up in the system which will gradually hit in a few years time. Even though the roads of national importance category has been introduced, and that partly covers the reduction, there are two points that need to be made in response to that. Firstly, it only partly covers the reduction and so the total spending on roads has still gone down. Secondly, what has occurred has been a shift away from the nation's most fundamentally important roads-the key roads-which constitute the national highway to a variety of other roads, some of which are almost as important. The Pacific Highway is an obvious example. Obviously, the difference in importance between the Pacific Highway and many parts of the national highway is limited. On the other hand, increasingly there are other roads which are receiving roads of national importance funding, such as the main road 92 in the electorate of Gilmore in New South Wales, which are of far lesser importance in relative terms to the overall national transport picture than the national highway. I think the effective shift of resources out of the national highway into roads like that is a very retrograde step for the road transport industry and the overall interests of the Australian transport system. I commend the bill and look forward to continuing constructive debate and discussion in this area. I am pleased to see that the government broadly has maintained the bipartisan position that was adopted by the former government and the state premiers in this area. It has already produced good things for the industry and Australia. I look forward to that continuing. There are a number of matters that the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner) has already addressed relating to the detailed achievements. I wish to commence with some historic reference as to why it is so necessary and why this bill, which continues the existence of the National Road Transport Commission, is justified. The member for Melbourne makes the interesting point that bipartisanship can produce good legislation. I have been telling this parliament for a couple of years now that that is how we should have dealt with the tax situation. I am of the view that, when politics intrudes on economics, you always get a half-baked outcome because politics will always ensure that the best possible solution is just simply not available. Yet we well know that that is not going to be the case. It is a pity because we seem to be able to agree on lesser matters when an issue as important as tax-which I say is far too important for an election anyway--cannot be resolved in a similar manner. Putting that aside, the historic basis for the NRTC was really the fact that we were one nation, we had a constitution guaranteeing free trade between the states, and yet we had nontariff barriers regarding the means by which that freight and that trade could be transported from place to place. The non-tariff barriers, which were always promoted as safety regulations relative to the operation of larger vehicles, were really just put there to protect highly inefficient state rail systems. We promoted the argument that anything larger than a single-axle truck was somehow unsafe on the roads. In fact, the larger the individual rig, the fewer trucks we have on the road and the less weight per tonne of goods carted on the road. If we require a single prime mover to carry, say, 20 tonnes of freight, we have to take account of the damage that single prime mover does. It probably weighs eight or nine tonnes in its own right. Once we put one, two or three",167,Representatives Main Commitiee
328,Mr Tuckey (O'connor) (11.27 A.m.),"This is a very worthwhile piece of legislation.3268 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 additional trailers behind a single prime mover, we have a much more efficient ratio of gross weight per tonne of freight. That is eminently sensible. Those of us who have lived with it for longer than most-and I certainly have, as a resident of the north-west of WA-will know that right back in the 1960s we started to license road trains, and on some pretty inadequate roads, I might add. We all soon learnt that they did not represent any more hazard to us than smaller vehicles did, and the fact that we did not have to pass so many of them was an advantage. It is an interesting aspect because, as the NRTC has managed to bring in uniform laws in regard to vehicle configurations, the incidence of large vehicles on even metropolitan roads has, of course, increased greatly-particularly in my state, where we now see road trains operating on major metropolitan highways. It was a great controversy because it was the great unknown. Being directly experienced in the trucking industry, I knew very well the cost of breaking up a road train on the periphery of a city. The cost of shifting it the last 10 or 20 kilometres often represented one-third of the value of the entire freight revenue for a journey of possibly 1,000 or 1,500 kilometres for that trailer. That was plainly silly when, in fact, there was no reason for it. In Western Australia, when it was announced that a trial was to be conducted to ensure that these larger configurations could operate within the metropolitan area, there was the usual outcry. But the real humour of it arose when a trial of 500 truck movements was authorised and completed without incident. I happened to have my radio on when the minister was being interviewed because that day he had announced that, owing to the success of the trial, they would allow these large configuration vehicles to move into the metropolitan areas. One of the opponents rang up: a woman, in high dudgeon because she lived in the area affected, who said that it was impossible to allow this happen because her committee had been unable to observe one of the 500 truck movements. The reason was, of course, that the committee had not even noticed them. They were so inconsequential on the road that they had not even been noticed. Of course, today we have those sorts of arrangements. But they also have to consider the extreme importance of road transport in the context of Australia. We have extremely large distances and a relatively low population density, particularly in our major resource areas, which always appear to be out in our remote areas. The simple fact is that, unless you have very substantial tonnages of freight, rail is not an economic proposition. This, of course, is also controversial because, in my electorate, we produce probably 10 million or 15 million tonnes of grain, most of which is shifted by rail. When one looks at all the receiving points associated with that process, we suddenly find that it is not traffic that is really suitable, even at that tonnage, for trains. It is suitable if you can aggregate the loads from the outlying areas; but, when you try and send a train hither and thither to pick up what might be 10,000 or 20,000 tonnes of grain from a single point, it is not economic. Whilst the figures have changed somewhat, probably upwards, we calculated some years ago that the rail system in my electorate was handling about 1,400 tonnes of freight per kilometre of track. That might be as high as 2,000 tonnes today. But that 2,000 tonnes has to be compared with the figure for the iron ore province in Western Australia, where the rate is closer to 90,000 tonnes per kilometre of track. They are the sorts of tasks that are adequate for a rail system. It is interesting that, in fact, a new developer for a new mine, the Hancock company, are arguing with the competition council that they should have access to the existing private rail infrastructure for its mining Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3269 effort rather than going for a new railway. Of course, they are right. It proves that there is still excess capacity within the existing infrastructure, and quite clearly it should be used and they should pay a fee for its use, which raises another issue. The member for Melbourne asked when the NRTC would be looking at the rail system. To tell the truth, I do not see any problem with that. We must, in the future, look at our rail system as a road and at the rail vehicle as more like a truck. In other words, people should have access to that road just as the Hancock mining company wants to, and they should be able to put their own equipment upon it and do their own work. That gives maximisation of the capital investment. We have really seen the system-as agreed by the National Road Transport Commissionachieving a uniformity of vehicle configurations and of licensing and things of that nature which have made it much more practical and sensible to operate the road system in the interest of all Australians. The extension of its term of office which is provided for in this legislation is therefore desirable. We naturally welcome the SUppOlt that has been given by the opposition. It was plainly silly to realise that when you got to the border of a state the legal vehicle you drove on one side of the border was illegal on the other. I have to congratulate the NRTC for not taking, as I feared originally, the lowest common denominator, for instance the very stultified views of the Victorian government at the time as to what was the largest vehicle that could be on the road. That government has changed its mind now and we see more sensible arrangements. As the member for Melbourne pointed out, in setting these vehicle configurations the NRTC has allowed sufficient flexibility for particular areas of particular states, but on the national highway system now we have quite adequate arrangements. Trucking, as I say, has a very significant role to play for smaller loads. Nevertheless, to come baek to rail-I have to be careful in thi8-I heard the Chief Minister of the ACT telling me on the radio this morning that my government is offering some attractive tax arrangements for the very fast train project. I hope that she has told me the truth. I have yet to see it in writing. I would be very supportive of that, and very supportive of a very fast train system, particularly between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, and the sooner the better. It does have a freight role, in being able to handle some of the smaller and lighter freight requirements, overnight type freight, that presently is serviced by the trucking industry. I hope that the governments involved-presently, the New South Wales and the ACT governments, with some involvement of the federal government-do not take us into the Ice Age of rail transport by going for things like tilt trains and/or any wheeled variety. We would be very silly to accept that technology, considering that those who know best are now moving to maglev technology, both in Japan and Germany, and gaining speed for nothing. The speed limitations of wheeled traffic and the fact that the locomotive has to be increased in weight for every extra kilometre are part of yesterday'S technology. Those of us that have had the opportunity to go and ride in a Maglev train know that the power is not in the vehicle; the power is in the track. Consequently you can achieve much greater speeds and attack much greater grades. You can also put road and rail, if you like, through private property without in'conveniencing the owner to any great degree, because you literally elevate it to an appropriate height so that tractors or livestock can go underneath. So that is going to give us the possibility, in my view, of also looking at the third arm of major transport, which is air traffic, and amalgamating a 3270 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 high speed train in the south-east comer of Australia with the three airports of Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. That would then ensure that we did not need that second airport in the Sydney basin which, of course, people think is a good idea provided it is not in their backyard. The reality is that we could, I think, achieve that in a way that would add greatly. I hear proposals that that train service could start in Parramatta and go through to Wollongong before heading down to Canberra and that makes a lot of sense to me. You would have a metropolitan service from Parramatta, which is probably an hour or an hour and a half away from Sydney Cove by road, in 10 minutes. They are the opportunities we have if we go to the best and do not take on second-class or yesterday's options. They are all good reasons for having a body that would really try to coordinate those issues and, more particularly, the road issue. Some aspects of that are worthy of mention. By the way, I was quite impressed to see that this legislation carries the signature of each state premier and of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). In other words, it is a national agreement on an issue where the states have the priority. The fact that we are bringing New Zealand into our vehicle standards arrangements is eminently sensible and, of course, the day that there can be some international agreement of that nature will make it even better. I am still astounded to think that in so many ways, be it with chemicals or vehicle standards, the testing process is done on a nation by nation basis and, quite frequently, we still do not have the confidence in other countries to produce vehicles, or chemicals, or other things, to a standard that is acceptable throughout the world. Quite clearly, if a car will kill you in one country, it is going to kill you in another. Equally, we should be looking for a reasonable standard on an international basis-but at least we are expanding that beyond our own borders. Firstly we have achieved it now on a national basis and by this legislation we are extending those arrangements to New Zealand. That is an excellent attitude. I come back in closing to the issue raised by the member for Melbourne about national road systems and government expenditure. I would strongly support more expenditure on roads, and I come back to my argument that some times the road is more efficient than rail, depending on the freight burden. In my electorate I would like to see government funding of a federal nature provided to allow for road upgrades as the replacement for rail. In other words, I would like to see an adequate road that allows for the traffic of large vehicles without the danger to the smaller traffic on the roads-the school buses and, of course, people in their individual motor cars. If, during tax reform-and I express this view personally-we could have a hypothecated road user charge included in the taxing arrangements of fuel, that would be an excellent proposition and it might be a solution to that particular arrangement. I would much prefer a hypothecated road user charge and a GST than the present excise arrangement which I find quite remarkable. Because of the nature of our country, we are heavily dependent on transport, and it is a very silly proposition that government should see it as a major source of revenue outside of the road maintenance and construction arrangements. And there is another interesting point there in terms of large vehicle transport, and that is the difference between a licence fee and a tax on fuel-and that was partly addressed by the NRTC. The public tends to say that users should pay and that there should be a tax on the fuel. That is fine in the heavy vehicle sector and where there is a road maintenance requirement, but when one gets into the cities roads are not built to accommodate trucks. We Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3271 build them to accommodate cars, and the level of the infrastructure required is directly proportional to the number of vehicles that are licensed. You get these people who say, 'But I only drive an hour a day. Why should I have to pay a higher licence fee?' In Western Australia, where licence fees have been relatively low, the government has, quite properly, suddenly decided to raise licence fees for road infrastructure, particularly in the metropolitan area. That is true-those people only drive an hour a day, and they all want to drive in the same hour to get to work and get home again. The demand they put on road infrastructure is relative to that. For the rest of the day many of those roads are grossly underutilised, but they do not want to be in a traffic jam at those peak periods so they demand that government build to that. A licence charge is the appropriate means of funding that need. But, furthermore, for those who say, 'Well you should all be on public transport,' that puts pressure on people who do have an underutilised vehicle to decide whether they should keep it or whether they should sell it, avoid the higher licence fees and use the public transport. That becomes a choice because they are being asked to put their money where their mouth is. I consequently believe that it is a very sensible thing as part of the road funding requirements to have licence fees at a level that reflects the demand that each individual vehicle puts on the road system. It never wears it out, but it constantly demands increased road services and infrastructure. That is just another important thing that we have to take account of in the future. I have used up my time. I do support this legislation. I congratulate the Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Vaile), who is present, for extending the period of this necessary cooperative operation between the Commonwealth and the states, and now New Zealand in some respects. I think we will see greater and greater improvements, particularly under his stewardship, because he is a man who clearly understands what is happening in road transport. Thank you. Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1998. I want to focus on one aspect of the bill which has received only minor comment and that is to do with the Australian Defence Force and the provisions for movement of defence assets. The bill makes provision for movement of ADF equipment and personnel to be exempt from a range of provisions that would otherwise apply. Of course, that is a common sense requirement because of the need for Defence to move assets around the country in times of difficulty. There are, though, some questions that have been posed to me that I would pose to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Vaile) in the hope that he may be able to clarify a couple of matters. The definition of what is defence related in the act is particularly broad. There are seven clauses there, in paragraph 41B(6). Most of those are straightforward, as you would expect. They say, for example: the defence of Australia; the security of Australia; the operation of the Australian Defence Force in connection with the defence of Australia; the operation of the Australian Defence Force in connection with a peacekeeping or other activity. There are, however, two subparagraphs which I would appreciate some clarification of by the government. Subparagraph (6)(e) refers to the management of an emergency or disaster, then it says: (whether natural or otherwise), where that management involves the Australian Defence Force; Questions have been raised about what constitutes an emergency or a disaster other than a natural disaster; and what is the circumstance in which it is anticipated it would be necessary",169,Representatives Main Committee
329,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (11.46 A.m.),"I will be brief in my contribution today on the National3272 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 for defence assets to be moved in those circumstances of a disaster or emergency that is not one defined as a natural one? The second query relates to subparagraph (g) which says: the operation of the Australian Defence Force in connection with the protection of a State or Territory from domestic violence, where the State or Territory has applied for that protection. It is not normal practice for Australian defence forces to become involved in domestic violence circumstances. Whilst this act of itself will not accord that opportunity-it would simply relate to the movement of assets and traffic regulations-it does nonetheless present a question in the minds of some, I think fairly so, as to what are the domestic circumstances in which the government believes it would be necessary to relocate substantial defence assets. That is what we are talking about in relation to this bill because we are talking about vehicles which, either by their size, their weight, their number or their design, would not conform to the standard state and Commonwealth laws for use on the roads. What domestic circumstance, does the government believe, requires that provision in the act? We are talking here about a state or ten-itory with a domestic threat not an external threat. It does not involve the defence of Australia. It is a domestic concern within a state-for example, when a state asks for APCs, leopard tanks or a large convoy of assets to be moved to their state. What is the circumstance the government has in mind that warrants those provisions? I could not readily answer the question when posed it. I am pleased the minister is in the Main Committee and I look forward to hearing from him as to why there is a need for that in the legislation, so the House can finally adopt it with a clear understanding of the application of these laws. In fairness and to put it in its complete context, given the recent events on Australia's docks, for example, would it be envisaged that a circumstance at Webb Dock might be a domestic incident in which the provisions of this bilI would be seen to apply? They are the sorts of questions on the minds of some and I look forward to the government's answer to clear that up. Firstly, I thank all the speakers who have contributed to the debate on this National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1998. In particular, I acknowledge the support from the opposition in terms of the initiatives that will tlow from the passing of this piece of legislation. The key initiative that tlows from this bill, as outlined in the second reading speech, is the extension of the NRTC for another five years. This has been awaited and it has taken time to get to this stage during the process of this legislation. We needed to extend the life of the NRTC under this act for a further five years. From that point, we need to consult with the state ministers to appoint two further commissioners to the NRTC. Three of the commissioners, Stuart Hicks, John Stanley and Caroline Ameduri, were in attendance at the last ATC meeting where we covered a lot of issues that are being dealt with by the NRTC-a lot of the reforms and improvements that have been made in the reform process, particularly with heavy vehicles. It should be noted that there is still a fair bit to be achieved as far as heavy vehicle reform is concerned. That is one of the core elements. The other is that this bill makes provision for the Australian Transport Council to replace the former ministerial council for road transport. It allows for regular review by the ATC of the National Road Transport Commission Act and the Commonwealth road transport reform legislation.",173,Representatives Main Committee
330,Mr Vaile (Lyne,"Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (11.51 a.m.)Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3273 As I said, it also makes provision for the appointment of five commissioners, which the Australian Transport Council will be doing. It allows the ministerial council to appoint the chief executive of the National Road Transport Council. Importantly-and I acknowledge the remarks by most speakers-it allows for the involvement of New Zealand in deciding transTasman road vehicle standards under the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement. It is very important that, in all areas of operation of government, we extend that openness across the Tasman to New Zealand. The New Zealand transport minister actually attends ATC, as a member. As the previous speaker identified, it also makes provision to recognise the unique transport operational requirements of the defence forces. I have had a quick look at the clauses that the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Bevis), has identified. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.54 a.m. to 12.06 p.m. couple of comments that were raised by the member for Brisbane with regard to that part of the changes to the act for the provision to recognise unique transport operational requirements of the defence forces-a couple of elements in section 4IB(6)(e), I think it is, of the act in regard to the management of an emergency or disaster whether natural or otherwise. I think that is probably fairly self-explanatory. If it is a natural disaster, we often have those in Australia and the defence forces are often asked to assist. A disaster otherwise could be a major explosion in a building or something like that where there needs to be extra assistance with emergency services from the defence forces. Obviously, they are declared by the states. I take the point that the member for Brisbane raised with regard to subparagraph (g), the operation of the Australian Defence Force in connection with the protection of state or territory from domestic violence, where the state or territory has applied for that protection. Evidently there is a section 119 of the constitution which provides that: The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. This requires the Commonwealth to take specified action at the request of a jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth could determine that a grant of aid to the civil power might be an appropriate response to, for example, a terrorist act or something like that within a particular state. The services might need to move equipment in as a response to that request. I think it is probably a circumstance that would be fairly rare to arise, I would grant you that. It reflects those elements of the constitution and other acts; that is why that is in this partiCUlar act. I would imagine the member for Brisbane is drawing a comparison, albeit a long one, to whether this could allow Defence Force activities in circumstances such as those that we have experienced recently on the wharves. The member for Brisbane would also note that our government did not even contemplate using the defence forces in terms of the strike action that was on the wharves, although Australia governments in the past have. That is what that is specifically directed at. In terms of recent actions on the waterfront, I will repeat that our government never considered at any time using the defence forces. This is an important piece of legislation. It has the support of both sides of the House and it will go well towards extending the life of the NRTC for another five years, allowing the ATC to get on and appoint two more commissioners to complete the complement of",174,Representatnes Main Committee
331,Mr Vaile,"Just before we were interrupted to go to the division, I was addressing a3274 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 commissioners on the NRTC and get on and complete that road reform process. I do not think there is any argument at all in Australia about some of the achievements that have been gained by this nation from the work of the NRTC. It is currently undertaking some very important work for the government in terms of the possibilities of increasing mass limits across Australia, opening up critical corridors of roadways for increased mass limits, from 42Y2 tonnes to 45 tonnes, which has a massive economic benefit to the entire nation, but particularly to regional Australia. That is the work that the NRTC is undertaking at the moment. We would like to see that continue. This will enable that to continue to happen and I commend the bill to the House. for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Vaile) for his response. I make just a brief comment. I understand the circumstances in which military equipment is required in national disasters. If there was, for example, to be a chemical or industrial accident, there may be some need for some military assets to be moved, although my understanding of the circumstances would be that it would mainly be some people. It would not be equipment intensive, which is the sort of thing we are talking about here with moving lots of things across the land. In respect of the domestic violence situation and 4IB(6)(g), I must say that, if there were to be some sort of terrorist or similar activity to which the minister referred, I would not have thought the response would be an armoured column moving down the road. There are obviously other responses that would be used if the defence forces were called upon. I must say I have great difficulty envisaging the circumstances in which this clause would be activated, even given the minister's answer. However, I do not propose to seek a division on the issue. It is a comparatively minor part of the bill and one which I hope we are not going to have to return to at any point in the future. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.11 p.m. to 12.23 p.m. cannot envisage a circumstance in which it would be necessary for substantial heavy equipment, of the sort that this bill refers to, to be transported around to deal with the types of contingencies mentioned by the minister, I nonetheless do not propose that we divide on it, on two bases that I would like to record. The first basis is the response provided by the minister, for which I thank him and which does clarify to some extent the government's expectations of the application of this clause. The second basis is that, under a worse-case scenario, even were it to be used in a manner that those on this side of the House-and also, I suspect, many other Australians-would have difficulty with, this bill does not of itself produce that outcome. It would be heads of power elsewhere that would facilitate a government decision to use the military in those ways. Even in a worse-case scenario, this bill would simply facilitate the transportation of the equipment rather than the authorisation of its use. On that basis, together with the minister's answer, for which I thank him, the opposition will continue its bipartisan support. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The question is that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Technology and Engineering Council Repeal Bill 1998 I would like to begin my remarks with a quotation from Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan, who died recently, was arguably the world's foremost promoter and communicator of science and science issues, and some of his views are very relcvant to the consideration of this bill. He is reported as saying: We've arranged a global civilisation in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces. That is a very relevant thing to consider when we look at the provisions of this bill. This bill repeals the ASTEC Act, but does so in contemplation of the government's announced intentions of incorporating its functions, effectively, within the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, which will subsume most of the roles of ASTEC. of the combined experience and expertise of Australia's most representative and important scientists and engineers so that it could incorporate those things within its ongoing policy initiatives. The council has served a number of useful functions over the years and has produced many interesting and worthwhile reports. The new arrangements of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council will allow many of our premier bodies-for example, FASTS, the Federation of Australian Science and Technological Societies, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the presidents of the Academy of Science and the Academy of Technological Sciences and other leading representatives of science in Australia-to meet together with our political leaders at the national level to ensure that they are well versed in the priorities of science and technology. I wish I could say that I look forward to the future of that committee with optimism, but, given the government's performance in two years in office in relation to science and technology, I think we would have to take a fairly pessimistic view of the potential outcomes of this new arrangement. While the opposition supports the change in principle, and also a number of our science and technology representative bodies have also welcomed this change, we do so with the caveat and the reservation that this government has shown no tendency in the past to rate science and technology highly and to ensure that it is incorporated into its budget strategies or into its overall policy framework. To look at this bill in context we must refer to the two previous budgets of this government. The reality is that in both of those budgets the science community, science and research in general have fared very badly under this government. One of its first decisions indeed set the",176,Representatives Main Committee
334,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Quick),"If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail,",177,Representatives Main Commitiee
335,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (12.25 P.m.),"In considering the Australian Science,3276 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 tone for science and technology. One of the early decisions of this first Howard governmentlet us hope there is not a second-illustrates its attitude towards science and technology: the decision to relegate Australia's Chief Scientist from a full-time position to a one day a week job. How can anyone take science and technology seriously when the government demotes its chief scientist from a full-time position to a day a week? A day a week is simply an insult to the science and technology community, but does illustrate the government's attitude towards science and technology in general. There are some other very specific facts which we need to review, to come to a more detailed conclusion about how the government regards science and technology, research and development in general. In its previous budgets, for example, it has cut back funding for research in general by somewhat over nine per cent in the first budget, with a further one per cent cut in the budget last year. The total cut is thus around 11 per cent in the first two years of the Howard government's office. We have also seen this government dramatically cut university funding, and so, because science is quite expensive to do in universities, obviously university administrations will seek to cut their science and research organisations first. They will be the main losers in the context of those higher education cutbacks. We saw the government honour their promise to increase funding to CSIRO only to see, basically, the whole amount of that increase taken back from CSIRO by increases in the efficiency dividend and by the requirement for CSIRO to make capital repayments to the government from the sale of assets and property. We saw, of course, most significantly, the dramatic cutback in general government assistance for research and development which was paid through the taxation concessions. The reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent was very significant and has had a real impact on business research and deVelopment expenditure. Of course, the government also completely abolished the syndication taxation concession arrangements. They did that in a way that sought to imply that people taking advantage of those arrangements were tax rorters. Indeed, the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) frequently refers to those science and technology taxation concessions as taxation rorts. Nothing could be further from the truth. While there is always the potential in any taxation concession for some dishonest people to try and exploit that, I think the syndication concession was very well arranged and ensured that only deserving projects were rewarded with the taxation concession. If there were any problems, the problems should have been tackled, not the overall scheme which did seek to bring together those who had good science with those who had surplus cash to ensure that the funding flowed to those innovative companies. However the government sought to cut that completely and that program has been abolished along with, as I say, the significant reduction from 150 to 125 per cent for the taxation concession. Also, we saw the government virtually double the HECS contribution to science degrees and that will ensure that fewer students take science as a degree choice at university. Obviously, students respond to market signals like everyone else. They are aware that this government has sent them a very powerful message by doubling the HECS contribution for science degrees. It is a very powerful message, indeed, and one which we will regret in future years as the number of our young people who would have been able to undertake science degrees and make a substantial contribution to science in Australia are discouraged from taking that career option at universities. Wednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3277 We have also seen this government cut back on the CRC program, the cooperative research centre program. That was a very valuable program which ensured that there was science at the cutting edge of Australian industrial technology. It ensured that our best researchers, principally from the universities, were brought together in an entrepreneurial context with industry and best players in the public science bodies in a way which ensured that technology diffusion had the best possible opportunity to come to pass, with knowledge going from the universities through the CRCs and out into industry. The program also served the very valuable function of encouraging large numbers of postgraduate students to work closely with industry and with the very best of our academic researchers to ensure that we have a trained and skilled pool of young people moving out into industry who are well aware of the needs of industry and yet carry with them the very best that our academic researchers can put forward. That was a very targeted program. And what has this government done? It has substantially cut the funding available to that. Again, that sends a very powerful message to industry, young people, universities, and to researchers in our CRC community that their work is not particularly valued, that it is reduced in value by this government, and that they have no real confidence for the future. Indeed, the government was very destructive in the way in which it allowed Mortimer's recommendation to abolish the CRC program altogether to hang out there in the public view for months while it made up its mind whether it wanted to support that program in an ongoing way. While I agreed with many of Mortimer's recommendations, the particular one in relation to the CRC program was very ill-founded and very destructive. Unfortunately, instead of decisively rejecting that recommendation when it first came down, thereby sending the message to the CRCs that their work was indeed valued in our community, the government allowed that recommendation to stand in the community for months while it made up its mind whether it wanted to continue the program. The budget of last night again reinforces the view that this government does not particularly value science, innovation, research and development. Indeed, again, the budget speech failed to emphasise any of those areas. I could not find any reference in the budget speech last night-as I could not particularly last year, or in previous years-to science, innovation, education, research and development. The only reference in that area was to the NHMRC, which is health research, and that is questionable. My colleague the member for Dobell( Mr Lee) will no doubt say more about that in the future. But, apart from that one reference to medical research, there are no references in the budget to industrial R&D, to innovation in our manufacturing industry, to science or technology or education and the value which they bring to our young people and to the future of Australia. is the highlight of the budget process. If a government values a particular enterprise in our society well, it will ensure that that features in the budget speech. That is how you rate governments on matters of science and technology. relevant here. The Treasurer failed to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of science and technology.

But science, technology, innovation, research, development and education-those critical things-were omitted from the Treasurer's speech. The relevance of it is the speech. That is where they should have been; that is where they were not. If you lookhighly disorderly in this context, as I am sure you will indicateSpeaker, as I know you would not want me to be. Honourable members opposite want me to turn to the budget papers and to ignore the Treasurer's speech. There is always a temptation to ignore that speech. However, if we turn instead to the budget papers, as the honourable members opposite want me to, what, for example, should I quote from those? At random I will turn to chapter 4, page 19, where there is a very relevant quote on general research outlays which honourable members opposite are so fond of: Total outlays decline slightly over the forward estimates. Note that, Mr Deputy Speaker: 'decline' over the forward estimates. It goes on: This is largely explained ,by a decline in ARC funding for research infrastructure, collaborative research grants and the High Performance Computing and Communications Programme. So when one does refer to those budget papers, the very documents which honourable members sought to have me quote from, one sees, in the government's own word, that funding for research in general will decline in future years and that it will decline because of a reduction in ARC grants for research infrastructure as well as for collaborative research grants and high performance computing and communications. Those are very critical areas for the future of Australian science. But, again, not only does the government not mention them in the principal speech but also, when detailing them in its papers, it seeks to justify that massive decline in future years on spending on general research. Why is this so important? The relevance of science and technology to economic development and jobs for our young people cannot be understated. The relevance of this was I think identified by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) himself following his recent trip to the United States. He met with a number of people, including the chair of the Federal Reserve over there, the equivalent of the chair of our Reserve Bank board, who I think educated the Prime Minister to some degree on the importance of IT in industrial development. Unfortunately, he should have broadened that understanding which he brought back from the United States about the importance of IT to the science and technology area in general. Research has shown quite clearly that some 40 pcr cent of all economic development in the United States post World War II-in the last 50 years-has been due to investments in the United States in science and technology, research and development, and innovation"" So nearly half of all US growth in the last 50 years is due to investments in R&D. If Australia is looking to have a place in the Pacific region in the next century, clearly we need to emulate that massive investment which the United States has made in R&D and replicate that here in Australia.

Australia has always had a very good base of public sector investment in science and technology. Our CSIRO is a world famous organisation, justly so, because of the innovations which it has introduced over recent decades and the way in which it has translated those into useful products in industry. Also, in recent years, the previous government introduced the concept of the CRC program. That has been a very worthwhile innovation and one which has helped to diffuse that technology out into industry. Of course, we have yet to see this government respond in a positive way to any of those things. If we are going to experience, as the budget paper points out, a significant decline in funding for general research-and the trend in the graph published in the budget paper is of something which is declining; it is a downward trending slope-if that is continued as the out years forecast in the budget papers predicts, then clearly Australia will not be in a position to respond to the giobalisation of our economy, or to the increase in innovation which other substantial countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France are experiencing. Particularly in the case of the US and the UK, they are experiencing substantial booms in their economy because of past investments in R&D. Despite this, the government here is only predicting a steady and certain decline. If you look more closely at those figures you will see that some organisations are not in such a decline. For example, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is due to experience very significant increases in its funding in future years. This is not because the government has singled out this agency for an increase; it is because this particular agency is to construct a new nuclear reactor on the Lucas Heights site. I will have more to say about that in another bill which is before this committee-it was to be debated later today but I assume it may now be tomorrow-in relation to radiation protection. Therefore, I will not canvass that at length now. I want to contrast the increase in ANSTO funding with the substantial cut in Australian Research Council funding, which is also detailed in the budget paper. We see this nice matching progression, a steady increase for ANSTO to fund a nuclear reactor and a steady decline in ARC funding. Obviously, that is where the increases in ANSTO's funding has come from. The government has sacrificed the Australian Research Council funding to pay for its new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. Because of past cuts in funding for ARC under this government, already only 19 per cent of grant applications lodged with the ARC by our young researchers are accepted. That means 80 per cent of those applications are declined. That is not because 80 per cent are in a poor state of science. It is because almost all of those cannot be funded by the available grants which the ARC has at its disposal. When you get down to a level where only one-fifth of those grant applications are being approved, obviously they will go to those researchers with a proven track record of research in ARC's terms. The grants will not go to those who are young, innovative, or who are trying to break into this field. That is a very serious thing for our progress in the next century. Also, this government will ensure that the 19 per cent figure declines even further because if we look to the out years, the funding for ARC for 1999-2000 will decline to $412 million; 3280 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 in 2000-2001 it will drop to $383 million; and in 2001-2002 it rises slightly to $390 million. That amount is some $50 miIIion less than the current value of funding for ARC. That is a very serious decline in funding. It has been brought about by the government's decision to increase the funding to ANSTO by about the same amount over that period. Obviously, the minister has sacrificed ARC in order to fund ANSTO. That is a very poor decision indeed. It shows a considerable lack of foresight and a significant lack of understanding of the way in which science, technology and innovation can feed back into our community and promote job growth in this country. We largely have missed the IT bus. The reality is that this country does not have a leading position in relation to information technology. That is something which has occurred in recent years. While our Labor government was addressing that through a number of grants in innovation and the CRC program, I would certainly concede that more should have been done to address the IT issue during our term of government. However, this government has continued that trend. It has reduced funding for IT. It has removed the computer bounty, for example, and it has failed to see the benefits of information technology in a way which will feed back into the rest of the community. Molecular biology, genetic engineering, is possibly the next cab off the rank. What does the government do in relation to that? Almost nothing. It is impossible to find in this budget document any real leadership in science and technology. So, while we might have reasonable hopes for the PMSEC arrangements which will replace those of ANSTO, I am afraid that an analysis-as I have undertaken this morning--of the government's trend in these areas clearly does not give us much'confidence. Again, this budget has failed to demonstrate the government's commitment to science and technology. It has reinforced that lack of commitment, lack of leadership and lack of vision on science and technology. This is not just a matter for political concern. It is, as I have said, a serious issue in the community where jobs are at stake and where growth in employment is at stake. This is not just about scientists in their laboratories. This is about providing jobs and economic growth for this country in the next century. Our young people will pay the price of the government's lack of vision. There are to be new arrangements for introducing the Prime Minister to those best representatives of science in our community from the leading technological societies in our community. I only hope that exposure to those people over the next year or so will ensure that the government-in the remaining 12 months of its term, or however much less the Prime Minister may choose to allocate-and the Prime Minister are better educated about issues of science and technology and that his ministers can bring to the cabinet table a better understanding of the need for job growth in this area. If the opportunities are not provided in science, technology, research, development and innovation, as they ought to be, Australia will not be in for an innovative future in the next century. Rather, many of our young people will face the unfortunate choices of a low wage and low skilled future. thinking government. We are a government planning and actively working towards making Australia competitive well into the 21st century. We are a government of vision and our vision is one of practical achievement.

346,Mrs Elson (Forde) (12.46 P.m.),"The Howard government is, above all else, a forwardWednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3281 I am pleased to say that technology and research are also part of our plan for a modem and competitive Australia. That is why, upon coming to office, we identified the need to examine how Australian science and technology systems could be improved. The Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Repeal Bill 1998 streamlines our current system winding down the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council. The current council is to become a standing committee of the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Engineering Council. This standing committee will maintain the key task of preparing issue papers and presentations to the Prime Minister's council and undertaking consultation, information gathering and analysis to provide the Prime Minister's council with information and advice on Australian science and technology priorities. However, we have been careful to ensure that the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council maintains its independence. Indeed, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs( Mr Truss), in his second reading speech, outlined how the government values the independent role played by ASTEC. As the minister said, we have been carefully planning this bill to capitalise on the strengths of the current system while addressing some of its weaknesses. It seems common sense to me to draw closer together the Prime Minister's advisory council and ASTEC. The ASTEC can still carry out its normal duties and information gathering but it now has a direct line to the ministry. It is a delivery mechanism that ASTEC has not enjoyed in the past and I am sure it will bring future benefits for Australian science and technology. Of course, the reason science and technology is important is not merely for academic purposes-we are not into 'esoteric' visions-it is also that the Howard government is focused firmly on practical achievements. Scientific and technology developments benefit society in many ways. New developments help generate economic growth. While I am speaking of growth, I will take the opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) on meeting the growth forecasts in last night's budget and for the continued expected growth of around three per cent, despite the Asian economic crisis. Last night's budget clearly has us back on track and back in the black. The reaction I have had in my conversations with local Forde residents this morning has been extremely positive. As well as economic growth, new technology developments help improve our health, help us find even better ways to protect our environment and help us to maintain our national security. There can be little doubt that our technological achievements over this century have dramatically improved our quality of living and have given us a whole range of new recreational and vocational pursuits. I am pleased to be a part of a government which is wholeheartedly committed to technology and scientific deVelopment. Our budget commitment regarding new software and the millennium problem will be a great boost to the information technology industry and it is indicative of our practical approach. CanI say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are in a much better position to look at expanding our focus and support for new technology in the future. We are in a much better position because the budget is back in surplus. As the Treasurer said, 'Isn't a great problem to have to work out where we can spend future budget surpluses.' Of course, in the short term, these have to go to pay back the huge government debt the Labor Party left behind, some $98 billion. But with things back on track, there will come a time when we are debt free as a nation and we can look at investing even more in emerging technology and scientific advancements. We have a proud history of achievement and the 3282 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 May 1998 Howard government is committed to ongoing support for science and technology. Mindful of the time, I now commend this bill to the House. reply-I begin by thanking the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) and the honourable member for Forde( Mrs Elson) for their contributions to this debate, particularly the honourable member for Forde who took the opportunity to respond to some of the baseless allegations made by the member for Bonython in relation to the government's commitment to science and, in particular, the content of last night's federal budget. The honourable member for Bonython in a very eloquent way used typical Labor rhetoric to misrepresent the government's commitment to science and technology, but sadly demonstrated the sort of fiscal illiteracy that led to the $10.3 billion deficit. He accused the government of lacking a commitment to science but at least had the grace to admit later in his remarks that Labor had not done much in this field. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that science and research and development issues do not gain much debating time in the House or the time of members of parliament in addressing the important issues for our country for the future. It is important that we have, as a nation, a commitment to science and a commitment to doing things better in the future. It is just beyond question, in spite of the comments of the member for Bonython, that there is a very high level of government expenditure in Australia on research and development by world standards. At a government level we spend more on research and development than does the US or, indeed, other leaders of industry in the OECD. Unfortunately, however, industry itself has not been quite so forthcoming and there has been a much smaller proportion of industry budgets spent on research and development. Whilst that problem has been improving over recent years and there has been increased expenditure by business on research and development, we still have some way to go to reach leading practice around the world in that regard. The government is determined to ensure that there is additional expenditure and commitment to research and development issues and that was reflected in last night's budget. The 1998 budget increased expenditure on science and technology by $90 million overall. I am surprised that the member for Bonython, since he endeavoured to give the impression to the committee that he had studied the budget in detail, had not uncovered that very obvious and very important statistic. There has been a particularly large increase in research and development in the health field, with major commitments in that regard and expenditure for the NHMRC up by nine per cent and in other health areas by 38 per cent. There is also support for industry and their efforts in research and development, with a 30 per cent increase in the Start program and IIF program. The estimate for the expenditure on tax concessions for R&D is up by six per cent. Expenditure on science agencies, such as the CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS, is up by 3.6 per cent. There is no diminution of the government's commitment to science in this budget. Indeed, there is a clear indication that there will be more money available and, indeed, that the government will be following on its rhetoric with classic action, by delivering additional funds to ensure that we have adequate resources available to support industry and, indeed, to back up the government's own commitment to expenditure in science and research and development.",182,Representatives Main Committee
347,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (12.50 p.m.)-inWednesday, 13 May 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 3283 Turning particularly to the content of this bill, it implements changes announced by the government last year as an important element in improving Australia's science and technology administrative arrangements by bringing together the resources of ASTEC and the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council, PMSEC, into one organisation. The new organisation has now been reconstructed as the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council. It combines the ability to draw on the best independent advice available, conduct studies-as ASTEC does at present-and deliver outcomes direct to the federal ministry. By repealing the ASTEC Act and implementing these new arrangements, the government will strengthen support for innovation and industrial growth. I note that the bill is supported by all sides of the House and I thank members opposite for their cooperation in that regard. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative.
