One of the most significant elresidence of persons from the Lebanon, persons ements about the trend and the style of this prowho are in the Lebanon and persons who have gram, of course, is the emphasis on persons who managed to escape from the Lebanon. I have to these people that the Department and the deUght in interjecting at a time when there is Minister in his responses are unable to be more something of so-caUed importance before us. frank. In one of the recent debates on this subject The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr in this place, the Minister not unfairly, said that Antony Whitlam) who has just resumed his seat we should never raise the expectations amongst said how important immigration is to his electorthe Lebanese community in AustraUa that everyate and to the Opposition. Yet, the honourable body who can escape from the Lebanon will be member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) sitting beside able to come to AustraUa.

But we certainly ought to be able, for the comfort Perhaps he does this because he has no concern, of persons in this country who have relatives in as is the case with the majority of Opposition the Lebanon or who have relatives who have members, for immigration and its impact on the escaped from the Lebanon, to give a much Australian community.
