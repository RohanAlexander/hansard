In Committee (Consideration resumed from 28th November, vide page 3284): Clause ,11The Bank shall be managed by the Governor of the Bank. -Before we adjourned last night we had a speech from the Leader of the Opposition on the subject of the government of the proposed bank. He drew attention to a number of subsequent clauses which, although not, any one of them, entirely supported his proposition, taken collectively, certainly do what he contended-that is, give to the public the idea, which I hold to be a very dangerous thing, if the bank is to be a success, that its management is not to be entirely removed from political influence. to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, and I thought that he put the whole question and demonstrated to the Committee, if it was open to conviction, that there were factors in the measure which plainly prevented the bank from either being or appearing to be one in which the entire management was to be removed from political influence. I listened to the speech of the Prime Minister, which purported to be an answer, and I am bound to say that, although I was anxious to hear how the speech of the Leader of the Opposition could be met the right honourable member did not logically touch it. On the contrary, he simply showed thaf not one of the clauses to which the Leader of the Opposition had drawn attention, in itself, gave to the Minister any distinct power to control the Governor of the bank. But that was not what the latter argued. What was argued was that in the several particulars contained in these clauses there were clear suggestions to people who look at the constitution of the bank, as a whole, that the Minister was going to keep his hand ""on the button,"" so to speak, so that it would be prevented from being completely controlled by political governing body. One of the strongest points which the Leader of the Opposition touched upon was that with reIt appeared, perfectly clear that under one clause the Governor General in Council is to have this power for a variety of purposes, and the Prime Minister seemed to think that, because in one clause it appeared that none of these regulations should be contrary to the provisions of the Act,"" that saved the situation. But I should like to point out to the right honourable member, who, I hope and believe, is anxious to see the measure put into a shape which will be perfectly safe to the public, merely to say that the regulations shall not be contrary to any of the provisions of the Act does not answer the objection, because it is quite possible that from time to time regulations may be made that surround the work of the Governor with conditions and stipulations which will have the effect of tying his hands, and even directing his activities in particular channels. I submitted the Prime Minister to a very fair test when I suggested that the regulations should be made either on the approval of the Governor or on his recommendation. If he I listened with very great care is anxious that the bank should be entirely under the control of the Governor and the Deputy Governor, with or without directors or trustees, free from tlte influence or control of any Minister or Government, he can have no possible objection to it being stipulated that these regulations should be made on the recommendation of the Governor. If the latter is going to have complete control of the bank, ought he not to have control or an important say' with regard to the regulations which are found necessary in addi. tion to the provisions of the Bill? If the Prime Minister really intends that the management of the bank is to be in the hands of the governing body, whether it be the Governor individually or the Governor with the assistance of the Deputy Governor, what objection can he have to making it a sort of addendum to the power of making regulations that it should be exercised on the recommendation of that man or these men who are said to have the complete control of the bank ? that my observations are not worth listening to by the Prime Minister; but I shall wait the non-parliamentary or nonuntil the Prime Minister is disengaged.

57,Mr Bruce Smith,"That may bemight discuss affairs from time to time. The great advantage of that system is that you bring into the management of the bank an atmosphere from outside, in the person of men who know what is going on in the outer commercial world. You bring into the bank the knowledge of the big merchant, the big ship-owner, the big insurance man. Al l these men throughout the week are gathering general information, acquired by them in the high positions which they hold in connection with the commerce of the country. They bring this knowledge to bear upon the proposals laid before them by the Governor of the bank. here to dispense witli such assistance altogether. The Prime Minister said that it would be very difficult to get a Board of Directors who would not be biased against the Commonwealth Bank. might as well say that it is impossible to get a board of directors for the Bank of New South Wales without fear of their being biased in favour of the Union Bank or of the Bank of Australasia. Many bankers have already said that they see no objection on general principles to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. It is a libel upon this community to say that you cannot pick out of the great commercial body of Australia-becaus e you are not limited to any one State-me n of eminence in some branches of commerce, whom you could call to act as directors of this great national institution, and to whom you could look to act as a check on the Governor of the bank. member bar the appointment of any director already connected with one of the other banks ? cause that kind of thing is never done. If a man is a director of an insurance company, he does not act as a director of another engaged in the same line of business. I have been a director of one insurance company .for twenty-two years. I have been approached by another institution of. the same kind to act on its Board of Directors, but, of course, I refused. One cannot serve two masters, and no honest man would ever think of taking a seat upon two competitive boards engaged in the same kind of business, because the interests are identical, and it would be impossible to' do justice to both institutions. I say again that it was unfair for the Prime Minister, in his high position, to suggest that it is not possible to obtain out of this community men of great influence, great knowledge, and great experience to come in as a body of directors. Because, as I have pointed out, the directors would not manage the bank. They would merely act as a check upon the Governor's recommendations. If the Go-vernor of the bank came to the conclusion that the wishes of the board were not such as he could approve, he would have the right at any time to say to those who employed him-the Commonwealth GovernBut it is proposed ment"" Here is a conflict; I am not in accord with my Board of Directors, and something will have to be done."" It! would be his duty to bring the business before the directors, and it would be for You them to approve or disapprove. If they disapproved the Governor would probably know why. They would bring in information from the outside with regard to proposed advances or proposed business of any other kind. It is to be presumed that the Governor would be a man with an open mind. Honourable members may take it from me that men occupying high positions in the financial world have their minds just as open, and are just as ready, and eager to receive new thoughts and new ideas, as are men of science. Therefore, we may depend upon it that the Governor would be very glad to get, from time to time, information which these men could give him. I have said that the banks of Australia are not altogther against this proposal. I have here a clipping from the Journal of the Institute of Bankers, New South Wales. It is a short passage, and I think that honourable members will be glad to know the attitude assumed towards this Bill. the Governor in the extract? thing about the management. It saysMany modifications no doubt will be made in the Bill in its progress through the House. There is little doubt, however, that the bank will be established-no t for the need of its services to the country (no sound argument has ever been adduced as to that), but because it will be the fulfilment of a party pledge. Established on a sound basis and conducted on sound lines, there is nothing to fear from a Commonwealth Bank. the honourable member that we are dealing with the Governor of the bank.",17,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As

The Prime Minister said in his speech last evening that it would be difficult to choose directors from outside, who are not biased against the Commonwealth Bank. I want to show, in answer to those suspicions, that it is not true that the existing banks are against the Commonwealth Bank. Here we have the magazine of the Institute of Bankers saying that the establishment of such a bank on a sound basis would leave us nothing to fearbut may it be relied upon that either of these factors will be found in a politically established Bret Harte's verses and politically conducted concern? the honourable member that he is not in order. What he is reading has nothing to do with the question of the Governor of the bank. can show you that it has, Mr Chairman. I am talking now about a politically-conducted concern. member must address his remarks to the appointment of the Governor of the bank. am proposing to do. This passage goes onI f the bank must be established, we should prefer to see a free board of control, consisting the Governor. of experienced and practical men, associated with a capable and expert banker, as Governor or general manager, not one man answerable to the Ministry in power, as the present proposal indicates. That shows that in the view of the editor of the Journal uf the Institute of Bankers there is no objection to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank in itself, though it suggests itself to ths banking mind that this is an institution which is to be under Ministerial control. Yet you have the admission in the same article that if there is sound management there is nothing to fear. That article, to my mind, gets rid entirely of the baseless suspicion that the other banks are jealous of the business which this Commonwealth Rank is likely to do. I do not believe that the business of this bank, whatever Government: we have in power, will be very large at first, because it will take years and years before its ramifications can be extended through the country as the ramifications of the existing banks have been extended. I stated just now that there are, on the whole, something like 5,000 branches I am showing of the different banks throughout Australia, including the Savings Banks. I thought I had with me a paper giving the number of branches in each State which the banks have had to establish in order to build up their , great business. them to have so many branches. orable member think that after the establishment of this bank there will not be any competition? phrase ""childlike and bland"" in one of member for East Sydney's little joke. quite serious.

As to the question of the appointment of a board of directors, the Prime Minister is attempting to depart absolutely from all precedent. ber when the Labour party first came into power in New South Wales, in 1890, one of their number, Mr Black, saying in the Legislative Assembly, "" We came here not to follow, but to make, precedents."" That is the inflated spirit in which the Prime Minister is working in this case. The resolution not to follow precedent is heroic, but I ask the Prime' Minister whether he will not admit, upon further consideration, that it is possible to obtain the services of three men, eminent in some of the many branches of commerce in Australia, who can be relied upon to honestly and honor-",18,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As

We shall see it grow, and if we do make mistakes in the beginning we can correct them.

When honourable members contend Iti that even where there are a number of directors one man always dominates the board, I say that men stand out from their The honourable fellows in such cases only because they have been proved to be good, sound men.

We get no end of support and suggestions from them."" It is nonsense and twaddle for honourable members to talk about one man having the sole control of an institution of this character.

The most important thing is to free this Commonwealth Bank from any political influence or control. The Governor, or General Manager, may appear a Czar to the ordinary man in the .street; but, if we examine clauses 14, 32, and 64, we shall see that political influence can be used over him in all directions. I am not suggesting that the present Government will use influence of the sort; but this bank"" is going to outlast this Government, and all of us, for the matter of that, or otherwise it will prove a very paltry affair. Governments, when pressed, as history shows us, have to raise money how they can, just like individuals when they are in a tight corner; and, with an institution of this kind, there would be great temptation to exert political pressure. This might result in the bank being put to uses for which it was never intended; and, in discussing a question of the kind, we ought to keep in view all possibilities. This bank will affect, not only the commercial life, but the social l if e of the country; we are creating a machine of very delicate mechanism, the.working of which must have very far-reaching effects. cumstances, the Prime Minister may, I think, take it as the sense of the Committee that more than one man is required to control a Commonwealth Bank. would one man not be able .as well as a directorate of four or five to withstand policircumstances, I would like to know what tical pressure, but the Governor of the bank might, by the discussion of his position and himself on the Estimates, be placed in a very awkward and humiliating position for any self-respecting man.

The honourable member for Parkes, himself, was a director of a bank which was run on the rocks. but a branch of a Melbourne financial institution. Company was not a branch, but a company, within the State of New South Wales, as the liquidator could tell us. Company was conducted on very similar lines to those upon which a bank is conducted. There was, however, this difference : that it did business which the banks refused to transact. As a result, it eventually found itself upon the rocks, just as many financial institutions in Victoria have done. Let me now refer to the directorates of a few of the large institutions of Australia.

Let me remind honourable members that the Commercial Bank of New South Wales was conducted single-handed by Mr T. A. Dibbs for almost half a century. He was virtually the manager of that institution. Its board of directors was composed of men who were on the Boards of Management of the Sydney Gas Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Take the case of Messrs. Hordern and Sons, of Sydney. business himself. He had -no board of management to direct him, and even to-day if one visits that firm upon any business matter, it is the manager who will tell him in a few words whether he can entertain it or not. Who will say that John Forsyth does not control the firm of Burns, Philp, During this debate we have heard a good deal of criticism in regard to the political control of the proposed bank. As a representative .of New South WalesI say that we ought not to allow.the control of that institution to pass I did not; I said from this Parliament.

[11.52] I think that the best management for the proposed bank would be that of a board of commissioners or directors, and that the Government should have power to appoint not less than three, nor more than five, according to the needs of the institution.

Hordern, of Sydney, is at fault in his judgments, he has to pay for his mistakes with his own money, and therefore he takes good care that as few errors as possible are committed. A man paid a salary for managing a business, and left without supervision, does not give the same results as a man who is dealing with his own interests. public servant? tries or public works are being carried on by a Government, the management is not so good as that of a private concern. municipal and other public management contradict that. impression of the public, and of most honourable members, that departmental management is not so good as private management. where the management of concerns by Government officials certainly does not produce as good results as would be obtained by private management.

The Governor is to hold office for seven years during good behaviour, but there should be some indication as to what will operate to secure the removal of an unsuitable Governor. If the man first appointed does not fill the bill , Parliament can, of course, readily remedy the trouble.

If MrI n that regard, the Commonwealth Bank will differ materially from banks which are working under charters. I think that we shall be more secure with one man in charge of the bank than we should be if we had more than one man at its head, at any rate at this juncture. The fact that the secrets of the bank will be in the custody of one man will be a safeguard which could not be secured by appointing a number of men to conduct its affairs. I am satisfied that the welfare of the bank and the interests of the public will be best secured; in this way, and also that political influence will be more likely to be eliminated by leaving the bank under the control of one individual, with, of course, a deputy to assist him in regard to the detail work, than by placing it in the hands of a number of individuals, who might be biased by reaI think it is the son of former associations, who might be unable to rid themselves of the ""trammels of a financial career, built up under a certain system, and who, consequently, might Russia is a bureaucratic country not be able to see through the eyes which we want them to see through, and that is the eyes best calculated to see that which will carry out the behests of this measure.

However, I am very pleased that the Government have placed the responsibility and the power in the hands of one man, with the right to appoint his own officers and to run the bank, ancl that there will be no other power to checkmate him in any respect.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [12.5] 1 beg to join in the suggestion that this clause should be amended by providing that the management of the bank should lie by a Governor uncler a board or council, to be appointed in a certain manner.

He said triumphantly, and without hesitation or qualification, that this House would be supreme in the control of the institution in the last resort as well as of any other Government institution. Allow me, with great respect, to point out to the honourable member, as well as to his friends, that such an attitude is quite inconsistent with the .fundamental principle of the Labour platform, which says that there shall be a Commonwealth Bank of issue, deposit, and exchange, and with non-political management. so . I do not know how they B ill , coupled with the pronounced views of certain honourable members, the management of the bank is nominally vested in the Governor, but in reality is to be. subject to a power behind the throne in the shape of political, or, in the last resort, parliamentary, control. That would, I think, be a great mistake from the standpoint of the friends of the Bill on the other side. I have no reason to doubt the loyalty and the desire of these honourable members to make the bank a success. Therefore I think that they ought to surround the manager, or the Governor, or the dictator of the bank with certain precautions and safeguards, which will secure independent, fair, just, good, and safe management, that will not be likely eventually to lead the bank to It might be that such a financial shipwreck, or bring dishonour and discredit on those associated with it.

In saying this, I ami fully aware of tlie contention that the one-man management is intended as a bold experiment and initiative in a direction not hitherto taken by financial undertakings of the kind. contended that the one-man management may possibly be the best, and is not necessarily open to objection because it is without precedent, but in launching a big institution like this we ought not, whilst claiming the right to be original, altogether to ignore the previous experience of mankind, ancl previous precedents, which should act ns land-marks and guide-posts to assist legislators and the people in considering the course of legislation to be. adopted. I have taken the trouble to make, for the information of honourable members, a brief analysis of the methods of management of some of the greatest financial institutions in the world. I need not remind them of Australian or American precedents. I prefer to take the precedents of the great financial institutions of England, France, and Germany. Whilst some may be inclined to brush them lightly aside, I think, on reflection, they are entitled to weight. In launching the new Commonwealth Bank, honourable members would be doing it greater justice, and hedging it round with greater safeguards ancl securities, if they refused to let the clause stand in its present blank form. Bank of England is vested in a Governor, Deputy Governor, and a court of fourteen directors, who are elected annually by the stockholders. ornamental figureheads, but are active participants in the work of managing the bank and controlling its destinies. naturally assume that no man could become a member of the Court of Directors of the Bank of England merely as an act of personal or social favouritism or social distinction, and certainly not for the purpose of bringing business to the bank, although the honourable member for East Sydney suggested that directors of banks were sometimes appointed to bring business or [x 20]2 social patronage to them. One may fairly assume that the position of director of the Bank of England would be regarded as a great honour ancl prize to be competed for by the very best financial men in the centre of the financial world, which is London. That precedent, therefore, is one which not superseding ought to influence members of this Parliament in deciding the mode of management of the Commonwealth Bank'. The Court of Directors of the Bank of England meet weekly, and if they do not attend a certain number of meetings they forfei t their seats. In addition to meeting weekly, they have to It is serve upon committees o i the bank which are appointed for special purposes, and to deal with special question -, leferred to them by the Court of Directors. The management of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the great financial institution of the northern kingdom, is vested in a Governor, a Deputy Governor, nine ordinary directors, and nine extraordinary directors, the whole of the directors being elected by the shareholders. Thus its management is vested, not in one man or two or three men, but in the combined wisdom ancl authority of a semicorporate body. The management of the Bank of France, which, probably, next to the Bank of England, is the greatest financial institution in the world, is vested first in a Governor and two sub-Governors, and secondly in a general council consisting of fifteen regents ancl three censors. The Governor and sub-Governors are named by the President on the proposal of the Minister of Finance, while the regents and censors are elected or re-elected by the shareholders of the bank, who therefore exercise control over the management of the bank and take a share of fhe responsibility, by having the sole voice in the selection of the Supreme control of the regents and censors. the shareholders here. The directors are not mere ple have apparently, under this scheme no. representation whatever in the management of the bank tical control. Direct political control through Parliament is what I am objecting to, and I understand .that the Labour party themselves do not want to create a political bank.

It is said'that the taxpayers of Australia are to. be the shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank, and that they have a voice in its management through this Parliament, but I apprehend that what the taxpayers ought to have is not merely an ultimate resort to this Parliament, but some body chosen to be associated with the direct management of the bank-associate d with the governor, surrounding him, in constant touch and association with him, not, it may be, to call him to account after he has made a mistake, but to check him day by day and week by week, to advise him, and enable him to perform the duties of his great task in a satisfactory manner. France another institution to which I wish to .direct attention as a precedent that might fairly be followed by this Parliament in creating the bank. Credit Foncier of France. This bank is -mixed institution. In the first place, it is a joint stock company, ancl in the second a society to some extent under the control of the Government in consideration of certain concessions ancl privileges. The management of the Credit Foncier of France is vested partly in a council of twentythree administrators, secondly in a governor and sub-governors, and thirdly in three treasurers-general. and other administrators are nominated by the general assembly of stockholders, and the governor and sub-governors are nominated by the Government. There you have an illustration of a popular semi-Government institution in which there is a divided control, the management being vested partly in the representatives of the shareholders and partly in representatives of the Government. The great Bank of Germany, to which reference has been madedie Reichsbank-ha s a similarly divided management and control. In the first place, there is the curatorium of five members appointed by the Government. Secondly, there is the directorium consisting bf a president and director appointed by the Emperor. Thirdly, there is the central council, composed of fifteen stockholders elected by the shareholders. buted the capital in conjunction with the -Government; is that so? contributed the whole of the capital, but, in consideration Of certain special privileges, the Government have been conceded a voice and participation in the management by the appointment of certain high officers. also ?

The management of the bank is not being surrounded with precautions and safeguards. We are giving too much power to one man. I do not believe in one-man rule in banking any more than in government. For a time the one man may, perhaps, do fairly well, but in critical situations he ought to be surrounded with a cabinet or council of advice, or controlled by a council of supervision in some shape or form.

Without going into any proposals which might involve fundamental or -organic alterations in the scheme, I think that undoubtedly it would have been much better to have had the management vested in a council or board in the selection of which the States of Australia might have had a voice. To propose such a scheme now would, of course, involve alterations in detail into which I cannot -enter at present. kind would, I think, recommend itself to the common sense of the people of Australia, and would reconcile to the bank many persons who at present -do not view this scheme from a friendly -stand-point.

I do not intend to discuss the clause at great length. But I wish to point out that much has been said about, one-man management, whicli appears to me to be beside the mark. When the selection of the Governor of the bank is made, undoubtedly any Government-and this Government in particular-wil l be exceedingly careful as to the calibre of ' the person -selected. class ability, and the deputy associated with him should be a man of expert knowledge in particular financial matters. In stead of one being responsible for the management of the bank there will always be two.

All new proposals look too far I think that the best ahead. It is surprising to me tliat honourable members should be so eager to depreciate their own country, and to rush tc foreign countries to find out what is done there. The argument that "" it may be a little too modern "" might have been used when the Victorian State Parliament gave to the world voting by ballot. It established then a precedent that has been followed all over the world. experiment upon? ber regards this as an experiment, then I can only say that if we were to adopt his view we should have simply a policy of But a scheme of that negation or stagnation. the same old nit. do so to the detriment of the' public, but I am not one who would.

If I thought any proposition to amend the Bill would be an improvement, I should support it, whether it came from the Opposition or from the Government side of the chamber, but the appointment of independent directors to control the management of this institution would probably mean a revival, more particularly in time of stress and storm,, of some of our experiences of the early nineties. I am going to refer to a discussion which took place in the Victorian Parliament, in 1894,. on a Bill to amend the Savings Banks Act, in moving the second reading of which the then Treasurer, Mr G. D . Carter, saidHe should be a man of firstWhen the term of the present Commissioners expires in three years' time, if any one of them is on the directorate of another institution, he will have to abandon one or the other.

152,Mr Fenton,"Some would have usmight be thought to be likely .to exercise influence in a certain direction, just as a brewer might also be open to the suspicion of being likely to bring influence to bear in another direction. Mr G. D . Carter continuedThat is true; and that was where the teetotal influence came in. However, I will not say much on this matter, lest it may be thought that I am speaking with prejudice, but it is possible that, but for that influence on a previous Board, certain loans to coffee palaces would not have been granted; and if it had not been for the religious element, I presume the Young Men's Christian Association would not have got the loan it did. He pointed-out that, in connection with our State Savings Bank, we had Commissioners, or,, in other words, directors, who were supposed to be reputable members of the community, but who, according to him, were influenced by certain predilections or leanings in granting loans out of the funds » of the Savings Bank to particular institutions that at the time were not considered to be too safe. We do not want to revive the unpleasant past, but I could, if necessary, go on reading records of this kind. Every financial institution is tested in time of storm and stress, and we cannot be too careful in dealing with this matter. Victorian Hansard also provides me with a quotation in support of the principle of one-man mangement.' I refer to the report . of a speech by no less an authority than the honourable member for Mernda. Speaking on the Savings Banks Act Amendment Bill in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, in 1894, the honourable member-and I do not think any honourable member has had a more varied experience as a merchant and a banker-said If I had any influence with the Government, and were asked my opinion, I should say that the direction in which you should go with regard to the Savings Hanks Commissioners would be to strengthen the authority outside of Parliament, and not to weaken it ; and this especially, if it is the intention to tack on a system like the Credit Foncier. It is all the more important in such circumstances that the executive and governing body of lhat institution should be strengthened instead of weakened. They should have positions like the judges of this country. One of them, at any rate, should be a strong man, a first-class financier, who should be in a position to hold the balance, and to say"" Thus far ancl no farther "" to his fellow commissioners. The honourable member, who then represented East Bourke in the Legislative Assembly, was favorable to the appointment of a Board of Commissioners in respect of the State Savings Bank, but contended that there should be on that Board one strong Mr Fenton. man with power to say to his brother Com>missioners, when great pressure was being brought to bear upon them, "" Thus far and no farther."" have the power of veto. member went on to say'He should be in a position not to have to consult or ask permission from any Treasurer, but to administer the funds as a banker would administer tbe funds of his bank. I believe that so far as this bank is concerned we are getting as near as possible to the position which the honourable member for Mernda desired to be' established in connection with the Victorian Savings Bank in 1894. That was the year after the financial crisis, when our public men were wiseand prudent in endeavouring to guard our public institutions. remaining Commissioners would have constituted a sort of advisory board? Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will have advisers. The operations of the bank will not be confined to any one departThe ment. In connection withall our big. banking institutions a man who wishes to make inquiry in regard to securities has to go to the securities branch; if he has a land transaction he goes to the lands branch, and in some cases he has to see the manager himself. There are officers in charge of these several departments, who are betterable to tell a man what he wishes to knowin respect of them than is the manager himself. The same system will be adopted! no doubt in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. When the Land Tax Bill' was under consideration last session, somehonorable members of the Oppositioni asked, "" Are we to place the land-holders of Australia in the hands of one man, theLand Tax Commissioner?"" For twelvemonths the land-owners of Australia, however, have been practically in the hands of that one man and his advisers, and they are still going on all right. The Land' Tax Commissioner has surrounded himself with officers to carry out the various: branches of the work of tlie Department, and the Governor of this Bank will alsohave to surround himself with a body of officers. I am sure that exceptional care will be taken to secure one of the best menthat it is possible to obtain in Australia for the office of Governor.

166,Mr Spence (Darling) [12.45],"by the honourable member for Moreton to the honourable member for East Sydney was rather unfair, because it was evident from the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney that what he had in mind was the difference between the position of private institutions and that of the proposed Commonwealth Bank. I heard nothing from the honourable member, or from any one else, to suggest approval of the exercise of any political influence in the management of this bank. There is an exaggerated idea abroad as to the value of boards of directors. It arises from the fact amount of wealth. that'when a company is being formed, and a provisional board appointed, an effort is made to secure the names of substantial -men. It is not unusual to find the names of the same persons on the directorates of several financial institutions.' There may be one or two members of an expert board of directors who take a keen interest in the business of the company, and consult with the managet more often than the other members of the board. But the ordinary practice is for the manager of a company to submit only important proposals to his board of directors, that they may be fully discussed. As a general thing, the management of the business is left to the man in whom the directors have confidence. Honourable members overlook the fact that proa matter of fact, the business will come to bably the only reason'for the appointment of a board of directors in connection with the management of private institutions is that the appearance of their names on the board gives, confidence to the public, as they are usually men of integrity. They are largely ornamental, and very frequently they have only a sufficient interest in the foundations bf a great National bank. It will'company to qualify them for a seat on the board. I am surprised that honourable members should suggest here that these men really run the whole show. That kind of statement may deceive people outside, but we all know very well what it amounts to. We have all heard of the ""guinea pig,"" as describing the man who makes a living from directors' fees. Many directors draw fees from a number of companies for simply putting in an appearance at the board meetings. of one case in which a director of half-adozen companies had to travel from Melbourne to Ballarat, and he charged his railway fare to each company. Honourable members want us to believe that directors do the real work of advising on the details of the business; but, as a matter of Mr Sfenee. fact, they do not look into matters very closely, most of them being appointed* merely as ornaments. It ought to berealized that in the case of the Commonwealth Bank the situation is very different. There is no necessity to publish the namesdf well-known men in order to inspire confidence in the public, because the Commonwealth Bank will have the credit of the whole country behind it. Many menare regarded as specially gifted with, wisdom, simply because they have been, successful in accumulating a certain, I am not oneto say that this does not frequently prove capacity, and I have no strong objection to advisers in the management of this bank eventually; but I agree with the Prime Minister that it is not a question on< which we can dogmatize. We ought topreserve an open mind; and, personally, I think that at present the appointment of a Governor is quite ample for the purposesof management. The Commonwealth, Bank, as I say, will have the credit of the whole country behind it ; and, moreover, the idea is not profit for the benefit of shareholders-excep t that profit which isrepresented by benefit to the community as a whole-and , therefore, there is no necessity for keen competition for business. Asthe bank without being specially sought for;. and the institution will start in a small way, as many healthy institutions have done. The success and safety of the bank' will depend on our obtaining the servicesof the best man available, and the Governor will have the grand privilege of laying the not be long, I presume before it will be necessary to have a branch in each of the capitals, and there will need to be verycareful selection of the local managers. We shall have to get brainy men of considerable experience, and pay them adequate salaries; and in this way we shaU obtain the services, not of ornamental directors, but of banking experts. The honourable member for Parkes and othersspeak of obtaining the services, as direc1 know tors or advisers, of men of high standing in the financial world; but such men are already directors of other institutions, or otherwise how can it be said that they have had experience. Apparently the idea is to ask those gentlemen to resign their present positions in order to act as an Advisory Board of the Commonwealth Bank; andnthis, of course, would mean several high.salaried positions. In the beginning, the work of this bank will be largely of an organizing cliaracter; and it will be some lime before we can' reasonably expect the .management to be called upon to handle large loans, advances on property, and so forth. It may be necessary in the future io have an Advisory Board similar to the arrangement in the case of the Bank of England; but at present I think the appointment of a Governor is sufficient. Honourable members seem to be unanimous in the idea that an opening should be left for the States to take an interest in this Ibanki f fhey so desire. The bank must, .'however, always remain a Commonwealth Bank; and if , for sentimental reasons, perhaps, the States do take a hand, that will necessarily involve some change in the management. In ordinary banking institutions the faith of the directors in the manager depends on the ability of the latter, and the work of the directors is thus regulated. If a manager is capable, reliable, and successful the meetings of directors are formal; whereas, if he has made -errors, though not sufficiently serious to justify a change, the directors are watchful and careful. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. I share the opinion that in this matter our Ibest precedents are to be found in the banking experience of Australia, our financial institutions being as highly developed as any in the world. mental weakness of the Bill is due to the fact that the Treasurer has not been sufficiently guided by Australian experience. In a departure of this kind there should be as little experimenting as possible. Certainly those features of banking operations which have contributed to their success -ought not to be ignored. :great many bank directorates have become so satisfied as to the efficiency of their managers that they leave the control of affairs largely to them, but one-man control is not regarded as likely in the main to promote efficiency. If this bank is to be a success, it must carry on ordinary banking business all over Australia. The tendency of officials is to get into a groove, and the officials of the bank are likely to become conservative. A board of directors, would be of value in formulating and controlling the general policy of the bank. The conditions of Australia vary as widely as those of ""any other country, and seasons have a great deal to do with production, and therefore with the value of securities. While in one State a liberal lending policy might be a good thing, a conservative policy might at the same time be necessary ir; anothei State. One officer controlling the whole of the bank's, operations would not be likely to have that wide knowledge of values and grip of policy that could be. obtained were he fortified with the assistance of an advisory board of practical men. I see no reason why the Governor of the bankshould not be almost supreme, and believe that an advisory board would be better than a domineering directorate. The Minister of Home Affairs initiated a scheme which in many respects was more statesman-like than that now under discussion, and was approved, I understand, by the Brisbane Conference. It tackled the question of the conversion of the debts of the States. It is unfortunate that the Government did hot consider this matter more closely before advancing, under the, guise of a business proposition, what, according, to the Prime Minister's own words, is largely an experiment. The Government has departed from the scheme approved by the Conference, which possessed .merits which the Bill does not possess. No sufficient reason has been given by the Prime Minister for ignoring precedent and experience in connection with a piece of legislation which has been correctly described as the fundamental basis of our future financial, stability and credit. I hope that it is not too late to The fundaimprove the measure by providing for a board to strengthen the administration of the Governor. -Honorabl e members opposite think that the Government should follow the precedent of private control, and appoint a . No doubt a board of commissioners or directors to join with the Governor in the administration of the bank. Practically every large private financial institution is controlled by directors or commissioners, but the bank which we are establishing will differ fromthem. In the case of the private financial institutions, a number of persons possessing vested interests appoint directors to act for them in controlling and managing their affairs. The proposed bank will be a national institution, and practically one of the first of its kind. It will belong, net tq a few investors, but to tbe whole com-, munity. Every elector will be interested",30,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As

168,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [2.40]..,"in its success. Those who deposit money with it at interest or borrow from it will, of course, have a special interest in its operations, but the whole Commonwealth will also be concerned. The management of the institution is very properly removed from political control, though the general policy of the bank will come under the review of the representatives of the people, who, to some extent, will take the place of a board of directors. The proper administration of the bank's affairs is safeguarded to an extent to which the proper administration of private financial institutions is not, the Auditor-General being required to examine the accounts, and satisfy himself that a proper financial policy is being pursued, not once a year, but once every six months. to Parliament, and therefore the whole financial and administrative position of the bank comes under the review of Parliament, and the need that exists in private institutions for directorates to keep a certain amount of control over the management does not exist to the same extent in this institution. the private institutions the directors do not take the onus and responsibility of that intimate management which honourable members opposite would lead the Committee to suppose. The analogy that has been drawn between this institution and such institutions as the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and the Bank of Germany is by no means complete. Those banks are practically private institutions with the addition that they transact large governmental business, and that fact is sufficient to warrant the Government in each country asking for, and being given, a certain amount of control. stitution, which is a purely national one, wholly under the control and wholly the property of the people. the banks are semi-private, while in the other case the institution which we are now launching is under purely governmental control, and purely a governmental institution. managed all the same. but '1 have yet to learn that a board of directors can guarantee that any institution will be well managed. in financial crises Boards that seemed to be quite above suspicion, and that honestly strove to do their duty, and yet the irrstitutions over which they presided came to grief. The success of all large business concerns depends greatly upon the management, and particularly upon the ability and capacity of the general! manager. If an institution has a competent, able, and honest directorate, arid an incompetent or dishonest manager, I fear that the incompetency or dishonesty of the latter will, more. than neutralize the honesty and competency of the generab board. That is by no means an uncommon experience. The purposes of the boards of management which have been so strongly urged as examples, are, certainly, to exercise a certain amount of control' His report has to be submitted over the general manager, or to beavailable for the general manager to consult, but they are also largely intended to> create confidence in the credit of the institutions, and so gentlemen high in thecommercial, financial, or even political, world are placed on them.

All these gentle.men have been prominent at one time or -other in the politics of the country, and. so far as my memory goes, obtained their positions on the Board of the bank in -every instance while in Parliament. them were on the directorates long before they had anything to do with politics, especially the members of the Legislative Council on the Board of the Commercial Bank. able member will find that more of them 'became bank directors after becoming prominent in politics. those gentlemen are not competent, but that list-and I have not quoted all the banking institutions of Australia-show s that the private banks are not afraid of political influence to the extent of having politicians upon their directorates. -some of the banks the politicians and expoliticians outnumber the private citizens -on the Board. That objection, therefore, does not hold good, but I submit that this proposal is largely in the nature of an -experiment. from the accepted method of control of private or semi-private banking institutions, and therefore ought to be examined -closely to ascertain if it is warranted. As I have shown that there is no direct lanalogy between private or semi-private institutions and the new bank that we are A t any rate', they were prolaunching, the reasons that call for the assistance of directorates in the case of the former do not prevail to the same extent in this case. Firstly, this Parliament is responsible for the policy and the Company of Sydney has on good government of the bank. It is responsible to the people, and to that extent it fulfils a considerable part of the functhe Queensland National tions that directors discharge in the case of private institutions. Further, the bank is subject to review by the Auditor General, whose Department is entirely F . S. Grimwade, M . L . C . ; the free from political control, and his report must come before Parliament every six months. Parliament has, therefore, authoritative sources from which to obtain information as to the financial position and management of the bank, and will be able more completely than any Board of Directors to know what is going on. The whole tendency of these times, wisely or unwisely, is to centralize the management of big concerns' in the hands of a few. I have only to refer honourable members to State tendencies. The first effort to dissociate the administration of our public functions from direct Parliamentary control took place in connection with the railways. New South Wales, I think, made the first movement in that direction. Under the leadership of the late Sir Henry Parkes the railways of that State were removed from political control and placed under a Board of three Commissioners. Other States later on adopted a three-Commissioner system, but gradually worked down to practically one-man control of their railways. We found, as the result of inquiry, that Mr Oliver, Chief Commissioner of Railways for New South Wales, was outI do not say that voted regarding a number of administrative matters by his two fellow Commissioners. As the outcome of an inquiry it was found -and I think I am expressing the general opinion of the public in this connexionthat his policy in connection with large contracts which came under review was more In in the interests of the Government and the country than was the policy adopted on the votes of his two co-Commissioners. Whilst we still have three Raihvays -Commissioners in New South Wales, the chief Commissioner to-day has the power to It is certainly a departure veto the findings of his co-Commissioners, so that such a state of affairs, cannot again arise. In New South Wales the Public Service was controlled by a Board of .three Commissioners, and, as the result of the experience of..that.State, the Commonwealth",33,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As
175,Mr Ryrie,You are wrong; plenty of,34,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As
176,Mr Thomas Brown,"-The honordetermined that its Public Service should be controlled by only one Commissioner. Whilst our system may not be all that some honourable members would wish it to be, it is impossible for any human being to give satisfaction to every one, and I am certain that the control of the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth has not been detrimental to the best interests of the service, and will, at least, compare favourably with any system of control by three Commissioners. gradually getting away from the idea of having a multiplicity of counsellors in respect of our public concerns, and for the reasons I have indicated, and because of the safeguards which this Bill provides I am prepared to assist the Government in giving a trial to the control of the bank by a Governor, who will have the fullest power and the widest authority to make a success of this institution. that, after all, everything will depend on the man selected for the position. If we can secure the services of an able, competent, experienced man the bank will be a success; I feel equally sure that if we did not secure the services of such a man, then, even if we had the ablest board of directors that could be chosen, the bank would probably not be the success that it would otherwise be. sire to add to the points previously submitted to the Committee one or two that escaped my memory when I was discussing this question yesterday, and which, in view of the importance of the Bill and of the particular proposal before us, I think it my duty to place on record. point I failed to mention yesterday when questioning the choice of a single Governor to control the bank related to the great size of this continent. The operations of the bank are, at least, to be extended over the whole of Australia, and there is provision for their spreading abroad for certain purposes. existing bank boards largely lies in the local knowledge and experience of those who constitute them. no man-could claim similar knowledge in respect of the whole of this vast continent, and that even if any man at a particular time had such a knowledge, he could not keep pace with the march of events. Hence there is another justification for the appointment of a board the members of which should be able fo lend valuable aid to the Governor. might be found in the choice of two or three men who between them were acquainted with the greater part of the Commonwealth, with which the Governor himself could not be expected to be familiar. That cannot be pushed toofar, but it is ar. important element to be added to those other elements for our consideration before finally negativing the proposal that the Governor of this bank should' have the aid of men of something like hisWe have been own status and calibre, and possessing experience in other directions, geographical or otherwise. My proposition that the Governor shall be so assisted does not of necessity imply the appointment of any or of all these assistant directors at the timeof the establishment of the bank. Every one realizes that a certain period must elapse during which the bank's operationswill be restricted, and during which the I recognise Governor himself may furnish the requisiteknowledge. honourable member think that the positioncould be met by the Governor appointing assistants in each of the States possessing special knowledge in respect of their respective States? could be derived in that way, though I doubt if it would be as effective as the choice of men of sufficiently wide knowledge of large portions of Australia who would be perpetually associated with the Governor when the bank got into f u l l swing. If there were such a power in the Government, it probably would not be exercised at once, neither need the appointThe first ments be simultaneous. As the needs of the bank required it , however, these subordinate directors should, in the interests of the bank and of the Commonwealtli, be appointed. Every honourable member who has defended the Government proposition Assuredly, the efficiency of our to entrust the fortunes of the bank to one man has said that everything depends upon, the man to be selected. The Prime MinI t is evident that ister, himself, has emphasized that point again and again. The risk can be expressed in a general way in figures. What are the chances of our finding a man of that f u l l knowledge of Australia and of banking, that sound judgment and habit of self-dependence, whicli would enable him to grapple with a great problem of this sort so as to conduct the institution, not One special justification only through its initial stages, during which",34,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As

We have to take into account the obvious risks run in attempting to make any such single choice. I have admitted, as many honourable members have contended, that if we could find the ideal man for this position, we should clo well to entrust him with the whole charge, free from the well-meant, but unnecessary, assistance of other capable experts. pressed in a sporting way, of our finding such a man ? What are the chances of our finding a man with a thorough grip of Australian affairs, with such intellectual resources and such a character as would enable him to sustain the great weight of the whole of this enterprise? It is quite sufficient to put the question in that way to bring it home to honourable members in a homely and direct fashion. What would it mean if gradually we supported the Governor by the appointment of two or three co-directors whose powers would be defined in their appointment? detailed discussion. vious choices. directors f u l l colleagues of the Governor, and either to allow majority control, or to permit the Governor's co-directors, if agreed, to suspend his decision, or, on the other hand, to place him in the first and solely responsible position, giving him authority, on his own motion, after receiving the advice and assistance of his colleagues, to determine what ought to be done, simply using, for his own advantage, their ability and acquaintance with the subject uncler consideration. cord. means that I do not wish to elaborate, and that could be adjusted according to the judgment of the Committee, so as to diminish tbe enormous risk of our not finding the absolutely perfect man who is required for this position, if he is to stand alone. mates would override the captain. that would depend upon the constitution of the bank. If we desired, whilst obtaining the knowledge of these assistant directors, to pin our faith to the judgment of their superior officer, that could be done. Board of Railways Commissioners in Queensland, and that State has now reverted to control of the railways by one Commissioner. have taken different roads, according to their experience and the men with whom they have had to deal. A much greater risk is undertaken when we trust entirely to one man. These are matters properly But what are the chances, exwithin our consideration. The other point to which I wish to allude was mentioned yesterday, but not, perhaps, put in as plain a form as I desired. It is that taking political influence in the ordinary sense in which political influence is usually mentioned, meaning by that the action of individual politicians who would place, or seek to place, themselves in relation with the Governor of the bank in order to obtain personal advantages for themselves, their friends, or their constituents-of this I have little or no anticipation. It ought to be practically impossible, and I In what way? think it is extremely unlikely to occur. T h a t is a matter for In speaking, therefore, of political in There are two obfluence I am not referring to individual One is to make these cointerferences. The bulk of honourable members opposite have frankly confessed -as , indeed, is obvious-that under this Bill political influence, in the higher sense, has been deliberately adopted throughout. Of course, the bank originates in this B ill , and will be governed from time to time by other measures passed by Parliament. Consequently under legislative power this bank is lx>rn, will live, and will cease to be if ever it does cease-; it cannot escape legislative control, and that control must always be political.

189,Mr Deakin,"Certainly not; for IGovernor of the bank. Supplementary to his control there is not only the legislative control of the Government to which I have referred, but a power of regulation by the Government, a power which, in itself, is so large and ample that it may, and, if necessary, would be sufficient to cover an entire change of policy and of administration. be exercised publicly under the regulations. The Act does so much, and then the regulations clo something more. These regulations it is in the power of the Government to make, with the tacit assent of the majority in Parliament; and it is a power absolutely and wholly political, just as die legislative power is. Then thei'e is the third power conferred by clause 32 which provides that the Governor may, with the consent of the Treasurer, make rules.. The authority of the Treasurer is absolute because without it the Governor cannot make rules; the consent of the Government as a whole is not necessary, the consent of the Treasurer completing the structure of authority. First of all, in the Bill itself, there are the amplest gifts of power-that-is , political. vernment through regulations-that is political in the higher sense. Then there is the control of the bank in what are relatively minutise by means of rules made by the Governor, but only enforceable with the consent of the Treasurer-that is, again, political. necessity, in the most absolute sense, and always under political control. The resources of the Commonwealth are behind this bank; it is on this that rhe credit of the bank is built, and is intended to be thus sustained. That being PO, some political control is absolutely indispensable. It is not admitted by many honourable members, and certainly not by me, that it is necessary to place the whole credit of the Commonwealth in this unlimited fashion behind the bank. It would have been possible to found this bank by enabling it to acquire its capital in what may be termed the ordinary manner, perhaps keeping a , reserve liability of the Commonwealth properly conditioned. So much in passing, merely to show that it is not essential to place the credit of the Commonwealth behind the bank in the wholesale fashion adopted in the B ill . We cannot, however, disguise from ourselves the fact that we are establishing a financial institution which, in Mr Deakin. the higher sense, will be, and, in many instances, must be, under political control. The proposition that the bank shall be managed by the Governor of the bank, has hanging to it all these very important considerations to whicli I have, in very brief and hasty fashion, directed attention. I once more submit to the Prime Of course, all this power will Minister that the path of safety would be to afford the Governor of the bank such assistance as may be thought necessary by qualified associates under conditions to be defined by the Government, and to make such consequential, amendments as would be advisable in the other portions of the measure. I am putting this matter formally to the Prime Minister after some further study of the B ill . The path we are pursuing may be justified by the successful choice of the right man, and his retention in office for a. sufficient time under favorable consideration; but the odds will be much more against us than they need be. We can make them much more in our favour by giving him expert support when and where necessary, under circumstances which"" Parliament will approve.

I must confess that the ideas developed durSo the institution is, of ing the debate have not afforded much help to those who desire to discover whether there ought to be one, two, or three at the head of the Commonwealth Bank. The debate, convinces me that, although this hank is practically a new departure, the proposal in this clause is the very best that ciuld be submitted. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that there should be a directorate to assist the one Governor. Who is to appoint the directorate? tail. that one director should retire eachyear. has been made that this Bill permits of political influence.

197,Mr Fisher,"Very well. The chargethe government of the bank would be entirely by political influence. Yet this is a suggestion made to remove political influence from the management of the bank ! I found one of my greatest difficulties in fhis connection. If there were a directorate, the Government would have to appoint the directors; and unless the appointments were made permanent, in the same way as those of the Governor and the Deputy Governor, the control would be absolutely in the hands of the Government of the day. A Government could find ample reasons for appointing men of the same political complexion as themselves. pose to appoint the Governor. is for seven years. could be made in the case of directors. for Balaclava has just suggested that one director should retire each year. I take, it that the honourable member for Mernda endorses the view of -the Leader of the Opposition. suggested that the directors should be appointed for seven years. appointment might be for three or five vears. the speculative stage, and we desire to hear some suggestion better than the proposal in the B ill . Such a suggestion we have not yet heard. The revised suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, to have a directorate, would, in my opinion, throw the whole management of the bank into the hands of political parties. 'The present Government do not desire that, and they ask Parliament to give them power to appoint a Governor who will be charged with the supreme control. Deputy Governor appointed for a term of seven years; ancl, in case of illness or other emergency, he will act for the Governor. Tliat, I think, is ample safeguard against the management falling into unsuitable or improper hands. Mr .MAHON -Supposing the two happen to be ill at the same time? but, of course, such an emergency might arise, and the honourable member for Coolgardie is quite right to call attention to the point. The risk, however, is not sufficient to justify the appointment of a third Governor; ancl if we did make such a. proposal I suppose some honourable member would ask what would happen if the three were all incapacitated by accident at the same time. There is a reserve power in the Executive Government to appoint one of their number, or any outside person, to take up the"" work, and that I think is sufficient. about the management of the bank? The directors would be experts. as I go on, because honourable members change their ground. I understood from honourable members that there were many But that appointment experts outside much better informed than the Governor or Deputy Governor could beBut now the honourable member for Fremantle indicates that nobody but the GoT h e honourable member vernor or Deputy Governor will be capableof managing the bank.

215,Mr Fisher,"The leader of the Opwill prevent that. It is a power which is given because there are many matters which it is thought can be provided for better by regulation than by statutory enactment. It has been suggested that no regulation concerning the management of the bank should have effect unless obtaining the concurrence of the Governor. That is an extreme position to take up, though not an impossible one -I think, however, that it would be better to provide that a regulation relating to management in which the Governor does not concur should be laid on the table of Parliament, accompanied with the Governor's reasons for objecting to it. [3-34]--The Prime Minister has promised to consider certain amendments if it can be shown that ;there is any danger of political influence. It seems to me that in addition to the dangers already pointed out, arising under the provisions requiring Executive approval to the general regulations of the bank, there is that which comes from requiring the consent of the Treasurer to the making of rules for its ordinary management and control. brings political influence into every detail of the bank's operations. is satisfactory to know that the Leader of the Opposition repudiates the idea that the Bill opens the door to what is commonly known as political influence. honourable member is contradicted by his own leader, who declared that there is no likelihood of the politician obtaining for himself, his friend, or his constituents, any special advantages. member for Ballarat objected, however, that the Bill was political in the sense that it has been bom of a political party. That objection, if he intended it to be an objecagement, but for what is equally important, tion, would apply to most legislation, including a number of measures and appointments, such as the Judiciary Act and the appointments under it, for which the honourable member for Ballarat was largely responsible. If we prevent members of Parliament, or powerful individuals in the community, from obtaining special advantages from the bank for themselves or for their friends, we shall do all that is necesI have had eighteen years' experience as a sary in that regard. But it is not clear that one-man rule is the best. I have no great love for autocracy, and agree with the adage written in enduring letters on tbe pavement of the entrance hall, that "" in the multitude of counsellors there is safety."" The ablest man may sometimes profit by the advice of another. Even. Homer nods, and while there may be a financial genius capable of guiding the destiny of the bank to success, it is conceivable that he would profit by the advice and experience of others. Final determinations might be left to the Governor, but there should be an advisory board, not to overrule him, but to assist him, and to put on record its dissent from decisions to which it did not agree. The board would be independent of Parliament, and should be appointed for seven years. I welcome the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will accept any amendment which will improve the Bill. No doubt he will receive such amendments from both sides. The advisory board I consider necessary, not as a check on political influence, but as a matter of ordinary business prudence. That listened with surprise to many of the remarks which have been made regarding the status and work of bank directors. The popular idea that they do little more than draw fees is as false as the statement that they often overrule general managers, and thus cause disasters. As the last speaker has reminded us, "" in the multitude of counsellors there is safety."" The proposed bank is, I understand, ultimately to control, not only the note issue, but the loans and every department of commercial banking, as well as the Savings Bank business. Its business will be more extensive and varied than that of any inThe honourable stitution with which I am acquainted, but under the Bill its sole control will be in the hands of one man. He will be made responsible, not only for its executive manits policy, and will have to do the best he can unaided in times of difficulty, which a Government institution must face just as private institutions have to do. The Prime Minister expects the impossible in thinking that one man can fulfil all the functions that the Governor of the bank will have, and undertake all his responsibilities. bank director, and perhaps an ounce of experience in these matters is worth a good many bushels of argument.

We -came into it, not because we were in any way interested, but for the sake of upholding, if possible, the credit of the -community, and we had practically to .take the bank in hand and run it, of course, with the assistance of the officers, 'but they had got into the difficulties, and, practically, the bank had to be pulled through by the directors, who were placed there by the shareholders for the purpose. I can assure honourable members that, to this day-and I have every reason to believe it is the same with other institutions -the directors have an accurate and close -acquaintance, not with all the individual accounts, but with the actual position of any borrower of magnitude. that the manager, who at the same time is the supreme executive officer, is under our -direction, and also that he can call upon :tis to aid him with our advice in any matter -upon which he considers it important to 'have advice. the duties imposed by this Bill would rather seek to have the assistance of men of experience and influence, as the Leader of the Opposition said, with local knowledge, appointed as directors. The theoretical banker must necessarily know many things that the ordinary man of business -does not know, but he is often ignorant of a great many things that it is most important that the manager of a bank should know, .and he should have access to that inforimation, and have the advantage of mind -contributing with mind to the discussion of the most complicated and extraordinary -questions that do from time to time come up. to think that this bank has only to 'be started to practically run by itself. It will do nothing of the kind. It will need enormous foresight and wisdom, and enormous powers of management. T submit to the Prime Minister that he and his friends ougITt to reconsider this matter fully, not from_ the stand-point of the -charge that if they do not do it they are handing the institution over to vulgar political influence, ancl to be pillaged by politicians, but with the object of securing the : best possible advice to guide and aid the .general manager or Governor in carrying -on the institution. My idea of this bank has been different from that of other lionorable members. I always felt that .a financial organ was necessary for the Commonwealth to manage the State debts, and even the note issue, if that were taken over. If it confined itself to those matters, it would have important functions to f u l f i l , and it could also be so constituted as to be, in times of crisis, a reserve force. The want of such, a central or centralizing force was felt at the time of the last crisis in 1893, and if we had had it, the worse effects of that time would' Tiave been averted. The body which I pictured as the right thing for the Commonwealth could have been managed on those lines with comparative simplicity, and possibly one Commissioner might for such duties have been sufficient But I proposed that even in that case there should be three Commissioners, one to be the chairman, with the right of a casting vote. If the functions We know of this institution had been to form a financial organ for the Commonwealth, and manage the Commonwealth 'business, it would have been simple; but the business now proposed to be given to it is enormously complicated. I therefore ask Any manager undertaking the Prime Minister, in all sincerity, to reconsider the matter, and, if he will listen to suggestions, to be prepared perhaps later on, after f u l l consideration, to recommit the clause. of those who have expressed honest doubts as to the appointment of one controller as opposed to several, I may be permitted to make my position clear, as, if this matter goes to a vote, I shall vote with the Government. I have given it careful consideration, and have made due allowances for such objectionsI will not say counter suggestions, because none have been made-as Honourable members seem have been raised by the Opposition, and particularly the protest voiced by the honourable member for Mernda, who is a man of wide experience. In taking any notice of the Opposition's remarks, one has first to allow for the fact that they are an Opposition, and therefore are more or less bound to oppose. I admit that that consideration does not dominate every member on that side, but it controls all of them more or less. In the honourable member for Mernda, again, we have a man who is bound by precedent, and who, as the result of long experience in certain courses of action, could not be expected to depart from them at this stage of his career. He is the last man onearth I should expect to head a reform, particularly in banking. It must necessarily devolve upon those of us who are prepared to take certain risks in advanced legislation, and I rank myself",39,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As
221,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [3.51],"As oneamong those who are prepared to depart to sonie extent from precedent, as is proposed in this case. If the Executive, as it must, selects a man from among the best banking experts of the day to control this institution, that gentleman must naturally immediately surround himself with all the skill he can command among the banking fraternity. proclaim himself as incompetent. I know of no man charged with a big trust, and capable of fulfillin g it, who does not at once seek his confreres among the most able men that he can possibly command. I myself, in a small and insignificant way in business, have always sought to associate myself with the best capacity I could find. Any man worthy of a responsible position must do so. This position does not require that special knowledge of the whole of Australia in detail which the Leader of the Opposition has laid down as essential. That must come with the men who are selected to help the general manager. What he will require is a knowledge of men and things, and the capacity to judge men. I have no doubt that the man who accepts this honourable position will feel so impressed by the responsibilities placed upon him that he will take every conceivable precaution, by surrounding himself with the right sort of men, to insure successful man-, agement. On general principles I oppose any promiscuous extension of State functions in a socialistic way, but in a matter of this sort we are entering the financial arena, which claims the best developed minds of the day. If we seek their aid, and get the best man among them, who will at once seek others of equal calibre, we shall not be running any such risks as those who denounce any and every socialistic proposal would imply. Without wishing to say anything against the banking part of this proposal, I hope the Prime Minister will take notice of the suggestions that have been put forward to alter the scheme of management of the bank. The very heading of this part of the Bill is wrong. It refers to the management of the bank by a Governor. A Governor governs or directs, but he employs a manager. The manager of a bank under present conditions is not the head of the bank, but is employed by the Governor or by the directors. throughout Australia make it compulsory for companies to be run in a certain manner for the security of people who have invested money in them, so many directors having to be elected in a certain way, and balance-sheets having to be made out, properly audited, and submitted to the public. If it is necessary to protect the people's money invested in 'companies, surely something of the kind is necessary to protect the people's money when handled in a conI f he does not, he will at once cern of this kind. Many honourable members who have spoken on this subject: hardly understand what a tremendous area tlte knowledge required to run a bank covers. Jt can be found in no one man. I have been in Australia between thirty and forty years, and have seen many ups. and downs, and have known times 'when any man. placed in the position of having, to' rely only on his own knowledge or on. any knowledge that he could get from outside would have been bound to f a i l . It would be better for the Government to appoint advisory directors to whom the Governor can appeal. They would be responsible to the Government for the advice they gave. Otherwise the Governor may accept the advice of men whose advice we should not recommend him to accept if we knew of it. The tenor of the remarks which have been made on the Ministerial side has been that the Governor would always have some one uncler him to whom he could appeal. We want some persons, not exactly over him, but in the position of an advisory board, to whom he could appeal -men , perhaps, better able to advise than are bankers themselves. The advisory board of a bank or company is generally composed of men actively engaged in many callings ancl in touch with all the business going on in Australia. Knowing that their advice would be criticised, and that Parliament or the Minister would have power to remove them if they gave bad advice, a board of directors for this bank would! be careful what advice they gave, and that should be sufficient guarantee that the very best advice would be given. We have in Australia experts in all sorts of propositions. Big business mightbe offered to the Governor of the bank, I feel certain that if such offers were made to him, he would be glad to have a board of directors whom he could consult. I could understand his saying to his board, "" Here is an offer that has been made tome ; but I do not know why it should haveThe Companies Acts been made. This business has been in the hands of another institution for years, and I should like your advice as to whether",40,Smith Honourable Inside In Time To Deposit Their Money As
222,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [3.56],"or not I should accept it , "" In such circumstances, the advice of a board of directors might be of great value. pointment of a board would be in accordance with a practice which has been adopted to protect the people. Acts of the States render it necessary for .a board of directors to be appointed in -respect of every company. -the manager of a company bas not f u l l and .sole control over it. The Governor should igovern the bank, but the policy of the bank should be directed and advised by a board appointed to assist him. We all 'hope that this bank will be a success. I object to the Savings Bank provisions of the B ill ; but I see no objection to the pro[4-5]--The statement just made by the honposal to establish a bank to transact ordinary banking business. Within the last ten or twelve years, the business of the country has been doubled, but there has been no increase in the number of our banking institutions. I object, however, to the bank being established on the lines laid down by the Government, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should accept the advice that was tendered him, not only by the Opposition, but by some of his own supporters, with a view of the better working of the institution. of the bank should not have to depend upon the life and health of one man, and if this -question is reconsidered by the Ministry, I am sure that the alteration we suggest will be made. Prime Minister, who tells us that he is anxious that this bank shall be governed in tlie best possible manner, and that it shall be free from political influence, proposes that its management shall be in the hands of one man. As against that proposition, we have several suggestions from various parts of the Chamber, not one of which, however, has materialized sufficiently to allow of its being put before us in the form of an amendment. I am asked to accept either the Government proposal or nothing. If the clause be struck out, we shall have nothing to put in its -place. If a definite amendment were submitted, I should be able to compare it with, the Ministerial proposal; but no honourable member has been able to state definitely what he thinks is really wanted. I should -prefer a system of control by three Governors or Commissioners. If three independent men of practically equal standing, and having powers somewhat akin to those of the Railways Commissioners, were appointed, the position might be more satisfactory.' We could provide that the maThe apjority should rule, but that the chairman should have the power to override the decision's of his'colleagues, conditionally on The Companies his placing on record a minute giving bis reasons for overruling them. That is the principle which I should prefer. I do not Under them favour the appointment of an advisory committee consisting of men from outside, who might or might not be connected with other banking institutions; but, failing any proposition by way of an amendment to which I can agree, I am compelled to support the Government proposal. orable member for Gippsland means that he would like an amendment to be submitted, but is not able to frame one himself. The honourable member says that he favours a board of three directors or governors. That being so, why does he not submit an amendment to that effect? live to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition appealing to me to frame an amendment. The good government this : that the honourable member for Gippsland confesses that he is not able to state in an amendment the views which he holds regarding a Bill before the Chamber? What a confession to make to his constituents who send him here to try to shape the legislation of the Commonwealth. Amendments are not flowing freely from the Opposition because I believe there is a feeling that it is useless to propose any. Notwithstanding the suave, smooth words of the Prime Minister, the Government have no intention of accepting any amendments that may come from this side of the Committee. amendment suggested yesterday, but the That is my difficulty. Committee rejected it. I was not here yesterday, and should not have spoken to-day but that I feel this is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. A faulty step taken now would result very unfortunately to the bank itself. I am not going to prophesy disaster for this institution. 1 believe the common sense of the Parliament will prevent anything of the kind, even if it be unwise to set it up on its present lines.

It is qontended that clause 32, which requires the consent of the Treasurer to certain things, introduces political influence, but it is very rarely, if ever, that an official is placed wholly outside control in some direction.

The Treasurer, however, will have nothing to do with the making of appointments. That, under clause 16, is left entirely to the Governor.

Sir JOHN QUICK .(Bendigo) [5.0] I desire to draw attention to the provision relating to the tenure of ofiice of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the bank. It is declared in this clause that their tenure of office shall be during good behaviour for a period of seven years, and that they shall be eligible for re-appointment. I have not been able to find similar words in any Act of Parliament relating to good behaviour appointments. This seems to mark a departure from previous Federal legislation relating to offices to be held during good behaviour, and I should like to know the reason for the variation.

305,Sir John Quick,"Then it wouldI n those three cases evidently the tenure of office depends upon ultimate parliamentary control. It seems, however, that the tenure of office of the Governor and Deputy Governor depends not upon Parliament, but, in the first instance, upon the act of the Executive. The only remedy which the Governor or Deputy Governor would have if he were dismissed from his office would be, apparently, an appeal to the High Court. If there is any reason why the Justices of the High Court, or the Auditor-General should have secured to them a tenure dependent upon the. will of Parliament, the same reason sliould apply to the position of the Governor of a great financial institution like this, who will have enormous powers and responsibilities. He may not. be able to please every one; he may make enemies; he may make friends, and in a position of such great responsibility and power, he should have some security of tenure, and should not be liable to be either suspended or dismissed by the Executive of tlie day, without any appeal to Parliament. The position of these officers certainly should not be less secure than is that of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. ister and Treasurer) [5.7] I do not think that the Governor or Deputy Governor of the bank will be in the same position as is the Auditor-General, or a Justice of the High Court. Their independence will be sufficiently safeguarded by the. Bill itself. I do not think Parliament desires that either of them should not be suspended, or even dismissed, without an appeal to Parliament. If either were wrongfully dismissed, or suspended, within the seven years' period, for which he is appointed, he would have a right, t presume, to sue for breach of contract, and to claim payment of salary in respect of the whole term of his appointment. The position of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the bank will be different from that of the Auditor-General, and the Justices of the High Court in that they will be appointed for only a limited term, but with the right to have their appointment renewed. I do not fear any attack being made on the Governor or Deputy Governor by any Government. from time to time will have enough to do to mind their own particular business without interfering with a big financial proposition of this kind. If the position is to be strengthened, I think it should be strengthened in another way, but I prefer the clause as it stands. not repeat what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo so well put regarding the aspect of this clause from the point of view of the Governor and his deputy. The point that is perhaps of more importance to us is that we have in this clause a departure from practically all our precedents in regard to similar appointments, inasmuch as it makes the Government of the day, instead of this Parliament, the active, executive agent. Again, instead of requiring that the sanction of Parliament shall be obtained for the dismissal of either of these officers, it leaves the matter entirely in the hands of the Government themselves. This appears to mark a constitutional departure so grave as a precedent that it ought not to be made without f u l l justification. It may be said that -ifaffects only one' man, and is likely to be used very rarely, if at all. The fact remains, however, that we are departing altogether from our establishedprocedure. Without warrant or necessity, so far as 1 can judge, we are introducing a new relation, and instead' of protecting the authority of Parliament, we are transferring our authority in this regard to Ministers. not think the position is so simple as the Prime Minister would have us believe. The Governor of the bank, if improperly dismissed, would have to sue the Commonwealth for wrongful dismissal. He would have to face an action in the High Court, with the possibility of the Commonwealth appealing against a decision in his favour, and hampering him in the many different ways that a Government can hamper a man who endeavours to secure justice against it . Those who understand the methods of legal procedure, know that, even if a man recovers damages, with costs, he may occasionally be out of pocket. His costs as between solicitor and client may quite.outweigh the pecuniary recompense he may have received from the Government of the day, although the verdict against the Government may have carried costs with it . The Government are proposing in The Government of the day this respect to place in a deplorable position a man who is supposed to preside over a non-political organization.

If the manager or Governor of this bank were dismissed, and the question had to come before Parliament, we can quite imagine all the "" lobbying"" and other influence that would be brought to bear. The Government will select an able man with a record behind h i m ; and it is in the highest degree improbable that the "" good behaviour"" of this man will ever be challenged, or that the extreme step of dismissing him will be taken. If , however, such a case arose the official has an appeal to the Court, and, though that may prove -costly, we must remember that he is a man in receipt of a handsome salary. The High Court will decide such a case on sworn evidence, such as we here could' not possibly have, unless we called witnesses to the bar of the House. Then, again, if such questions were raised here, the Government would almost surely be backed up by their majority; and there would be all the wrangling and unpleasantness of a discussion of this character. Any Government, no matter of what party, would endure a great deal from an official of this standing rather than dismiss him before the end of his term of office. In ^ ordinary business, 'when an employee' of importance proves unsatisfactory, he is not usually dismissed out of hand, but is given a hint that his resignation would be acceptable. Let us suppose for a moment that the manager of the bank had created disaster by injudicious advances to farmers and others, and that the question of his dismissal on this score was raised in Parliament. We should have those people to whom hp had advanced money claiming that he was just the sort of manager for the place, and there would be influence brought to bear on representatives by constituents in his favour. wisest plan would be to keep the bank entirely free from politics. the door to secret political influence. may take it, I think, that an official of this standing, if he did cause disaster, would be the first to admit his failure and resign. It would be most inadvisable to accept the suggestion of honourable members opposite. They talk a great deal about the Caucus; and if we are so bound as they would make us out to be, they can imagine how we would support the Government in any emergency of the kind. It is the experience that majorities of all parties back up the Government, right or wrong; and, altogether, there would be much less likelihood of political influence under the clause as drawn. Doubtless the clause represents a new departure; but we must remember that the whole Bil l is a new departure. .There is no doubt that the management of this bank should be as free as possible from political influence; but that object is not attained by this clause, which, in fact, introduces influence of the worse kind. The Governor of the bank will be subject to a sort of Star Chamber, or cabal, and the Treasurer will be in a position to become a perfect taskmaster to him. judge of ""good behaviour""? Practically the Treasurer, who may be able to induce his colleagues to dismiss the Governor after a lot of secret work. I feel quite sure that such an official would rather have his affairs ventilated in Parliament than dealt with in such a way. I have not heard from the Prime Minister one reason why there should be a departure from the usual course adopted in the appointment of high public officials such as the Justices, the Auditor-General, or the High Commissioner; and I am satisfied that this clause is ' a beginning of the introduction of that political influence which we all deprecate. The Ministry declare that they wish to remove this bank from politics as far as possible; and yet if clauses 14, 32, and 64 are accepted, the institution cannot possibly escape. If the Bill passes in its present form, political influence must be introduced sooner or later -no t necessarily by this Government, but by some other Government in charge of the affairs of the country. What is a few The years in the history of a bank? I am thinking, not of what may happen within the next six or twelve months, but of what may occur within the next decade, during But this clause will open which a Ministry may find itself in a tight financial corner, and may press the GoverWe nor to do something in its political interest.

It is a very serious matter for the staff. ment, promotion, and dismissal has no limit, subject 'to ;an appeal which the employees will have later on under another Bill. While, as a Democrat, I agreed to the appointment of the Governor of the bank as the Bill provides, I think this power requires modification. Switzerland, which is known as the schoolhouse of Europe, with twenty-six different forms of government, and tenfold that number of what would correspond to our municipal councils, thought it necessary, after a series of experiments extending over many years, to make provisions against nepotism. There two Ministers cannot be related, and the same principle is applied to the various parliamentary officials. In these circumstances, I propose to move That the following new sub-clause be added :placed on the Governor in regard to the"" 2. The Governor shall not appoint as an officer of the bank any relative by birth or conin the bank; but a wise Governor would' nexion by marriage."" I trust that this amendment will be accepted by the Prime Minister. If adopted it will prevent the Governor appointing to a position in the hank any of, his own relatives. It is stated in Vincent's Switzerland that I t is provided by fundamental law that no father and son or son-in-law, no brothers or brothers-in-law, no uncle and nephew, nor even in some cases, more distant relativesshall hold certain offices. The historical reasons for these sentiments are discussed in the chapters on Federal government. given in the book? are proverbial. Many hold that we could have no better system of government than that of an absolute dictatorship, if it were possible to secure for the office a man ofscrupulous honesty and great ability. The trouble is, however, that a dictator, having secured power, usually desires to hand it down to his soil, or to some other relative, so that, in the words of the old boatman of Lake Lucerne, a dictatorship generally becomes an oligarchy, and proves to be for the benefit of only those immediately surrounding a dictator. I shall be satisfied if the Prime Minister will assure me that what I desire to cover by my amendment can be secured under the regulationsreferred to in clause 14. The experienceof the country known as the schoolhouse of Europe, however, is worthy of the study of this young community. The principle that I advocate has been adopted by many of the States of America.

One would hardly imagine that there is any cause to fear that an officer occupying such a prominent position as that which the Governor will fill, and which will be subject to the control of the Government, would descend to anything in the form of nepotism. As to the further point which has been raised, I think that the Prime Minister has been well advised that the power to appoint includes the power to remove, because that is expressly provided for in sub-section 4 of section 33 of the Acts Interpretation Act.

There should be nothing to prevent the Governor or Deputy Governor taking prompt action in ridding the bank of an officer who had proved himself unworthy of confidence. It is satisfactory to find that honourable members are at last realizing that we can secure a service that is worth having only by giving these dual powers to some particular officer. One of the great drawbacks of our service at the present day is the inability of those who know that officers are incompetent to deal with those officers.

In that measure provision can be made for the valuation of securities, which, I think, is advisable. discussing the Bill with the draftsman and the Secretary to the Treasury, I maintained the view that the Auditor-General should not be called on to do this work. There are not many persons who would be qualified to examine all the securities of the bank, and say exactly what they are worth. In good times the securities might be worth twice the amount advanced on them; but in bad times the values would shrink considerably. I think that such a valuation once a year would be ample. think that it will be found necessary to create an independent staff of inspectors. The need for proper inspection, to my mind, shows the unwisdom of having one man only at the head of the bank. To whom is the Chief Inspector to report? If the Governor and he had made unwise advances, on which his inspectors reported adversely, he would not be likely to disclose the reports. When the business of the bank becomes large, its securities will not be held wholly in the head office, but will be distributed through the branches, and one man could not examine them all. With private institutions, when an inspector makes his rounds, he goes first through the accounts of the branch at which he is calling, looks at the transactions for the year, and sees that the securities are present and in order; The Auditor-General but it is impossible to value every property on which money has been advanced in the district, though he goes through tlie books, and obtains a general idea of the bank's prosperity.

The Bill should provide for an inspectorial staff, and W h o will value the securii f the Chief Inspector has anything particular to report in regard to .the securities If it be thought necesof the bank, he should make a confidential report to the Treasurer of the day, as the the Government has not provided in the B ill for any better method.

In special provisions of this Bill are to be applied to the ordinary banks. I gather from the Prime Minister's Interjection that he is contemplating the creation of an inspectorial staff to inspect the whole of the banks in Australia, and their securities. That seems an extraordinary idea, but even if it is proposed, it will not touch the inspection of this institution in regard to the whole of its internal management.

Whatever has happened to other banks may happen to this bank, and we should therefore make our machinery so perfect that that sort of thing at any rate could not occur again. It was only possible through the scheming and fraud of the manager of the bank, and some one working with him, but it did not last very long, and the bank is now closed. Will the Prime Minister see that the audit makes sure that any securities supposed to be in the Commonwealth Bank are really there? £8.20] I am. anxious for full provision for a general inspection in the bank, but am inclined to support the Prime Minister's idea that it would be better to deal with the matter completely in the general banking Bill, and at the same time to apply inspection and safeguards to the private banks to a greater degree than is done at present. The speech of the honourable member for Fremantle is an eloquent tribute to the idea that those banks should be better watched. The financial good name of the Commonwealth is in the hands of the Government of the Commonwealth, and, in the past, too much laxity has been shown by Governments in regard to financial institutions generally. Much of the over-speculation and trouble of the past could have been avoided if Governments had taken a more intense interest in the matter. It is our duty as a Commonwealth Parliament to encourage all legitimate financing and speculation in the Commonwealth, but when it comes to wild-cat schemes and dangerous work of any kind, it reflects on the Commonwealth generally. I trust that, in the general measure foreshadowed, the Prime Minister will deal as drastically as possible with any private institutions that depart from strictly honourable methods. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.22]. auditorial inspection, but, as 'the Prime Minister truly said, that does not include anything like a valuation of securities. It includes merely an examination of the books, and of the vouchers. It has never been held to be part of the duty of auditors to have a valuation, or even an inspection of the securities, or the general mode of investing money. In the circumstances of this bank, there ought to be something more than the audit which is proposed. There ought to be an inspection by an officer who is not responsible solely to the Governor of the bank, but whose duty it would be to make a report from time to time to the Treasurer, and through the Treasurer to the House, not, of course, as to the value of each individual security, but as to any fact into which he was directed by the Treasurer to inquire, or which came under his notice in the ordinary course of general inspection, and which he would think desirable to bring before the Treasurer and the House. The Treasurer seems to think it would be sufficient if provision were made in the general banking Bill to cover the case, but I would remind him that proprietary banks are under an obligation to their shareholders to have some general inspection of the securities, which the shareholders, through the directors, are always careful to see enforced. Here, there is no such obligation. T submit that, especially since the Committee in its wisdom has adopted the principle of government by one man, it would be a great additional source of safety to have an officer quite independent of the bank, and of the Governor of the bank, whose duty i l would be to report from time to time with regard to matters such as I have mentioned. point an independent inspector to act as a sort of check upon the Governor would be a roundabout way of undoing what we have done in deciding absolutely to trust the Governor. We must trust him. The Government could not properly appoint inspectors responsible to it as a check on him. The best thing to do is to permit the Auditor-General, when conducting his audit, to engage any duly accredited public valuer to inspect the securities.

We as a House cannot go into the details of inspectorial reports, but must depend on some one else, who must be absolutely independent. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that it would be undesirable for the Government to appoint a special inspector to go into matters of this kind, but, then, no one has made such a proposal. I understood the Prime Minister to meet the difficulties pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition by admitting that it was desirable to have somebody to do something more than give an assurance as to the ""correctness"" of the figures in the balance-sheet. valuation of the securities is not the only difficulty that occurs in a balance-sheet. It is very easy for the manager of a company who wishes to show a good result to put into his balance-sheet as assets worthless advances made in the past. He might say, "" I am more sanguine than most people, ancl believe that to be a good debt,"" and so might easily put in ^100,000 worth of advances, which had ""gone to seed,"" as if they were still good assets. Under this provision the Auditor-General would not have power to look into questions of that sort. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, and as the next clause provides, he will merely give an assurance of the "" correctness "" or incorrectness affairs of the bank shall be subject to inshould like to know from the Prime Minisspection and audit."" more than audit. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That means inspection for the purposes of audit. give the Auditor-General power to look into the value of the assets, consisting of past advances, where there is a personal element. vides that all advances made by the bank on real property shall be assured by a seal, but it also gives the Governor of the bank power to make advances by parol, which means without a seal, and may be on personal property. It might be on what is called a contingent remainder, or on expectations in an estate. The bank Governor might from time to time include theseamong his assets as expectations which he was justified in valuing at 20s. in the j £ i The Auditor-General would not under a mere power to check "" correctness "" criticise a matter of that sort. If the asset was put in the balance-sheet as a good asset, he would say, "" That is correct, so far as the figures are concerned."" If , however, the Prime Minister can see his way, apart from the general banking Bill, to give in this measure an extended power to the Auditor General by the use of a single word, so as to allow him to certify to the correctness "" and sufficiency,"" or something of that sort, of the securities shown in the balance sheet, he would invest the Auditor-General with an extended jurisdiction, and give him the power which an ordinary auditor has with regard to a company. says that the auditor of an ordinary company confines his attention to the mere correctness or incorrectness of the figures is quite wrong. I have known auditors over and over again to find fault with certain assets being taken as good where it was quite evident that the security, even of a personal 1 character, had failed, and the security itself had gone to seed. It would be wrong to suppose that an ordinary auditor has no more power than has the Auditor-General of a State, and, therefore, there would be nothing inconsistent in adding words so as to extend the jurisdiction of the Auditor General, and to give him as much power as has an ordinary auditor in going through the balance-sheet of an ordinary company. Inspection covers ter whether it is to be understood that clause 16 gives the Governor the necessary power to appoint inspectors such as are ordinarily associated with a bank, whilst this clause endeavours to cover what theGovernor has done, to our satisfaction. This clause is inadequate. While the bank is in its initial stages it might be possible for the Auditor-General to make an inspection and report, and that report might be satisfactory, so far as it went, as to the correctness of the figures submitted to him ;but we should require to know when the report came before us that the assets had been properly valued, and that the values, were correctly represented by tlie figures.",60,Wynne Th E Honourable Ciple The Governor And Deputy Go

My contention is that it should be of general application. This clause deals with something entirely separate from the actual audit. It is a very difficult matter to allow another officer of superior powers to enter the bank and value the securities against which money has been advanced by officers occupying responsible positions in the institution. The honourable member for Macquarie put his finger on the weak point of this proposal when he pointed but that it would be very dangerous to put behind the men intrusted with the whole business of the bank, and in whose honour, experience, and integrity, so far as these securities are concerned, we are bound to have confidence, another public officer with the right to intervene and to prevent business being carried on as the responsible officers of the bank desired.

The balance-sheet, a copy of which is attached, was laid before the general meeting of shareholders of the bank on the 18th instant; it ex' hibits a f u l l and correct statement of the bank's affairs, as shown by the books and documents. These bave been f u l ly examined by the officer appointed for the purpose and by myself. The usual certificate from the bank's solicitors was seen by me, certifying that all securities at head office had been examined and found in order. Then follows a series of headings relating to bills payable to the Government of Queensland, coin in hand at head office, Treasury notes, Government stocks, bills discounted, cheque books, duty stamps and other stamp forms; and also to branches, the London office, the general business of the bank, deposits, realization of securities, and profit and loss. It seems to me that others besides the general manager, the chairman, and auditors, who sign the Queensland National Bank balance-sheet, are responsible for the certificates regarding securities. It would be no reflection on the Governor of the bank if the Auditor-General appointed The Prime Minister cannot some officer whose duty it was, as soon as the operations of the bank became sufficientlylarge to require his services, to examine the books and documents. I do not suppose that an officer of the Auditor-Gene ral could go into all the branches of the Commonwealth Bank of the future and test the value placed on certain securities: That is a work which I do not think any existing bank would be able to undertake. At present I imagine that the word of the branch managers has to be taken. in time to come, when the Commonwealth Bank has a large commercial business, it will be necessary to appoint inspectors. my opinion, the whole trouble arises from the draftsman having inserted one word too much, namely, the word "" inspection."" If the clause simply provided that the affairs of the bank should be subject to an audit by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, that would have been quite sufficient. I take it that the Governor of the bank will be a competent man, and that what suffices for shareholders in private banking institutions should suffice in the case of the Commonwealth Bank.

I do not agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that it would be desirable to eliminate the word ""inspection,"" because, I take it, inspection is necessary to the audit. The power of inspection is indispensable, in order that the Auditor-General may proceed with his auditing work, and it is only intended in that sense. North Sydney seems to assume that the word "" inspection "" means inspection of the securities, but that is not so, and the hondo would be to certify as to the correctorable member for Capricornia threw a useful light on the question of auditing by quoting from the report of the Auditor General of Queensland on the Queensland National Bank. The balance-sheet of a bank is totally different from the ordinary statements concerning the work of a Government Department. It contains a number of algebraical *'s, and, as to the value whicli they represent, opinions d ffer. The question is whether the Auditor General's powers are sufficient to enable him to do in respect of the Commonwealth Bank what an ordinary auditor does in respect of a public company, or other instituAuditor-General now has to send his offition of the kind. I agree with the honourable member, for Macquarie that we might well leave it to the Governor of the bank to appoint a staff for the ordinary work of --inspection. Each large bank has a small army of inspectors and sub-inspectors, who constantly move about the country examining the securities on which advances are made. Under the clause as it stands, the Governor of the bank, being desirous to produce a good balance-sheet, and being 'unchecked by a board of directors or commissioners, might put among his assets securities which a competent critic would regard as doubtful or bad, because, as the honourable member for Coolgardie ha? pointed out, the bank may make advances on personal security, such as the expectation in an estate, or a bill, and the powers of the Auditor-General might not enable him to estimate the correctness of the figures supplied. While the balance-sheet might ^£2.500,000, at least ^100,000 represent advances which had, popularly speaking, ""gone to seed,"" and this Mr Bruce Smith the Auditor-General might not have power to discover.

At present, a private bank will advance money on a pastoral property, on meat works, or on a sugar refinery ; and if the owner is unable to meet his obligations, it is not unusual for it to foreclose, turn him out, and run the business in its own interests. The pastoral diiecrory shows that many of the pastoral properties of Australia are in the hands of banks, having been acquired by them by foreclosure. I believe this is one of the Bills which, when passed, will have to be submitted to the High Court to see whether it is in our power as a Commonwealth to carry on a business. At the present time we believe it is not in our power, for instance, to carry on a sugar refinery, or a pastor.al property, or meat-preserving works. Yet under this clause the Commonwealth Bankwill have power to lend money on any of those concerns, step in, take over the business, and run it on behalf of the Commonwealth.

It might need improving within ancl without before it became valuable; and ithe bank ought to have power, under proper supervision, to make it valuable, and await the opportunity to dispose of it. It is not the desire of the Government to encourage the obtaining of property of any kind in this way for trading purposes. The clause is designed to protect the interests of the bank, and to enable it to get rid of property in its hands at the most profitable time and at the most convenient opportunity.

Clauses 28 and 29 agreed to. Clause 30 (Disposal of profits). doubt very much the wisdom of compelling the bank to divide its profits in the way for which this clause provides. It would be much wiser from the point of view of the bank to allow the Governor to determine what proportion of the profits should from time to time be allocated to the bank reserve fund and the redemption fund mentioned in this clause. Let him have the two funds if honourable members like, but give him power to determine how much shall be paid into the reserve fund and how much into the redemption fund every year. It is conceivable that the Governor may be able from time to time to see sufficiently far ahead as to make him consider it advisable to use the whole of his profits, particularly in the early stages of the bank's career, in strengthening the reserve fund, and I doubt very much the wisdom of compelling him to divide the profits in the way proposed. course to adopt. member for Richmond is worthy of consideration. I think it would be wise to so amend the clause as to provide that not less than one-half of the net profits shall be placed to the credit of the bank's reserve existence it might be considered desirable to apply the whole of the profits to the building up of such a fund, and if my suggestion were adopted it would give'the GoA property vernor a discretionary power. If it is desired to make this a strong bank, it will be necessary to build up a big reserve fund.

I prefer that the bank should begin operations on the principle that we have set forth. The clause provides that one-half of the net profits of the bank shall be paid to a reserve fund, and I think that we are entitled to the remaining half for other purposes. No demand will be made on the bank in respect of the payment of dividends to shareholders, although, of course, it will have to pay interest on the debentures issued. The bank will have the advantage of having the Government account, and, after all, there is very little difference beTreasurer should lay on the table any retween the clause as it stands and the clause as proposed to be amended.

It is essential that the public mind should be absolutely relieved of any fear that the Government are going, by means of this power, in respect of rules, to embarrass the Governor of the bank. I, therefore, feel that the best way to meet the charge that this is going to be a political institution, and that the Governor can be harassed and embarrassed by the acts of the Treasurer, is for me to say that any memoranda in the shape of a proposed rule sent to me, and of which I do not approve, shall be laid on the table of the House or published in the Government Gazette.

The complaint made by the Opposition is that political influence may be introduced by the action of the Treasurer in negativing a proposed rule; and so far as that is concerned, 1 am quite prepared to meet the wishes of my honourable friends. --The principal banks carrying on business in Australia, as well as all our large insurance companies, have formed superannuation funds for the benefit of their employees. Out of their profits a certain percentage is set aside each year towards the establishment of such funds. The employees also contribute a certain amount, with the result that, after service extending over a' certain number of years, they are entitled to receive pensions. We might add to this clause the power to make rules to provide for the establishment of a superannuation fund. an amendment embodying the honourable member's suggestion. already determined how the profits of the bank shall be dealt with.

All this can be done by regulation. fit of the bank officers to have the two funds in one. as is the case in many of the hanking institutions to-day -to provide their own guarantee fund. whole of the guarantee fund, but they will also contribute to the superannuation fund. If the two are run together it will mean a smaller charge on the officers. The bank with which I was connected for a number of years was worked in the way I suggest, and the small demand on the funds in case of defalcation was remarkable, with the result that the pensions were considerably larger. If the officers have to guarantee their fidelity to the. bank by means of a separate fund it will mean a double charge on many of them. I suppose that 999 out of every 1,000 officers are absolutely honest; and why should the honest be penalized by providing a special guarantee to meet the dishonesty of the one? I think that if the Prime Minister will favourably consider my suggestion he will be conferring a great benefit on the officers. ister and Treasurer) [9.47] -I do not desire to mix up the two funds, because I consider that such a step would be unwise. I should now like to suggest that the new proposal be called sub-clause c.

The whole credit of the Commonwealth is behind the bank, which will draw on that credit according to its needs. Clause 34 provides that the bank may invest any money held by it in any Government security approved by the Treasurer. As the bank starts with an the credit of the Commonwealth behind it, what is it going to gain by purchasing Government securities, whether approved of by the Treasurer or not ? ister ancl Treasurer) [9.51] -Claus e 33 means exactly what it says, namely, that the Commonwealth shall be responsible for the payment of all moneys due by the . bank. bank. credit! the bank, the Commonwealth's public funds will be available to satisfy every creditor. The second paragraph of the clause met with some criticism on the. second reading, though we bear nothing of it on the present occasion. That paragraph provides that if any person is aggrieved by the bank he is not to be allowed to sue the Commonwealth in the first instance. He must sue the bank, ancl, if tlie bank does not satisfy the claim, then the Commonwealth comes in. Now, the next clause serves to cover the retreat-or , shall I say-the abandon. ment of an earlier attack. The honourable member for Ballarat desires to know I merely point out the position. we come to deal with the next clause. I think this a wise provision; but if it is in any way embarrassing to the Governor. I shall' be glad to receive suggestions for its amendment. Prime Minister apparently took it for granted that there would be no criticism in regard to this extraordinary and self-contradictory clause. I am not clear as to what the clause means, although the Prime Minister has told us with great confidence that it means what it says. The extraordinary feature is that, while the Commonwealth is to be "" responsible"" for the 'payment of all moneys due by the bankwhile this placard is displayed to the creditors of the institution-n o creditor is free to sue the Commonwealth for the recovery of his debt!

I presume that the result is n i l ; but it is more or less our duty to point out that the clause is purely a placard for those who may have dealings with the bank. The Prime Minister tells us that it is to prevent creditors suing the Commonwealth in the first instance; but what is the meaning of ' ' first instance ' ' ? Will the clause entitle creditors, at any stage, to sue the Commonwealth ?

IRVINE -And the limitation of the limitation shows that the limitation itself limit! Mr VV. H . IRVINE -No. but that the limitation itself wipes out clause 7. A reasonable interpretation, reading this clause with clause 7, is that none of the powers of clause 7 can be exercised, except that of making advances to customers, unless the power is prescribed by special regulation.

That includes lending money on land and on personal security, and investing it in Government securities. Lending money"" on any security you choose is included in the genera] business of banking. to lend money on land? Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not know any Australian bank that has not that right; though, under the laws of Canada, and some other countries, banks are expressly prohibited from lending money on the security of land. banking is strictly the discounting of commercial bills; but the lending of money on mortgage has, in Australia, become so mixed up with banking business, that I think the expression "" general business of banking "" will undoubtedly cover the lending of money on landed security. But the conferring on the bank, by clause 7, of certain specified powers, may impliedly exclude other powers. It is true that, under clause 34, the bank may invest money "" in any other prescribed manner "" ; but the effect of clause 34 is that, before the bank can start its operations, the Governor in Council must make regulations repeating the provisions of clause 7. ister and Treasurer) [ro.3] I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his criticism. The intention of clause 34 is that, when the Governor of the bank' desires to invest money in any Government security, or on loan on the security of land, that is for general loan purposes, as an investment to earn interest, or in any other prescribed manner, he shall do so only with the consent of the Treasurer; because it is thought that such investments should not be greatly encouraged, and should be made only with the cognisance of the Treasurer. The honourable member, with his legal acumen and knowledge, has pointed out that, in seeking to place restrictions on the Governor in regard to these three kinds of investments, we may have prevented him from exercising the powers conferred by clause 7, unless they are given to him by regulation. That was not intended. It was not our wish to impair clause 7. I think that this provision will have to be re-drafted, and as it is not proposed to go further to-night, I propose now to move the Chairman out of the chair. Mr W. H .
