DEAT H OF ME. WILLIAM Ivir. MENZIES (Kooyong Prime Minister) Mr Speaker, it is my very sad duty to refer to the death of one of our colleagues and friends in this House, Mr William Davies. He was born at Abertillery, in South Wales, and he died on the 17th February of this year, after a long period of illness, at the age of 73 years. Our late friend came to Australia at an early age and engaged in coal mining on the south coast of New South Wales. Later he was, as a man of active mind, prominently identified throughout that area with industrial matters relating to coal-mining, and he was a inember of the Federal Coal Board Tribunal. Towards the end of World WarI . , Mr preacher of the Methodist Church there, Davies exhibited an interest in State politics, and he became the State member for Wollongong, in New South. Wales, in 1917. In 1920 lie was returned for the Wollondilly seat, which he held until 1927. Wollongong in 1927. He then held the Illawarra seat from 1930 to 1941, and the seat of Wollongong-Kembla from 1941 to 1949. Mr Davies was Minister for Education in two New South Wales governments. In 1949, he resigned from the New South Wales Parliament, and was elected to this Parliament as member for the division of Cunningham, which he held until his death. Mr Davies is survived by a widow, a son and a daughter. I think the House would like me to say to them that although his parliamentary service was long, his term in this House was relatively, and unhappily, short. All of us who were his contemporaries in this House came to know him and to enjoy a deep respect and affection for him. Some of us, in the course of our political life, get into the headlines and into controversies of great or small moment. It is not given to every one to enjoy a natural and simple respect on both sides of the Housea respect for a man's It -W character and innate high quality. I should like our late friend's widow and children to know that he has left behind him in this House a fragrant memory. He enjoyed the respect and affection of his colleagues. We shall long remember Mr Davies, and we join with his widow and children in mourning him. I move That the House expresses its deep regret at tlie death of Mr William Davies, who was at tlie time of his death a member of this House for the Division of Cuiiniiighan), places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Opposition) I second the motion which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has moved in such sympathetic terms. I wish to say something more about the career of our late colleague and comrade. It was an extraordinary career when one looks back on it. As the Prime Minister has said, the late honourable member was born in South Wales. He was a lay and he became an employee in the mining industry in Wales. With his wife and two children, he came to Australia in 1912 and worked in the Coalcliff colliery in southern New South Wales until 1917. He was returned again for He was actually appointed a member of the Federal Coal Tribunal for a short time and then, in 1917, he was elected to the Parliament of New South Wales. From that date, until his lamented death, he was continuously a member of the State or Federal Parliament; that is, a period of 39 years' continuous service to the people, a very remarkable record. Those of us who knew him during the earlier portion of that long career remember him as a great orator espousing the cause of theminers and the trade unions associated with the mining industry. He was a fiery speaker, like so many of the great speakers who have come to this country from Wales and who have been associated with the coal industry. During that long career he saw his own district, the WoUongong district,, emerge from an area that was partly rural into one of the greatest industrial centres of Australia and, indeed, the southern hemisphere. He was a very loyal colleague, Mr Speaker. He served thp. trade",6,Setup

I was associated Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, which with him in many industrial troubles were his blueprint for the future, and he before ever he entered the New South lived to see it become a reality and even Wales Parliament.

4,Mr Haylen (Parkes),"I beg a wordwhich were never obtruded. He believed in them himself. It was too late in the clay to try to convince other people, but that dignity of his won more converts to his point of view than a thousand rugged sermons. In his way lie was an inspiration in his gentleness and his kindliness. He had a very rugged life, lived in South Wales and on the south coast of New South Wales, in the torrid days of coal-mining, out of which lie developed a gentleness and a love of reading and of literature. I knew him so well on the literary side. He was a man who spent his time, when lie was laid aside by sickness, reading the poets, whom he appreciated as most Welshmen do with their love of music and verse. The best epitaph that I can think of to give lum is something from his own favourite poet, Henley, who saidSo be my My task accomplished and the long day done, My wages Some late add my tribute to the memory of our late colleague, Mr Davies. PerhapsI knew him as long as, or longer than, most honourable members because for a continuous period of almost 40 years, first as a inember of the State Parliament, and then as a member of this Parliament, he represented the district in which I was born and reared. I recall that it was not long after he arrived in the south coast district that he began to make his mark, especially in coal-mining circles. In improved compensation laws for disabled his early days in Wales lie had worked in the coal mines, and because of the hardships that he endured, and because of an accident in which he suffered injury and which, he said, contributed to his infirmity in recent years, he was inspired to improve the lot of his fellow coal-miners. He took pride in the fact that when he was younger he burned the midnight oil while he studied to improve his mind, and then rose in the early hours of the morning to go to his work in the mine. Working conditions then wore not anything like they are now. The miners had to journey long distances up the mountain sides to reach the pit top, and then had to walk for miles in a stooped position through low-roofed tunnels. Coal mines now are equipped with modern facilities for ventilation and transport, and also for effecting rescues after an accident. It is owing to the efforts of men such as the late honourable member for Cunningham and his colleagues on the coal-fields that those improved conditions have been achieved. In his early years in this, his adopted eountry, he took an active part in the work of the coal-miners' organizations and, as the Prime Minister said, he was a meniber of the Federal Coal Board Tribunal. Although he could take a militant stand when circumstances warranted, Mr Davies always believed in the constitutional approach .and the appeal to reason. He considered that industrial disputes should be settled, if possible, by the appropriate tribunals, and that working conditions should be improved by passing! parliamentary action. As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) pointed taken, and in my heart out, there were times when he was prelark singing, pared to take his courage in his hands, and try to make reason prevail even at the risk of incurring the hostility of the impetuous section who wished to precipitate trouble which could have far-reaching consequences. Having persuaded the members of his organization to follow a proper course he would fight with all his power to have their grievances redressed by the properly constituted authority. He made his mark also in the parliamentary sphere. Many reforms, such as the coal-miners' pensions fund and the mine workers and other sections of the community, were the result of efforts by Mr Davies and his colleagues in the State sphere. As the leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) pointed out, he proved himself an able administrator in the capacity of Minister for Education in New South Wales during, two periods, the first in 1927 for a short time and the second from 1930 to 1932. He was particularly interested in technical education, and I recall an occasion in 1927 when I waited upon him as a member, of a deputation seeking the establishment of a technical high school in Sydney. Mr Davies readily acceded to the request of the deputation, and gave instructions for the",12,Davies M P

It is only within recent years that that technical high school has been established. He was always a champion for progress in his own district and did everything possible to have public works established. The inner harbour at Port Kembla is a monument to his persistent and effective representations. encouragement to private enterprise, and the great industrial concerns such as the steel works and other major industrial undertakings in the Wollongong area, which have contributed so much to the prosperity of that district and the Commonwealth, are further evidence of his untiring efforts on behalf of the people and of industry. Because of that, he showed a broad tolerance in his approach to all matters and held the respect of all sections of the community, irrespective of class or creed. He always stood loyally and staunchly for the causes that he espoused. He seemed to have an uncanny capacity to weather the storms and crises through which the Labour movement passed during the 40 years or so that he was a parliamentarian. To my mind, our late friend was a service which contributed to the success of model parliamentarian, particularly as, so his representation of the people of the to speak, a local member.

"" He said, "" No. I like to see all these people myself, so that I can understand their problems and get a proper grip of them. I want to do the best I can on their behalf"". I think it was that quality, above all, that endeared him to all the people whom he represented on the south coast, where the name of Bill Davies was a household word. I have been proud indeed to have Bill Davies as a friend and a colleague, both in the He also gave every district where we lived and carried on our activities and in the parliamentary sphere. He was at all times willing and anxious to give helpful advice, especially to younger members of the community, as well as to younger members of the Parliament. To his widow and family, I extend my deepest sympathy. I knew them personally. Most honourable members have not had the honour of knowing Mrs. Davies personally, because during recent year3 she has been suffering from a grave disability which has precluded her from getting about and froni coming to Canberra.
