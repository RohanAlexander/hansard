Thursday, 13 August 2009 ----Chemotherapy Medication Funding electorate and the wider community about the Rudd government’s attitude towards chemotherapy. As we know, Labor is cutting $105 million from chemotherapy medication. Cancer patients, current and future, will pay a hefty price for the government’s slash-and-burn approach which shows little understanding and empathy to those facing their darkest hours. The government says it will no longer foot the bill for leftover chemotherapy drugs that have not been used by the patient during treatment-what it calls ‘wastage’. How compassionate, from a government completely spun-out on health spin. I must agree with my colleague Senator Mathias Cormann that the ‘wastage’ label is an ‘inaccurate and baseless slur against healthcare professionals across Australia’. What Mr Rudd and Ms Roxon fail to realise is that treatment of this kind is highly individualised. These drugs are tailored to each patient’s makeup, fluctuating weight, height, illness and dosages. From time to time a portion of a vial may be left unused, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration rules stipulate that unused portions must be discarded. That makes sense because these drugs are highly toxic and cannot be used to treat anyone else. While Minister Roxon insists that ‘patient safety and access to chemotherapy medications will not be compromised by this measure’, there is little doubt that the changes will impact on operations and dispensing of lifesaving pharmaceuticals. It shows the government lacks an understanding of the additional stress that patients and their families suffer. It is undeserved. The question is: who will be left with the tab? It will be either the patient or the pharmacist. If the cost is left to the patient, many individuals will choose to go through the already overloaded public health system. Why should we ask a patient to purchase their own chemotherapy drugs? Should we now ask them to reschedule their treatment to a day that another cancer patient is receiving the same drug, to limit wastage? Should we make the patient suffer even more than they already have to? The government clearly has no idea, or simply does not care about the stress that it could potentially place on patients and their families, which may adversely affect their ability to recover. Could the government consider approaching the major pharmaceutical companies to alter the sizes of the vials in order to minimise wastage? Possibly. But, despite coalition persistence, it is the unfortunate-but unsurprising-reality that the government only recently started to consult with patient groups and healthcare professionals and are now delaying the implementation of the changes until 1 September this year. Penalising patients and those involved in delivering these vital services is not the answer. The uncertainty and fear a person faces when diagnosed with cancer should not be exacerbated by a government who say they are committed to fixing the health system. How can the government put a dollar amount on a person’s life? MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Adjournment Fresh In The Minds Of Many Australians And
225,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,,128,Constituency Statements
226,Mr Randall (Canning) (9.30 Am),"TodayI wish to reiterate the grave concerns of myIsaacs Electorate: Women’s Health Forum in my electorate. The forum was conducted with the excellent assistance of the Jean Hailes Foundation for Women’s Health. The forum was designed to raise awareness of the federal government’s review of the National Women’s Health Policy and to seek the contribution of local women on the content of the policy. There has been a National Women’s Health Policy for approximately 20 years. Women and some men in our community were very keen to contribute their ideas on the policy review and on issues relevant to women’s health in the 21st century. I specifically invited women living in the more culturally diverse areas of my electorate, as I believe that some women from migrant communities have not had sufficient opportunity to contribute to public policy. The forum was conducted in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere which encouraged participation. A major benefit of the forum was the interaction of women from different cultural backgrounds, expressing and sharing their views with each other and with professionals from local health organisations. I was very fortunate to have the assistance of the Jean Hailes Foundation for Women’s Health in facilitating and presenting the principal session of the forum. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Helena Teede, Director of Research, Jean Hailes Foundation and head of the diabetes unit at Southern Health, and Janet Michelmore AO, Director of The Jean Hailes Foundation, for their assistance and contribution. I would also like to thank Tricia Elliott, Chief Executive Officer of Women’s Health in the South-East, and Councillor Pinar Yesil, Mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong, for their wonderful and in some instances moving contributions to the forum. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with them. This forum is one of two health forums I have held this year. Earlier in the year I conducted a similar forum on men’s health. Both forums were very well attended and very well received. The eagerness of people in our community to contribute to policy issues on health reflects the need for the health system to be reviewed and brought into the 21st century. It is notable that at both forums very many people spoke about the importance of relationships with doctors, particularly building a strong relationship with a general practitioner. There was a real recognition of the role played by GPs and community health centres in preventative health, which of course is one of the focuses of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report. The government is investing heavily in fixing the problems in our health system and, as a member of this parliament, I am committed to ensuring that the reform of the health system meets the needs of all Australians. I am encouraged that so many people in our community want to contribute to the process of health reform. I was encouraged by the way in which so many people attended both the forum on women’s health and the forum on men’s health and participated at those forums. I will encourage people in our community to contribute to the process that the government has embarked on of reforming the health system. Telstra Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.36 am)-Bank bashing has been a time-honoured and often justified tradition in this place, but every now and again the banks get it right. We have recently seen major banks either removing or reducing overdraft charges. There are still many areas in MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Constituency Statements
227,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (9.33 Am),"Two weeks ago I conducted a women’s health forumwhich banks can reduce fees and would attract new clients and help keep existing ones. This improved business practice would benefit the shareholders and offset the loss of fees. However, there is one company which continues to make life difficult for many of its customers, and that is Telstra. I have had quite a few complaints from my constituents about the new penalty for those Telstra customers who have had the temerity to expect that they should receive a bill and be permitted to pay it in person. One constituent enunciated the general concerns very well. He does not own a computer and even if he did he does not want to give his personal financial details to a system which is vulnerable to hacking, identity theft and other privacy issues. He says he does not trust the internet and should not be forced to do business online. He is absolutely right. This is cost shifting at its most cynical. There is also the simple fact that people stick their bills on fridges as a reminder to pay their account and, afterwards, as a record of payment. Business related letters, many of them bills, also account for about 4.2 billion of the 5.6 billion mail items carried in 2007-08 by Australia Post. So any reduction in postage accounts will impact on Australia Post and drive up the cost of postage. A far bigger issue has been raised by former New South Wales Auditor-General, Tony Harris, in the Financial Review of 4 August. He said that such a penalty may be unlawful under the Currency Act. He adds: Telstra and others must believe it is legal to penalise cash customers. This is a brave interpretation of the law. This is a grey area and needs clarifying immediately. Tony Harris puts the vital question: Who can allow or stop companies from levying these fees? The answer, of course, is the Treasurer, who is not the slightest bit interested in protecting the rights of Australians to pay bills legally without penalties. Harris finishes: Perhaps Swan and his officers don’t care. But consumers should. Will the Treasurer sit idly by and let Telstra rip people off or will he actually start doing his job? Defence: 1st Brigade Corporal Mathew Hopkins federal member for Solomon when I attended the parade on 8 August in Darwin to welcome home the 1st Brigade. I was speaking to Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston the other night at dinner about how proud I was as the local member to have these troops coming home. I was joined on the day by the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, the Hon. Greg Combet. I was also joined by Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, Chief of Army, and Brigadier Michael Krause, Commander, 1st Brigade. I know how proud the Brigadier is of his 1st Brigade troops. There were 1,200 troops who arrived home, and the responsibilities that they had in Afghanistan, Iraq and Timor included work in the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force, the Special Operations Task Group, Force Communications Unit 1, the Australian Security Detachment and the Timor-Leste Battle Group. All these people have contributed in a fine way to the efforts in these three areas of concern to our country and in our support to the coalition forces in these areas. There was a big crowd on hand. A lot of local people turned out to thank the troops for their efforts. One person who was not there, and who I would like to pay special tribute to this MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Constituency Statements
228,Mr Hale (Solomon) (9.39 Am),"I rise today to talk about the great honour I felt as themorning, was Corporal Hopkins. Corporal Mathew Hopkins was killed during contact between the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force and Afghanistan’s national army personnel and Taliban insurgents approximately 12 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt, in Oruzgan province, Afghanistan. That was on Monday, 16 March 2009. To mark the loss of Corporal Hopkins, a riderless horse was part of the parade, in the spirit of an ancient tradition. Saxon people used to bury a great warrior’s horse with him so that he could serve him in the afterlife. This practice was continued in some European countries until the late 18th century. In modern times, custom has been kinder to the horse and it has been led along as part of the funeral procession, with the soldier’s boots reversed as a sign of respect. Corporal Hopkins was 21 years of age and was married with a young son. He is survived by his wife, Victoria, and son, Alexander-who were both there on the day-and by his mother, Bronwyn; father, Ricky; and brother, Corey. It was a tribute to him. Unfortunately, he was not there but he was the hero of this parade. It drove home to all of us the dangerous work that our troops are doing overseas. The 1st Brigade are an institution, a courageous institution, in my electorate. They are skilful and they always see the bigger picture. Victory in the Pacific Day Pacific Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, 15 August. The day commemorates Japan’s acceptance of the allied demand for unconditional surrender in 1945. For Australians, Victory in the Pacific Day, or VP Day, meant that World War II was finally over. From historical accounts, it really was a celebration after six long years of war. Australia woke to find a world at peace. There was singing and dancing in the streets across the country. In Sydney, shredded paper rained down from office windows on the crowds and motor traffic came to a halt, with trams carrying revellers clinging to the sides and perched on the roofs. On Thursday, 16 August 1945, there was a more formal VP thanksgiving ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. A large crowd gathered to watch the march of ex-servicemen and to respect the fallen with the traditional minute’s silence. A fly-past of Australian fighters and Dutch bombers, based at Fairbairn, completed the ceremony. TodayI ask all Australians to pause on Saturday for a few moments to remember those Australians who gave their lives to help achieve the peace that VP Day stands for. Their past sacrifice must never be forgotten. On VP Day it is also important to honour those veterans who returned to enjoy the peace that they had helped deliver to all Australians. According to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs annual report, there are 121,000 surviving World War II veterans. Two weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting one of these veterans, who witnessed first hand the formal surrender of the Japanese on the US Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Retired Petty Officer Bill Hill is a member of the Kurrajong-Colo RSL in the Hawkesbury. Bill served six years in the Australian Navy and was also seconded to the Royal Navy for two of those six years. In 1945 Bill served on HMAS Nizam, an N-class destroyer carrying out submarine detection in the Pacific Ocean with the United States 5th Fleet. Their mission was to protect the US aircraft carriers from the submarine attack. Bill recounted: Our task on the day of the surrender was to screen the US Missouri for submarines as it went into the bay for the signing. I stood on the deck of the destroyer and had a wonderful view of the whole ceremony on the US Missouri. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Constituency Statements

Bill witnessed history in the making. He did not watch it on the TV or the internet; he was actually there. Bill finally got back to Australia in early 1946, after spending time in the Pacific picking up Japanese troops from the surrounding islands. I thank Bill and the many other Australians for their service to our country. They must not be forgotten as we approach Victory in the Pacific Day. Lowe Electorate: Vocational Education and Training ment of three students from my electorate of Lowe who have been awarded the Australian Vocational Student Prize. I extend my congratulations to Nathan Sullivan from St Patrick’s College, Strathfield, Stephanie Madonis from Santa Sabina College, Strathfield, and Stella Hackett from OTEN, Strathfield, who were among only 113 students statewide to receive the award. Each student has demonstrated great skill and dedication in their respective vocational course. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Australian Vocational Student Prize, as you know, was introduced to recognise high-achieving year 12 students who undertook vocational education and training while completing their higher school certificate. All prize winners receive $2,000 and a certificate for their fine efforts. Two weeks ago, at my electorate office in Burwood, I had the pleasure of meeting Nathan Sullivan. Nathan demonstrated high-level skills and qualities that will serve him well as he pursues his career as an electrician. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure, like me, you are aware of the immense value of skilled tradesmen and tradeswomen and the chronic shortages we are currently experiencing in our country. As you know, the Rudd government will provide $2.5 billion in federal funding over 10 years to develop state-of-the-art trade training centres in secondary schools across Australia. The centres will encourage students like Nathan to undertake vocational training in areas of skills shortages and emerging industries. As I previously mentioned in this place, I am extremely pleased that Lowe will open its very own trade training centre in Burwood. Local secondary schools will now have increased access to high-quality skills training facilities, made possible by $11 million in grants for inner west schools under the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. In addition to the trade training centres, the Rudd government has also introduced several measures to support apprentices and their employers, including the apprentice wage top-up, apprenticeship training vouchers, Commonwealth trade learning scholarships, the Tools for Your Trade initiative and the Mid-Career Apprentices scheme. All of these incentives work to improve the skills shortage crisis and simultaneously offer meaningful careers to thousands of Australians. The particular achievements of Nathan, Stephanie and Stella are a testament to their excellent education and to their families. I am delighted that vocational courses offered in my electorate of Lowe are supporting young Australians such as Nathan, Stephanie and Stella to develop valuable skills for their future. Recognising and honouring the outstanding achievements of local students remind us all that there are great rewards for hard work. I commend the minister and the government for recognising and encouraging students like Nathan, Stephanie and Stella in their chosen careers. I know that their success will inspire many others and I wish all of them the very best for the future. Well done, Nathan, Stephanie and Stella. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements
230,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.45 Am),"This morning I speak about the outstanding achieveSwan Electorate: Rotary Clubs service clubs are doing across my electorate. Swan is in Rotary district 9470 and there are clubs in Ascot, Belmont, Bentley-Curtin, Cannington, Como, Mill Point, South PerthBurswood, Victoria Park and Welshpool. Rotary was founded in 1905 by the American Paul Harris. He aimed to enlarge his circle of business and professional acquaintances to provide services to the local community. The spirit of Rotary has extended beyond the organisation, with other small business groups in my electorate giving regularly to charity. However, Rotary itself continues to lead the way and I have been pleased to support the clubs in my electorate. A couple of months ago I attended a meeting of the Cannington branch. The Cannington branch has a prestigious history and received its charter on 25 September 1965. A Cannington member, Dr Push, is the district governor of district 9470 at the current time. The Belmont branch is also very active and held its annual changeover night on 4 July. Like many Rotary clubs, they are constantly looking for members. I will be including a notice in my next community report to encourage all interested and potential members in the community to get involved. I was also pleased to be given the opportunity recently to meet with the Mill Point Rotary Club. Although Rotary concentrates much of its efforts on international development, the district has many good programs running at the moment. One of them, the Pride of Workmanship program, promotes and recognises employees whose high standards of vocational service are worthy of recognition. It gives employers opportunities to recognise worthy efforts that might otherwise go unnoticed. Its ultimate aim is to raise Australia’s standards in the workplace. Another program, the Four-Way Test speech contest, aims to provide year 11 students with the opportunity to compete in public speaking, bring the concepts of the Rotary Four-Way Test to the attention of secondary students and provide Rotary and its Four-Way Test with valuable exposure within the community. All year 10 students in the electorate are eligible to enter the contest by applying through their local Rotary club. Note that by the time students participate in zone and district finals they will be in year 11. Any topic may be chosen but the speech must refer to the Rotary Four-Way Test and centre on any one of the components of the test. Each speech is to be a maximum of six minutes. I have also had involvement with the Ascot Rotary Club and their Grandcare program, which I spoke about in this place last year. It is a fantastic program and benefits many children in the electorate who have been left without parents. I have also been a member of Rotary, at Northbridge Rotary Club during the eighties. I recently attended their 25th anniversary, and it was great to catch up with a lot of old friends and mates whom I had established links with back in the late eighties. I also recently attended the Victory Park changeover night, which I attended with the president, Wilf Hendriks. The night had an Egyptian theme with some belly dancers. They had me get up and take part in a belly-dancing contest, but I have lost 10 kilos and so was not much good at it. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the night. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Constituency Statements
231,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.48 Am),"I want to talk about the good work that many Rotary andMs Rebiya Kadeer zine argued last week when discussing the 80,000 hacking attacks from China on the Melbourne International Film Festival screening of Australian director Jeff Daniels’s documentary 10 Conditions of Love about the exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer. The reaction of Melburnians to this hack attack and to the Chinese consulate’s attempt to close down the Melbourne film festival was to decide that the audience in the Greater Union theatre was too small, with 800 people. No, film-goers would not appease this bullying. As a result, Melbourne Town Hall was booked, where I had the honour of introducing Rebiya Kadeer and where she spoke to more than 2,000 people. So the love of free speech and the love of film are very strong in Melbourne. It is very interesting that one of the premier international film critics, Mr Richard Brody of the New Yorker, surmised that this hack attack was the tacit work of the Chinese government. Brody argued that film festivals around the world should not stand for Beijing’s attempts at censorship. That was the implication of this headline ‘We are all Melburnian’, just as it was with the famous headline in Le Monde after the attacks of September 11, ‘We are all Americans’. Mr Brody said: 10 Conditions of Love… should be instantly programmed for all upcoming film festivals; I’d like to see it included in the Toronto International Film Festival… in its important documentary section; in the New York Film Festival, coming in October; in Venice, Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, Cannes-all the festivals that matter in the industry should show Daniels’s film. Festival directors would thereby affirm their solidarity with the Melbourne Festival and its courageous director, Richard Moore, against government pressure. When Rebiya Kadeer spoke at the National Press Club the Chinese embassy tried to get the Press Club to deny her a platform. Most Australians would have resented the hysterical attacks on Australia and the admission of this non-violent Uighur activist to Australia in the Chinese People’s Daily as yesterday’s Canberra Times reported. I had the honour of being singled out by this kind of prejudice, along with Senator Barnaby Joyce, in another propaganda rag called the Global Times, which comes out of Beijing. China’s attempts to muzzle the Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer during her current Australian visit are, as the Canberra Times noted, hypocrisy. China does not want people to interfere in their affairs but is willing to interfere in ours. On such occasions Australia should firmly and politely remind the Chinese government that freedom of speech and association is an inviolable part of this country’s political fabric. That is what the Australian government has been doing. We are going to keep our nerve with all of these national security issues, keep good relations with China and keep freedom of speech in Australia. Mental Health made by the member for Melbourne Ports as well-very well said-and it is important that we stand up for the rights of individuals in our own country who have come from China as well.

233,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (9.54 Am),"I would like to associate myself with those remarksrather than increasing, and yet the need is certainly prevalent throughout the whole of the country. In fact, what they state is: ‘When this budget is compared to the ’08-’09 budget, it appears that the government is not investing or even interested in mental health services. Last year’s budget was cut by $289.6 million from mental health programs. This year’s budget makes further cuts of $63.1 million over four years.’ I highlight that because I really want to encourage the new government-the Rudd government-to get behind people suffering from mental health issues. There is an incredible amount of stigma attached to patients with mental health issues and they fall across all ages. RecentlyI visited a place in my electorate called Harmony House, which is a halfway house for people with mental health issues. It supports people with mental health issues and tries to help them to integrate back into the community. I saw the people who were there. I saw the things that they were doing, like jewellery lessons, singing lessons and art and craft lessons and learning computer skills and trying to integrate back into the community. I met people who, when they were younger, had had dreams and aspirations to be politicians, to be lawyers, to achieve great things in their life but now they would be happy with a job stacking shelves at Franklins or Woolworths, if they could get one, because of the issues that they now face regarding their mental health. There is a lot of stigma attached to this situation. As a result, a lot of employers will not take on people who have schizophrenia or other mental health issues. It has been indicated by SANE that most people with mental health issues probably receive on average around $20,000 a year. They spend around 10 per cent of their budget on medication. It is an issue that we really need to look at. These people are lost and forgotten souls that are falling through the cracks of our health system. It is most important that we increase funding for mental health patients, support programs such as the ones at Harmony House in Campbelltown and support the many and varied workers who support young people with mental health problems and indeed old people with mental health problems.

It is one of the great joys and pleasures of being a member of parliament, particularly a member of federal parliament, where you get to meet a range of incredible individuals, inspiring people who are determined to make a difference in our community, often in the face of adversity, often when they do not have the personal time, often when they are burdened with so many other responsibilities. But overwhelmingly, these people are driven by a passion to make a difference to their communities. One such person that I have the honour of knowing is Erica Maliki. She is a person that I have come to meet through her assiduous advocacy for those in the Hampton Park area. Erica has been a resident of the Hampton Park area for over 20 years. She has been president of the Cairns Road Recreation Reserve Committee of Management. She is a former president of the committee of the Hampton Park Junior Football Club and one of the community representatives of the Hampton Park Community Renewal project. She is also a small-business ownershe runs an SME upholstery business in Hallam. She was also the main organiser of the recent MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Constituency Statements

You would have seen some of the stories about this in the national media. As a result of this quiet, effective advocacy, traffic lights were installed recently after a series of terribly tragic accidents where we lost five young people-horrific accidents at this intersection. In fact, in her working life she has taken on local apprentices who have not been able to find work due to the global financial crisis, particularly through the VCAL placements. One is an apprentice who is going to continue on from Hampton Park Secondary College, which Erica has a bit to do with. Incredibly, she achieves all of these things as the proud mother of six children. Erica is phenomenal in terms of the way she can balance her work and family life and her capacity to contribute to the community. Erica is an absolute ornament to her community, and we are very, very lucky to have a person of her strength and her energy and her courage and determination to advocate for those in the Hampton Park area. Additionally, Erica is a fixture of the Hampton Park Secondary College. I met her again recently at a ceremony I attended as part of the National School Pride Program. She was responsible for advocating for a refurbished commercial kitchen. Their old kitchen needed to be brought up to standard. As a consequence of this advocacy and the school investing the money, this new kitchen is going to be used by 100 students per day, five days a week for 40 weeks of the year-something in the order of about 20,000 student hours in the course of one year.

ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM (DANGEROUS GOODS) REPEAL BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. form (Dangerous Goods) Repeal Bill 2009 repeals the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995. This will allow the Australian Capital Territory to enact its own legislation, based on the Commonwealth model legislation and the associated updated Australian Dangerous Goods Code. This bill is part of the change in approach taken up by the former coalition government and continued by the Rudd government to this range of regulatory reform. Up to the late 1990s, the Commonwealth commonly pursued regulatory transport reform with the states and territories using template legislation. The Commonwealth would pass legislation for application in the Australian Capital Territory and that legislation would be copied by the other states and territories as a way to establish national legislative consistency in transport. This approach was increasingly criticised and, following a 2001 review of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, the Council of Australian Governments decided on a different approach. This new approach to transport regulatory reform was made formal in the 2003 Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport. This agreement at clause 14.1 agreed that there was a need: ... to maintain a ‘single reference point’ for Agreed Reforms that take the form of Model Legislation or Road Transport Legislation, in order to promote and maintain a uniform or nationally consistent regulatory and operating environment. In practice, this means that the Commonwealth develops model legislation, with no legal effect in itself, for implementation in other jurisdictions. The model legislation is drafted for the Commonwealth by a new entity, the National Transport Commission. According to clause 14.5, legislation passed by the Commonwealth on behalf of the ACT was to be repealed as soon as practicable. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Jakarta Bombings

240,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (10.03 am)-The Road Transport ReThe Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 is one such piece of legislation. It was passed by the Commonwealth for application in the ACT to regulate the transport of dangerous goods by road in that territory and to provide a national code to be adopted by the states and the Northern Territory. The legislation has been superseded by the National Transport Commission (Model Legislation-Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road or Rail) Regulations 2007, promulgated by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mark Vaile, on 26 September 2007. The states and territories are progressively applying this model legislation, developed by the former coalition government, via their own legislative processes. New South Wales introduced its own law based on the model legislation in June 2008 and most of the other states have followed with comparable regulations. The ACT cannot implement the model legislation until the Commonwealth repeals the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995. The repeal will come into effect on a day to be fixed by proclamation to coincide with the passage of legislation by the ACT government. The opposition is satisfied that this bill is a necessary piece of housekeeping and it applies the approach to regulatory reform implemented by the former coalition government and therefore the bill deserves, and will receive, our support. Unfortunately, the effort that the new Labor government is making in its own right to address uniform transport regulation, a fundamental matter of economic reform, is far more disappointing. The Productivity Commission has estimated that the cost to Australia’s GDP of conflicting transport regulations is $2.4 billion. The National Transport Commission in 2006 found that after one decade of effort to pursue regulatory reform only one third of the ‘oversize’ and ‘overmass’ provisions that apply to heavy vehicles have been implemented in a nationally consistent way. I have mentioned in this place before some baffling examples of regulatory transport inconsistencies. For example, a truck operator carrying hay bales and loaded to its maximum allowable three metre width in Victoria will be overwidth in New South Wales, where the maximum width is 2.83 metres. So the farmer or truck operator in Victoria who loads his truck with hay as wide as is legally possible in Victoria is not able to drive into New South Wales without cutting a few inches off all of the hay bales. The coalition has also mentioned the failure by the states to take up in a uniform way the heavy vehicle driver fatigue reforms, agreed by the Australian Transport Council in early 2007 and rolled out from September 2008. Tasmania and the Northern Territory have not yet applied the fatigue reforms and Western Australia has never had any plans to implement them at all. It is also astounding that New South Wales and Victoria, which have applied the reforms from 29 September last year, have introduced variations. These include differences between Victoria and New South Wales in logbook requirements and in defence provisions, should a breach of the fatigue regulations occur. The opposition is also concerned about variations between the states in opening up their roads to the highly efficient B-triple vehicle combinations. In spite of agreements to do so, New South Wales refuses to make a serious effort to open its road system to these vehicles. Victoria is also lagging, only allowing B-triple use between Broadmeadows and Geelong for vehicles carrying Ford parts. It is quite ridiculous. If it is safe for a form of vehicle to carry one particular type of freight, why could it not also be used also for others? MAIN COMMITTEE I also refer to the recent study put out by the Australian Logistics Council. This study released earlier this year looks at the transport regulation inconsistencies in the SunraysiaRiverland region, a food bowl area that adjoins the borders of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This study notes that transport operators have spent nearly $250 million in higher mass limit equipment on higher productivity trucks-trucks that generate between nine and 13 per cent increases in payloads. Unfortunately, the failure of the New South Wales government to implement the higher mass limit reforms agreed to by the Australian Transport Council in the year 2000 has made it difficult for truck operators to realise on this investment and has added to the costs of fleets operating across the South Australian and Victorian borders into New South Wales. These are just a few examples of what is a serious problem of economic inefficiency in Australia. What is the government doing about it? The opposition notes with interest the September 2008 decision by the Council of Australian Governments to ask the Australian Transport Council to prepare a regulatory impact statement for a national framework for regulation, registration and licensing of heavy vehicles. This was part of a decision by the Australian Transport Council to establish a single regulatory body to administer Australia’s national heavy vehicle laws and to develop a uniform national approach to such matters as driver competency and training, heavy vehicle licences and a uniform body of national heavy vehicle laws. These are worthwhile objectives and have the coalition’s support. However, certain questions remain unanswered. When will these worthwhile aims be realised? The regulatory impact statement issued in December last year proposed that the national heavy vehicle regulator be operational by the end of 2012. The joint communique of the Australian Transport Council issued on 22 May this year states that the national heavy vehicle regulator is to be up and running in 2013. So in just this short period the government has already slipped the timetable by a year. It is obvious that the government wants to keep these fundamental transport reforms at a comfortable time in the future, because it simply cannot answer the hard questions these reforms involve. For example, on what basis will the national heavy vehicle regulator be established? What will be its powers? How will it deal with the recalcitrant states and territories that refuse to consider the national interest and insist on peeling off from national standards? How will such a body deal with existing state laws and regulations? Will this scheme involve the referral of powers by the states to the Commonwealth? Is the Commonwealth contemplating such a course? Most importantly, are the states? These are all very relevant questions. We do know, since the opposition raised these questions in Senate estimates earlier this year, that the government as yet has no clue what the answers to those key questions are. How, indeed, the government could commit to regulatory reform of this nature when they have no idea how it is actually going to work is beyond me. The opposition acknowledges that the establishment of a national transport regulator to build a consistent and uniform framework in which a key industry may operate is an overdue and necessary reform. The opposition is also aware of the naive and bland assurances offered by the Labor Party to the Australian people during the last election. They said the vexed problems of our federation would all be dealt with simply by cooperating with one another. All the Labor governments would get together in a giant love-in and all of these sorts of problems would be solved. Unfortunately, the history of transport reform in Australia demonstrates the MAIN COMMITTEE foolishness of this answer. Love-in federalism will not be enough; hard decisions have to be made and state Labor mates need to be confronted with the imperative nature of dealing with some of these issues. We know that Labor are good at some things. They are good at creating a $315 billion debt and a massive liability for every Australian. We know Labor are good at trashing programs aimed at regional Australia and turning them into election funds in urban areas. Of course, in that regard I am referring particularly to the Nation Building Program off-network projects for roads. It is no longer directed at rural Australian roads, which are so important in the freight transport task around the nation. In fact, they have shovelled 82 per cent of the funds available under this program, over half a billion dollars, into marginal Labor seats-a gigantic slush fund. So we know Labor are good at shifting money into those sorts of funds. We now know that they are looking again-as Labor always do-at a range of new taxes. This morning, for the first time, the veil has been lifted from a proposal to increase fuel excise by 10c a litre. Again, this will place an enormous burden on the road transport industry. Increased costs of doing business in Australia reduce the competitiveness of Australian industry, which seeks to make contact with overseas markets and to meet the competition from other parts of the world. Another mass increase in taxes-bearing in mind fuel excise already raises $13 billion a year for the government-simply cannot be afforded. Labor’s proposal to increase the tax by 10c a litre would also be devastating for regional people. Country people, who have to travel hundreds of kilometres perhaps to visit their doctor on dirt roads, will be paying massive new fuel taxes under this proposal, whereas city people, who can visit their doctor just around the corner, will be paying very little in extra taxes. If you have to travel a couple of hundred kilometres into town to buy groceries, why should you be paying massive extra taxation compared with somebody who has a grocery store on every corner? Why should people travelling on dirt roads have to pay massive extra taxesallegedly to upgrade the road system-when they in fact are not getting that money spent in their areas? I call on the government to immediately reject the concept of a 10c increase in excise. If the government do not reject it, we can only assume that this government will follow the same route as the Keating government, which promised before the election that they would not increase fuel excise but immediately after the election introduced the biggest fuel excise increase in our nation’s history. It is clear that this government are intending to follow the same route. This is the history of the Labor government. They are good at making some of these promises but, when it comes to actually delivering, the story is often different. They need to convince the nation that the government are capable of making the difficult decisions to deal with transport reform. This legislation is an important step in seeking to eliminate some of the differences in legislation between the various states, but it is a very small step. It is a step that we certainly welcome and will support; however, the really big and difficult decisions to establish a seamless and efficient road transport industry are still being pushed off into the distance. Very, very little progress has been made. The anomalies remain. All the promises about the goodwill there would be between the Rudd Labor government and the states have simply failed to deliver action in this very important area. Frankly, I doubt that the government have MAIN COMMITTEE the courage or the skill to actually deliver common national road transport laws around the nation, and this costly burden of inefficiency will rest upon the sector for a very long time. for Wide Bay in this debate on the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Repeal Bill 2009 with some honour, particularly considering his previous capacity in presiding over the regional rorts leading up to the last election.

I announced that with the then minister, Martin Ferguson. It followed a series of questions that I asked in this place of the then transport minister, the member for Robertson.

This is an important bill, although it is a bill that, on face value, may just look technical. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Repeal Bill 2009 meets the Australian government’s obligation under the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport. It repeals any road transport legislation that has been enacted by the Commonwealth on behalf of the ACT, the Australian Capital Territory. That is to coincide with the passage of legislation by the ACT. The intergovernmental agreement sets out the principles and processes for cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories in the progress of regulatory and operational reform to roads, rail and intermodal transport in order to deliver a sustained national consistency of outcome in this essential area.

261,Mr Hayes,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I do accept your wise counsel.The bill will repeal the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 and will allow the Australian Capital Territory to implement the updated Australian Dangerous Goods Code and the associated model legislation in its own legislative arrangements. In the same way, each of the other states and the Northern Territory are able to bring that code into operation. It should be noted that the ACT government cannot implement the updated Dangerous Goods Code and the associated model legislation until the Australian government repeals the existing dangerous goods legislation. The repeal will come into effect on a day to be fixed by proclamation, but it will coincide with the passage of the ACT government’s actions to ensure that a seamless transfer of the new dangerous goods transport provisions occurs. By way of background, the legislative responsibility for transport of dangerous goods on roads and rail is a matter for the states and territories. To avoid the cost of disruption which arises from different requirements governing the transport of dangerous goods around the country, transport ministers, through the Australian Transport Council, asked the National Transport Commission to develop a national legislative framework to provide consistency in the rules and standards. The national framework is also periodically updated to ensure that the components remain current. The dangerous goods package has two main elements. It sets the model regulations and, importantly, a technical safety code known as the Australian Dangerous Goods Code. The Australian Dangerous Goods Code is a technical document setting out detailed instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by road or rail and is based on international model regulations. It addresses issues such as classification, labelling, packaging, stowing and bulk transport. The international regulations also underpin the international aviation and maritime codes for transport of dangerous goods. The adoption of the UN requirements into Australian requirements thus promotes international harmonisation to facilitate safe and effective trade arrangements and transportation affecting dangerous goods. The regulations are under the National Transport Commission Act 2003, which provides a legislative scheme of arrangement that serves as the sole reference point for the nationally agreed standards. The model regulation approach reflects the 2003 Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport and it commits to the establishment of model legislation under the National Transport Commission Act to enable the implementation of nationally agreed reforms endorsed by the Australian Transport Council. The model legislation is subordinate to the National Transport Commission Act as the enabling act, and it is made by regulation. The model regulations allow for implementation in each jurisdiction using the most convenient and effective regulatory route available to them. For instance, the provisions may be incorporated into the law of a state or territory by amending their existing dangerous goods legislation as it applies. At the Commonwealth level, the regulations are not operative-that is, they are not live-but seek to be the sole reference point for jurisdictions to adopt into their own legislative arrangements as nationally consistent transport legislation. This approach replaces the earlier template model approach which, it is well conceded, proved to be unworkable. Consider the amount of variation that takes place between various states and territories as they move between their respective legislators to customise legislation; things get lost in the mix. This becomes essential, particularly when we are talking about something as critical as the transportation of dangerous goods, to ensure that there is less variation, that there is MAIN COMMITTEE absolute standardisation, in the way we go about delivering consistent and workable laws concerning the transportation of dangerous goods in this country. The current dangerous goods package, which was developed by the National Transport Commission under the direction of the Australian Transport Council, incorporates the seventh edition of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code and the National Transport Commission’s Model Legislation-Dangerous Goods (Road or Rail) Regulation 2009. Very briefly, the key elements of that package are to adopt, to the extent possible, the latest available United Nations’s model regulations, retaining Australian specific requirements where appropriate; to harmonise with air and sea regulations; to incorporate amendments, accumulated over recent years, that reflect agreed practice; and to provide a single set of updated regulations for the transportation of dangerous goods by road or rail, using the model regulation approach. As I said before, the implementation of the code is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. Through this process of having model legislation, we are seeking to achieve definite harmonisation. In response to COAG’s consideration of the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into chemical and plastic regulation, the Australian Transport Council agreed that the National Transport Commission would undertake an independent review of the consistency with which the Australian Dangerous Goods Code has been adopted throughout the Commonwealth and how it has been applied through each of our state and territory jurisdictions. The review will commence within 12 months of the implementation of these reforms. As I understand it, it will be some time in the first half of 2010. The responsibility for policy development and monitoring of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code and legislation will remain with the National Transport Commission, and it will continue to report to the Australian Transport Council on these matters. In summary, the development of the national dangerous goods package has been a lengthy and complex process, but it has provided the framework for efficient, effective and nationally consistent regulation of dangerous goods transportation across this country. Our technical requirements are consistent with international requirements, thus facilitating trade. This is good for business, but it also provides confidence to the community that dangerous goods are being transported in a safe and consistent manner. However, this is not a static process, and the National Transport Commission will need to continue its role to maintain the dangerous goods provisions to ensure that they are consistent, they are updated and they continually reflect the requirements that are set at both international levels and local levels. The Australian Transport Commission commits to that review, as I mentioned a little earlier, and that will ensure that there will be that consistent harmonisation. For those reasons, I commend this bill to the House. this bill repeals the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 so that the ACT can implement the updated Australian Dangerous Goods Code and the associated model legislation into its own legislative arrangements in the same way as other states and territories. Let me say at the outset that I believe it is somewhat ‘Big Brotherish’ that the federal government does have the capacity to legislate or overturn legislation in relation to the territory assemblies. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the territory is going to be able to, at least in name, be the architect of its own destiny in relation to this because, as we know, this comes about through a national scheme of legislation. The Australian Dangerous Goods Code sets MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Condolences
262,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (10.35 Am),"As has been indicated by a number of speakers,out detailed instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by road and rail. It is based on model regulations set out by the United Nations which harmonise with existing regulations in sea and air transport. Until the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 is repealed, the ACT remains powerless to move on its own. Dangerous goods are around us in every aspect of our daily lives and yet I expect people do not pay as much attention to them as they perhaps ought. Dangerous goods and materials can cause or accelerate combustion, have acute toxic effects, have the ability to corrode skin or other materials, or have a capacity to harm the environment, cause asphyxiation, present temperature or pressure hazards or react with other materials that can then do any of the above. I indicated that people are generally unaware of them. I will relate a couple of examples from my own experience, firstly as an employee of a national airline where I was engaged in transporting dangerous goods by air and discovered, I guess somewhat to my amusement, that there is an internationally known brand of cola beverage who very jealously guard their recipe and ship it to countries where it is going to be made in part A and part B, and one of the parts-I cannot remember whether it is part A or B now-is too dangerous to be transported by air. Yet we quaff this material by the hundreds of thousands of litres a day, I suspect. But one of those two parts, on its own, is too dangerous to be transported by air. going to name the product. gest to people that Pepsi Max is okay; there is no sugar. The other experience that I had-and the member for Fisher, were he in the chamber, would remember this-was the kerfuffle, I will call it, that we had in the early 1990s in the area that we share about the storage of spent radioactive waste material. There was quite a large community opposition to that. As it turned out, the argument was ultimately won and the storage facility was build elsewhere. But those same people were not at all aware of active radioactive sources bouncing around in the back of council utes through their community every day. Yes, if it is spent, we cannot store it. If it is live, well, we really do not care. It was an interesting insight into people’s view of dangerous goods. It is important, particularly to me as the member for Longman, that the safe transport of dangerous goods is something that is well regulated and well policed. Running through the entirety of my electorate are the Bruce Highway-the main road corridor north from Brisbane to the major regional centres-and the north coast rail line. These transport corridors carry all of the freight from Brisbane port heading north and a number of things heading south. My eastern boundary is the port of Brisbane, and we all saw what happened recently there with the oil spill, for which it looks likely that the Swire company may well be about to pay adequate compensation, but our council is a million dollars out of pocket because of that. SoI understand that safety is necessary and I understand that safety in the carriage of dangerous goods is important for my constituents, the people I am here to represent and to look out for their interest. A report in the Australian Journal of Emergency Management identified a number of the types of goods that travel up and down the highway, including petrol, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied ammonia, molten sulphur, liquefied chlorine, concentrated hydrochloric acid, compressed hydrogen, sodium cyanide and liquid fuels coming south from Gladstone. So there are MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Condolences

264,Mr Sullivan,"The honourable member is not going to name the product but will suga number of very volatile materials running past major population centres in my electorate, including North Lakes and Caboolture. Over the years there have been a number of incidents. Most of them have, fortunately, been relatively minor. But in September 1992, for example, a minor incident that had the potential to be much more than that occurred near Nambour. Fortunately, nobody was injured as a result of the collision between an LPG tanker and an ethanol tanker, neither of which ruptured, but had either or both of them done so then we could have had a really serious incident on the highway. So we need to be very clear about how important it is that the transport of dangerous goods is, as I said, well regulated and well policed. Highway. another occasion! That highway is important in serving the west and the south Burnett parts of South-East Queensland-so an important road in itself. It is important for us to have a national approach to these matters, simply because there is trade across Australia for goods moving from Victoria to New South Wales to Queensland. If different regimes are in place then you have compliance costs. The national code is a springboard from which we can have advantages when we trade overseas, and consistency across the jurisdictions is important. As I indicated, we have road, rail and sea lines running through or adjacent to my electorate and it is very important to me and to my constituents that there are clear and safe guidelines. Internationally, it is important that we are doing exactly what the rest of the world is doing, for much the same reasons. There is an ever-increasing amount of international trade. In fact, this country depends on international trade. Although we tend to send out some volatile materials, a lot of them are benign, but it is important that regulations are consistent across the world. The Australian Dangerous Goods Code incorporates the UN guidelines but retains some Australia-specific requirements which are updated periodically to make sure that they meet our guidelines. This bill, as previous speakers have said, meets our obligation under the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Intermodal Transport. It is a national scheme of legislation of the type that has been coming very much more into vogue in Australia in the last two decades. It is an example of cooperative government. The state and territory governments and National Transport Commission developed the framework so that there can be consistency. The National Transport Commission has established a set of national guidelines which each state and territory has then adopted or is about to adopt into its own legislation. In conclusion, this bill firstly repeals the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 so that the ACT can pass its own legislation, and I applaud the move that gives the ACT the opportunity to look after its own interests. The code itself is valuable because having a single national code makes the transport of hazardous goods more efficient and safer. It is a great example of government cooperation across state and territory boundaries. Finally, the matters relating to the carriage of dangerous goods are something about which I am particularly aware and in which I have a particular interest with regard to my electorate. I commend this bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Condolences

The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Repeal Bill 2009 will repeal the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 so as to allow the ACT government to implement the updated Australian Dangerous Goods Code and the associated model legislation into its own legislative arrangements in the same manner as the other states and territories. The ACT cannot implement the updated code and associated model legislation, which has been endorsed by ministers at the Australian Transport Council, until the Australian government repeals the existing dangerous goods transport legislation. The repeal completes a long standing commitment by the Australian government and the states and territories to repeal any road transport legislation that has been enacted by the Commonwealth on behalf of the ACT once that legislation is no longer necessary. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Electoral Matters Committee Report Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by Mr Melham: That the House take note of the report. the debate on this matter. In speaking to this report of the Electoral Matters Committee, I particularly thank the chair of the committee, the member for Banks, and all other fellow members of the committee. In terms of the inquiries we undertook and the submissions we received, I also thank the many, many people who made submissions to the inquiry over a lengthy period of time and thank them for the enthusiasm of the debate that was pursued in those many hearings around the country. I would particularly like to place on record my appreciation to the secretariat of the committee, who worked incredibly well in supporting all the members of the committee in fulfilling their responsibilities. I thank them for their assistance in the preparation of the majority report-in which there are matters that the coalition obviously agrees with and there is support for but, importantly, there are some very real matters where the coalition has some very significant differences of opinion with the government. As the committee worked through its processes and particularly as we received information in numerous submissions from the Australian Electoral Commission, I think there was one central fact before the committee that we wrestled with, and that was the issue of those who do not vote because they did not enrol to vote, who did not show up to vote or who did not fulfil their responsibilities to vote properly on the day. When you add all those people up, there are around 2.4 million Australians-that is one in seven eligible voters-who did not vote in one way or another. There were around 1.138 million who did not enrol to vote, 715,000 who did not show up although they were on the roll, and 510,000 who failed to complete their ballot properly. This is actually an improvement on the situation in 2004, but the fact that one in seven voters in a system of compulsory voting in this country do not exercise MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Condolences

268,Mr Morrison (Cook) (10.50 Am),"I thank the House for its indulgence in resumingtheir franchise because they have not chosen to, they did not get it right or they could not be bothered is, I think, a genuine issue of concern. I know that that concern is shared by all the members of the committee, but we have a difference of view about how we go about alleviating that concern. The matters put forward in the majority report where the coalition has significant problems go to what I describe as the policy of appeasement of apathy when it comes to those who are not choosing to exercise their franchise properly within this country. The government made a number of recommendations through the committee’s majority report. These recommendations, which include extending the close of rolls, weakening the existing proof of identity requirements for those not found to be on the roll, removing any sanctions for failing to maintain your enrolment as required under the act and removing the requirement for voters to fully exhaust preferences for House of Representatives elections, say one thing to me, and that is that it is all too hard, so basically, instead of trying to uphold standards, we are going to lower them. It is easy to help people to meet standards if you just do not have them. When it comes to the integrity of our electoral system, I think standards are incredibly important and they should be preserved by laws, encouragements and sanctions that uphold those standards. The government’s approach in the majority report is basically to say that it is all too hard and that we should walk away and it seeks to weaken very important integrity provisions within the Australian Electoral Act. We have a system of compulsory voting in this country, and it is a system that I support. If we were to ban compulsory voting, we would leave our democracy hostage to the extremes of both sides of politics, and I think that is a very disturbing element. I have through the course of the inquiry commended the AEC on their positive actions to get people on the roll and on their positive actions to encourage people to vote on election day. It is one of the reasons that, despite what is talked about widely out there in the community, that somehow closing the rolls early led to more people not being able to vote, the evidence before the inquiry was actually the reverse: fewer people missed out on being able to enrol at the last election in 2007 than was the case in 2004. One of the reasons for that, I think, was the excellent communications campaign run by the AEC, working up to the election of 2007, which had one simple message: value your voteyour vote is precious; take it seriously. In encouraging people to do that, they had a surge in enrolments over the period of the campaign, particularly, as their evidence to the committee showed, during the spikes in activity in that campaign. I applaud those sorts of measures, because they involve people engaging with the process, choosing to be enrolled and choosing to exercise their franchise carefully and in a considered way. The recommendations put forward by the government through the majority members of this committee actually worked against all of those sorts of positive efforts. What they say is: ‘Look, you don’t have to bother to enrol to vote, you don’t have to bother to ensure that your enrolment is up to date and you don’t even have to bother to fill out the ballot properly, because we are going to lower those standards-if you get all of those things wrong, it doesn’t really matter. When we tell you that you must enrol to vote before an election, don’t worry about it; you can leave it to election day. There’ll be no sanctions, there’ll be no penalties and there’ll be no requirement for you to come and present proof of identity to say who you are; you can just turn up on the day and vote.’ MAIN COMMITTEE I think this is a very dangerous development for our democracy, because it undermines the positive efforts of the AEC-which, hopefully, at some point will also include a more enthusiastic approach online to assist people, with appropriate safeguards, something we have supported in our dissenting report. We need to ensure that the AEC’s positive measures are not undermined by the undermining of standards that will enable people to basically continue an approach of apathy. Just because we have compulsory voting in this country does not mean that we have to walk away from the standards of our democracy, which I think uphold that democracy. SoI encourage the government, when they consider this report, to urgently resist those measures that would seek to appease apathy, which we have seen through the recommendations of the majority report. I will pick out another one of those. This particularly relates to the issues of where the government members are effectively arguing that, instead of being required to fill out your ballot paper in sequential order, from 1 to the total number of candidates that are before that election, you can get the first few right and, after that, if you cannot get it right, that is okay. We are either going to have a system of compulsory preferential voting in this country or we are not. While I support compulsory voting, when it comes to the issue of whether there should be a compulsory requirement to issue preferences all the way down the line, my view is that you have one system or the other, and you do not have the system which is proposed in the majority report, which basically says, ‘If you get it wrong, we’ll count it anyway-if you could please fill it all the way out, as the law actually requires you to do so, but we will turn the other way if that does not happen.’ In New South Wales and Queensland we have a system of optional preferential voting. As the evidence before the committee showed, that drastically reduced the amount of informal voting in both of those states. The fact that we have a different system of voting in state elections in New South Wales and Queensland than we have at the federal level is actually a fairly significant contributor to the level of informal voting at a federal level in both of those states. Instead of trying to bite the bullet on some serious reform, the majority members of the committee took the view that they would have some sort of ‘look the other way’ proposal when it comes to preferential voting. If they are serious about reform then they should seriously take on the issue of optional preferential voting. That was the evidence put forward by all the experts who came before the committee. I took special care to ask them when this model of ‘look the other way’ was put forward by the government members of the committee. I specifically asked each of them, from Antony Green to others: ‘But, isn’t it your preferred method that, if we were going to go down this path, we would choose optional preferential voting?’ Their answer was the same on every occasion: ‘Yes, it is.’ If you are going to move away from compulsory preferential voting, it is best not to go to what some may describe as a ‘mongrel’ of a system; it is best to go to a pure system when it comes to our electoral process of optional preferential voting. So that is the debate which I think the majority members of the committee refused to engage in. They ducked the issue, I think. In the dissenting report you will note that the coalition members said, ‘Well, if we are going to go down that path then we certainly should be considering optional preferential voting as a preferred alternative, but our actual view is that we would prefer to stay with the system as it is and uphold the integrity of that system all the way through.’ MAIN COMMITTEE The other issue I would draw attention to is the requirement of proof of identity for those who were not correctly enrolled. The requirement before the last election was that if you turned up and you were not on the roll then you would be required to show proof of identity. If you did not have proof of identity then you could lodge your vote and you had seven days to get to the Australian Electoral Commission office in your electorate to present your proof of identity. It turns out that at the last election there were 33,901 provisional voters who failed to provide this identification on polling day. Only one in five of those voters subsequently turned up within the seven days to show some identification. That is very concerning given that the majority members’ report is actually suggesting that this measure be overturned. One of the issues that was raised and argued in the committee process-and even in fact stated in the majority report without any supporting evidence-was that provisional voters do not turn up because within a week the result of the election is pretty much known and they cannot be bothered. Not only are they going to appease the apathy of such an approach; it is also not true in fact. In the seats of McEwen and Swan the results from the last election were not known for some weeks, in fact months, later. In those cases there were 260 provisional voters in the electorate of Swan and 188 provisional voters in the electorate of McEwen who failed to come forward and present proof of identity. SoI would argue that to lower the standards and appease the apathy, which is what the majority members of the committee have recommended to the parliament and to the government, would be a very dangerous way to go. I would urge them very strongly to reject those considerations and instead opt to preserve the standards that we have in our electoral process and our electoral system. I will conclude on this note. In return for citizenship and the right to vote in this country we ask that citizens do some very basic and easy things-that you enrol to vote; that you maintain your enrolment, just as you would for a drivers licence, for your power bills or for membership of your local RSL or football club; that you turn up to vote on election day; and that when you get there you follow the instructions and you number the candidates from one all the way through to the highest number of candidates that are there. I do not think that is a very onerous task; I do not think there is a very onerous task at all. Australia was one of the few democracies that existed over 100 years ago. We were in the minority back then. Fortunately, today there are many nations who join us as democracies around the world. I think they look to a country such as Australia to be a standard-bearer for these things. What will they think when they hear that we in this country are prepared to say to people who are not prepared to vote properly, turn up or maintain their enrolment: ‘It’s okay. We’ll appease you by lowering the standards’? What we are saying, I think, is that we do not take the responsibilities of our citizenship terribly seriously. As I said, I am a strong supporter of compulsory voting, but I am not a strong supporter of appeasing those who are not prepared to take the responsibilities that come with compulsory voting seriously. If you are not prepared to do that then the sanctions that exist in terms of additional inconveniences and other penalties-and maybe there are other penalties that should exist-should be applied. We should encourage all of our fellow Australians to turn up to vote and make sure they are doing the right thing by all their fellow citizens in exercising their vote carefully and in a considered way so that we can get the governments that the people of Australia want. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.04 am)-I move: That further proceedings be conducted in the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Question agreed to. 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS That the House: (1) notes the sixtieth anniversary of the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949; (2) congratulates the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement for continuously fostering the principles of international humanitarian law to limit human suffering in times of armed conflict and to prevent atrocities, especially against civilian populations, the wounded, and prisoner of war; (3) recalls Australia’s ratification of the Conventions and of the two Additional Protocols of 1977; (4) affirms all parliamentary measures taken in support of such ratification; (5) encourages the fullest implementation of the Conventions and Additional Protocols by the military forces and civilian organisations of all States; (6) encourages ratification by all nations of the Conventions and Additional Protocols; and (7) recognises the extraordinary contribution made by many individual Australians, including Australian Red Cross members, volunteers and staff, in carrying out the humanitarian ideals expressed in the Conventions and Additional Protocols. ventions and comment on how they have created order, even in the case of wars. I attended the commemorative service yesterday morning. I believe that adherence to the conventions is vital to maintaining integrity in the world. Of all my comments, one thing I am going to say will perhaps be disagreed with by some present-but perhaps not; we will see. As others in this place have already said in this debate, the Geneva conventions have their origins on the battlefield of Solferino, where Henri Dunant was stunned and then outraged by the carnage he observed. Writing in 1862 about what he had seen, he proposed a neutral relief agency for alleviating suffering in conflicts by providing aid. Dunant’s proposal led to the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which commenced lobbying for standards of treatment for wounded soldiers and enemy combatants. From these events, 10 articles of the first Geneva convention were adopted in 1864 by 12 nations. In that treaty, the Red Cross were provided with the authority to provide aid. The next treaty came in 1906 and dealt with the members of armed forces at sea. The third treaty related to the treatment of prisoners of war and was adopted in 1929. The fourth treaty was adopted in 1949 and it was created with a view to addressing the actions revealed by the Nuremberg trials and the realities of what occurred during World War II. It is my view that these conventions-what are effectively rules of war-are absolutely vital to the minimisation of the loss of life and destruction of property during wars and conflicts. If you have rules that each side are confident are being observed then the more extreme acts of war are far less likely. In fact, it really makes sense to observe these rules if you are serious about winning the hearts and minds of those not yet involved in a conflict. It is smart to abide by the Geneva conventions because, in any case, if you do not win the war then you will be forced to account for your actions and any breaches of those conventions, let alone the fact that these conventions represent standards of human decency and respect that we should all be able to abide by if we consider ourselves decent human beings.

270,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.05 Am),"I rise to speak of my support for the Geneva conIn researching this contribution last night, I had cause to look at an essay put together by Steven Ratner entitled ‘Think again: Geneva conventions’. In that essay in the March-April 2008 magazine Foreign Policy, Ratner questions a trend of doubt in the conventions by modern governments. He makes a number of good points, stating that, while some details may appear outdated, the core of the conventions and the value of the conventions remain as valid as they ever were. While I believe that we will always have conflicts, I also believe that, regardless of our enemies’ disregard for the conventions and human decency, we should never stoop to their level. I have said before that when we speak of terrorist groups like Jemaah Islamiah, Hezbollah, the Taliban, Hamas and al-Qaeda, just to name a few, we can never expect the same standards of human decency and compassion. That should never tempt us to adopt their standards. We will never win the support of the people in places like Afghanistan or Iraq by lowering ourselves to the base brutality and reckless hate of our enemies. Whilst stating that point, I found one point where I disagreed with Ratner. It was with regard to what constitutes torture. The need to obtain information quickly from enemy combatants is no excuse for brutality, and to that end I say that waterboarding, deafening music, assault of any kind and humiliation of any kind do constitute torture. Interrogation that commences with a period of discomfort but no actual injury or ongoing psychological damage can be appropriate. To obtain information quickly but without injury or damage, sleep deprivation has always been highly effective. In the Army, sleep deprivation was one of the methods used, along with physical exhaustion and stress, to determine what a person was like under pressure. Similarly, the resistance of a person can be reasonably quickly broken through lack of sleep and then information obtained through questioning. I reiterate that this is not about physical harm or injury; this is more about weakening the character of a combatant to a point where they will provide the information they are asked for. I would say that, while questioning can be undertaken immediately upon capture, if the information is not provided we should be able to place prisoners under the pressure of which I speak. It is also worth remembering the realities of wars and conflicts. Finding out what one’s enemy is planning is very useful. Prisoners are interrogated to try to obtain that advantage. One reality is that the information that can be obtained often declines in value with the passing of time. If a prisoner is not placed under some sort of pressure then they are not very likely to provide information that will be of benefit. Lives may depend on accurate information being obtained, and, while getting that information may not seem important to those not involved in prosecuting these conflicts, it is to those who are. As I said at the outset, I stand by the Geneva conventions and their observance, regardless of what our enemies may do or how they conduct themselves. I reiterate that physical harm, assault and dehumanising or other long-term physical or mental damage are, and always should be, prohibited. We are here to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Geneva conventions. They represent a great step forward for humanity-an enshrinement of human decency-and I am confident that Australia will always stand by them and observe them, because that is the right and honourable way to act in all conflicts. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (11.10 am)-It is a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Cowan, as both of us in a previous life spent a lot of time working together in support of these MAIN COMMITTEE major pieces of humanitarian law that we are discussing and commemorating and whose 60th anniversary we are celebrating. There is an old expression that is attributed to Plato that says ‘Only the dead have seen the end of war’. That is obviously a very pessimistic view of human affairs and is one that we in this place have an obligation to work in contravention of as we continue to forge the paths of peace. In that respect I often refer to the Talmudic scholars who said, ‘You are not obligated to complete the task of achieving a better world, but neither are you free to desist from it.’ And that is really what the story of these Geneva conventions is all about. As the member for Cowan highlighted, it has been a long evolutionary process to the point that we are at now in the law of armed conflict and international humanitarian law. There are two streams in the history of that evolution-what we refer to as Geneva law and Hague law. Hague law effectively governs what we call the methods and means of combat. It also regulates weapons systems and the employment of weapons systems. We saw in the most recent versions of that last year the passage of the convention on cluster munitions, but there are many others besides that regulate landmines and incendiary weapons et cetera. The four Geneva conventions that we celebrate the 60th anniversary of today are part of the Geneva law tradition which regulates those who are hors de combat or the victims of warfare. They began famously with the experience of Henri Dunant, the Swiss businessman, who witnessed the terrible sufferings of the wounded and sick on the battlefield at Solferino in Italy, which led to the first Geneva convention of 1864. There was a period where a number of conventions were developed to deal with the specific issue of the treatment of the wounded and sick on the battlefield or, in the early years of the 20th century, of the wounded and sick and shipwrecked at sea and then, moving into the 1920s, of the treatment of prisoners of war. It is important to note that the fundamental principle that was evolving through this period was an understanding that there was a limit to war. At the same time we started to see emerging not only the humanitarian aspect or issue of how people were treated on battlefields but also the additional dimension of the industrial abilities that mankind was able to bring to that situation, which raised the threshold of inhumanity itself. Of course, we had the experience of World War II and the terrible atrocities wrought by the Nazis in relation to civilian populations, and that experience led to the creation of the main development in the 1949 conventions of the fourth Geneva convention relating to the treatment of civilians under the authority or control of military forces. The four Geneva conventions have been supplemented and added to by three additional protocols. The first of those expanded the conventions relating to the varying types of international conflict that we were seeing emerge post the Second World War and the second protocol dealt with situations of civil war where there were organised armed forces confronting existing governments but not extending further into the Hobbsian situations we have often seen in these failed state scenarios of warring factions against each other in multiple, fractured components not necessarily involving state forces. Then the third additional protocol, which we ratified yesterday, adds the new protective emblem to the armoury of the International Committee of the Red Cross in their seeking to perform their task. The other essential element of these Geneva conventions was the way they fundamentally and formally incorporated the role of the ICRC in the objectives of those conventions. MAIN COMMITTEE Also today, I would to pause to salute the work of the ICRC. Over many years, they have not only performed those tasks as set out in the conventions with great dedication and great effect but also been at the heart of the evolution of the law itself. Even today, they continue to pursue that evolution through their projects to do with distilling customary international humanitarian law and also in their current dialogue in defining what is meant by direct participation in hostilities by those who are hard to distinguish from combatants. Their work continues to this day and I salute them for that. The law has also been complemented by the contributions of tribunals beginning with the Nuremberg tribunal through to those governing the conflicts in the former Yugoslav republic and in Rwanda. That, of course, as part of the revolutionary trend itself, led to the creation of the International Criminal Court, which has helped to develop and distil the laws through its definition of crimes and, most recently, following on from the 1980 statute, the development of the elements of war crimes and crimes against humanity et cetera. In that development, we have seen the law seeking to come to grips with the challenges posed by internal conflicts and dealing with these elements of asymmetric threats and terror. That is a long evolutionary process in itself which we are continuing to see develop. The ICC statute has now had 109 states sign up to it and it is starting to get some traction and get a roll-on in dealing with the current situations we face internationally. I had wished that I had had something like an international criminal court to support me in the operation I was involved in in Somalia, where we were attempting to deal with serious warlords who had engaged in atrocities and genocidal activities. It was very difficult to find the means to deal with them other than by recreating the local justice system, which in itself was problematic because the end result of that system was that any person convicted would end up being executed. If we had had the International Criminal Court available to us then we could have used that to deal with these serious warlords and violators of fundamental human rights. My own background is that I have been closely involved with the Geneva conventions through these last 20 years in the Army before I entered parliament. In particular, I also was involved closely with the ICRC as a pool military officer that they drew upon to try and advance the cause of the work of the ICRC in their efforts around the world. It was a great privilege for me to have worked in support of the ICRC, in particular in Bosnia and Croatia during the war there. That is why I have such a deep admiration and respect for the work of the ICRC. In particular, if you are a soldier, you will want to know that the ICRC is being respected and facilitated. If you are a captive then it is only the ICRC that will have the ability to ensure that you exist, that you are being dealt with humanely and that at some point, some day, there is a chance that you will be released. I continue to respect and do whatever I can to promote the cause of the ICRC’s work. It was also a privilege to have been at the meeting of experts in Geneva in 1998 to draft the Australian statement on our position on the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Fourth Geneva Convention has been a great tool of mine in various conflict situations where Australia accepts or promotes a broader interpretation of the application of that convention to situations not just arising in the context of international armed conflicts but where military forces find themselves in the control of civil populations. The most extensive example of my reliance upon that convention was in Iraq for the year that I was there from 2003 to 2004. Using the framework of that law, we were able to do a MAIN COMMITTEE great deal of good in Iraq, something which is often lost in the context of the overall problems of that operation. Using that framework, we were able to establish a central criminal court which is still functioning extremely well and dealing with the most serious crimes in Iraq, and is well respected by Iraqis. We were able to use it as a tool to defeat the major international maritime oil smuggling operations that were bleeding Iraq dry at the time. We were able to create frameworks and operations based upon our use of that law. We were also able to use it for economic reconstruction purposes, and I participated with my colleagues in Iraq in developing over 100 laws for that country which are still being relied upon today as Iraq tries to move forward as a free-market democracy, respecting fundamental human rights. Many of the things that we implemented at that time-freedom of the press, right of assembly and various other measures to create the free-market framework-are still in place today and helping to move the country forward. Unfortunately, of course, that experience was significantly offset by the dark aspects of what occurred in Iraq in relation in particular to interrogations and the treatment of detainees. Part of the all-consuming aspect of my struggle there was to deal with this detainee issue and create a framework that would meet decent humanitarian standards and the scrutiny of organisations like the ICRC. I worked closely with them in Iraq to try and achieve that. But we were undermined by an atmosphere and an approach that was promoted by various authorities which led to the situation that we saw unfold at Abu Ghraib. That experience itself is all you need to look at to understand the importance of these conventions. That experience undermined the position of our forces. It undermined our position not only within Iraq but, more importantly, internationally in terms of sustaining international support and domestic support for that operation. This is the key thing about these conventions. In terms of practical military application, our compliance with these conventions helps us to maintain moral authority, to sustain our operations and to win that strategic battle for moral authority. It also has extreme practical military applications in relation to economy of effort and in the process of taking care in targeting; it makes life a lot easier for us in situations when we have to deal with the backwash behind our combat operations. Also of course there is a very serious practical effect in relation to our troops. If we are able to provide an environment for them and provide training for them, it enables them to fight a war and engage in conflict in a moral and just way. Then, at the end of the day, after the conflict is over, they will have less to deal with in terms of psychological and other traumas. You only have to look at some of the experiences of those who have been involved in breaches of these conventions to understand how important that is and what the effect can be in terms of suicides et cetera, and the impacts on anybody associated with those who suffer from those traumas. We have the major challenge of facing asymmetric warfare and the tactics of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Taliban et cetera have been referred to. Their tactics are used to exploit our application of these conventions. These people use civilians as human shields. And, of course, there is their own non-compliance-and I refer here particularly to the ongoing situation of Gilad Shalit, who has been in the hands of Hamas in the Gaza Strip for three years now without having been visited once by the ICRC. In dealing with this, we have to shape our tactics properly and that does not mean varying from the framework of the conventions. We must still maintain our application of them to maintain the moral high ground and win this battle in the longer term. MAIN COMMITTEE It does mean that we have to be very intelligent and capable of shaping the battle space to deny the opportunities for these enemies in that respect. That means being able to apply soft power as much as kinetic power to achieve that. But, when we do need to apply kinetic power, it means that we have to apply that force precisely, which is the key to that. We must avoid collateral damage at all costs and of course make sure that those persons we are targeting are the ones who should be targeted. That is really the secret to success as we face the challenges today of Afghanistan. We have to also take care of the politicisation of the law, and we have seen what can occur in relation to the ICJ’s case on the Israel security barrier. The judges on the ICJ basically adopted positions in line with the political positions of their home states, which confused and clouded the application of this law to the great detriment of the way the troops would be required to apply this law in the field. So it is something that we have to bear in mind. That also means that we as politicians and as governments must make sure that we make very clear statements about the application of this law for the benefit of the practitioners of it at the sharp end in terms of our troops. We have an opportunity to promote international humanitarian law and the work and the role of ICRC, and we have to take that as a solemn responsibility. The road to a humanitarian and peaceful world leads ever on, and we have many to miles to go before we can sleep. (Time expired) motion before the Main Committee. I acknowledge the previous speaker’s wealth of experience as a military officer and the 20 years in the Army that he brings to this debate. I commend him on his speech and his commitment in relation to the work he has done throughout his military career. Of course, this is an opportunity to put it on the public record, which will stand forever more. One thing in this place is that the words we say will be here forever more and recorded in Hansard for, quite seriously, generations to come. It is an important forum for all of us and I commend the parliamentary secretary for his contribution. Yesterday marked the 60th anniversary of the Geneva conventions which were agreed upon initially in 1949. They came into existence on 12 August 1949, just three days short of the fourth anniversary of that dreadful war, World War II, and the armistice in the Pacific region, which was on 15 August 1945. The four Geneva conventions, in essence, protect wounded and sick soldiers, both on land and at sea. They protect medical personnel and hospital ships, and they protect religious personnel during times of war. The Geneva conventions also call for the protection of prisoners of war from mental and physical torture, as well as the protection of civilians in war zones and occupied territories. Australia signed the Geneva conventions in January 1950 and ratified the agreement in October 1958. Even though we were a young country, we too were well aware of the atrocities that our service men and women had witnessed or had been victims of in battle in war zones. Indeed, the atrocities that were committed in the Second World War serve as a reminder to us, even today, of the long-lasting damage of war and the depraved acts of warlords-of the Nazis and of the Japanese in the Second World War. They are a reminder to us all of the importance of these conventions. Sadly, violations of the Geneva conventions are still happening across the world as humans continue to wage war against each other. Perhaps it will only be when there is truly peace that MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Committees
271,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (11.26 Am),"I rise today to make a contribution on thisthere will be no violations of the conventions and, hopefully, one day there will be no need for them at all. But for mankind a peaceful utopia is still out of our reach, and until then we as Australians and members of parliament must make sure that we continue to uphold and encourage the upholding of the Geneva conventions so that the ravages of war are never again as horrific as those witnessed in World War II. In the world’s recorded history there have always been many wars and conflicts and despicable acts of genocide and torture and of vengeance and domination. But there is always a silver lining to every cloud, and from the depths of war emerged charitable organisations such as the Red Cross. It was formed in 1863 after a Swiss citizen, Henry Dunant, witnessed the violence of Italy’s battle of Solferino, in which 38,000 soldiers lay dead, dying or wounded. They are just incredible numbers, numbers that in a modern world you cannot relate at all in your mind to human beings. Those 38,000 soldiers who lay dead or dying or wounded had noone to care for them. After rallying female civilians to help provide first aid, Dunant organised for makeshift hospitals to be built and for care to be administered to the soldiers. Later he wrote a book called A Memory of Solferino, calling for the establishment of volunteer groups to take care of casualties in wartime and calling for countries to protect first aid volunteers and medical personnel. From those very humble beginnings, Red Cross has grown to become a worldwide recognised symbol of humanity. But their humanitarian aid is not just limited to the battlefield. Red Cross in Australia run a blood donation drive, provide first aid training courses, deliver Meals on Wheels in many communities, provide employment services for people with disabilities and offer counselling services. They provide respite services and give assistance to personnel supporting refugees and asylum seekers. Earlier this year it was the Red Cross who were very much on the front line in the aftermath of those tragic Victorian bushfires. That work is continuing today as we speak in this parliament. I am a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Red Cross. When I was asked in this parliament to be a supporter of the Friends of Red Cross, I did not hesitate. If there is a symbol of humanity that stands large and bold out there in my eyes and my mind, it is the Red Cross. Yesterday in Federation Mall in front of Parliament House, at 7 on a very cold morning, it was a real privilege for me to join other parliamentarians and Red Cross volunteers in commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Geneva conventions. Robert Tickner, a former minister in the Hawke and Keating government who is now the CEO of the Red Cross in Australia, addressed those of us gathered on that cold lawn in front of Parliament House and presented to the Attorney-General a bound copy of the conventions, with the inclusion of the new convention. It may be symbolic, but I think it was important that that book, be it small, is a gift to this parliament. I understand it is the intention of the Attorney-General to make sure that it finds an appropriate place, either in the Parliamentary Library or another part of Parliament House. As I said, it is symbolic but also terribly important and a reminder of the great work of the Red Cross and the importance of the Geneva conventions. I want to commend the work of Red Cross in Australia. Yesterday’s commemoration was wonderful in recognising not only the conventions and their work, and what it stands for and means for us all as a model, but also the dedication of the Red Cross to helping people, regardless of their religious belief or the colour of their skin. I just say the Red Cross’s work is admirable. It has no boundaries; it is about humanitarian support and aid. Quite clearly, Henry MAIN COMMITTEE Dunant’s vision has been recognised and the work continued. I am sure, were he with us now, he would be so proud of his work in establishing the Red Cross so long ago. Last week I travelled with our defence subcommittee to Timor-Leste. I had visited TimorLeste on three occasions before ,when we were there with INTERFET helping the East Timorese establish their own democracy, which they had voted for. They wanted independence from Indonesia. I was able to witness some of the work that had gone on, albeit rather slowly but again as part of all the operations that have gone on through international support and AusAID. And there are some 610 Australian military personnel who are still helping them bring about a new democracy. The work also of many NGOs that I saw there is invaluable. One of those is the Red Cross. I also want to acknowledge the work that they have done in so many areas of conflict around the world, and in peace time here in Australia, but particularly the work that they are doing in Timor-Leste. I will just take a couple of moments to recognise the work of the Red Cross volunteers in my own electorate. I remember growing up as a little boy in Roma, a country town in western Queensland. The office of the Red Cross and the symbol of the red cross is something that remains an indelible imprint on my mind, along with the work of the volunteers. They were always doing it silently. They collected clothes and provided money or food assistance for those who were needy. They always did it silently, and they volunteered their time. I just want to acknowledge all of those people in my electorate. There are many Red Cross branches in my electorate. I want to acknowledge the work that they do. They are among the unsung heroes in our community, and I just continue to admire the work that they do. I want to recognise the work of the Red Cross volunteers in my electorate and across so many parts of Australia. It is just an honour to be part of this motion before the House. I commend it to the parliament. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (11.36 am)-I rise to also speak in support of this motion on the 60th anniversary of the four Geneva conventions of 1949. It is certainly an honour to be a member of this House and to have the opportunity to acknowledge the 60th anniversary and to give recognition to such important international humanitarian laws. As other speakers have noted-including the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP-tragically the world continues to experience armed conflict. There are many other speakers to this motion who are able to give much more detailed personal accounts of their experiences overseas that these conventions are in place to deal with and to provide protection from. Of course one such speaker was the member for Eden-Monaro. I think it is fair to say that all of the members of this parliament should thank the member for Eden-Monaro for not only his contribution on this motion but also his contribution in the military and his service, which he referred to in detail today. I know many of the speakers have spoken about the events throughout history that these conventions have been in place to provide some support and solace for. I think this is also an opportunity to reflect on the conventions and the protocols themselves and on what they are meant to achieve. When I was studying law I made the decision to do an elective subject on international law. I found it an interesting area that I wanted to understand in more detail. I have to say that it was one of the most frustrating areas of law to study, especially when dealing with international humanitarian laws. To know the impact of these laws, these conventions and these protocols and what they attempt to achieve throughout the world and to watch over MAIN COMMITTEE time the violations against these conventions, to watch countries and nations not sign up to certain conventions and to see the difficulty of enforcing these conventions and protocols at an international level was hard to come to terms with for me, as someone who believes that law is there to be enforced and to get results one way or the other. I acknowledge the amazing work that organisations and individuals do throughout the world in trying to bring countries, political parties, organisations and individuals to account at an international level for what they have done, for the atrocities they have been involved in against other people. That is why I want to take the opportunity to just look at these conventions and protocols and to put them into the record so that anyone who revisits this motion and these discussions about the 60th anniversary understands what the intent of these conventions is. The International Committee of the Red Cross have worked tirelessly in some of the most oppressed areas of the world and have seen some of the worse atrocities that have occurred throughout world history. They best summarise through their web site what the 1949 Geneva convention seeks to achieve. The Geneva conventions and their additional protocols are international treaties that contain the most important rules limiting the barbarity of war. They protect people who do not take part in the fighting: civilians, medics, aid workers and those who can no longer fightthe wounded, the sick, and shipwrecked troops and prisoners of war. The first Geneva convention protects wounded and sick soldiers on land during war. This convention represents the fourth updated version of the Geneva Convention on the Wounded and Sick following those adopted in 1864, 1906 and 1929. It contains 64 articles. These provide protection not only for the wounded and sick but also for medical and religious personnel, medical units and medical transports. The convention also recognises the distinctive emblems. It has two annexes containing a draft agreement relating to hospital zones and a model identity card for medical and religious personnel. The second Geneva convention protects wounded and sick shipwrecked military personnel at sea during war. This convention replaced The Hague convention of 1907 for the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva convention. It closely follows the provisions of the first Geneva convention in structure and content. It has 63 articles specifically applicable to war at sea. For example, it protects hospital ships. It has one annexe containing a model identity card for medical and religious personnel. The third Geneva convention applies to prisoners of war. This convention replaced the prisoners of war convention of 1929, and contained 143 articles whereas the 1929 convention had only 97. The categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war status were broadened in accordance with conventions one and two. The conditions and places of captivity were more precisely defined, particularly with regard to the labour of prisoners of war, their financial resources, the relief they received and the judicial proceedings instituted against them. The convention established the principle that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. We should not underestimate the importance of these conventions and, certainly, this third convention dealing with prisoners of war. We have heard of many atrocities over the years in relation to prisoners of war and the circumstances in which they have found themselves-the standards of their surroundings, their food provisions, the labour they were required to perform. We would all like to see an end to war in itself across the world. We must ensure that MAIN COMMITTEE conventions such as these remain in place to ensure protections for any prisoners who are taken into custody during wartime. The fourth Geneva convention affords protections to civilians, including in occupied territory-another worthy convention when you consider that the nature of war, and the nature of any sort of intervention in a nation, has changed considerably over the years. Although there is a lot less hand-to-hand combat and a lot more technology involved now, the reality is that we are still seeing many civilians being seriously injured or losing their lives as a consequence of these actions. We need to do more to protect these people, and that is why these conventions are in place. The Geneva conventions, which were adopted before 1949, were concerned with combatants only, not with civilians, and that is why this particular convention, adopted in 1949, was so important. To think that prior to 1949 we did not have a convention that provided safety or any rights or protections for civilians is hard to believe, but in fact it only occurred as a consequence of this convention in 1949. The events of World War II showed the disastrous consequences of the absence of a convention for the protection of civilians in wartime. The convention takes account of the experiences of World War II. It is composed of 159 articles and it contains a short section concerning the general protection of populations against certain consequences of war, without addressing the conduct of hostilities as such, which was later examined in the additional protocols of 1977. The bulk of the convention deals with the status and treatment of protected persons, distinguishing between the situation of foreigners on the territory of one of the parties to the conflict and that of civilians in occupied territory. It spells out the obligations of the occupying power vis-a-vis the civilian population and contains detailed provisions on humanitarian relief for populations in occupied territory. It also contains a specific regime for the treatment of civilian internees. It has three annexes containing a model agreement on hospital and safety zones, model regulations on humanitarian relief and model cards. Article3 common to the four Geneva conventions marked a breakthrough, as it covered for the first time situations of non-international armed conflicts. These types of conflicts vary greatly. They include traditional civil wars, internal armed conflicts that spill over into other states or internal conflicts in which third states or a multinational force intervenes alongside the government. Common article 3 establishes fundamental rules from which no derogation is permitted. It is like a mini convention within the conventions, as it contains the essential rules of the Geneva conventions in a condensed format and makes them applicable to conflicts not of an international character. It requires humane treatment for all persons in enemy hands, without any adverse distinction. It specifically prohibits murder; mutilation; torture; cruel, humiliating and degrading treatment; the taking of hostages; and unfair trial. It requires that the wounded, sick and shipwrecked be collected and cared for. It grants access to the International Committee of the Red Cross to offer its services to the parties of the conflict, and it calls on the parties to the conflict to bring all or parts of the Geneva conventions into force through so-called special agreements. It recognises that the application of these rules does not affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict. Given that most armed conflicts today are non-international, applying common article 3 is of the utmost importance. Its full respect is required. The problem is that we know that that particular convention is probably one of the most violated and breached conventions in the Geneva conventions of 1949. MAIN COMMITTEE The Geneva conventions entered into force on 21 October 1950. Ratification grew steadily through the decades, with 74 states ratifying the conventions during the 1950s, 48 states during the 1960s, 20 states during the 1970s, and another 20 states during the 1980s. Twenty-six countries ratified the conventions in the early 1990s, largely in the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and the former Yugoslavia. Seven new ratifications since 2000 have brought the total number of the states party to the conventions to 194, making the Geneva conventions universally applicable. The 60th anniversary gives all of us-government and non-government organisations, businesses, community organisations and the broader community-the opportunity to reflect on these conventions and protocols, to stop and think about what they seek to achieve and how, as individuals and as a collective group, we can go forward into the future and to do more to cease hostilities and to limit human suffering around the world. I would like to support the Attorney-General’s recognition of the extraordinary contribution made by many individual Australians, including the Australian Red Cross members, volunteers and staff, in carrying out the humanitarian ideals expressed in the conventions and additional protocols. Let us all work together, now and into the future, to see that these conventions are actually enforced and to ensure that full human rights and humanitarian protections are provided to all citizens across the world. ney-General and to support the comments that have been made by all speakers in the debate so far. Yesterday was a day of confirmation and celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Geneva conventions. To start with one family anecdote, a nice surprise for me from yesterday’s celebration was the finding of a new relative in the Hon. Robert Tickner. As of yesterday, we have now established that we are cousins of some form, probably much to the shock of half my family and much to the pleasure of the other half. For another reason I want to give another family anecdote, and that is that I am the grandson of someone who is probably a lot of the reason the Geneva conventions were established and we have them today. My grandfather was one of the five officers and 15 other ranks who survived to the end of the Sandakan death marches, as I have mentioned previously, and to the victory in the Pacific, on 15 August, 1945. However, two weeks after that date, on 27 August, those 20 individuals were murdered at the hands of their captors. They fell into the very difficult legal gap of not technically legally being prisoners of war yet not technically legally being able to be dealt with as civilians being murdered because documents at the end of the war were not technically signed until 2 September, so there was a very difficult window of about three weeks. I would have loved to have met my grandfather and I would hope he would have loved to have met me. And that is just one such example of someone falling into a legal trap at the end of the war: not technically a prisoner of war but not technically a civilian and therefore not able to be dealt with under international law. But out of those end of Second World War situations we saw negotiations start and we saw good principles develop through the four Geneva conventions. And the very good words in article 27 of the fourth Geneva convention give some small solace, I hope, for families in similar situations to our family who are ask: what is the point of those deaths? The point of those deaths, in some small way, is that we now have some established international law that leaves no-one behind. So article 27 is important. It says: MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Committees
272,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (11.51 Am),"I rise to support this motion moved by the AttorProtected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution or any form of indecent assault. Without prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by the Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion. These are good solid principles that I would hope every member of this place supports and, where possible, actively fights to protect and uphold. Whilst they are broad words-and quite often in international law we see words that are so broad that they can often be left to interpretation for the moment and really not achieve anything-I think what these four Geneva conventions over time have done, from way back in 1949, is set some broad principles which we have seen be defined by various courts of law and various international tribunals. From that slow evolution of the defining of these laws, I think today we have some really solid principles with some practical application. An example is the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia, which has done some really good, sound definitions of what is and what is not a prisoner of war and all those difficult questions about-I think it is article 3-armed conflict within a sovereign nation, what is and what is not armed conflict and what does and does not fall under these Geneva conventions. I think these are now all starting to be defined and 60 years later we have a stronger document and a stronger set of principles than we had in 1949. A good example of that is going on right now. I think Australia can be extremely proud of, and should probably talk more about, the work that is being done in Cambodia with the international tribunals in the prosecution of various principles attached to these Geneva conventions. The name Gareth Evans, for anyone who goes to Cambodia, is held in very high esteem. The Australian government generally is held in very high esteem and Australian law officials are intimately involved in what is happening now with the Duch trials and the various trials in the prosecution of these Geneva conventions. These are not broad, symbolic, flowery statements. They have practical applications. I was lucky enough to be in Cambodia in the early days of these trials and to see villagers coming with awe, shock and wonder to stand in the court and to listen to the evidence being given over 30 years later. This said to me that it has real practical application for the hearts and minds of individuals and families all around the world. That is the upside of the delivery of these Geneva conventions and something Australia should be, in that particular circumstance, very proud of. The downside is-the point was already made-man’s inhumanity to man and the folly that is attached to a lot of the decision making that goes on in the world and world affairs and what drives people to conflict. In the Cambodian situation, I would love every Australian to walk through those killing fields-to walk through S21-to get a real sense of the absolute brutality of the loss of principle that goes with man’s inhumanity to man when it all goes wrong. From that we drive home the importance of international conventions-and these Geneva conventions in particular-and within every single one of us the importance of the vigiMAIN COMMITTEE lance of protecting and upholding an understanding of these principles so that, whether within Australia or in any capacity where we have an engagement with the world, we do not allow ourselves, our friends, our family or our communities to go off the rails in dealing with our fellow man. That is probably a nice link into some local work that we are trying to get off the ground, and that is the expansion of the brand of the United Nations throughout the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Within political circles and within public debate in Australia-and I have mentioned this before in public addresses-I do think the United nations has copped some rough trade. An organisation that is doing some difficult work is an easy target at times. It is important for an area like the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, where there is probably not the amount of contact with the international community as you might find in many metropolitan communities or in Canberra, to try to engage better. That is why right at the moment we are trying to roll out the United Nations Association branches throughout the mid-North Coast, and we are getting some really good feedback from community members wanting to be involved. It gives me a lot of comfort that there is an interest and a desire within the Australian community to engage with the world as a friend, on peaceful terms, so I will certainly be following that work up and supporting it and helping wherever possible to promote the international message within the local community. It is a bit of a cliche in this place that all politics is local; in a lot of ways that is true but also, attached to that, international documents like the Geneva Conventions can be as local as you want them to be. The obligation on all of us in this place is to make these documents local, make them relevant and endorse and promote Australia’s international role of being a good fellow citizen within the world community. These documents are an excellent way of doing that. I finish where I started, in that my example of the family story is told 100 or a 1,000 times over around the world. Unless we have international law that can prosecute when things go wrong and protect those, whether they are prisoners of war or innocents caught up in an armed conflict situation, unless we have documents in place and unless we have people in place willing to uphold those documents, the world is a worse place. That is why these Geneva conventions are so important, the 60th anniversaries are so important. I hope that all members of this chamber will take the time to do a Wiki search or get a quick understanding, if they do not have one already, or just reconfirm and then go about the business of promoting these principles far and wide. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (12.03 pm)-I thank the Attorney-General for moving a motion to recognise these important anniversaries, and I welcome the government’s ratification yesterday of the third additional protocol to the Geneva conventions. The Geneva conventions, whose 60th anniversary was celebrated yesterday, are part of the essential humanitarian codex. Indeed, they are one of the most recognisable sets of agreed international conduct. ‘Geneva conventions’ is itself a phrase that is often used as shorthand in other contexts for the kinds of rules that ought to govern our conduct in difficult circumstances. In a recent interview with CNN, Charlotte Lindsey of the International Committee of the Red Cross noted: On a daily basis, living in a war zone, you see examples of the conventions being applied. Every time a soldier is captured and moved to a prison, or a wounded soldier is collected by an ambulance, that is an application of the Geneva Conventions. MAIN COMMITTEE People forget that they are rooted in the law because they seem such evident needs and evident rights that people have. The Geneva conventions set down important protections for civilian populations, wounded combatants and prisoners of war. The recognised significance of these protections is underlined by the fact that the Geneva conventions still represent the only piece of international law to have been ratified by all member states of the United Nations. It is, as the Attorney-General has noted, a mark of their primacy that this is so. It is also a reminder, however, of the progress that remains to be made in reaching global consensus and adherence to many other crucially important instruments of international law. Last year, for example, we saw the signing of the treaty banning the use of cluster munitions. Wherever they are used, cluster bombs lie unexploded on the ground and in trees, killing and maiming civilians and rendering vast tracts of land unusable for years after conflicts end. I saw this graphically for myself in Kosovo and Lebanon. The cluster munitions convention has now been signed by more than 100 states, including Australia, and it is to be hoped that the ban on these appalling weapons will eventually be supported by all. The notion of ‘humanitarian warfare’ can rightly be regarded as perhaps the best or worse example of a contradiction in terms. Certainly, we should never allow the achievement of the Geneva conventions and other like instruments to in any way mask the fact that war itself should be avoided and opposed where possible or otherwise brought to the quickest end possible. On the question of progress with respect to the scope of the conventions themselves, I note that in a recent interview, Knut Dormann, the head of the Legal Division of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has observed that the protections provided by the Geneva conventions do not extend far enough in the case of civil conflict. The adoption in 1977 of additional protocol II strengthened the protection for victims of non-international conflict, but it remains the case that there is more to be done in this area. In JuneI moved a motion on the subject of the conflict in Sri Lanka. On that occasion, I expressed concerns that had been raised by the United Nations and by humanitarian NGOs on the ground in Sri Lanka about the conditions and circumstances of some 300,000 Sri Lankan Tamils living in displacement camps. As most of the contributors to the debate on that motion clearly recognised, it is critical that civil conflicts and the aftermath of those conflicts are governed by appropriate humanitarian law. On this point, Knut Dormann has observed: … there is currently no detailed framework establishing procedural safeguards for people interned for security reasons in relation to non-international armed conflicts. Again, that is something the international community should be prepared to work towards. As Chair of the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF and the Australia-UN Parliamentary GroupI also want to make particular note of the fact that when it comes to civilians affected by war it is often women and children who suffer the most. The Progress of the World’s Women 2008-09 report of UNIFEM, entitled Who answers to women?, which was released yesterday, noted that the use of sexual violence against women is now an established tactic in armed conflict. Such violence is a way of affecting an entire community into the next generation, because women may be too damaged from it to bear children, or they may become pregnant or be infected with HIV-AIDS following a rape. The UNIFEM report quotes a former United Nations forces commander saying: MAIN COMMITTEE … it is more dangerous to be a woman than to be a soldier in the Eastern DRC. That is, the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. This morning in my office I had a visit from the group Friends of ‘Comfort Women’, including a survivor of the military-sexual slavery system during World War II, Ms Gil Won Ok from Korea. Ms Gil Won Ok was taken by the Japanese military from Pyongyang as a 13year-old child to China and kept in sexual slavery for five years, during which time she was forcibly sterilised and suffered so many torments that she says, ‘it would take months to tell them all’. She never saw her family again and has not been able to have a family of her own. She said, ‘I came into this world as a human being but I have not been able to live as a human being for 81 years. People think that because it happened so long ago we would forget, but I live with it every day, and every night I’m still fighting them in my dreams.’ The Friends of ‘Comfort Women’, supported by Amnesty International, are seeking an official apology from the Japanese government. In June last year, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for a resolution that recognised sexual violence as a war crime and a crime against humanity, and called for a security response. Now that this crime has been recognised by the international community, it is my hope that Ms Gil Won Ok and her fellow comfort-women survivors, who are now quite elderly, will receive the recognition and apology they so desire and deserve. It must be acknowledged that challenges and imperfections do exist in the area of international humanitarian law. Conduct in breach of the conventions is certainly occurring even now-witness reports of atrocities, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, mistreatment of detainees and practices such as extraordinary rendition. Of course, the expansion of the field of application of international humanitarian law beyond situations of international armed conflict between states to more often situations of non-international conflicts involving non-state armed groups has raised a significant number of challenges. Oxfam has pointed to violence in Afghanistan, Columbia, DRC and Sudan as examples of the increasingly indiscriminate nature of modern conflicts. ICRC President Kellenberger has also noted the increasing complexity of armed conflicts and the difficulty of distinguishing between combatants and civilians as well as phenomena such as terrorism. However, this should not be regarded as evidence that the conventions themselves are ineffective, nor that the multilateral institutions that seek to uphold such law are ineffective. The Geneva conventions remain, as I said at the outset, one of the greatest expressions of humanitarian principles and one of the most powerful frameworks of humanitarian practice. I worked for the UN in places like Kosovo, Gaza and Lebanon. The Geneva conventions were the shield that we used as protection for ourselves and the vulnerable populations we assisted. Unfortunately, and shockingly, United Nations staff have increasingly been the targets of attacks. I am keenly aware that 19 August next week will be the sixth anniversary of the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, which killed more than 20 people-including several of my UN colleagues I knew in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission as well as my good friend Jean-Selim Kanaan. I dedicated my first speech in this place to Jean-Selim and his war against indifference. I am pleased that the Australian government, in its recently announced changes to counterterrorism offences, will be recognising that international organisations such as the UN can be the target of terrorist violence. MAIN COMMITTEE Significant progress has also been made in enforcing compliance with the Geneva conventions through the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the establishment of the International Criminal Court, among other international processes, which recognise that violations of the Geneva conventions are criminal offences for which individuals can be held accountable. Earlier this year, as a member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, I attended a workshop in Jakarta, the aim of which was to encourage Indonesia to ratify the International Criminal Court Statute, as it has committed to doing on a number of occasions. Now that the elections in Indonesia are over, we are hopeful that ICC ratification will occur in the near future and that many other countries will follow Indonesia’s example. Currently the Rome statute of the ICC has 139 signatories and 110 ratifications. There are many Australian peacekeepers participating in humanitarian endeavours in trouble spots around the world. It is only right that on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva conventions we remember and honour the good work that is done and we continue to believe that there is both the capacity and the will in humankind to make progress-even if it is achingly slow-towards the sometimes seemingly impossible ideals of global tolerance, cooperation, justice and peace. be able to speak in the debate on the motion on the Geneva conventions. I travelled at Christmas across to Egypt and had some dealings with the international Red Cross in Egypt, Nepal, Peru and India. I saw first hand the work being done by the international Red Cross. I will get into that a little bit more in a moment. In these times of uncertainty, with wars in the Middle East, with terrorism lurking on every doorstep, I find comfort in reflecting on the signing of the Geneva conventions some 60 years ago. I find hope that the initiatives shown all those years ago to create and to promote a doctrine of universal human decency are still alive today. I think that is the thing that we need to reflect upon most in this debate-that is, it is all about humanity and human decency regardless of the times or the circumstances that we find ourselves in. It is interesting to note that those same fundamental principles were the foundation of the conventions and that they remain in place as an important and relevant part of our society today. In 1962 Henri Dunant published his book A Memory of Solferino about the horrors or the First World War and the four treaties that now make up the Geneva Conventions of 1949. If he were here I am sure Henri would be pleased to see that the rules and regulations that were dreamt of in those days have been enacted today and that his vision is taking placing and will live on well into the future. I believe that the same planned, logical thinking that eventuated in the Geneva Conventions can and should apply to politics as well. Decisions that we make today should be made with the future generations in mind. Moral standpoints that transcend party politics should not be ignored but welcomed as a compass for our policy making. It is a testament to the first of the conventions that the Red Cross remains as strong and as prevalent as ever. I have travelled the world and I have run across half of it and I have seen first hand the incredible work being done by the International Red Cross and the laws that are implemented on a daily basis in fields of conflict. The Geneva Conventions consist of four treaties and three Additional Protocols that set the standards of international law for humanitarian treatment of victims of war. The singular term ‘Geneva Convention’ refers to the agreements of 1949, which were negotiated in the afterMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Committees
273,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (12.13 Pm),"CanI say at the outset that I am very pleased tomath of World War II after having seen the horrific circumstances that took place during the course of World War II. The Geneva Conventions comprise rules that apply in times of armed conflict and seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in those hostilities. It takes care of and protects wounded and sick fighters, prisoners of war, civilians and people who are not involved in the conflict at that point in time. It protects women and children on the fields of battle from having their rights violated just because they found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time when a war has erupted around them. The most serious crimes are termed ‘grave breaches’ and provide a legal definition of a war crime. Also considered under ‘grave breaches’ of the four Geneva Conventions are the following: the taking of hostages; extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; and unlawful deportation, transfer or confinement. Nations who are party to these treaties must enact and enforce legislation penalising any of these crimes. As I mentioned early on, during the last Christmas break I had the opportunity to visit Egypt. While I was there I met with the Secretary General of the International Red Cross, Professor Mamdouh Gabr, who was heading up operations there in Egypt, and the Director General, Dr Magda el-Sherbiny. During the course of my conversations with them they took a phone call in relation to the bombing of a school on the Gaza Strip. I saw the horror on their faces as the circumstances unfolded and I saw how they dealt with those circumstances. I have to tell you, quite honestly, that the professionalism that is dished out in circumstances such as this by each and every person involved with the International Red Cross is to be admired. It is certainly something that this world cannot live without. I remember asking the professor, ‘How on earth can you possibly deal with both sides of a conflict with compassion and without feeling some form of resentment for the actions that they have taken?’ He replied, ‘We would not be who we are and we could not do the job that we are expected to do if we did take sides.’ These people risk their lives and send their volunteers into situations where conflict is happening all around them to protect and care for the injured, to save lives and to protect the people around them regardless of which side of the conflict they are on. They live and breathe the word ‘humanitarian’. The No. 1 thing that stands out in my mind in relation to the Geneva convention is how in times of conflict-and all nations have found themselves in conflict over years gone by and probably will in the future-we need to reflect on the most important principle of all: the value of a single human life. We need to reflect on the quality of a single human life as well. We need to make sure that we always, even though we may have disagreements that bring us to arms, consider these people and their rights during any disputes that we or other nations may have. We must always uphold these rights. That is what this recognition in this debate is all about. It is important that we place it front and centre in the minds of every single Australian, both young and old, so we never find ourselves in the situation where we have put politics, legislation, wealth or greed in front of humanity. signing of the Geneva convention. I am somewhat intimidated by the fact that chairing these proceedings is the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Mr Kelvin Thomson. I MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Committees
274,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.22 Pm),"I am pleased to speak on the 60th anniversary of thehope I can make a contribution that meets with your approval. I listened to the honourable member for Fremantle, who of course had an outstanding service record before she came here. Certainly on both sides of parliament we rejoice in that. As a member of parliament I have had the privilege of going to Rwanda, Somalia, several times to East Timor and Bougainville. Bougainville per capita was one of the bloodiest conflicts. It is really sad that as we are now well and truly in the new century and the new millennium there does not seem to be an abatement of man’s inhumanity to man. The Geneva convention, which is 60 years old, is very important in the conduct of formal warfare. These days we live in the era of terrorism where the target of the attack is the civilian population and the idea is that maximum damage be done and headlines gained. There is no formal declaration of war and none of the formalities. I think it is all very sad. If we can sign the Geneva convention, hopefully in the future we will have an era where terrorism does not exist. The Geneva convention is a collection of four treaties and three additional protocols that are ratified in whole or with reservations by 194 countries. Although in the House yesterday we commemorated the 60th anniversary of the Geneva convention, most of the protections it affords in fact predate the 1949 agreement. The convention defines the basic rights of those captured during military conflict, establishes protections for the wounded and addresses protections for civilians in and around a war zone. It took almost four months to agree to the terms of the convention but many still consider it a miracle that agreement was ever reached, considering the signatory states effectively agreed to relinquish sovereignty for international law when engaged in conflict. As I pointed out, sovereign states are usually not the proponents of terrorist acts. The architects of the Geneva convention were the International Committee of the Red Cross. In April this year in Geneva, together with my colleagues and led by the Speaker, I was pleased to visit, amongst some other organisations, the International Committee of the Red Cross. We met with the vice-president there, and I was truly impressed by the work that they do. In 2007 the International Committee of the Red Cross provided food for more than 2.5 million people and emergency supplies such as tents and blankets for almost four million people. Its water and sanitation construction project supported 14.3 million people, and around 2.9 million-more than half of them children-benefited from the International Committee of the Red Cross supported healthcare facilities. Of course, the International Committee of the Red Cross, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Macarthur, do go into these conflict zones. They do not take sides. In that way I think warring parties or factions can gain confidence from the committee’s involvement there. They seek to protect civilians and provide emergency aid. I should mention for the record that the International Committee of the Red Cross is a key partner in the Australian aid program for international humanitarian assistance. Over the past several years Australia has steadily increased its core funding in addition to responding to ICRC appeals. Thus far in 2009 Australia has provided $16 million. Of this, $14.8 million is a core funding contribution. In 2008 Australia contributed approximately $23.5 million, of which $12 million was for core funding. More recently, the third protocol of the Geneva convention has introduced a new protective emblem, the Red Crystal. The Geneva convention is not just a series of documents or a blueprint for international law. It should serve as a living memorial to all those innocent civilians MAIN COMMITTEE who suffered and perished in times of war, particularly World War II. We should all be grateful for the convention. I just hope that in the future it will not have to be honoured, as we will have reduced conflict around the world.

Farrer Electorate: Community Partners Program Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.41 pm)-I would like to bring the House’s attention to a situation in Broken Hill, in the west of my electorate. The Broken Hill Multicultural Women’s Resource and Information Centre have recently been denied funding by the Department of Health and Ageing, under the Community Partners Program. They have received this funding for the last two years and now they will be forced to close. How much funding? Just $70,000. That is really a drop in the ocean and we are so disappointed. It is beyond comprehension that the government could not see their way to provide this small amount of money for an organisation which, in turn, assists residential aged-care homes and provides community-care resources for migrants as they age. Broken Hill is a town that was built on migration. At least 12 per cent of the population are older migrants. Their children have left and they are, in many cases, without support and without resources. This program has previously been delivered in Broken Hill. It has been a huge success in assisting service providers with culturally specific training on the difficulties that face migrants as they age. The Community Partners Program funding was advertised as giving regional areas priority. I saw it myself on the website but the outcome, as we often see, is completely different. The only regional area, apart from Sydney and the Illawarra, receiving a grant is Lismore. No areas west of the Great Divide are to receive funding. Lismore, Sydney and the Illawarra were lucky enough to get funding under the Community Partners Program. They all deserve the money they got. I do not suggest for one moment that funding should be withdrawn from the coast, but why advertise a program as looking after regional areas and then not provide the money? The centre has been running for 22 years. It has assisted migrants, particularly women with issues facing them due to relocation in a new country and the isolation they experience in an outback city. The inability to access this funding will probably mean the centre will have to close. It is an untenable situation. It will mean the closest migrant services will be in Adelaide and Dubbo-that is, 756 kilometres to Dubbo and 512 kilometres to Adelaide. As I said, Broken Hill was built on migration and these people are ageing. It is more important than ever that we assist them. I ask the Minister for Health and Ageing to review this decision and to give consideration to the circumstances of this outback mining city. It has become apparent to me that, too often, there is a lack of comprehension by this government of the issues faced by rural and regional Australia. The distances are getting no less but, time and time again, I hear of a decision made by a bureaucrat based in Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney, which is then approved by their city based minister. They seem to think it is okay; well, I don’t. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Committees
275,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.41 Pm),"I move:I spoke this morning to Eleanor Blows, who is the coordinator of the Broken Hill Multicultural Women’s Resource and Information Centre. She painted a picture of what that centre does. What hurt her the most was that the response it got from the department was, ‘You’re really just a social group.’ How absolutely incorrect. The department knows what this centre does because it has been funding it for two years. The department is providing only $70,000 but it has been funding them. They are not just a social group. They have monthly meetings and they link in this frail older group of migrants with important people in the community. For example, the local doctor will come and talk to them in a non-threatening session and, likewise, the local pharmacist. Yes, there are social aspects to this group but that follows on from the real work of integrating migrants into residential aged care and helping the local health service and local doctors provide them with what they need. I have often seen migrant ladies sitting in a corner of a residential health facility, unable to communicate and possibly suffering from dementia. To have that resource there perhaps to provide these ladies with music in their own language or the nursing staff with a book of words that they can use to help them understand these people is, I think, important. There are Italians, Germans, Filipinos, Afghans, Greeks, Yugoslavs, Lebanese and Russians in Broken Hill and they all deserve this support as they age. Residential aged-care facilities are good but they need additional support when migrants are moved into them. The local area health service is struggling desperately with fundinganyone who is acquainted with New South Wales knows that-and so this resource becomes more important than ever. Wakefield Electorate: Mallala Community Hospital Wakefield Electorate: Vietnam Veterans Charity Walk community events that have occurred in my electorate over the last week. The first was the annual fundraiser for the Mallala Community Hospital, which was a very fun affair. It featured the renowned political journalist, Annabel Crabb, and our own Grant Cameron from the local ABC. It was a terrific fundraiser. There were a lot of familiar faces from places like Balaklava, Mallala, Two Wells, Owen, Hamley Bridge and Gawler. It was a night of great humour. Mac Crabb, who is the chairman of the Mallala hospital board, is Annabel’s father. I think he helped to get her that night. It was a chance for Annabel to come home. I was reassured in the middle of her speech when she said about politicians: Most of them are good on the whole and well motivated. There are not many bad guys, only there for personal gain and power building. She then went on to rather ruthlessly, I think, make fun of us all-it was done in very good humour-to the delight of the crowd. It was a really great night, and I cannot tell you how much fun I had being there. It was reported in the local Bunyip newspaper as ‘Mallala becomes centre of political discussion’. In the Plains Producer it was reported as ‘Talking politics pays off’. A great night was had by all. Mallala hospital is a particularly important institution for the town. It has a very active board, which is made up of Maxine Varcoe, who is the CEO, Ian Jenkin, Richard Verner, Mac Crabb, whom I have mentioned, Jenny Irish, John Tiller, Denise Goward, Sharon Henderson MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
276,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (12.46 Pm),"I rise to inform the House about two greatand Carol Baker. Over the last four years, they have raised over $150,000 for the hospital, which is a tremendous effort, and last Friday night, they raised $7,500. I am proud to say that I did my bit by bidding $100 for a signed bottle of the member for North Sydney’s wine. I have that in my cellar back home in the City of Salisbury. I am sure he will be reassured to know that. The event was very popular and very well chaired by Paul Angus, who was the MC for the night. It was a very enjoyable evening. It is a great hospital and a great town, and I would like to commend them all on their efforts. The other event in my electorate this week is the annual walk by Vietnam veterans from Port Augusta down to Kapunda. They did this walk in 2007 and raised approximately $30,000. This year, as I said, they are walking from Port Augusta to Wilmington, Gladstone, Clare and Kapunda. It is a journey of over 450 kilometres. There are overnight stays in Wilmington, Gladstone, Clare and Kapunda. They will arrive tomorrow in Kapunda, where they will be met by Mr Keith Payne VC, a very brave man, who has served this country admirably. Mr Payne will address the local high school-the high school that I am a graduate of, I am proud to say-and also the local primary school. It is a great event both for the Vietnam veterans and for the young people who are attending school in Kapunda. I am very proud to say that the town has really got behind this event. I have to acknowledge the local sponsors: the Light Regional Council, led by Mayor Hornsey; Pat Hayward and Pam Laver, who are organising the trip; the Kapunda Football Club; JT Johnsons, a very prominent business; Roof Seal-Kapunda; Prior’s Auto Service; the Kapunda newsagency; and Menzel’s Meats. It is good to see all of those local businesses and local people, including, of course, the local branch of the RSL, getting behind such a good cause. This will raise money for the Vietnam Vets Children’s Education Fund, Legacy South Australia and Foundation Daw Park, which looks after South Australia’s repatriation hospital. My grandfather was treated in that hospital many years ago, and I know just how important it is for veterans and their families. I should also mention teachers Peter Norde and Jennette Mickan from Kapunda High School and Di Jamieson and Brett Cummins from Kapunda Primary School, as well as Andrew Hayward from the Kapunda footy club, local Vietnam vets John Rees and Kevin Hudson and, of course, all the other people involved in this great event. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Crime North Sydney’s wine, and I am sure he will give us some feedback on that. This afternoon, I wish to raise in the parliament the recent crime wave that has hit my electorate of Swan. It is one of the sad contradictions of life that criminals choose to target areas in which people who can least afford to lose their possessions live. This has been the case in my electorate, with the areas of Belmont, Rivervale, East Victoria Park, Manning and St James being particularly affected. Over the last few months I have noticed a steady increase in such calls to my office from people in these suburbs, and I suspect that crime figures have increased. David Glossop of East Victoria Park wrote to me. Last week an 80-year-old man had his house broken into at 2am. Gary on the corner ... had his house broken into and had things stolen.... The deli on the corner of Devenish and Westminster has been broken into many times, costing thousands of dollars for repair. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Adjournment
277,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.51 Pm),"I hope the member for Wakefield enjoys the member forI have had my own vehicle broken into twice costing me $1000’s in repairs and so far one trespasser has been caught on my property. The local community has had enough. In a recent phone chat that I had with a Cloverdale constituent, she told me about her experience of her place being broken into. Others have been reporting burglaries, graffiti and general antisocial behaviour. No-one should have to put up with this. Sadly, the crimes appear to be getting more violent. Two recent incidents have been of particular concern. In Rivervale, a son managed to defend his mother against a violent attempt to break into the family home. A day later, Helen, a blind woman, was cowardly bashed by criminals while she was standing on her own property, waiting for a friend to pick her up. One thug pushed her to the ground and another punched her in the stomach as they snatched her bag. Speaking to the West Australian, Helen said: I just want to warn people when they’re out in the street, even if you are not ill, even if you’re not blind, don’t take it for granted that people coming towards, or behind you, are safe to deal with. I can think of few lower or more cowardly acts of crime. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will agree that something must be done to reverse these worrying trends. The WA police and local government offer a range of good initiatives aimed at helping the community combat preventable crime. I have prepared a pack with information on some of these programs, which I will distribute to residents across the electorate. However, I want to take this opportunity to briefly mention some of these programs today. The City of Belmont offers a free security appraisal of premises and the city is also about to roll out its excellent CCTV Alarm Assist initiatives. For more information on these initiatives, residents can call the City of Belmont or my office. I could go on and speak more about the programs that are in the pack, but due to the time limit I would just like to say that, as parliamentarians, we should maintain the pressure on crime and also maintain its public profile within our electorates to make sure that people are aware that it is still around and that it is causing many sad moments in the lives of people in our electorates. Telstra Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.54 pm)-TodayI would like to raise an issue that has caused great concern in my electorate and, I am sure, in other electorates throughout Australia, and that is the reluctance of Telstra to respond to problems experienced by constituents and the impact that that is having on them. I am not talking about the $2.02 fee per transaction for paying an account by cash-I will raise that at another time. Rather, it is Telstra’s failure to address the issues that my office raises with them. Previously, the contact person at Telstra was able to resolve most of these issues without too many problems. It is with great reluctance that I have had to bring this to the parliament today, because no matter how hard that person in Telstra tries I still have a number of issues that are unresolved. If people reading the Hansard could see these, I have about a centimetre full of issues that relate to unresolved complaints. They are from people like Christine, who paid her account and, after much problem with Telstra, transferred to another provider. Telstra owes her a hundred dollars. There is Helen, whose husband died. She has had trouble transferring the account across to her name and had her telephone number quarantined and her mobile disconnected. Another couple had ongoing problems with an account. They were signed up to MAIN COMMITTEE a Blackberry over the phone. When it arrived they said, ‘I do not want this,’ but they keep receiving accounts for this Blackberry that they had returned immediately after receiving it. There is a litany of complaints that I have received in my office. I would like to call on Telstra to be much more receptive to the concerns of their customers and to the concerns of people that have contacted their office and whom I have contacted on their behalf, and to resolve some of the problems that are real issues for these people. Given the fact that there is a time constraint, I will finish here but I would like to reiterate that it is time for Telstra to act and be receptive and do something for all these people. Landcare the issues of climate change and Penny Wong is touring the countryside buying up properties and water rights on the premise that it will save our depleted waterways, it is very surprising that the government would dramatically change funding for Landcare groups. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has admitted that, thanks to his reshuffle of funding for Landcare, there are now only 56 facilitators to cover the entire country. The government has introduced a funding model which now puts Landcare groups in competition with one another for funding. Under the new system, 70 per cent of funding must go toward funding grants, leaving only 30 per cent for wages of staff. Despite the minister’s assurance that funding levels have not decreased, he cannot guarantee-and he will not-that Landcare groups on the ground will not suffer. It does show that the minister is totally out of touch. Landcare, as we know, is made up of volunteer farmers-farmers who take time out of their busy day to contribute to their local environment and community. It is these volunteers, who rely on the expertise of paid Landcare facilitators, who help local groups in so many ways-to identify problems, to provide advice on funding opportunities and to help draft proposals. Local farmers just do not have the time to keep up with government funding. They are not always in a position to be able to draft proposals to access funding. In an ABC Radio interview, the minister failed to accept responsibility for the reduction of staff in areas in Victoria-and in some areas, such as the Mallee, they are down to one paid facilitator for the entire region. The minister must take responsibility. He is the one who approved the change. He should speak to farmers on the ground and other Landcare operators and actually do something that helps farmers care for their environment. Banking: Occupational Health and Safety Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (12.58 pm)-I met recently with the delegation from the New South Wales branch of the Finance Sector Union to discuss the recommendations arising from the national review into model occupational health and safety laws. Among the group were three women-Anne, Narelle and Debbie-who had all been subjected to violent hold-ups while working in local branch offices. They are particularly concerned about the recommendation which could put an end to the ability of unions to commence prosecution over safety issues in the workplace. Anne was a bank manager when she was attacked in a hold-up in 2002. She was kicked unconscious, suffering permanent back and psychological injury. The incident was reportable to WorkCover New South Wales but no action was taken against her employer, even though she had previously reported the obvious gaps in branch security measures. Narelle worked at MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Adjournment
278,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (12.57 Pm),"At a time when the government is talking abouta suburban branch which was robbed four times in nine months between August 2002 and April 2003. She and her workmates were confronted with screwdrivers and sledgehammers. The doors were smashed as the offenders took advantage of a security weakness that the branch head office had been informed about. After the fourth hold-up, the FSU commenced court action against that particular bank. The bank pleaded guilty and was fined $175,000. Debbie’s workplace was attacked in September 2004 by three offenders, at least one of whom was armed with a handgun. The union had had 23 exchanges with the bank’s head office about weaknesses in security measures. After the attack on Debbie’s branch, the union commenced court action, again for a breach of the act. The bank pleaded guilty and was fined $145,000. I raise these three case studies because it was cases like this that led the FSU to begin its compliance campaign against the banks to bring about better safety standards. In 2002, when the campaign began, there were 106 bank hold-ups in New South Wales. They have now fallen to about 20. Most banks, as we know, now have full-height antijump barriers, ATM bunkers and digital CCTV with live back-to-base monitoring. I ask: what would have been the outcome if the union did not have a statutory right to initiate prosecutions? I thank the FSU for bringing this matter to my attention and to Anne, Narelle and Debbie for sharing their traumatic experiences with me. I firmly believe in the right of unions to undertake prosecutions for safety breaches, and I believe this is fundamental to the well-being of all Australian workers. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government: Moncrieff Electorate (Question No. 587) Mr Ciobo asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 10 February 2009: In respect of the Government’s funding of organisations and projects between 3 December 2007 and 20 January 2009: (a) which organisations and projects based in the Moncrieff electorate received funding from the Minister’s department; (b) what sum of funding did each organisation and project receive; and (c) for what purpose was each funding commitment made. All projects funded within the Moncrieff electorate are available on the Department’s website. Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs: Phone Survey (Question No. 709) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2009: (1) Is she aware that her department conducted a phone survey on domestic violence during March 2009. (2) How many people were surveyed. (3) How many departmental staff were involved in conducting this survey. (4) If the survey was not conducted by departmental staff, what sum of money did this survey cost the Government. (5) What questions did the survey put to respondents. (6) What was the purpose of the survey. (7) Will another survey of this type be conducted; if so, will it ask whether it is acceptable for a person to criticize another person for domestic meals. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. At the White Ribbon Foundation’s White Tie Dinner held in September 2008, the Prime Minister publicly announced $2 million would be invested to benchmark community attitudes on domestic violence and sexual assault. The household phone survey was a key component of this project. (2) A total of 12,900 people nationally comprising a general national community survey of 10,000 people; 2,500 persons from selected Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds; and 400 Indigenous Australians. (3) None. The survey is being conducted by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation in association with the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Social Research Centre. (4) As at 20 June 2009, $1.8million of the allocated $2million had been paid. The balance is payable on completion of the survey later this year. (5) The survey includes modules that assess community attitudes of what constitutes domestic violence, sexual violence and sexual harassment; understanding of the consequences or harm caused",173,Adjournment
279,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:by violence; whether violence is ever excusable; myths and beliefs about victims and perpetrators; and impacts of previous awareness campaigns. (6) To gauge contemporary Australian attitudes on domestic violence and sexual assault to provide a baseline from which to measure the outcomes of future national anti-violence initiatives and improve the Government’s understanding of strategies that are effective in reducing violence. (7) Because the 2009 survey is intended to provide a benchmark, it will be necessary to repeat it at subsequent intervals to measure attitudinal change to violence against women and their children. At this stage no date has been set for the next survey. The current survey asks no questions about domestic meals and it is not anticipated that such a question would be asked in any future survey. Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs: Intergovernmental Agreements (Question No. 738) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2009: In respect of any intergovernmental agreements that exist in the Minister’s portfolio: (a) how many exist; (b) what are their (i) names, and (ii) objectives and purposes; (c) what are the names of the parties to each; and (d) will the Minister provide a copy of each; if not, why not.

(2) What is included in the government schools line item in Budget Paper No. 1, other than the National Specific Purpose Payment (SPP) for government schools ($3.3 billion) and the National Partnerships. (3) Is there a reference in Budget Paper No. 3 to the capital grants program for non-government schools; if so, on what page and line items is this located. (4) Does funding provided under annual appropriations (see PBS, page 75) sit in Table 7, pages 6 to18, of Budget Paper 1; under line item ‘School education-specific funding’; and for Government schools, is this funding additional to the National SPP for Government schools. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Table 2.51 in Budget Paper No. 3 and Table7 of Statement 6 in Budget paper No. 1 are budget papers produced for different purposes. Table 2.51 details payments to support state education services, and Table7 is a summary of expenses for the purposes of education which takes into account other Commonwealth own purpose expenses. The data published in Budget paper No.1 was compiled by the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the data published in Budget Paper No.3 was compiled by the Department of Treasury. (2) The government schools line item in Budget paper No.1, incorporates expenses for the purposes of education including Commonwealth own purpose expenditure in addition to the estimated expenses for the SPP and National Partnerships. (3) There is no reference in Budget Paper No3 to the Capital Grants program for non-government schools. (4) Funding provided under annual appropriations in Table 2.2.3 in the DEEWR Portfolio Budget Statements is included in Table7 under line item ‘School Education’ specific funding. This funding is in addition to the National SPP for government schools and National Partnerships. Education: National Partnerships (Question No. 826) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the National Partnerships where funding will be provided to the States and Territories which will then enter into agreements with non-government education authorities: (a) what are the terms of these agreements for each National Partnership, and the details of progress; (b) will these agreements be publicly available; if so, on what date; (c) what sum of money will nongovernment authorities be required to contribute; (d) what impact will this have on small independent schools; (e) will the funding be based on enrolments; if so what are the details; and (f) will the nongovernment education authorities report to the States and Territories or the Commonwealth. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) In November 2008, COAG endorsed 3 Smarter Schools National Partnerships (NP) designed to drive educational reforms in Australian schools. The NPs are available at www.coag.gov.au. The systems have worked together to develop arrangements for implementation of the NPs in each state and territory, and have agreed a methodology for the distribution of funds. This has been a process of negotiation between the Government and non-government sectors and the Commonwealth welcomes the collaborative approach taken by all school systems. The states and territories have developed Preliminary Implementation Plans and Bilateral Agreements triggering the initial flow of funding to each sector to facilitate reforms. The Commonwealth will continue to work with states and territories to further refine the Preliminary Implementation Plans with Final Implementation Plans expected to be in place in October 2009 (b) The Final Implementation Plans will be publically released after they have been finalised in late 2009. (c) States and territories will match the level of investment for the funds paid under the facilitation component across the three NPs. The proportion of each sector’s contribution to this co-investment will be negotiated between the sectors. (d) School sectors within each State and Territory will negotiate the share and source of each sector’s contribution to the co-investment. The sectors will need to determine an appropriate approach to this, taking into consideration the effects at the school level including for small independent schools. (e) The methodology for the indicative distribution of facilitation funding differs across the three Smarter Schools NPs. For the Improving Teacher Quality NP this has been determined on the basis of state shares of the national Full-Time Equivalent teaching staff; for the Low SES School Communities NP this has been determined by student enrolments in disadvantaged schools and the school-aged population who reside in the most disadvantaged Census Collection Districts; and for the Literacy and Numeracy NP it has been determined by the total number of students at or below minimum standards (NAPLAN 2008) in reading and numeracy for Years 3, 5 and 7. (f) The states and territories will provide reports to the Commonwealth against the implementation milestones, achievement of reform targets and timelines, for both the Government and nongovernment sector, as detailed in Bilateral Agreements.",178,Questions In Writing
