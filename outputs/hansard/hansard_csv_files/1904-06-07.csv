Sir Williamlyne The Prime Minister I F He Will .Endeavour To Ascertain Whether The States Governments Are Prepared To Avail Themselves Of The Ad","vantages which it is proposed to offer under the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill, in connection with the production of iron from Australian ore. In the event of their not being so disposed, will the Prime Minister consider the desirableness of taking further action, instead of allowing the matter to remain in abeyance? pose to again approach the States Governments, and ascertain whether any of them have came to a conclusion different from that conveyed to the Federal Government some time ago. any to Manufactures Bill, on the line's suggested when the Bill was first under consideration, the Government will be quite prepared to assist in passing the Bill without delay.

11,Mr Batchelor Laid Upon The Table,"an order p f the House, all the papers in regard to the appointment of the Commissioner of Patents were laid upon the table on the 22nd March last. The papers supplied were the originals, not copies, and the Department of Trade and Customs are now anxious to have them returned. A strict compliance with the Standing Orders and Parliamentary papers, which had once been formally laid on the table, being returned. As, however, it appears impossible that tlie papers I have referred to will be further required by the House, I propose, with the concurrence of honourable members, to authorize their return. While upon this question, I should like to point out to the House that, when members desire to peruse papers, which, on account of their bulk, and the consequent cost, it is considered inadvisable to copy, they would probably . be the Minister placing them on the Library table, instead of on the table of the House. There would then be no difficulty in their return as soon as members interested had perused them. At the same time, when for any reason it may be found necessary to lay original papers on the table of the House, I should propose, with the approval of the House, in future, to allow them to be returned, if applied for, in any case where it appears improbable that they will be further required by honourable members. ter of Home Affairs, upon notice1. How long is it since the Tarcoola gold-field was discovered? 2. How much gold was obtained during the years igoi, 1902, and 1903 respectively? 3. How many persons are engaged in.rnining on the field, and what is the total population? 4. What did thc Tarcoola telegraph line cost? 5. What was the date of the opening of the telegraph line, and how much revenue has been received since thc line was opened? have been addressed to the Postmaster-General. The answers are as follow :1. It was discovered in July, 1899. 2. May, 1901, until December, 1902, . 11,043 ounces; January to December, 1903, 6,314 ounces. 3.

I may add that the construction of this line was authorized by the Cabinet of which Sir John Forrest was' a member. the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Whether any overtime payment is made to officers engaged in sorting mails in Queensland practice would prevent and, if so, on what scale? 2. Whether any overtime payment is made to officers engaged in sorting' mails in New South Wales; and, if so, on what scale? orable member's questions are as follow : 1. No special overtime payment is made for sorting mails in Brisbane, but the allowances that were in force in the mail room there piior to Federation, which cover all claims for overtime (including the extra duty each week, at 5 a.m., in connection with English mails), and also on holidays, were continued by the Public Service Commissioner until the classification of the service is completed. The above allowance* equally well served by range from 5s. tb 12s. per week. 2. Overtime payment is made to officers engaged in sorting mails in Sydney on the follow, ing basis :-On day staff, 93 hours per fortnight, exclusive of time allowed for meals; on night staff, or for broken hours, 84 hours per fortnightexclusive of time allowed for meals. SALE OF DUTY STAMPS. General, upon notice. Whether he will endeavour to make arrangements with the Government of Victoria so that duty stamps may be kept for sale at all pl. B offices within the State? orable member's question is as follows: Arrangements were made some time since, at the request of the Government of . Victoria, for the sale of duty stamps at all the Victorian post-offices that are in charge of officers of the Postmaster-General's Department. As the sale of such stamps is not included in the work to be performed for the Postmaster-General's Department at post-offices under the contract or allowance systems, and is not paid for by his Department, the matter can be arranged for between the State Government and the persons in charge of such offices, either directly or through the Postmaster-Genertil; but in either case it would necessarily involve terms acceptable to the persons who might be asked to undertake the work.

Long-service increments legally due under State law, and not dependent on classification, have recently been paid to certain officers in the Postmaster-General's Department, Victoria. This State is the only one in which provision of the kind exists. 2. Information is now being obtained by the Public Service Commissioner from Departments, to enable increments voted in the Appropriation Act 1903-4 to be paid before the 30th instant, subject to classification. master-General, upon notice-1. If the expression by him in the Age of 3rd June, under the heading"" The functions of this Department being purely civil, no recognition of any kind can be given to military titles;"" and that the men had no right to have such titles recognised, represents his views on this subject? %. Whether these titles are conferred by the Crown, under the powers conferred by the Defence Act and the Regulations made under it? 3. By what power or authority can a Minister direct ""that titles held under the law are not to be recognised ? 4. Does he think such a direction tends to encourage the citizen forces, on which we desire to wholly depend for our defence? 5. Does he think that the deprivation of their military titles, many of which have been won on the field of battle, is likely to stimulate and encourage men to become officers? 6. On the contrary, does he not think it will be regarded as a desire to lessen the position of officers of our citizen forces? honourable member's questions are as folnoticelow:1. The words within quotation marks correctly represent my views on this subject. 2. Yes; but I am unaware of any provision in the Act or in any lawful regulation thereunder which compels recognition of military titles while the holders thereof are discharging purely civil 'duties. 3. Apart from statutory authority, it is considered that every Minister possesses the inherent right of prohibiting any practice which by creating friction amongst officers diminishes the utility of his Department to the public. Possession of a military title "" under the law "" conveys 110 power to a postmaster acting-as such to compel his subordinates to employ his military title in addressing him. 4. 5, 6. There seems no reason to anticipate that non-recognition of military titles in civil our citizen forces or lessen the attractiveness of commissions therein. I regret my inability to concur in the right honourable gentleman's apparent conclusion that recruits are attracted to the Defence Force by the prospect of becoming officers and obtaining titles. On the contrary, it is believed that the majority of men join the force from a patriotic impulse to fit themselves for effectively defending, their country in its hour of danger. representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice1.

The total cost of the Staff to the taxpayers exclusive of the cost of railway travelling, can, however, be given in the course 01 a day or two. I might add that I am informed that the preparation of a return setting forth the actual amount paid away in travelling expenses would, if called'for, involve some expense, inasmuch as a. great number of vouchers would have to be examined. the Minister of Defence, upon 1.

The honourable and learned gentleman declared when discussing the amendment, that he never rose early if he could avoid doing so, and that he did not intend to resort to the practice. In making that resolve he somewhat tends to jeopardize the important Ministerial, desires that before he rises the world shall mentioned by him that in his early youth he retired from a luciative position that he desired that he should rise at what appears having regard to the necessities of his He disagreed with his emleft his service.

I have not included the pastoral production for 1902, the value of which was £21,000,000. pastoral production, the total value of the agricultural, dairying, poultry, and farming industries amounted to £52,000,000; as compared with a gross revenue from the railways of £10,470,580. The productive value of the interests concerned by the proposition now before the Committee is surely of such serious importance that we should determine that nothing shall be done to injure them. Next let me refer to the capital value involved.' Upon this point I may say that Coghlan, so far as I was able to ascertain, is not as definite as he might be in distinguishing between city and suburban property ancl agricultural lands. But it will be obvious that that is not important as affecting what I wish to point out. I find that the capital value of the raihvays is £129,490,000. The capital value of the land of the Commonwealth, exclusive of Government lands-that is to say, including only lands which have passed into private hands-amount s to £350,281,000; the houses and buildings are valued at ,£277,514,000, and the live stock at £85,048,000. I quite recognise that there is not a sufficient distinction in these statispertinent to the subject. tics to indicate which are urban lands and which are rural properties; but surely anything which affects such enormous interests should be regarded by honourable members opposite as vital. I do, therefore, respectfully submit these figures to the Committee/for consideration. Turmoil, trouble, fricthose figures even in their present tion, and delay of our parliamentary work were caused last session by the proposal relating to the railway servants, which was regarded by the late Government as vital. It was also regarded by honourable members opposite-as was indicated by their actions-as vital. I never heard that they went to the late Government, whom they defeated, and said, "" We do not wish you to retire; we do not regard this proposal as vital; on the contrary, we consider it to be so unimportant, that we do not think it is desirable that the Government now in office should be displaced, and that we should take their places."" If that is the case, surely, altogether apart from the agricultural interests that are affected by the amendment, the Government should say distinctly whether or not they intend to regard the present proposal as vital. If they d'o not regard it qs vital. I venture to think that I have sustained the position with which I started, that the honourable members opposite, in this respect, have added another to several inconsistencies which their previously homogeneous party has displayed during the last week Including the or two. I recognise, of course, that one can only generalize from the figures which I have quoted. I endeavoured, this morning, to get from the Government Statist's office, in Melbourne, a closer subdivision of the figures; but I found that the officials could not supply me with the information I desired. Here, I may remark, that the sooner this Government, or whoever occupies the Treasury benches, takes the Statistical Department into their hands, in order to see that the statistics of the Commonwealth are placed upon a uniform basis, the sooner wa shall be able to go to some authority from whom we can obtain figures knowing them to be trustworthy. Surely the Government might consult the various States with a view of taking up this matter. It ought to result in a saving of expense. difficulty which I have had in getting closer figures. defect that we are not able to get statistics of a closer character thaivthose which I have given to the Committee. But I hold that form incontestably display that we are not dealing with a mere municipal or State matter, but one involving gigantic interests. The figures are enormous.

48,Mr Knox,"What I feel is, that it is athis further imposition upon the producing interests, ancl upon the property which is used in connection with them. Another most inconsistent contention, admitted, I think, by the Minister of Home Affairs, and by other honourable members opposite, is that the provision Avould not prove operative. If it will not prove operative, why should it be included in the Bill? Are our laws to be only so much worthless printing and paper? We should not be asked to pass laws unless the intention is that they shall become operative. For instance, our conciliation and arbitration law should be such that any foreign investor or any man desiring to spend money in the Commonwealth should be able, on perusing it, to learn the conditions which wiil attach to his investment if he takes up land in Australia. If the provision is to be inoperative, now refer is that proposed by the provision why, in the name of all that is sensible, should the Ministry oppose the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Wannon? When I was last in LondonI visited the offices of the High Commissioner for Canada, and I saw there a busy hive of men actively engaged in securing the publicity of information which would be of benefit to people .who desired to settle upon the lands in Canada. They were doing everything possible to induce good, honest workers to emigrate to Canada. So far from imposing restrictions, such as that proposed here, they were offering every inducement to people to settle in the Dominion. upon honest statement for honourable members to talk of making efforts to bring population to Australia, when at the same time they are attempting to place these obstacles in the way of their coming here. There are people in the old country who read our Acts of Parliament. In the little towns and villages of England and Scotland there is always some man who takes the trouble to read up these questions, and he is the man who guides his fellow-villagers, ancl who will really determine whether or not a few of them will emigrate to Australia. Many honourable members who know London well are aware that in the centre of the living and throbbing city the representatives of the Canadian Dominion have a great office, and another in the West End. I have seen at those offices a crowdi of intending emigrants seeking information before going out to settle upon the lands in Canada. Those in charge of the offices were good enough to supply me with the literature they distribute broadcast in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and I have much pleasure in laying specimens of it upon the table for the information of honourable members who may desire to learn what kind of literature it is. Let honourable members listen to what Canada offers to fanners. mane to the subject? portant.

It is competent for him to draw a parallel between' proposed legislation here and that in any other part of the world; but I fail to see that .the advantages offered by Canada, or by any other country, should be quoted in detail, as against a supposed disadvantage arising from the amendment. If the honourable member can show that in the literature .which he has now presented to the Committee there are distinct. evidences of a desire on the paTt of the Government of Canada, or of any other country, not to include in their legislation such a provision as that proposed to be included in this B ill , I shall hear him.

I ask honourable members to take the trouble to read some of the papers to which I have referred, and I have no doubt they will be perfectly astonished to see the facilities and advantages which the Canadian Government offer broadcast to the people of Great Britain. On the other hand, we in Australia are pleading for population, and at the same time, by Acts of Parliament and other restrictive measures, we add burden after burden. Early in the debate, last week, a proposal was made that the employees with whom I am now more particularly concerned should be paid by the hour. I regret to see the effort being made to divorce the common interests which have always existed-in farm life, at any rate-betwee n employer and employed. The honourable member for Barrier, who comes from the old country, knows that the interests of the farm employees there were the interests of the owner. But what are we proposing to do ? It is proposed that a man shall be regarded simply from the point of view of what he can clo in an hour. Are we to turn our men into simple machines, instead of their having a common interest in the work in which both employers and employed are engaged? If we proceed with these proposals we are on the high road to a divorce in that social life which, after all, is the greatest bond of union between us as a people. posals, to make more marked the line of division between what are called the classes and the masses; and that, in my opinion, is highly undesirable. The interests in farm life are so interwoven as to be mutually dependent, and it is highly desirable that the employee should take a real interest in the stock and the various products on which the fortune of his master and his master's family may depend. What is the proposal underlying many of the suggestions now before us? It would appear that we are to have a new scheme for estimating the reward of labour. A man on a farm, whc has to rise at 4 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning, is to be paid for the period of the day for which he is at work in the early hours, and for the other part of the clay he is to receive no reward whatever. the employee' to feel that he is a trusted sertude of the interests at stake is so great vant of his employer, and that he has an interest in the undertaking in which he is % employed, rather than that he should be told he is to get so much per hour? This divorce between the common interests of the employer and employed is a very serious matter, and it is one deeply involved in the proposal before us. It has been said that this provision will not prove operative; but in this connection there is a point which I should like to emphasize. My friends on the Government side, although recently they may have appeared somewhat inconsistent in the surrender of one or two points, are consistent in this: that, if there is anything in the Bill which they can apply, they will apply it ; they will not allow it to remain inoperative. They may say that it will not be put into operation because the farm servants will not combine, but, unless I under-estimate their capacity, they will take steps to overcome that difficulty, and I am in fault in my estimate of their ability if they do not succeed. Al l my actions here have tended to the encouragement of the primary producers of the Commonwealth. I believe that the basis of our national .wealth is the prodiuce of the soil, and the more we hamper our primary producers with fiscal or other legislative burdens 'the more shall we retard the development of the country. On that ground alone I would urge honourable members on this side of the Chamber to stand firm by the amendment, and I appeal to honourable members opposite to try to We are trying, by tbese prorealize the importance of the figures which I have submitted. We are dealing with interests valued at hundreds of millions of pounds.

I think I have not exceeded the limit of time which I set myself. hoped that we would come to a division last week; but, as it now appears likely that every member of the Committee will speak.

The provisions of the measure will apply only in regard to disputes contemplated by the Constitution. If the clause is carried as it stands, it will apply to all classes of agricultural labourers. mission of the Chairman, I wish, at this stage, to make a short personal explanation. On Fridav last the honourable member f >x Kennedy referred to the debate which took place in 1901, when the Pacific Island Labourers BiU' was under consideration, when he said the labourers on the sugar plantations, who are none other than farn labourers, were termed drunkards and loafers. As I took a very active interest in that measure, I thought that possibly the honourable member might refer to me. I regret that he is not now in his place, because I wish to most emphatically deny that I used any such terms in relation to the workers on the sugar plantations of Queensland. I know that they are as sober and industrious as any other body of men. liable, according to some honourable members. touch upon that point. The honourable member for Kennedy said that these men had also been characterized as unreliable -did so I should support him. The LabourI believe that I made use of that term. I was then referring to the fact that the desire of the sugar-planters to retain the Kanakas was not due to the cheapness of such labour, because, as I maintained, one white man could do the work of three Kanakas. I pointed out, however, that at certain times of fhe year, when a delay of two sults, the Kanakas were considered more reliable than white labourers, because the white workers would probably want extra pay, or a few days' holiday. That was the only connection in which I made use of the term "" unreliable,"" and that was the only sense in which I said that the Kanaka was more reliable than the white labourer. I did not refer to the white labourers as drunk: ards or loafers, nor did I hear them socharacterized during the debate. We all know that less than three years ago special legislation was passed relating to the class I of labour to be employed upon the sugar plantations of Queensland. The planters considered that they were subjected to very great hardship in being deprived of the Kanaka labour to which they had been accustomed for. many years. Now we propose to place them under further disabilities by bringing them within the scope of the Bill. The planters have not, so far, suffered to any great extent from the reduced supply of Kanaka labour, because at the time the Pacific Island Labourers Act was passed there were in the Commonwealth 60,000 coloured aliens, of whom many thousands have gone to Queensland, and are now finding employment on the plantations, to the exclusion of white men. say so. my own knowledge. I have seen the men at work. These aliens are much more dangerous than are the Kanakas, because they are keen competitors of white men. If measures had been proposed to secure the deportation of these coloured aliens, together with the Kanakas, I should have supported the Bill, heart and soul! might have mentioned that fact. I distinctly asked the Prime Ministeri f he would make the provisions of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill apply to other coloured aliens, and I told him that if he < Party, however, lost a very good opportunity of taking effective steps to secure what they desired, namely, a White Australia.",20,Conciliation And Arbitration Position Which He Occupies He Evidently

If he had done so he would have obtained strong support. that any strong desire has been expressed by the people of the Commonwealth for a measure such as that before us. I do not know that the farm labourers have ever asked for it. They have not complained of bad treatment. As a rule they become members of the farmers' families. The onlycase mentioned by the Prime Minister was that of a little boy who was found lying sound asleep on the road, alongside his milk cans. That would be a very good place for him to sleep, if he were out of the way of traffic, because it would be in the open air. My two sons always sleep in an open verandah, because they feel all the better for taking their rest in the fre'sh air. ' I very much regret that the Government have decided that farmers shall be brought under the operation of. this measure. As a class they have many difficulties to contend with. take up land whicli is thickly covered with forest trees, or dense scrub, and they have to expend much labour and money before they can obtain any return. They have droughts, noxious weeds, rabbits, and low prices to battle against, and they deserve every consideration at our hands.

One of the planks in the Laboui Party's platform is a proposal to impose a heavy tax that will have the effect of driving persons off the land. Is it not possible for the Government, instead of wasting the time of trie House in this way, to introduce some useful legislation? Cannot they bring forward legislation that will tend to attract to the Commonwealth capitalists, and to establish industries that will provide work for our great army of unemployed ? We need more avenues of regular employment. workers receiving wages as high as it is possible to give, and working under the best possible conditions; but the certainty of regular employment all the year round is far better than the promise of high wages. In stead of doing anything to bring about that desirable state of affairs, we are driving capital from Australia by means of socialistic legislation. the honourable member were correct. It is not a nightmare; it is something more substantial. It has been made known throughout Australia that last year no less than £ 5 .000,000 were withdrawn from Australia, and money is still being withdrawn from the Commonwealth. ' Investors will not risk their capital in a country where there is so much uncertainty, not only as to the return of their money, but even in regard to the payment of interest on it. I regret that the Government should be occupying the. time of the Committee in this way. The Parliament has now been in session for three months, but during that period we have, simply been wasting time. nothing has been done. The proposal that farmers and farm labourers shall be brought within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will place another obstacle in the way of agriculturists. I trust that the Prime Minister will see the wisdom of withdrawing his opposition to the amendment. Let us proceed with the con-' sideration of the B ill , and endeavour to make it a. useful measure. I recognise that we should provide for conciliation and arbitration ; but I do not think that men should be forced to join any union or, as an alternative, unable to obtain employment. In November and December last I addressed a great many meetings of my constituents, sometimes making two, and even three, speeches in one day, and I made up my mind at the outset of the campaign that I should not touch upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill unless I was asked to do so. I was generally provided with sufficient material for an hour's speech upon this matter, but I desired not to discuss the question unless it was introduced, and only once was I asked the simple question as to whether I was in favour of conothers who will be prepared ciliation and arbitration.

Another man, who was perhaps a little more wide awake, said"" Yes, I wish to know whether you are in favour of compulsory arbitration ?"" I said"" I am glad you said so, because I do not wish you to misunderstand me. I desire you to know I only wish that exactly what I think on that question.

You know, sir, that if we discuss this question from personal reminiscences, how difficult it becomes. We are never weary of pointing out the danger of establishing theories on our own experience. seventy-five different personal theories with regard to almost any question under consideration.

We should not be controlled by the experience of the past; After the present Government had that would be idle. We are a progressive people-a n evolving people. We must endeavour, as far as possible, to be influenced by the history of the past just as far as it appeals to our reason, and no further. With regard to these old records, some of them appear to have been effaced. That is not an unusual thing in politics. Something of It apthe kind has happened quite lecently. AlthoughI have taken only a literal translation, still I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to get the sense and wisdom of the Why, sir, think of the great queslegends. The first matter of importance that struck me was the effect of arbitration and the common rule on such a project as an exploring party looking for agricultural land; and in the death of Horatius may be found a singular reference which comes pertinently home to us to-day.

The party were only two hours away froni comfort and rest; but they were Roman man, the Roman motto, civis Romanus sum -whereve r a Roman citizen was, the laws of Rome applied' They would not break the laws of Rome; and as the hour for leaving off work had arrived, they determined to camp where they were. They camped just as an exploring party led by my right honourable friend the member for Swan might have done. But in the night a dust-storm arose, and the party were smothered by the sirocco, with the exception of walking delegate Clodius. of the young man, wanted to 'know how it was that Clodius returned alone. He said that he was the only unionist among those forming the party, and therefore he had during the night exercised his right of preference by commandeering all the water which his companions had. intervened. approached the question in the conservative way, and suggested that young Horatius had endeavoured to join the union before he started with the exploring expedition. But it appears that Horatius was blackballed because he had not hair of the right colour; and Antoninus could not get in because the books of the union were closed. So a tumult arose, and Mrs. Horatius declared that her boy had not had "" a fair show."" for that phrase? arose and pointed out that he did not care whether the other members of the party had endeavoured to join the union or not. That had nothing to do with him. What concerned him was that, being a member of a union, he did not allow them to hreak the common rule, and was entitled to the preference. on to show the patriotic and friendly way in which Clodius' met the question, by a prompt demonstration on the part of a body of men whom he had there. I cannot quite translate the term that is used in the manuscript, but we might use the word "" push."" There was a demonstration by a "" push,"" after which peace was eventually restored. Now, instead of using the word Capadocia, honourable members may apply that story to the experiences of my honourable friend the member for Swan. He knows how impossible it would be to apply the common rule to an exploring expedition. I will take one incident from the manuscript with regard to the dairying industry, which is of great importance to the people of Australia. You, Mr Chairman, will remember the remarkable trial of Catulus v. Coriolanus. I am using these names phonetically, out of consideration for my audience. The case, which is to be found in the records, is one in which Catulus summoned Coriolanus before the Roman Arbitration Court. . The defendant had nothing to do with Geelong, notwithstanding the similarity of his name with that of the constituency Of the honourable member for Corio. It appears that the Mrs. Horatius, the mother Romans had some trouble with the warlike Volscians. The attacks of these warriors gave rise to a great deal of alarm in ancient Rome. The Roman people sent to Coriolanus, asking him to come and defend them against their enemies. He came, leaving his dairy under the control of CaDentatus here tulus. On returning he discovered that He, as the manuscript says, four of his best cows were suffering from milk-fever. Honourable members can take a dairy in any part of the world, and they will 'find that the effect upon the proprietor on making a discovery of that kind is just the same. Cicero in his fifteenth philippic makes the whole matter perfectly clear. He delivered one of his greatest orations, on the occasion to which I am now referring, and he described those cows with as much detail as the honourable member for Gippsland himself could do. He described the milk halo, the escutcheon, the thin tail, the well-developed milk veins, and all the rest It is idiomatic. Clodius of it. So far as I can see from Cicero's description, the cows kept by the ancient Romans were very much like our own shorthorn cattle. They were, in fact, just like the cattle with which the honourable member for Gippsland or Illawarra has to do, and such as will be found in the south coast district of New South Then the manuscript goes Wales. They were almost as good as the cattle in my own electorate. I am endeavouring to point out how important the dairying industry is to Australia, and incidentally indicating how important it was to the people of Rome. Indeed, it seems to have been more important to the people of ancient Rome than to us, because there was such a dearth of cows there that some of the most illustrious men were reared on wolves' milk. You will remember, Mr Chairman, how Romulus",25,Aworking Farmer

110,Mr Ewing,"and Remus are described by a poet historianThou ""that art sprung from the war-god's loins, in RomeI desire to be perfectly exact on And hast tugged at the she wolf's breast. The case came before the Roman Arbitration Court. Catulus said that the mishap to the cows had arisen because the milking machine got out of order, and there was something wrong with the engine. He said that he had milked np to 4 o'clock, and then, being a Roman citize/i, and realizing that he was under the Roman law, he had knocked off work. He would not milk a cow after 4 o'clock, no matter how much damage might be done to any other man's animal. Coriolanus granted that the facts might have been as Catulus stated them that the machine might have got out of order, and that his servant had probably acted according to law. tion at the loss of his cows was such that he assaulted Catulus. There was a remarkable finding of the Arbitration Court. In those clays in Rome it-so said the Court did not much matter whether That was not material, because there were plenty more like him. But the Court was astounded to find that a man like Coriolanus should, under any circumstances, have expected the man to break the laws of his country. They said further, that they would impose a penalty for not using union cows-cow s that gave an intermittent supply; cows that did not milk on Sunday. It was of no use for Coriolanus to urge that he could not get cows of that description. The plain answer to that was that if he could not he should give up dairying. He did not use that class of cow, and he was fined, the penalty being two talents. I mention this incident to show that this sort of thing has happened before. One more instance, with regard to the pastoral industry, and I shall then have finished with the historical research which it was necessary to give to the question. The 'CHAIRMAN -The pastoral industry is not affected by the amendment. would refer to that part of the dairying industry which relates to the herding of the cows. Horses are required for that, and they require to be broken in. Even members of the Labour Party could not ride horses unless they were broken in. I ask the attention of honourable members 'to this very remarkable case, which will be found in the records. The matter came before the Arbitration Court in this way; Herminius, the head of the Horse Breakers' Association this matter, and to keep strictly to absolute facts-Herminius , the head of the Horse Breakers' Association in Rome, sued Sempronius for an offence to wit, that he did ride a buck-jumper after legal hours. From the evidence, it would appear that Sempronius was a very reasonable and genuine man, and on coming before the Court he granted everything. It seems that Mr Walking Delegate Peritonitis was on the cap of the fence. He was taking no risks, and was not worrying very much about work, 'but had a stop-watch in his hand. At4 o'clock all work of that kind ceased by law. It was illegal by the common rule to be on a buckjumper after 4 o'clock. Sempronius But his indignagranted that Peritonitis had told him to get off the horse, but the manuscript points out that just then the horse did incontinently commence toI had some difficulty in discovering an accurate translation of the Latin term used, but it would seem to be he killed Catalus or not. ""root and buck""-and Sempronius could not get off. He was face to face with a dilemma. To obey the laws of his country would be to break his neck, and he honestly told the President df the Arbitration Court that he preferred not to break his neck. The finding of the Court, according to the manuscript, was this-That in any circumstances, should obedience to the laws of his country hang in the balance with his death, a Roman citizen should accept his death rather than disobey the laws of his country. For breaking the law, in this instance, Sempronius was laid under a penalty of one talent. I will quote no further reference as the result of historical research, and honourable members will see that although the translation may appear to be somewhat loose, as far as possible the spirit of the manuscript is preserved. The manuscript goes on in such a way that it is clear there was very great difficulty in securing cows that would obey the laws of the country-inter I meant to say that I mittent milkers ancl cows, the flow of whose milk stopped directly the law said it should stop. As a consequence, the chemists of the time were hard at work to discover a remedy. A jemedy was discovered in the shape of a microbe, and its application was by inoculation. They were getting on very well, but it was a difficult matter to keep up the supplv of the microbe.",26,Aworking Farmer
111,Mr Ewing,"Honourable members should read the statements which Cicero makes in regard to that. They clearly show that the microbe was as rare as is radium in our days. It could be found in abundance, so the manuscript explains, in a certain place at certain times, but these did not happen often. As far as I can understand, the time when it could be got in its f u l l virility, strength, and useing between the new aristocrats and the fulness was when May Day fell on the f u l l of the moon. With respect to the place at which it was found the manuscript is very faulty, as I shall be able to show to honourable members later on. They will find a reference to "" Yarra,"" and though the "" B "" is quite clear, whether the reference is to ""Yarra Bank"" or to ""Yarra Bend,"" I cannot quite make out. Having said so much with regard to ancient history, and again warning honourable members that I feel they ought not to be guided absolutely by these historical precedents, I desire to make a passing reference to more modern times. able member will lay the papers on the table ? me to do so I shall have pleasure in laying the papers on the table of the House later on. The members of. the present Government are entitled to everything that a Government should have, so long as they can stop where they are. They are representa<tive of a number of men whom we had in New South Wales a little while ago. They have the same policy and the same principles-that is to say, that industry and everything of that kind is of no importance at all in connection with the great social problems they propose to solve. I remember that the agricultural industries of New South Wales were under consideration. I desire at no. time to make more than a passing reference to what happened in the colonies before Federation. I prefer to allow the dead past to bury its dead. Labour Party-no w known as the Ministerial Party-ha d determined to destroy all the primary industries in New South Wales. We appealed to them as strongly as we could not to do so, and what reply did we get? That what we asked was impossible. The working men in my own electorate, and in various other parts of New South Wales, came clown to Sydney and appealed to those who are' now so much interested in the farming industry not to destroy their homes and the industries which they had developed so well. They asked to be spared. consult the executive before we can give you a reply."" The members of the executive, I understand,although not connected with Parliament, and drawing no salary, govern Parliament from outside. They determined to consult the executive. We can divide all humanity into two, the workers and the worked; and the meetworking men who came down from my electorate was a truly remarkable meeting. These workmen from the north had never seen their new masters, the new aristocrats, previously, and a large number of those gentlemen never had an opportunity of meeting a working man. The surprise was mutual; still neither succumbed, and eventually the question was submitted to the executive. This was the question of the life of the industries as they are before us to-day; not merely the question of legislating for them in the direction of conciliation and arbitration; but the question whether they I suppose the honorshould or should not be absolutely destroyed. This brings me closely to the point under consideration. One would have imagined If the Chairman requests that the executive would take an interest in the fostering of native industries. The executive, to whom it was submitted, consisted of an ambassador from the Hairdressers' Union, an ambassador from the Closeshavers' Union, the emperor and chief of the Shirt-stud Union, an ambassador from the Tobacco Pouch Union, and a delegate from the union for the promulgation of ""sparklets."" I am credibly informed that the executive was thus constituted ;. and it may be admitted that they were perfectly honest, straightforward men. But what was. the reply ? The reply simply was, "" What are your industries to us ? We who work in the city live on you hayseeds in the country, and under no circumstances shall we alter our policy to please you. It suits us to destroy indusBut the tries, and we shall destroy them; it suits us to cut at the root of the sugar industry, the timber industry, the dairying industry, and other industries, and you hayseeds may go back to your country districts: we Sydney men control the situation, and you can look after yourselves."" There are men in this House who know that that was the reply given to the working men of the north by men who were fiscal atheists-by men who had no knowledge of or belief in anything but their own social programme and ideas.

I venture to say that if this proposal to include all rural workers were submitted to a poll of the people to-morrow, farmers and workers generally from one end of the continent to the other would be opposed to it. In my opinion, the Labour Party would rot get very much support from any fanning centres for their present proposal. When we come to look into the matter of industrial development, it seems to me that nothing is more likely to discourage industrial enterprise in rural pursuits than a clause of this character. further disabilities on producers from, the soil, but to remove the manifold disabilities already existing. We ought to create greater facilities for productive enterprise, not only in rural pursuits, but in all other pursuits. Not only in Victoria, but in New South Wales and the other States, industry suffers from over-legislation. As I said on a previous occasion, we should do good to the producing interests of every class throughout Australia if we could get rid of much of the legislation already passed. In regard to the particular clause before us. If a i l absolutely to understand why the Ministry wish to press it. I cannot understand why the Government insist on including in the Bill this particular class of labour, in the absence of any apparent necessity. it does not seeni very probable, that disputes in rural pursuits may extend from one State to another. It may be possible that, through the medium of organizations hereafter to be created, a little dispute in one place may be magnified, and assume such large proportions as to gradually extend beyond the limits of a State. But that is so remote a possibility that I do not think it is worth consideration, espeI think I cially when we have regard to the fact that, in the case of small farmers, the work is I have gone as far principally carried on by members of the family. Can we conceive of a dispute between the members of a family so engaged, as likely to be taken to the Arbitration Court? That view has already been put before the Committee, and in reply it has been contended that, in such a case, the powers of the Court would not be brought into force-that it is not likely such a contingency will arise. Biiti f such a contingency is not likely to arise, where is need for making provision for it in the Bill? That, to my mind, is an argument for exclusion, rather than for inclusion. I claim to be just as anxious as any member of the Labour Party to see the best possible conditions for wage-earning classes, producing classes, and all other classes. I claim to be just as anxious to see the best rates of wages, and the best possible conditions for workers. In my opinion, at any rate, the proposals of the Labour Party tend, not to improve industrial' conditions, but to make them worse than they have been heretofore. It may be that, in one or two instances, a slight improvement is observable. But when we come to generalize, and have regard to the What we should do is, not to put whole of those engaged in all the various industrial enterprises, can we honestly say, after thirteen years of direct labour representation-mos t of that time with legislation under the direct control of the Labour Party-that 'the conddtion of workers is better than it was before Labour had direct representation? I do not think that that can be said. On the contrary, it seems to me that the conditions are considerably worse in a number of cases than they were thirteen years ago; and that is one of the greatest arguments against legislation of this character. It is not because the intention is not good; I admit that the intention is all that can be desired; but the reason for the failure is found in the fact that the methods are wrong. ber think that shop employees are worse off than they were fourteen years ago?.",28,Aworking Farmer
114,Mr Johnson (Lang),I do not pro,29,Aworking Farmer
115,"I T May Be Possible, Though Mr Webster","Does the honourable memthat there may be isolated cases, where, possibly, a slight improvement is noticeable. But we cannot look at one particular class only in an argument of this kind. We have to look at industries as a whole, and the undeniable proof is before us that there are thousands more unemployed now than at any previous time, and that people are leaving the shores of Australia to-day in greater numbers than ever before. That is a very bad outlook for the future progress and prosperity of this country. This exodus is due, not to the niggardliness of nature, or to any failure of her bounty, but mainly to misdirected legislation. The Prime Minister, speaking against the amendment, saidI do not say that the dairy farmers are getting cause of industrial troubles; but that the fat at the expense of their employees. who really take the cream are the landlords, and every increase in the cost of production will be borne by them, because it will be paid for out of the rent. That statement contains an absolute fallacy, which the honourable gentleman would not have enunciated if he knew anything about the economic law governing these matters. The effect of the provision uncler discussion will be to create so many difficulties that small farmers will be crowded out. An Arbitration Court can fix minimum rates of wage, and minimum hours of labour, but it cannot force employers to give employment on terms which are unprofitable. No man will employ another when he finds it unprofitable to clo so. The effect of the provision would be to make agriculture and dairying unprofitable for small farmers, and they would, therefore, be crushed out of the business, while the men with large capital who would remain would pool their interests, and thus establish a monopoly, limiting their output, forcing up prices on the consumer, and restricting the amount of employment for labour. Therefore, all that the Government would have done would be to increase the number of unemployed. The Minister of External Affairs spoke the other day of the influx from the country into the cities. In New South Wales the Government, moved by a laudable desire to uplift the wage earners, established a minimum rate of wage. But it was seen that the economic law of supply and demand which governs rates of wages, rates of interest, rents, and kindred matters, cannot be disregarded. economics that one can intelligently approach and effectively deal with questions of this kind. ' The effect of establishing a minimum wage in New South Wales was to attract to Sydney in thousands agricultural labourers, and even small farmers. Thus the rural industries were neglected, while the number of unemployed in the overcrowded city was further increased by those who came from the country. Furthermore, only those who were expert in their trades, the best workmen, who could devote most brains, energy, ancl skill to their callings, were employed, and they were compelled to accept the minimum wage, which gradually ceases to be the maximum wage also, in a general sense. The provision in this Bill would have a similar effect. What we should do is to deal with the primaryThose Labour Partyand Ministry do not propose to touch. In New South WalesI have travelled through miles of as fine agricultural country' as one could wish to see, all held by one individual, who probably does not employ one man to eveiy 1,000 acres. Away out beyond these agricultural areas are to be found farmers struggling under the most adverse conditions. Sometimes farms are perched on the top of barren mountains, which are accessible only by passing through good but unused agricultural land. Ought we to place additional disabilities upon the owners of such farms ? Not only are they now handicapped by their remoteness from markets, and the poorness of their land, but they are heavily taxed upon everything that they use. The Ministry do not propose to remove any of their burdens. They do not propose to remit the taxation upon agricultural machinery and implements, fencing wire, clothing, and the other requirements of the farmer. Neither do they propose to reduce freights. A ll they propose is a further interference which will mean the ultimate extinction of the small farmer. reduce freights? vernment that they have that power, I should have to enter upon an economic discussion, which I do not think is justifiable at the present time. There are, however, men in the ranks of his party, such as the Minister of External Affairs, who know as much about these matters as I do. TheI t is only by a study of Minister of External Affairs the other day accused me of sacrificing principle, and I ask him, therefore, whether, as a free-",29,Aworking Farmer

If they had spent half the time which has been devoted to this measure in dealing with the causes of low wages, dearth of employment, and enormous wealth on the one hand, and extreme poverty on the other, they would have been better employed, and might have succeeded in rendering some real service to the cause of industrial emancipation in this country. I intend to support the amendment. pleasure in supporting the amendment, to add to the definition of "" Industrial dispute "" the words'-' But it does not include a dispute relating to they not manifest a desire to benefit the employment in any agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, dairying, or pastoral pursuit."" It would appear from the speech of the Prime Minister that he is in favour of bringing farmers within the scope of the Bill, because many landholders receive high rentals for the valuable farmed by their tenants. that he knew of land that -was held under rentals ranging from 30s. to 40s. per acre, and that it was owing to the high rentals they had to pay that farmers were unable to give their labourers reasonably good wages. I am reminded that the district represented by the honourable member for about Mount Gambier, from which the owners derive a rental of £ 1 per acre. tunate enough to secure such land have done so well that many of them have retired on a competence. It is because the land is valuable that it commands a high rental, and owing to the same cause the farmers are well able to pay high rates. that legislation of this kind is directed specially against the landlords. visions similar ,to that now under discussion are to be found in the New South Wales and New Zealand Arbitration Acts, but no advantage has been taken of them by the agricultural labourers. There is no likelihood of any contest between farmers and their employees extending beyond any one State; and I ask Ministers, why we If Ministers had adshould bring the agricultural industry within the scope of the Bill? Why does not the Minister sitting at the table act upon the advice which I tendered _ him on a former occasion and which he has followed in one case and by dropping the provision which .would bring farmers within the scope of the Bill, endeavour to improve the measure as much as possible? TheB ill is bad enough, but it would be much woise if its effect were to harass farmers, drive men out of employment, and inflict still greater hardship upon the small children to whom he has referred.. If the B ill were passed in its present form, and hard-and-fast rules were imposed upon farmers, many of them would probably have to dismiss their hands and make their children do all the work. Another effect would be to increase the cost of living of other workers: The Labour Party claim to represent the working classes. Why do masses, instead of adopting measures which would have the effect of increasing the price of food to the people of Great Britain? During the preferential trade campaign, we heard a great deal about the proposals . if Mr Chamberlain to impose preferential duties upon grain, butter, cheese, lands and other products of Australia. Why He stated should the Government now seek to nullify the effects of such a policy by increasing the cost of production? It would be extremely difficult for this or any other Parliament to arbitrarily fix the Hours of labour ancl rates of pay of agricultural labourers. That it is practically impossible to do so is proved by the fact that the proBarker includes the rich land vision made in New Zealand and New South Wales for bringing the agricultural industry under the control of an Arbitration Court The tenants who have been forhas never yet been availed of. Why should the Bill be spoilt by inserting a provision which would prove ineffective? Does the Prime Minister wish to make a special appeal to the farm labourers in his own electorate, who are said to be hard-worked and badly paid?

121,Mr Willis (Robertson),"I have much.Quite recently the farm labourers in my own case were unable to plough for fully a fortnight owing to rain, but they received their pay all the same. Afterwards they cheerfully worked early and late in order to make up for the loss of time. During last week, some men told me that they had been unable to plough for some time owing to the wet weather, but that they had subsequently worked as long as they were able, in order to make'a show. These men were anxious to give some return for the wages they received. Yet, it is now proposed that this class of men shall not work more than a certain number of hours, and shall receive not less than a statutory minimum wage. bers who are acquainte'd with the farming industry must know that it would be impossible to adopt a minimum rate of wage, unless it were desired to throw men out on the roads, or force them to forsake tbe country for the towns. The Labour Party includes many strong advocates of closer settlement. If the policy were carried out, small farmers would be invited to go on the land. would be necessary for these men to employ others at seed and harvest time. Yet it is now proposed to bring them under arbitrary control as to rates of pay and hours of labour, and the enforcement of\Ji common rule. This would have the effect of starving-out the small farmers, and leaving the industry entirely at the mercy of monopolists. The Minister of Trade and Customs recently travelled through Canada, and he must have noticed that in Manitoba the agricultural industry is very largely carried on by big syndicates. In some parts of the United States of America, notably in California, enormous combines have obtained control of the agricultur'al industry. The small man is crushed out of existence. If the Government wish to bring about a like state of affairs in Australia, they should persist in the proposal to pass the clause as it stands; but if not, let them accept the proposed amendment.

America and in Great Britain the voluntary system prevails. In New South Wales a Conciliation and Arbitration Act has, been in operation. It will continue to remain in force till 1904, and, as a practical politician, I am willing that the principle should be given a fair trial. I would not place any obstacle in the way of a proposal to confer a benefit upon workers that could not be secured in the absence of a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act ; but I claim the right, when that measure has proved to be a failure, to go before my constituents and say that voluntary arbitration is preferable. Whilst we are legislating in this Honourable memdirection I hope that we shall make the B ill as practical as possible.

I wish it to be distinctly understood that even had the Ministry of which I was a member, remained in office, I could not have voted for the clause as it stands, because I do not approve of it. Has any necessity arisen for the extension of this Bill to farmers and farm employees? Has a request for such an extension been made by the farming community throughout Australia? Has any necessity arisen for it? The answer must be in the negative. Honourable members know that, speaking generally, I am opposed to legislation of this kind unless it is necessary. There are many matters that are necessary and pressing to which we might well devote our attention, instead of embarking upon legislation which has not been asked for, and is unnecessary. In speaking in this Committee on 2nd inst., the Prime Minister is reported at page 1924 of Hansard to have saidI do not think it is likely that any dispute of that character would extend beyond the boundaries of any one Sate; but if such a condition of affairs did arise, it would be most unfortunate if there were no provision in the law which would enable a settlement to be promptly arrived at. I do not think there is any immediate prospect of such a dispute arising as would call for the intervention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. This is the opinion of the Prime Minister, ancl our own experience goes to show that there has never been any dispute in relation to agricultural employment in Australia to which a measure of this description could have been applied under the Constitution. Why should we occupy week after week in discussing proposals that are not required-for made-when, Prime Minister, there is no immediate prospect of a dispute arising among those engaged in the farming industry to which they could apply? made by the Irime Minister condemns the Government in its desire to force this unnecessary legislation upon the country. No dispute among those engaged in the farming industry has ever extended beyond the boundaries of any one State, and no such dispute or strike is likely to occur. It cannot be urged that the placing of restrictions upon industry and enterprise of any kind will tend to make the cost of living less.

137,Sir John Forrest,"This provisionforwardly and openly the better. rose for the purpose of making my position clear. of this legislation, as my late colleagues know, and I have reasonable ground for saying that the late Government would not have opposed the present amendment. raise my voice against this B ill as well as to vote for the amendment. proposed to include in the Bill the agriculturist, the viticulturist, the dairy farmer, and the gardener. I am in favour of .any kind of legislation that will, if possible, ameliorate the conditions that arise from strikes, the dislocation of trade, and the misery that men and women suffer at those times. that a Bill which includes the class of people referred to is a step in the wrong direction. why this dragnet should be laid. I happen to know something about farming, because I have lived in a farming community for many years, and I am satisfied that'those people will not be benefited by the Bill. It has been said that it will never be brought into operation. as it were, a sword of Damocles above thenheads? mainstay of this young country? man who tills the ground, sows the seed, and reaps the harvest is the man who, if any, should be encouraged by us. On the contrary, we. have the Prinie Minister saying that these men will be taxed, and that the tax will f a l l , not on the tenant, but on the holder of the land. From my experience, I can say that the farmer of to-day is the farm labourer of yesterday. He has saved the fruits of hard work, and bought the land, and yet it is proposed to tax this man's energy in such a manner that he will simuly be driven out of his business. The Prime Minister talks about the hardships which fanners' children suffer. I have seen nothing of that kind, although I have lived amongst them. No doubt the honourable gentleman can talk of hardships which he has seen in connection with trades unions, and we all know that there is dire distress of a certain kind among the employees of the factories; but I have seen no distress of the kind which he mentioned amongst the employees of the farmer and the dairyman. It is absolutely necessary that the farming industry should not be interfered with in any way. It 'is impossible to make a hardand-fast rule, because, as we all know auite well, the farmer is dependent on the conI only ditions of the weather. I have seen men working from early dawn to late on moonI have never been in favour light nights, with the object of getting 'in their harvest, and on wet days simply amusing themselves, much as sailors do at sea. Is it possible under such legislation as is advocated not to interfere with this particular pursuit ? Fancy the Prime Minister, that high priest of labour, talking about inI t is troducing machinery to milk cows. Milking machinery has been tried in Australia and Denmark, and has been thrown aside. Who has not noticed how a calf presses its nose against the udder of the cow? AVhat is the reason for that action? The cream lies on the top of the milk, and the object of the calf, taught by But I am firmly persuaded instinct, is to separate the cream from the milk, and allow the latter to flow. What machinery will do that ? We have not, and I see no reason are not likely to have any machinery that will replace the hand of the intelligent worker guided by his brain. chinery that has been employed successfully for a good many months. Patents Act, no doubt there -will be a chance Why harass the man who is the of some money being made out of that The machinery. But I am not in favour of machinery that will displace the worker in connection with the dairy farmer, as the majority of these workers are the sons and daughters of the farmers. I shall not detain the Committee any longer, although I should have liked to speak at greater length. I fear that this amendment will prove to be an "" uncharted rock,"" on which the Ministerial ship will strike. entered the chamber this afternoon, I did not intend to take part in this discussion; but, after listening to the various speakers, I am really at a loss to know what they have been talking about.

All these appeals that have been made by men who profess to be ihe friends of the man on the land, seem to me to be altogether foreign to the question before the Committee.

I began to wonder why he did not give notice of an amendment similar in terms to that which has been moved by the honourable and learned member for Wannon. If he was in earnest, there was no obstacle to prevent him from showing his sincerity at the time by giving notice of an amendment to exclude these people from the operation of the Bill. solidarity. does not exist, I believe, in the mind of the right honourable member.

When honourable members put before the Committee an argument of that character, if they have any knowledge of the history tion in the States, that such a thing is not calculated to come about, they are simply trying to frighten the people on There has been no attempt to organize this class of labour in New South Wales, nor has there been any such attempt in New Zealand. vision in the Bill? legislating merely for to-day, but for years to come. This Parliament is passing foundation laws under which the Commonwealth has to be governed,, and which wiil apply long after we have left this sphere. We should frame those laws as openly as possible, so as to embrace any set of conditions that may arise. Let me point out to the honourable member for Kooyong that the Bill does not indicate that the rural \vorkers shall be brought under the authority of the Arbitration Court. It simply raises no objection to the jurisdiction of the Court extending to them should necessity Cabinet solidarity arise. H a l f the arguments used by honourable members opposite show that they do not believe that there is any chance of this class of labour being affected by the Arbitration Court. Yet they try to raise a bogey class of labour is affected. The NewI do not understand Zealand law proves beyond a doubt that the new-born fears from whicli honourable members opposite are suffering is mere moonshine.

All we ask is that the law should be so framed that justice may be done to all classes of people. Why should honourable knowing, as they must know, members support an Arbitration Bill at all if they are not willing to have it generally of this kind of legislaapplied? Have we no confidence in the Court which is to be established ?

They are merely the outcome of unfounded fears, or of influence by a few electors upon honourable members opposite. I do not intend to follow the honourable membei for Richmond through his historical studies; but I must at least express my regret at his taking up such an attitude. Years ago, in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, I used to appreciate his arguments. But it seems to me that he has marvellously deteriorated as a logician and a parliamentarian since he entered Federal politics. I regret that, because he would have been an important figure in this Parliament had he retained the ability to express his knowledge and his arguments which he exhibited* as a member of the State Parliament. The honourable member for Oxley tells us that he is in favour of conciliation and arbitration, but is not in favour of compulsion. member is behind the age. Industrial arbitration, voluntarily applied, has long since been denounced as impracticable and illusive. Those who have studied the question know that arbitration which is not compulsory is not effective for the purposes for which it is proposed. The honourable member says that compulsion' is repugnant to him as a Britisher. But does he not recollect that there is a. certain amount of compulsion in all the laws under which he has lived? There can be no law without interference to some extent with the liberty or licence of the individual. Laws are made for the protection of the weak against the strong, and in this case we are making a law to establish a court of justice to which men who work on the land will have the right to appeal, so that justice may be done to them. Let me say to those honourable members who entertain fears concerning this measure that' I represent a farming district, and when the New South Wales Act was passed there were no such misgivings about the provision under discussion as now seem to be entertained. Those who imagine that any harm will be done to the farming interests in consequence of this B ill , not only do not understand it, made by the last Government. but are fighting a shadow, a myth-some thing which does not exist in fact, but only in their imagination. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON (Barker). -Knowing that there is a general desire on the part of the Committee that a division should take place at once, I have no intention to delay honourable members. 4 A merely to say that it is my intention to support the amendment. In taking up this position there is no change of attitude on my part. When the Bill was introduced by the Deakin Government I told the honourable member for Gippsland that I would support him in the action he was taking. It seems to me that it would be a mistake to include the proposed provision in this Bill. If we may judge by the experience of New South Wales and New Zealand in regard to local legislation, it is very improbable that it would be operative, and if it were, I believe that its results could only be mischievous. not propose to deal with the merits of the question, but I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the remarkable attitude of ex-Ministers.

It is provided in the New South Wales, and I think, too, in the New Zealand Act, that there must be nothing in the rules of association to prevent the joining of would be members, and I cannot see why that provision has been deliberately omitted from this Bill. The Attorney-General of New South Wales, when in i960 he introduced his first Arbitration Bill, said in effect that there would be no boycotting of non-members by unions, that there would be no obstacle in the way of men joining unions. It seems strange, therefore, that only recently, when, after a case in which the employment of men not belonging to the Wharf Labourers' Union was successfully objected to, they applied to enter the union, tendering their subscription of Case shows how the best draftsmanship may be faulty. We have been told that everv evil is provided for in the Bill, and yet we find that it makes no provision to meet a case which is specially provided for, though apparently ineffectually, in the New South Wales Act. The Attorney-General of New South Wales, speaking in the Legislative Council of that State on 31st October, .1:900, saidI provide that, as a trade union is alone allowed on behalf of the employees to bring this measure into operation, a trade union shall not Further on he declares that unionsShall be reasonably open to members of an industry who wish to share the benefits and privileges conferred by the Act. I have not a copy of the New South Wales Act, but the provision to which Mr Wise was referring requires that the rules of an industrial union or trade union, must . amongst other things, provideThat reasonable facilities shall be given to become members of the union. In the Bill before us it is provided, in subclause 2, of clause 62, that any Association applying to be registered shall comply with certain conditions, which, until otherwise prescribed, shall be those set out in schedule B. Turning to that schedule, I find that in paragraph // it is required that the rules of the Association must contain provisions as to the Times when, terms on which, persons may become, or cease to be members of the association, but so that no member shall discontinue his membership without giving at least three months' previous written notice to the secretary of his intention so to do, nor without paying all membership subscriptions, and dues owing by him to the association.

It suggests many things which even the most ardent supporters of industrial arbitration might fairly think were open to some question. whether this provision signifies that employees upon the State railways could ask the Court to determine the extent to which their privilege passes are to be granted.

I mention thiscase in order to illustrate the far-reaching provisions of the B ill, and, to suggest to the Government the desirability of reconsidering the definitions, or intended definitions. It is not desirable that we should even apparently claim excessive powers, and the definitions do suggest that such a claim is being made. I thoroughly agree with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that if it isintended to make the provisions of the measure as wide as the Constitution will permit, and I think that that is the desire of the majority of honourable members-that is a position with which we need not seriously quarrel. It is only when I see that States rights are being infringed, or when It might appear so. special circumstances seem to justify special 1 exceptions, that I raise my voice in protest. inI think that we should definitely follow the wording of the Constitution.

It, seems to me highly probable that it includes' a great many things which are by no means industries in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and which would probably not be held to come within the meaning of "" industrial "" as used -in the Constitution. It says that "" industry "" means "" business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, service, or employment."" That would include almost every service'rendered for pay or hire. It would even embrace our Defence Forces -. If the Arbitration Court were called upon to determine a question of discipline in connection with our Defence Forces, the spectacle presented would be even more striking than that furnished by a Parliamentary Select Committee engaged upon a similar task. The most ardent democrat must admit that, under certain conditions, obedience is of more immediate importance than the highest justice. I should not like to see our Defence Forces going on strike while on active service, and asking the Court to give a decision as to the rations which should be supplied to them. they would go on strike, because the men would put up with a great deal rather than allow a grievance to interfere with the discharge of their duty.

I think that the fine the word used in the Constitution. We are attempting to do something that we have no power to do. make laws under the Constitution. it. To take a concrete case, let us suppose that this definition of the word "" industry "" includes a dispute beween a doctor and his groom, and that the High Court determines that an "" industrial dispute"" under the Constitution does not include such a matter. I am not suggesting that it would or would not; but if tinder this measure such a dispute would be included, while under the Constitution it would not, our efforts to cover it in this wav would be absolutely futile. We are compelling the Arbitration Court, and the High Court in case of appeal, to ascertain first of all what the Constitution means, and, secondly, to see whether this measure provides for something for which, under the Constitution, provision may be made. This Bill cannot add anything to what the Constitution declares can be done. In the interests of good forms of legislation, and quite I do not suppose apart from the substantial merits of the question, I urge the Government to drop any definition that conflicts with all their endeavours to define the meaning of "" industrial disputes "" in the Constitution. In the Constitution, and the Constitution alone, will the Courts find a source of inspiration from which they can decide what are matters coming within the purview of this measure and what are not. The Bill cannot make the constitutional provision any wider than it is, but it may make.it more difficult to determine. I can well imagine the wealth of argument that any skilled person might employ after exhaustively discussing the Constitution, to determine whether this measure, with all its multitudinous definitions and descriptions, intended the Constitution to be limited in any particular instance.

As a matter of good drafting, it is undesirable to load the Bill in this way. If the definition of "" industrial matters "" consists of a series of suggestions, it must be admitted that the series is a most liberal one to a Court which will have enough difficulty in giving satisfactory awards all over Australia. It suggests all sorts of ways in which questions might be raised and awards given, and is certainly not calculated to make this measure what the Prime Minister says he would like it to be, an engine of potentiality, rather than for the settlement of actual disputes carried on to extremes between employers and employees. If the honourable gentleman desires that the measure should be ratfier a force to induce people to agree without going to the Court, the less we have of these suggestions-the less we have of a multiplicity of comparative details, as some of these suggestions are-the better it will be. an idea on the part of honourable members that we are limited to the discussion of a particular, expression. I would point out that no amendment is before the Committee, ancl that the remainder of the clause following the paragraph with which we have just dealt is under discussion. able and learned member for Ballarat appears to have forgotten the point which he emphasized in the course of his excellent speech, in moving the. second reading of the Bill, that we should put some faith in .the Court which will have to interpret it. that involves the reposing of faith in the It would be difficult Court.

It was, no doubt, his desire that nothing should be shut out because of any legal quibble. honourable and The suggestions made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella appear to be that we might as well omit all these definitions ancl leave it to the Judge who will have to interpret the Constitution to determine to what extent the measure covers any industry. To my mind, however, no case has been made out for the omission of any part of the clause. I do not complain of the suggestion that the Government, with, the assistance of their legal adviser, should carefully consider these definitions, but it has not been shown that any difficulty is likely to arise. That being so, we come back to the question whether we must not necessarily leave many-matters to the discretion of the Judge to be appointed under the Bill. He will determine all these questions, and I think that, as the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, it would, be reasonable to have a very wide definition. The definition now before us was evidently intended to be wide enough to cover everything, and to leave it to the Judge to determine whether any industry should be excluded. At present, no one can say definitely to what extent the Constitution goes in this direction.

Arbitration Acts have to be administered in equity and good conscience, and decisions under them must be based less upon legal technicalities than upon common-sense principles.

In some respects these rules of interpretation differ very much from Webster's definitions, and in connection with this new legislation there must have grown up from practice and custom, definitions that vary the rules of interpretation in some degree. The decisions in the New Zealand Court, for instance, would serve as a kind of guide to a Judge in determining what the terms used in this Bill really meant. a departure in that sense.

But the Court in New South Wales has undoubtedly the power, in my view. In the first schedule to the New South Wales Act, it is provided, amongst other things, that rules shall provide forThe terms on which persons may become or cease to.be members of the company, association, trades union, or branch. . . . reasonable facilities shall be given to become members of the union.

I can assure honourable members that anything we can do to make that clear, and to give fuller powers lo the Court in that direction, will be looked into by the Government. As to-the general argument in regard to the phraseology of the clause and the desirability of limiting it words, but not limiting its scope at all. bers appear to think that all we need do is to omit these words altogether. They think that the general terms of the Constitution sufficiently define the word ""industrial,"" and show what class of disputes are intended to be referred to. not, these words will not.' That is the contention. we have the power of limiting. We need WhatI not go as far as the Constitution goes, though I personally think that we should go all the distance in this case. It is a question how far we may appear to limit the constitutional power by any alteration of this explanatory clause. I cannot see that any great harm is'likely to follow from the retention of these words. I quite appreciate the self-sacrificing spirit of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, as I think they have power a member of the legal profession, in expressing the opinion that the retention of these words would increase the work for lawyers in appeals. After all, I do not see how noany appeal can be grounded on the fact that, to use the honourable and learned member's I should think there own phraseology, these words are intended to indicate to the Judges of the Arbitration Court what is aimed at by Parliament, because, after all, it is still left to the interpretation of the Constitution in each case. If the constitutional provision is wider than the words used here they can do no harm. They appeal to me, I admit, purely as an indication to the Court of what we intend. I clo not know leave them as they are. If not, it seems to me pression. I do not pretend to be able to follow all possible legal interpretations of these words, but I think it will be better to leave them as they are. beH e has the power under cause they will give some indication to the Arbitration Court of the matters which we intend shall be dealt with by the Court. The honourable member for I believe that the Court North Sydney spoke of the ""possibility of disputes coming within the cognizance of the Court over comparatively trivial matters.

If we attempt to limit the clause with respect to disputes which may be brought before the Court, we may incur the danger of the Court being prevented from settling the minor aspects of a dispute, when a really serious question is at stake. A side issue in an important dispute might require settlement when the Arbitration Court came to deal with the matter, and this provision would give the Court power to adjudicate upon all the issues that might be presented. For instance, there is the question of the privileges of railway employees which was referred to, honourable and Corinella. people that the privilege of having a free pass even once a year, although a very trifling matter, is one of the conditions of employment, and a consideration for the services rendered by the employee. it would not be wise to take any step which would limit the power of the Court to decide upon that amongst perhaps a dozen other issues submitted to it in connection with an important dispute. On the whole, I think it will be wise to allow the clause to remain in its present shape. the whole, it would be well to leave the clause as it is. well consider whether they will recommit the clause with regard to the words which define "" industrial dispute,"" and put it in the form"" Industrial dispute means all industrial disputes arising,"" & c , so that there could be no question about the interpretation embracing all such industrial disputes , as are intended to be referred to. But I think it is necessary to retain the definition of "" industrial matters,"" and of the word "" industry,"" because, when we come to the important clause 46, sub-clause / , it will be seen that power is there givenTo declare by any award, that any practice, regulation, rule, custom, term of agreement, condition of employment, or dealing whatsoever in relation to an industrial matter, shall be a common rule of any industry affected by the award. The Court would be at once be thrown upon a sea of argument and matters of doubt as to what was meant by "" industrial matters."" There would be a large amount of litigation, as to whether that would include privileges and the relations between employer and °53 employ^. If we retain the present definition of "" industrial matters,"" no possible so extended, to take the wider doubt can arise as to that, because the Court will be told what we mean by an "" industrial matter"""" all! matters relating to work,"" &c. They will find in the clause a pretty exhaustive enumeration of the various heads of determination which range themselves under the comprehensive ' term "" industrial matters."" I think it would be unwise' to eliminate the definition of "" industrial matters,"" because the words "" industrial matters,"" in the important sub-clause to which I have referred, really need some clear definition of the intention of Parliament as to what is meant to be referred to the Court. I may say the same with reI think, by the gard to the word ""industry,"" which occurs learned member for in the same sub-clause of clause 46, which It is admitted by many will be, perhaps, the main provision of the Bill affecting the prohibition of strikes and locks-out. It is probable that it will be absolutely the pivot of the B ill. Therefore, I think too much trouble cannot I think be taken to elucidate what Parliament means, so that our intention shall not be left to conjecture hereafter, or to possible amendment from time to time. Personally. I cannot, for the present at all events, see what more is wanted in the definition clause, which appears to be the result of very careful consideration and a great deal of experience and observation in regard to the various industries. For my part, I am The Government might unable to offer any suggestion to make the clause more complete. We could, of course, strike out the word ""industry,"" and leave the meaning to argument and the ultimate decision of the Court. In the first place, we do not want to do that if w'e can possibly help it, but would prefer thaf Parliament should say exactly what is meant in the use of the word. Buti f we do not put in the words "" including land or water "" a vast amount of argument may be offered as to this or that industry never being intended to be included; and that, I think, would leave the whole matter in a state of doubt. A Bill of this sort, whicli is novel so far as the Commonwealth is concernedand, indeed, is novel so far as Australia is concerned-shoul d be made as free from doubt as possible, and matters which affect industry in all its branches should not be left to chance. I would rather run the risk -which , however, I do not think is very great-of finding some unconsidered industry by chance omitted, than imperil the principle of arbitration in its application",47,Pairs
311,Mr Isaacs (Indi),"I think that, onto all the branches of industry to which we intend it to reach. I personally, of course, do not agree with the application of the B ill to State employees, but now that this House has determined that it shall so apply, the intention of' Parliament should be made as clear as possible. is quite.clear to me that this clause, or this particular definition, is intended as a dragnet, and that the Judge of the Court will have to inquire into the simplest, matters connected with the employments of people. In New South Wales there is an' Arbitration Act, ancl the Court there was asked to decide as to whether, on a Good Friday, the sum of 7s. 6d. or 5s. should be given to the drivers of bakers' carts engaged in the delivery of hot-cross buns early in the morning. To me that appears to be utterly absurd. settled in favour of the men? Judge referred the matter back, with the remark"" Surely this is a matter which you ought to be able to settle yourselves."" I do not know exactly what was the result, but some sort of compromise was arrived at. If , however, both parties had insisted, the Court could have been kept occupied in arguing the point. Is that a matter which should be brought before the Court? As I say, it appears to me absurd; and it is just this sort of thing which makes these Courts the laughing-stock of Ihe world. Surely it is not proper that every little detail connected with the arrangements between employers and employed should occupy the time of the Court. If the larger disputes only were dealt with, the Bill could be confined to the important towns or cities, and then I could understand the measure being advocated. But the honourable and learned member for Indi spoke of the "" common rule "" ; and I do not know whether, in saying that, he meant that one rule should apply to the whole of the States. question of the common rule at. present, and to have a second-reading debate. the honourable and learned member for Indi used that only as an illustration. tail of a trade may come before the Court, and I take it that the common rule would apply in such a case as is now before the tion?

Consequently, if my view of the very narrow margin which is permitted for the Court's action upon Federal agreements, is not sustained, if Federal agreements can be made, and any breach or claim arising uncler them in one State can be brought before the Arbitration Court, that tribunal will be required to transact an immense amount of what may be very trivial business.

The Bill does not compel the Court to do so; it only allows the Court, when it sees fit, to declare the common rule. It would never do to have one manufacturer in one town subject to one rule, and the rest of the manufacturers of the Commonwealth under like conditions under another rule. Thus the principal power to be conferred upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Court with regard to a grievance is simply this: that if, for the purpose of applying a common rule, it considers it expedient to break an industrial agreement, it may doso. This matter will come up for consideration when we deal with the pioposed new clause 87A, which has already been circulated.

Before resuming my seat, I wish' to show that where we use the phrase "" industrial matters "" in certain clauses, we also mean, to include a claim arising under an industrial agreement. example, at clause 30, which provides thatA certificate by the Registrar that any dispute relating to industrial matters is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State shall be -prima facie evidence that the fact is as stated. If the certificate shows that a dispute relating to an industrial agreement is an industrial dispute extending beyond the boundaries of any one State, it is to be accepted as -prima facie evidence that the fact is as stated. It is for the registrar in the first place, although* not conclusively, to say that a dispute in relation to an industrial agreement has become so widespread and so grave in its operation and consequences that he regards it as having extended bevond one S'tate, and as being a matter the Court may properly entertain. glad to have the discussion limited to the words immediately before us. When I rose to question them, it was not with any idea of entering on any of the larger issues that I was led to discuss, in reply to an interjection by the Prime Minister. No harm has been done, however, by the reference, for it reminds us Row closely we tread to these greater issues. If I may be pardoned for saying So, the point which I rose to make still remains. I do not w'ish to object to an amendment that will enable the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to have power when necessary to deal with any difficulties arising out of industrial agreements. I realize that it is necessaiy that the Court should have such a power. attempted to do. power, but they do a great deal more. I have taken two points. We know, first of all, that these agreements will be extremely complex. Many of them may cover a great variety of circumstances. They may relate, not only to hours or wages, but rights, difficulties, privileges, priority of employment, and non-employment of persons, and other matters will doubtless be dealt with by them. We may expect a great number of these' agreements. We may also expect disputes as to their interpretation to arise not infrequently. If they occur all over the Commonwealth, and we have, as the Government propose, only one Court, which, no matter how rapidly it visits the various States, will be in only one State at the one time-",52,Iioav Those Avords Have The Slightest Bearing Sary To Make It Clear That The Court Will

374,Mr Deakin,"Thes e words give thatcar. It will be impossible for one Court to deal with all these matters. the Government propose to sweep away some of the supplementary Courts, for which the late Government provided in this B ill . In any case, have the Government considered the practical question whether they have not here thrown open a door of appeal which will render it impossible for the Court to answer the expectations that may be formed in regard to it by us, or tliose outside ? Have they taken into account the impracticability of any one Court dealing with all the questions that may conceivably arise in regard to the industrial agreements that may be made all over Australia? There is that strong practical objection. In order to meet it, it seems to me that, although I must confess that the Government proposal is the easiest way of dealing with the subject, it will be necessary for them to consider whether, instead of these wide, general words, language cannot be employed that will indicate more clearly those questions of interpretation, and those agreements that will be important enough to engage the attention of a Federal Court. I waive all other difficulties. the right to waive the privilege. have been better if for this purpose the Bill had been taken as it stood. Our Court could have refused minor complaints, while this Court cannot. The whole responsibility now will be thrown upon the Judge, who, until he hears thecase, may not be acquainted with the nature of the business with which he has to deal. Until he hears the evidence, he will not know whether the Case to be determined involves a question of importance, or a comparatively trifling matter. All these considerations are related. I think that these wide words, simple as they are, take in a great deal more than the Government intend them to cover. they will embrace more matters than one Court will be able to manage. One of the dangers of the Court will be that it may be called upon to have before it disputes that are of a comparatively and relatively trifling cliaracter, and safeguards ought to be devised for confining its attention to great questions, such as it is reallyconstituted 2 0 which could be dealt with by the local Courts or other tribunals more speedily and quite as effectively should not be encouraged to come to the Federal Court. These wide I think that words are f u l l of danger, and I cannot, in my own mind, put a limit to the classes of cases that might be presented as claims arising out of agreements when those agreements cover the ground provided for by this B ill . great deal of importance is attached to these words, but it strikes me that they are better in the clause than out of it. these words are too wide. that the idea of the Government, if I caught it aright, is to do away with private boards under industrial agreements, and to see that the Court which is to deal with arbitration matters generally shall also deal with industrial agreements. The fear of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is that the Arbitration Court will be engaged in doing work which otherwise would be done by private boards. might be done by the States boards in many , cases, I think. vernment's proposal, no limit is put on an industrial agreement which may well relate I consider that it would to private boards. vent an employer and' his employees when making an industrial agreement as I understand the matter that. they propose to strike out clauses 81 and 82, but that will not affect what I am saying in the smallest degree.

They are trying to get an award of the Court made a common rule in an industrial agreement, so as to control every business throughout the country; really to throw the business into their own hands. The conditions in small towns are so different from those in large cities that we should in some way or other guard against any attempt of that kind. An industrial agreement made ih New South, Wales between the master tanners and curriers and their employees fixes the wages outside the county of Cumberland at 11 \ per cent, more than those paid inside that county. It will be seen that the employers and the employees in the metropolis are working together to crush out the industry in the country towns. This places in the hands of not only the men, but the masters, in large cities the power to cripple small industries in country districts. Our .experience in New South Wales is that the Arbitration Act is hitting the small man severely. We should encourage the extension of employment in the country rather than in the cities if possible. It is not posConstitution. sible to have a common rule applied all over this great Commonwealth. But, under this Bill, if a dispute arises in Victoria, and extends into New South Wales, and the two States take it in hand, a common rule may become the award of the Court. It would not be fair to extend that rule to Tasmania or some other State where entirely different conditions apply.

If the common rule amongst other things, if a claim is made made by the Federal Court were to apply under an industrial agreement, to make an in one State only, there might be something award; and there will also be power under to be said for it. A remark made by the clause 33, if one of the parties brings the honourable and learned member for Ballamatter to the Court to have a common rule rat left me doubtful as fo the meaning of made in accordance with the agreement. industrial agreements. It seemed to me that the idea was that, supposing Victoria had a dispute, and an award of the Court were given, it would apply in other States give that common rule application to an industrial agreement without entering into the whole subject afresh. if, when a dispute arises in one State, this Bill makes the common rule apply in all the States, we shall be acting against the whole spirit of the Constitution. We should not put into this Bill provisions which are intended to deal with State industrial disputes, apart from Federal industrial disputes. My point might be met if the provision were made to readNo claim arising under an industrial agreement having a Federal bearing. Or some such words as those.

It will enable ordinary voluntary agreements to come within the region of disputes, and then everything else will follow. Amongst other things, what was an industrial agreement on voluntary lines may become an agreement after a dispute. What will be the result of that? It will have the effect of an award, and instead of being binding as the old agreement was between the parties, it will bind everyone. Under clause 37 it is provided that the award of the Court shall be binding on, amongst others, the parties, organizations, and persons "" on whom the award is declared by the Court to be binding."" amendment to that clause. after parties have entered into an industrial agreement, one party can bring the matter before the Court, and then the award will be made binding, and the common rule can be applied right through the State. under this part of the B ill will be a perfect farce, because it could be broken the day after it was entered into. ister to deal with these private agreements in the proper place. An amendment can be made giving some jurisdiction to the Court to entertain certain disputes that may arise as to the wording of the agreement, or as to the enforcement of it, but surely it is not intended that after a voluntary agreement is entered into, the matter may be brought by one of the parties before the Court, which will deal with it as though there had been a dispute. learned member noticed clause 30 ?

They can apply under that industrial agreement a common rule throughout the State. No doubt that is a legitimate development of the insertion of these words in the definition clause.

For instance, when a reference is made to a common rule as regards wages, it must be remembered that equality in wages depends on the purchasing power of money, and not on the exact amount of money received. A common rule with respect to wages might give an equal amount to wage earners in different parts of a State without giving each an equivalent in value.

The honourable member, for instance, made it appear that the bread-carters appealed to the Court in that State. question was a special matter, and arose because there was some doubt about the extra delivery in the morning, and both employers and workmen appealed to the Court to know what they should do. The Judge told them that they could clo as they liked without breaking the law, and the employers and their men fixed the matter up without an appeal to the Court.

We propose later to take steps in the direction he speaks of; but they will take the form of a substantive motion, which the Committee will be able to decide upon its merits. me that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has made out a strong case against the proposed addition to the clause in its present form, he has shown that the apparently innocent proposed addition is by no means so innocent as it looks, and should, therefore, be considered with extreme caution in view of its possible latest potentialities. We should be particularly careful to make the interpretation clause so clear that there shall be no room for doubt as to the meaning of anything contained in the BiU. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat has certainly shown that the words proposed to be added to the clause are capable of a very much wider interpretation than apparently ever was intended by those responsible for the amendment. Clause 30 providesA certificate by the Registrar that any dispute relating to industrial matters is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State shall be -prima facie evidence that the fact is as stated. By way of friendly suggestion, rather than by way of amendment, I ask the Prime Minister to add the following words to those which have already been moved :certified by the Registrar to be a claim within the meaning of this Act. That, it seems to me, would get over any difficulty in the way of unduly extending the provisions of the Bill beyond the boundaries intended by its framers. ber would give the Registrar judicial functions ? posed to be familiar with the provisions, and, as we rlo riot know what the subsequent clauses may be, it is all the more necessary to be particularly careful that the interpretation clause is all right, and leave no room for doubt by reason of ambiguity. Anything which follows will bind the Registrar himself, so that no claim of this kind will be considered unless it be certified to as coming within the meaning of the Eill. ried out, will throw the onus of responsibility on the Registrar, and will leave no doubt whatever as to the scope of the interpretation clause. hope the Government will pay no heed to the suggested amendment, which would be.most unwise, inasmuch as it would leave the decision with the Registrar instead of with the Court. member does not desire to go beyond the scopeof the Bill? must come before the Court.

Arbitration Courts in some of the States it is necessary to give power in the Bill to deal with these matters in dispute. I do I not think there is any likelihood of the time of the Court being unduly taken up, because there is the restriction that the measure can deal only with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. I do not want to go into the,arguments which the honourable and learned member raised as to disputes so extending, especially with regard, for example, to shearing disputes. The honourable and learned member pointed out that if a dispute arose, and an award were given, there might be a difficulty if the dispute arose only in one State. A shearing dispute is one which would not only be likely to extend, but probably would extend, beyond the limits of any one State, and no doubt the Court would have",58,Iioav Those Avords Have The Slightest Bearing Sary To Make It Clear That The Court Will

I should be willing to let the matter go if the definitions in the' interpretation clause were to be considered after the other clauses had been 'dealt with, but we are following the reverse order, and we have no guarantee that the other clauses in the Bill will not be amended, perhaps out of all recognition. This makes it all the more necessary to see that the definitions are properlv drawn. I am afraid that there is behind the proposals of the Government an intention to make the B ill more far-reaching than it appears to be. member that that is'a'mistake. sible that the definition may be construed so as to include matters not now within the purview of this House. It is desirable that there shall be no ambiguous phraseology in the interpretation clauses. If the words ""certified by the Registrar to be a claim within the meaning of the Act"" are added, we shall be perfectly safe, because it will then rest with the Registrar to see. before the Court is moved, that the claim is a legitimate one. I see no objection to the insertion of those words. The acceptance of that amendment could not hurt the Bill, if the intention is not to go beyond the scope of the present definition. ber desire that the Registrar shall have the same power as the President of the Court? vided that a certificate of the Registrar shall be -prima facie evidence that a dispute relating to industrial matters is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. ber's proposal makes the Registrar the final arbiter. 30 doea Why should he not have power to examine a claim, before the Court is moved, to see that it is legitimate? In many cases it is the Registrar who moves the Court, and he should have power to look into these matters to see that the claim is one in regard to which the Court should be moved. If the Attorney-General-sees no Of objection to the words themselves, there can be no reason against their acceptance, unless there is an intention to extend the application of the clause beyond what is at present contemplated. at the position taken up by the honorable member for Lang. What would he accomplish by putting in the words which he wishes to insert? The Registrar would.not have power to hear a case. It may be very difficult for the President of the Court to say how far the jurisdiction shall extend. Surely we should not vest in the Registrar, who may have no legal knowledge, and who has no power to hear the case or to make inquiries, the power to decide. Under clause 30 the Registrar will deal merely with matters of f a c t; the matters now under consideration are matters of law. It seems to me that the acceptance of the I assure the honourable honourable member's amendment would accomplish the end which some honourable gentlemen have in view that is, that it would make the measure a failure. I look with suspicion upon amendments suggested by those' who, whenever they speak, declare themselves opposed to the measure. The Bill may be capable of improvement, but I think that amendments coming from its' enemies should be regarded with distrust. In my opinion this is one of their plots. ney) -If anything could surprise me in connection with the consideration of this measure it is the speech of the honourable member for Darling. He has taken exception to any one but himself criticising, or even speaking upon the Bill, though I think he has spoken already three or four times on the clause now before us. And, further than that, he asks"" Why should we trust the Registrar to decide whether a claim is within the provisions of the measure?Are we going to make him a Judge?""

That is only what he is empowered to do in connection with disputes, which are far more important than agreements. I do not object to honourable members replying to criticisms, but I take exception to remarks which impugn the bona fides of honourable members on this side of the Chamber. If the accusation against the honourable member for Lang is well founded, the honourable meniber for Darling has also impugned his own motives by his own act in supporting the provision to which I have referred in the interpretation clause. The Attorney General sees no objection to the amendment, except that it is covered by a subsequent clause. it sufficient to say that the amendment was covered by a subsequent clause, but I could have mentioned grave objections to it. willing to accept that explanation.

Neither in clause 30 nor in the interpretation clause is that attempted.

The two clauses, to which reference has already been made, certainly do not justify the action taken. made by several honourable members as to the difficulty of thoroughly grasping the effect of the printed amendments in the way in which they have been put forward, and I must say that I quite appreciate its justice. I inquired from the Government Printer what would be the cost of making the proposed alterations in the Bill itself, and ascertained that it was set up, nearly twelve months ago, in type that has since been discarded, so far as the printing of Bills is concerned, and that consequently to have all the amendments inserted in the Bill would cost as much as dirl the original setting. original setting of the Bill? sult the Government Printer, and he was unable, on the spur of the moment, to give me an estimate. -Avould cost ; £ i o to print copies of the Bill as proposed to be amended by us, and that it would cost considerably more at a later stage to put the Bil l in order for transmission to the Senate. this Committee might involve the loss of thousands of pounds. present conditions are likely to lead to any mistake.

Honourable members are, doubtless, aware that one part of that Bill dealt with the whole of the coasting trade of Australia, whether undertaken by Australian ships, by British ships not coming within the scope of the Constitution, or by foreign vessels. To that end, elaborate machinery was provided. about to be considered by a Royal Commission, and, consequently, the Attorney General might well be asked to give us his view of the meaning of the words "" land or water ' ' in this clause, assuming that this measure is passed without any Navigation B ill . He' might further indicate whether the Government propose to supplement these words by a provision in any other measure, or by an addition to this Bill, that will restore practicallv the same condition of affairs that obtained when we had the Navigation Bill, and Conciliation ancl Arbitration Bill, going, so to speak, band in hand. Attorney-General) I think it is due to the honourable and learned member, as leader of the Opposition, that I should reply at once to his questions. It is the intention of the Government to submit new clauses to the Committee. the purpose of making it perfectly clear how far this provision for Arbitration Courts is to operate in regard to ships, whether interState or over-sea. The honourable and learned member has asked me to express my view as to the interpretation of the words as they here stand, "" on land or water."" -My view, right or wrong, is that the word's on land or water,"" would not cover oversea ships; that the word "" water "" would be limited to the water over which we have direct jurisdiction, and that that would mean all the ships ancl boats on our rivers, or within three miles of our shores. But we shall require to put in this Bill some supplemental clauses in order to fill the gap which the withdrawal of the Navigation Bill has caused in the legislation which was As I cannot obtain proposed by the late Government, and is approved by the present Government. an amendment, which, on consideration, I do not think I shall move. I wish to draw from the Government and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat a statement as to what is really meant by the words which have just been referred to. Honourable members will remember that the words found their way into the B ill, I think, after the resignation of the honourable and learned meniber for Adelaide, as Minister of Trade and Customs, and there seems to have been a difference of opinion between Ministers regarding it . The first draft confined the That measure, however, is now operation of the clause toBritish ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance, and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. Those words were struck out, and the words "" on land or water"" inserted, so that there must be a significance in the difference, or, I suppose the. Bill would not have been amended. I do not think that either the provision in the Navigation Bill, or any provision which may be put into this B ill, can possibly give jurisdiction over ocean-going vessels, whether foreign or British. scope of the Constitution. foreign vessels from coming here if we like? rests with the Imperial Government. No doubt we have power to prevent an alien from landing on our shores. But surely we would not arrogate to ourselves the right to stop a vessel coming from a foreign country from entering the three-mile limit. If we In this Bill? did, it would be an absolute breach of our obligation to the Imperial Government, who deal with these external affairs. There is a provision in the Constitution giving us the right to deal with ""external affairs;"" but the man has not yet been born who can tell what it means. I know thatat Home they had .great doubt as to what it meant, and I do not think there is anyone in the Commonwealth who can say what is covered by the use of the words "" external affairs."" There is no doubt that foreigners are subject to our laws when they come within the limit of our jurisdiction; but, at the same time, our laws are such as we can pass by delegation from the Imperial Government, and we have not the power to do more within our . territorial limits as regards vessels than to regulate the coasting trade.

In that case the difference between the right honourable member for Adelaide and tlie late Ministry was, in my opinion, tweedledum these words mean practically nothing. The powers claimed by the right honourable member for Adelaide could not, under the Constitution, be enforced either in the Navigation Bill or in this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I state this for the purpose of inquiry. I think, however, that I am right. We have had about the biggest fight on this question as affecting coastal vessels that has taken place in this Parliament. It led to the resignation of a Minister. Yet it seems to me that our powers are exceedingly definition put u p o n ' "" coasting trade"" in the Navigation Bill is not in accordance with the Constitution. are in a different position. They may be in a better position; because, in section 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, sub-section c, there is a provision that, while we have power as regards British ships, our powers in regard to foreign ships are subject to treaty rights created prior to 1869. Therefore foreign ships may have a right to come here without being subject to the limitations which we can place upon British ships. good in proceeding with ""the amendment of which I have given notice, because my amendment is to the effect that we cannot, either in this B ill or in a Navigation Bill, touch ocean-going vessels, whether foreign or British.

I am glad that he has seen his way not to propose an amendment at this stage. I do not think this would be the stage at which to carry out his objects, if he wished to carry them out. I do not intend to do more at the present time than to assure the Committee that, so far as I can see, we need not be apprehensive that, in dealing with the vessels which we are proposing to That is probably deal with-vessel s which take in cargo at Fremantle and leave caigo in Melbourne, and which take in passengers at Adelaide the clauses in the last and leave those passengers in Sydneywe are infringing the Constitution.

MrM c DONALD order to exempt the persons to whom I have referred, I do not think' that these words would be in the Bill. I do not intend to labour the question, as I feel sure that honourable members have their minds made up in regard to it. the amendment, although I do not regard it as a matter of very great importance. In the first place, the Government are advised that all employees of persons engaged in business will come under the Bill without the amendment. In New South Wales, the Arbitration Court, fortified, on appeal, by the Full Court, has decided that cooks and waitresses are not domestic servants within the meaning of the Act ; that is, cooks and waitresses are held to be engaged in an industry. waitresses ? are advised that on that decision of the New South Wales Courts, the opinion is held that all servants, men and women, of employers who are engaged in conducting a business, as distinct from private individuals who employ domestic servants for household duties, are within the purview of the New South Wales Act. Consequently, the exemption of domestic servants only affects those who are engaged in private homes. I do not think it is likely that the exemption in line 19, which it is proposed to omit, will prevent other than purely domestic servants from coming within, the operation of the measure. Of course, as a matter of principle, I do not desire to see any large class of the community exempted from the operation of the Bill, always keeping in view the Constitution ; and, for that reason, I am willing to accept the decision of the Committee on the amendment. I . do not think it likely, in view of the law as declared in New South Wales, that many cases, if any, will arise which will bring this particular class of person under the operation of the measure, even if the amendment be carried. The Government simply take the same stand they ""have taken in regard to other portions of the Bill, as, for instance, in their opposition to the exemption of the agricultural class. The Government think that the operation of the Bill ought to extend as far as the Constitution will allow; and, in consonance with that view, I have no objection to the amendment, except that I do not think it will have the far-reaching consequences vvhich the honourable member for KennedyI f it were not in may at first have been inclined to suppose. The New South Wales decision is that all who are employed, As I have said, though it may be in a domestic capacity, in the carrying on of a business for profit, come within the measure, despite the fact that in the New South Wales Act, as is proposed in this Bill also, domestic servants are exempted. The phraseology is very similar. this amendment has been proposed. A few days ago, observing that no notice bf any such amendment had been given, I asked the Prime Minister whether he had any objection to a proposal of the kind. I feel that the objection raised in regard to the noninclusion of waitresses of a special classan objection raised by interjection by the honourable and learned member for North Sydney-lose s its weight when looked at from a just and equitable stand-point. I do not see that it matters whether a waiter or a waitress be employed in an hotel or in a private house at Toorak; I can see no reason why there should not be equal treatment. I do not see why a groom in private employment should not have the same advantages as are enjoyed by another groom employed at a livery stable. If we start making these distinctions we might as well give up the whole spirit of tbe Bill, which is that'every person shall have equal treatment before the law. Why should a gardener who is a domestic servant, not have equal treatment with.the gardener vvho is employed by the man who grows produce for market ? Then, again, there is the case of the servant who shaves his employer at home; and I ask whether he ought not to have the same treatment as that accorded to a barber employed in a shop. putes in relation to such people to extend bevond the limits of any one State? disputes in relation to waitresses and cooks employed in hotels may extend beyond the limits of any one State, and I do not see why we should not take the same view in regard to waitresses and cooks in private employment. My own opinion is that a good many of the class which come within the sweeping definition of the B ill will never come before the Court, for the simple reason that disputes of the kind will not extend beyond a State. On the other hand, if there is a possibility of such domestic ser-",68,Thomson No T As It Ber Very Closely And I Can See That His Mo

Their services are at the disposal of their employers during the whole of the time; and, as I say, it is such conditions which make domestic service so utterly distasteful to many men and women. I»do not feel that to-night I represent the "" Cook Ladies' Union,"" but I may say that during the election, a body, largely composed of mistresses, called the National Women's League asked me some question on the point at Geelong, and my answer-which , I may say, gave rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction-wa s that, in my opinion, every class of worker, including the domestic worker, ought to come within the operation of a measure of this kind, and that my vote would not be directed to excluding any special class. If any class needs protection, it is the domestic servants. time efforts have been made to organize those engaged in domestic service, and I only trust that in the future their organization may be such as to make it possible for them to take advantage of this Bill. the vote we give to-night on this clause, we have it in our power to do much good to a large number of unprotected workers.

The Victorian Shops and Factories Act of 1896, in sections 39, 40, and 41, makes provision for the employment of waitresses, and so forth, by providing thatFor the purpose of the two last preceding secA r e domestic sertions of this -Act every waitress employed in a restaurant, coffee palace, hotel, eating-house, or fish and oyster shop, shall be deemed to be a I consider that domesperson employed in a shop, and the keeper, proprietor, or occupier of every such restaurant, coffee palace, hotel, eating-house, or fish and oyster shop, shall be deemed to be the occupierof a shop within the meaning of the said sections. It goes on to fix the hours during whicfr persons employed in these shops shall work, showing that protection is given in Victoria as well as in New South Wales. Does the Prime Minister seriously propose that the Commonwealth Court shall have its time taken up in settling disputes between mistresses and maid servants relating to hours of work and rates of pay ?

How can the thousands of employers of domestic servants in Australia become members of one union?

Sydney) I support the request for an adjournment, for several reasons. that I am sure that there will be a dozen or more speakers on this subject. Another is that honourable members were not aware that the Government intended to accept the amendment. Honourable members should be in possession of that information. If we are forced into continuing the debate now, we may feel compelled to resort 'to action which would give rise to ill-feeling, and that had better be avoided. MrO ' MALLEY (Darwin) I rise to enter a protest against the manner in which the business of the House is being interfered with. We come here every day at 2.30 p.m., and are called upon to listen to a lot of doubly-distilled rubbish. We have listened to references to everything beneath the heavens and above Hades from the honourable and learned member for Wannon. He has discussed every subject on earth except the question before the Committee, and I think it is about time that honourable members entered their protest. If the Opposition have the necessary nufnbers, let them eject the Government from office. I would ask the Prime Minister to stiffen hisis in Sydney now. back and fight the matter out. Honourable members opposite get up whenever they feel disposed, and talk of everything and nothing, and then at 10.30 p.m. ask for an adjournment. We have been going on for several months now, and not one honourable member has earned his allowance. I have watchpd the peculiar methods adopted by honourable members, which are unlike those of Christians or heathens, and I hope that a stop will be put to the present mode of procedure. hope that the Prime Minister will oppose the adjournment. It may be quite true that several honourable members wish to speak, but it is also true that a number of honourable members are prepared to go on with tlie business. I have listened to dozens of second-reading speeches in. connection with the discussion of the Bill in Committee. This objectionable practice has been pursued with the evident intention of wasting time. I trust that the Prime Minister -will be firm, and push on the business as quickly as possible. . MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I do not offer any objection to the proposed adjournbers to support him if a division were taken ment at this stage, because it has been the rule to adjourn about this time on Tuesday evenings.

MrM c DONALD I have been told byseveral honourable members, on whom I can rely, that they are only marking time, in order to allow the right honourable member for East Sydney to return to Melbourne. It is a scandal and a disgrace that we should be required to come here day after day and waste valuable time simply because one right honourable member is absent earning money in New South Wales.

Some of the honourable members to whom I have referred are appearing in the Courts in Sydney, and attending to their own business instead of looking after public affairs.

There is not a scintilla of truth in it . with a very funny lot. attempt as that indicated has ever been made. the effort made by honourable members on this side of the Chamber to have a division taken before tea, rather than afterwards, upon the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Wannon.

Their duties are in many ways as' hard and as unpleasant as are those of almost any class in the community. On the other hand, I am oppressed by the knowledge that to include them in this Bill would be to hold out an utterly illusory hope to them. No doubt other honourable members are in the same position. Their judgment moves them in one way, and their sympathy in another. I think it is reasonable, as the honourable member for Kennedy and the Prime Minister admits, that we should Court to deal with. of leaving fhis and that to the High Court, but I am glad that the Prime Minister has .agreed to report progress, so that we shall be able to resume the consideration of the question to-morrow, when none of us will be angry, no matter which way the vote goes. have spoken to-night, but for the remark made by the honourable and learned member for Wannon that this amendment would not have been moved but for the fact that .some days ago he drew attention in this Committee to the exemption of domestic servants. I would inform honourable members that I made a note of this exemption some weeks ago, and would have moved for the inclusion of domestic servants had not the honourable member for Kennedy done so. It was only because I desired to correct the statement made by the honourable and learned member for Wannon that I considered it necessary to speak at this stage. the Government recognise that it has been usual to adjourn about 10.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, and that my only reason for offering any objection to the request that progress be reported was that I was not satisfied that there was a large number of honourable members, in addition to the honourable and learned member for Wannon, who desired to discuss this question. If an important amendment is suddenly accepted by the Government it is only fair to afford an opportunity to those who have left for their homes to consider the new condition of affairs created by that acceptance. I personally do not regard the amendment as being very important. I have already expressed the opinion that a proposal to bring domestic servants under I an Arbitration Court is not likely to be brought into operation under a Federal law. I do not see any probability of such a provision in a Federal law being likely to operate, at least for a long time to come. It was rather because of the reason that has just been expressed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that we did not make this a Government question. I believe that all the members of the Cabinet are in perfect harmony with the principle underlying the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, but it seems a somewhat illusory hope to hold out to a number of servant girls that under the Constitution Federal machinery can be brought to their assistance. a sham?

As a matter of principle, therefore, I have no objection to the amendment, neither, so far as I am aware, has any member of the Cabinet. The point at issue, now, is the question of whether progress should be reported. On the whole,'we have not done badly to-day. We have discussed a large number of important matters, and I quite believe that there is no organized attempt to delay the passing of the Bill. The debate, so far, has been mostly due to a desire to elucidate the bearing of a number of different points which must inevitably crop up, more especially when, as in our case, we have a written Constitution governing our actions. I do not complain of the progress that has been made to day, although I should like the headway to be a little more rapid. the consideration of this Bill, we shall be able to make a little better progress, and that there will be no undue delay. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. That the House do now adjourn. the Prime Ministeri f he has been able to see his way to deal with the matter bf the clothing allowances for the Defence Forces, about which I asked a question the other evening? After the honourable and learned member made his representation lastweek, I asked the Minister of Defence to look into the matter, and advise me as to how it stood. I am informed by him thatThe. Financial and Allowance Regulations, paragraph 89, provides as a safeguard that certain Clothing and Corps Contingent Allowance "" will, subject to provision being made by Parliacarry on the expenditure out of a vote alment,"" be credited to Officers Commanding. The practice of issuing such allowance has varied in the different States, but where Commanding Officers have required advances to enable them to tide over financial difficulties, such advances have been frequently made when funds have been available. As these amounts are really due "" at the -commencement of the financial year,"" provision could be made in the first Supply Bill prefrom another point of view, because we sented to Parliament for payment of same to those Corps who require them, and thus both maintain the Regulation (which is advisable), and to enable Commanding Officers to pay cash for their supplies. My honourable colleague supplied me with a I do not statement of the total sum paid for clothing during 1903-4, and the sum proposed in the Estimates for 1904-5. The total sum for the different States and Thursday Island comes to .£46,765 for this year, and practically a similar amount is proposed for next year. I do not see any difficulty in the way of making the allowance available earlier than the voting of the Estimates. It is worthy of the attention of the Government and the House whether it would not be possible to make some better arrangement in regard to works and buildings, and I dare say that the right honourable member for Swan has recognised its necessity. In regard to the matter which the honourable and learned member for Corinella has brought up, if we have to wait until the Estimates have been passed before we can attempt to make use of the money voted, it will mean I hope that when we next resume that very little time will then be available in which to arrange contracts and spend the money that is voted for the whole year. In the same way with military and other works and buildings, the Estimates are passed, perhaps, four months after the nnancial year has begun, with the result that there is only a period of eight months in which to make all the arrangements for the spending of a vast sum. It means that we have to increase the staff, perhaps to abnormal strength, or to have at the end of the year a large unexpended balance, which has to be re-voted year after year. It is worthwhile to consider whether, in the future, it would not be wise to have a special estimate for works, which might be brought up and be authorized for operating on at an earlier period of the financial year. has been experienced in all the States. 1 always noticed in the Parliament of New South Wales. But in our case it is accentuated by the cash system under which the expenditure of the vote ceases immediately the financial year ends.

But to have it available at an early date will be, I have no doubt, a great advantage to the commanding officers.
