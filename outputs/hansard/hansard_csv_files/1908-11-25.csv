MAIL DELIVERY, SYDNEY. know from the PostmasteVGenerali f an answer has yet been received to a questionwhich I asked relating to the administration of the Postal Department in Sydneymaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :1. No confusion exists at any time in tbe Mail Branch. Inconvenience is experienced owinjf to want of space and congestion or accumulation of work naturally occurs with the heavy posting prior to the departure of mails. 2. In addition to the advertised clearancesof posting-boxes, special clearances are mndeof boxes at busy centres, in order to expeditethe work of sorting as much as possible. An alternative to increasing the staff and space byinitiating a system of collecting mail matter from premises in the business parts of. the citywould involve the employment of a Urge number of extra bands on the clearing staff, witha consequential increase in cost, without affording any advantages, as posting would not be effected until prior to the last clearance foreach mail, and the existing inconvenience and* congestion for want of space would' continue. As regards the want of space, alterations bave been decided upon which will give additionalroom, and the matter is in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. from the Prime Ministeri f he is aware of any precedent for. the appointment of both a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator for the same State, Colony, or Territory.

6,Sir John Forrest,"I wish to knowto know whether the Constitution empowered the Goveniment to appoint an Administrator for Papua, whether there was any need for appointing such an officer, and whether it is not likely that difficulty will be created by having, in a -small place like Papua, a Lieutenant-Governor representing His Majesty, and invested with the Royal Prerogative, and a second officer who, by virtue of the title of Administrator, may be presumed to be 'invested with that prerogative. I know of no precedent for such appointments. Perhaps the Prime Minister will explain why established usage has been departed from in this case. of the moment; say what precedent there is in the action of the authorities of any other British community'for what has been done; but the terms of section 13 of the Papua Act may, assist the right honourable member in coming to a conclusion as to the constitutionality of what has been done in this case. That section reads as follows(1) The Governor General may, by Commission under the Seal of the Commonwealth, appoint an Administrator, who during any vacancy in the office of Lieutenant-Governor, or when the Lieutenant-Governor is absent from the Territory or unable by reason of illness, to perform his duties, shall administer the GovernDefence has the matter in hand. ment of thc Territory, and while so administering shall have and may exercise and perform all the powers and functions' of the Lieutenant-Governor.

It was subsequently approved by the Postmaster-General that the erection of the line be proceeded with. that date an inspection of the route has been Minister, upon noticemade, details prepared for calling tenders, and a contract for the poles required (93) has been posals, with the object of giving Parliament full' let. 2.

CATTS asked the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the fact that mails intended for delivery on Christmas Eve last year were, in many cases, four and five days late, will he take such early steps to provide for the extra business at Christmas time as will obviate the recurrence of such delays and consequent dissatisfaction ? honourable member's question is as follows :Yes, I am pleased to say such steps are now being taken. Colonel FOXTON asked the Posthave pleasure in giving full and careful master-General, upon notice1. Is he aware that the allowance or commission on sale of postage stamps, which is payable to railway stationmasters, acting as postmasters, has not yet been paid to such stationmasters in Queensland in respect of the six months ended 30th June last? 2. Is he aware that such commission in respect of the previous period of six months was not paid in Queensland until the same was several months overdue ? 3. Can he say whether the Postmaster-General's Department or the State Railways Department is responsible foT the delays? 4. Will he take such steps as may be necessary to insure that these amounts will be paid in future with reasonable punctuality? position of this matter, as under the arrangement in force with the Raihvay Commissioners, payment to stationmasters is not made direct by the Postmaster-General's Department. The Deputy PosmasterGeneral, Brisbane, reports as follows regarding the action of this Department in the matter1. Payment of commission for the half-year to June, igoS, was made to the Railway Department on the 26th June. 2. Payment for the previous half-year was made on the 29th February, 1908. It was held back awaiting inquiry and decision on an overpayment in the preceding half-year. 3. The Railway Department distributes the -mount to its officers. 4. Future payments will be made when due. AND STATES.

31,Mr Fisher,"The duty that falls upserious and careful attention which they detion of £37,000 in the estimated revenue serve and require. The first question to from the Post and Telegraph Department. which a Treasurer must give attention is Thlat Department has already received undoubtedly the a/ll-important one of the from the Treasurer's Advance a sum of finances of the Commonwealth, with the £20,438 in excess of the estimated exadministration of which he is charged. In penditure for the year. The deficit, that -regard, I find, speaking generally, therefore, amounts at present to £57>438, that 'our financial position is fairly secure leaving on the whole of the Estimates, on the basis of the Estimates submitted to which are accepted by the Government, a the House by my predecessor. goes to show, however, that there will be £42,362, a shortage of £37,000 in the estimated surplus by granting to the Defence Departrevenue of the Post and Telegraph Department a sum of nearly £11,ooo, and the ment. In other words, the corrected estiwhole of the balance, with any further mate shows that the return from the Deamounts that may come in from all sources, partment during the current financial year owing to the good season, or by any excess will be £37,000 less than was originally of revenue over the present careful esticonsidered likely. the discrepancy in the Estimates? mind, is a very small one. I intend to give short made up to it, and also to meet the the House the benefit of inquiries that have £20,438 which it has already had from the been made, and the fullest information Treasurer's advance^ with, I venture to available from the officers. the receipts and expenditure of the Departestimate which is now submitted is borne ment of Trade and Customs, we find that out by the results as I ' think' it will be. in all likelihood we shall be able to make It is a fairly conservative estimate, and an actual cash saving of something like has been very carefully drawn up from the £89,000 on the Estimates as submitted. reports that have been handed to me.

39,Mr Fisher,"The right honorablethe shape of bounty, three-fourths of that sum out of its own share, as the sugar is nearly all grown by white labour now. The Commonwealth's share of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 received in sugar Excise would be only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , and we should have to pay in bounty £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 , so losing £ 5 0 , 0 0 0. Therefore, in this instance, if we do not get the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , we save the £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Since taking office, I have paid to the trust fund for old-age pensions during this month the sum of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Eveni f I have not the pleasure of putting any more money to that fund, I think .that my statement as regards the provision for old-age pensions, based, as it is, on that payment of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , is a very fair proposal in the meantime. From my point of view, and from the point of view of the Government, that part of the finances is regarded as fairly satisfactory, because, owing to last-season being rather a poor one, there are, undoubtedly, indications of a reduction of revenue, both in the Post and Telegraph Department and from Trade and Customs. That being so, honourable members and the country may congratulate themselves on the ability of the Australian people to pay taxes to meet the cost of government. Speaking generally, while we are able to more than meet the Estimates as submitted to the House-mor e than carry out the promises that have been made to the DepartmentsI admit that the principal spending Departments, those of Defence and Post and Telegraphs, would cheerfully undertake the responsibility of year if it were available. nately it is not available, nor could any Government be expected to meet a request for any such amount.' But the consideration of the question of the granting of extra money to those Departments will devolve on any Government which has the honour and duty of presenting future financial statements. Government to provide the money if it is escape notice, and there is no document urgently necessary for those works? Why to show the actual total amounts to which should they not borrow it? no objection to answer interjections, it of the general policy of the Government, . would be difficult for me in this my ""first I may say that we are committed fully to effort to answer every interrogation put lo old-age pensions. We hope-and we shall me in that manner. The honourable memsee that we are able-to give f u l l effect ber for Wimmera will, perhaps, remember to the measure already on the statutethat statements have been made to the book, providing for old-age pensions Postal Commission that money is needed by throughout Australia. the Post and Telegraph Department for its requirements to the extent of some millions. It is only a matter of degree how much you intend to do. I have stated to honourable members, and to the country, -that we have accepted the responsibility of the Estimates. We feel that we are able to give effect to them, and to have an actual cash surplus, which we shall be able to devote to the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department, and which, with what has been already given and what may be given later, may amount to anything up to £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 . That, taking it all in all, is a fairly satisfactory position for any one who occupies the office that I occupy to be able to announce. Before leaving the question of finance I wish to touch upon the matter of commitments in these Estimates. Honourable members will remember that more than once during the discuss'ion of the Estimates I have drawn attention to the fact that the Committee are often asked to vote small sums on account-perhap s £ 4 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 for a large building or work, which must be continued afterwards. I find, on making an estimate of the actual amounts involved, that £ 1 6 0 , 0 0 0 more than has already been voted will be required!. to complete the works. what is on the present Estimates? has been adopted in all Parliaments. I mention this fact because, in a spending £300,000 more this previous Parliament, I took occasion Unfortuto urge that, when we were asked to vote, say, an instalment of £ 5 , 0 0 0 on account of a work involving £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , the Estimates ought to show what balance remained to be appropriated. mates do so in many cases. be discovered in the present Estimates we are committed by the items before us.",16,Honourable Members Hear Hear

65,Mr Fisher,"In my present position,word that I am doing my very best to make -my observations understood. T have now to refer to a question of very great importance, which, I venture to say, has been discussed in this House more than any other question that has come before us. I refer to that perennial problem, the Federal Capital site. This ahd the other branch of the Legislature have decided by resolution to change the site from Dalgety to Yass-Canberra; and the Government, adopting the verdict of Parliament, intend to introduce a Bill which will, in proper terms, take power to have an investigation made as to the most suitable part of the latter territory for the Federal Capital and Seat of Government. left to experts? taken in the Bill to have an investigation. It is the intention of the Government, while conserving the full powers of the -Commonwealth, to act, shall I say, as genially as possible in regard to the other interests involved in the location and settlement of the actual site of the Federal Capital. In that way we shall -co-operate, as well as we can, with the -Government of the State in which the site has been chosen. answer a question which I asked earlier in the afternoon? Have negotiations been -entered into with the Government of New South Wales? -communication with that Government; but, as this House is not constituted of children, honourable members probably do not wish to be informed of every detail. We desire, consistently with the position of the Commonwealth, to carry on whatever negotiations may be necessary in connection with this momentous question, without creating antagonistic feeling to the injury of the public interest and without benefit to any part of the Commonwealth or to any person in it. Although Ministers differ as to which site should have been chosen, we feel that united action must be taken by the Government in this matter to give effect to the will of Parliament. sonally, I confess that I should like to have seen some site other than Ysss-Canberra chosen; but Parliament having made a decision, the question is now a national one, ind I trust that it will be finally settled at the earliest date possible. Another matter which we must submit almost immediately is the agreement made by our predecessors for the purchase of a site in London whereon Commonwealth offices may be erected, wherein the future High Commissioner, appointed to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth in the world's metropolis, will be housed. I understand that when I finish this speech, the adjournment of the debate will be carried, and the Minister of -External Affairs will then put this matter before the House. as a party question? the case have been made available to honourable members, and as the time within which the agreement must' be ratified is limited, we should have a decision as early as possible. It will be necessary to pay a deposit of 10 per cent, on the purchase money, which will come to between £19,000 and £20,000. I do not think there will be any difficulty in finding that sum. Reverting to the Capital site question, I may say that every care will be taken to preserve the rights of the Commonwealth. The Government will ask for an area not less than that provided for in the Seat of Government Act, and I think that it will be cheerfully granted. We «nall also ask for territory which will give us access to the sea, and a port. I do not. think that the State Government will raise any difficulty about that. The Government intend to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in the Senate, and to propose amendments in it which will more effectually safeguard the Commonwealth's interests and the policy of the Labour Party regarding the nationalization of the iron industry. to do with the matter? Sandford has now no interest in it. He came to Melbourne to give me special information regarding the question. I have seen very little of him, but if he needed testimony as to his character, I could speak of him as a man of high principle. information may be worth, but his sworn evidence was not worth much. members may have the fullest knowledge regarding my public actions; and, therefore) I say that Mr Sandford has given me very",18,Smith Doe S The Prime Tration Court As Will Insure Fair And Reason

There is another small measure to which I must refer, and that is a Trades Description Bill. Honourable members are aware that we have endeavoured, on many occasions, to secure an amendment of the law so as to prevent the community being injured by deleterious importations well known to medical practitioners, and to the necessity for the regulation of which attention has been called by nearly every learned society. In many instances such importations lead to loss of stamina, and in some cases to loss of life. We, therefore, desire to protect the people of the Commonwealth by means of an amendment of the present law relating to trade descriptions. These, brierly, are the proposals that we shall put before Parliament this session. We purpose proroguing before Christmas, and we shall ask honourable members, in the first place, to agree to this motion, so that the time usually devoted to private members' business may be given to the consideration of Government measures.

102,I Have Mr Batchelor (Boothby,"Ministerof Northumberland Avenue and Charing Cross, London, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, for the sum of ^ioSjOoo. May I explain that I am led to ask leave to submit this motion now because of the fact that our option to acquire the site will expire on the 30th inst. But for that I should have give™ notice of motion in the ordinary way. There is no intention to ask the House to vote on this question to-dav. the House that the honourable member have leave to submit the motion? l>een stated by the Prime Minister, the proposal for the purchase of a site for Commonwealth offices at the corner of Northumberland Avenue and Charing Cross, London, was brought to a head by the late Government. They began the negotiations and carried them to the stage :it which they proposed to ask the House to ratify their acceptance of the offer made to them by the Messrs. Lyons. ask honourable members not only to discontinue the conversations which are being carried on in loud tones, but as far as possible to avoid moving about the chamber during the delivery of. a speech. most perplexing to me, and it must be trying to the honourable member who is addressing the Chair, to find honourable members crossing and recrossing the chamber. They will promote the business of the House by keeping their seats as much as possible, and refraining from conversing in loud tones. stand, sir, that the photographs of the proposed site, as well as the plans and maps which are being distributed, are of great interest to honourable members. I ivas pointing out that the late Government brought this matter to the stage of agreeing to place before Parliament the offer made to them by the Messrs. Lyons. In submitting this motion to-day, however, I desire to say that the Government do not shelter themselves behind the action of their predecessors in office. We take full responsibility for recommending the acceptance of' the offer, and we invite the fullest criticism. As the honourable mcmlier for Parkes pointed out on one occasion, this is not *i party question. The late Government have investigated it, and we propose, after the most careful investigation and the consideration of all information possible for us to obtain, that the Commonwealth shall acquire the site. No question of party arises. I am sure that all parties are at one in the desire, that the best site possible for the purposes of the Commonwealth shall be selected, and the decision in this case is not to be governed by any question of whether or not it is possible to inflict a defeat on the Ministry. We desire the fullest and freest criticism of the proposal, and' wish the House to be placed in possession of all the information ihat it is possible to obtain. The House will be absolutely free to take whatever -lotion it pleases. Government. member is aware, propositions are sometimes submitted in circumstances in which the House finds it very difficult to take the responsibility of rejecting them. In some cases Parliament is asked to ratify an agreement to which a Government has pledged itself to such an extent that honourable members are not quite as free to deal with it as they would like to 'OR. In this instance, however, the House is free to take whatever action it pleases. T understand that no hint has been given It is to the owners as to what will -be the attitude of the Parliament with regard to this proposal. us to throw it out? think that by doing so the House would' neglect an opportunity to secure what appears to be an exceedingly desirable site. lifetime,"" as the auctioneers say. portunities to acquire in London free» holds of areas sufficient for our purpose do not present themselves every day. The site is situated at the corner of Northumberland-avenue and Charing Cross, Trafalgar Square. The superficial area is 8,683 ieet, and there is a frontage of about 201 feet. The title is freehold. To those who have not been in London, probably that statement does not convey very much. I admit that my own knowledge of London is exceedingly weak, although I know more now through going into these papers than I did a week ago. But every one who has been to England and knows the capital of the Empire at all knows this site. That",21,Commonwealth Offices I N London Purchase Of Site And Buildings

Ophas been one advantage in making inquiries as to its suitability or otherwise. is the place from which all distances are measured in England. the hub of London, as all distances are calculated from this site outwards. The plan which has been distributed will give honourable members a clear indication of its situation and surroundings. It is on one of the main arteries of London traffic, and I understand that there are no fewer than sixty-six theatres within a mile of it. If there is one thing which any man going into the theatre business looks for when he sets up a theatre it is an accessible place where people naturally congregate. Hence, from an advertising point of view, a place which is surrounded by so many theatres must necessarily be exceedingly accessible. This place is also the centre of the official life of London. cial life of London? that point later. The site is surrounded saidby many buildings of great historical interest, and consequently is in the part of uncovered site in London with advantages of London to whicli visitors go.

So far as concerns the financial work of the High Commissioner, the office would not be so well situated there as if it were in the City, but that, after all, would be only one portion of the High Commissioner's work, and probably, for all the work that would need to be done in the City, a room and an office bov, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh suggests, may be sufficient. At any rate, we submit that the principal work of the High Commissioner appears to be rather in the direction of assisting immigration and replying to inquirers about this country, and advertising its resources in various ways. He needs an office where he can be in touch with the official life of the Empire. Those appear to us to be the most important functions which he will be called upon to perform.

It will be admitted that the site is eminently suitable for the general purposes of a High Commissioner's office for any work in connection with immigration or advertising the resources of Australia, and .for transacting tlie general business of the Commonwealth. ment have the High Commissioner to live there, close to the theatres ? High Commissioner shall live on the premises is a matter of detail which I have not -considered. If the honourable member desires an answer, I must ask him to give notice of the question. in London is right alongside. however suitable the site may be, the question we have to consider is whether the price is a fair one; because, if the price be not fair, the Government are not justified in placing this proposal before honourable members. Having taken all possible precautions, in view of the fact that negotiations had to be carried on by cable, and that it is much more difficult to arrive at values when separated by thousands of miles, the Government have come to the -conclusion, after a careful investigation of the papers, that the price, while not a low one, is not unreasonable. I am not going to say that this is a bargain on the part the High of the Commonwealth-it is no bargain. But the price is not unreasonable; and that I have admitted is the only view I can place before honourable members, and, I believe, that that was all the late Government could claim. I understand that some honourable members have raised the difficulty that Messrs. Lyons, who are the other parties to the bargain, are probably making a good thing out of this transaction. Whether that is so or not, it is, of course, impossible to ascertain, because nobody but Messrs. JOHN FORREST -The inscribing Lyons themselves know what price they paid for their option. Probably Messrs. Lyons are making something out of the H o w much space transaction, because the papers disclose that they acquired an option over this site before the Commonwealth entered into negotiations. secure the option while the negotiations with the Commonwealth were going on ? that that is true; at any rate, the papers do not disclose anything of the kind. cure the option after the site had been brought under the notice of the Government ? matter before honourable members exactlv as it appears from the file of papers.

No doubt the Minister will recollect this site. The situation is admirable. I'attach a tracing of the site. That is the first intimation of there being any such site availableIt was first brought under my notice by Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who inform me that the total frontage is about 164 feet, with a total ground area of 8,600 feet, and they consider that an offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted. The present leases of shops, &c, fall in in about 4^ years' time', and they think that these leases can be bought out for a sum of £25,000 if necessary. Then there comes the reference which the honourable member for Grey suggests proves that Messrs. Lyons secured the option while the Commonwealth was negotiatingSince they brought it under my notice, an agent of Mr Lyons, the well-known caterer, has called on me, and he states 'that Mr Lyons has within the last month bought this property from the Prudential Insurance Company, but he would be prepared to enter into negotiations for the lease or for the sale of the freehold.",23,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Lyons actually bought the property-that it is not an option. fact, Captain Collins found afterwards that Messrs. Lyons had acquired an option, but had not actually paid for the freehold. Mr Lyons, the head of the firm, has an agreement which, when submitted to the solicitors acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, was found to be satisfactory. At any rate, Mr Lyons' position as vendor is satisfactory; but what price he gave for the option, we cannot, of course, ascertain, and he would very naturally refuse to disclose it. the option yet? but .1 should say that he has not-that he has not actually paid the cash over. Captain Collins' letter continuesOn my remarking that I expected Mr Lyons would want some considerable profit, the agent said he was not sure, but he thought that Mr carefully, and I find nothing to justify me Lyons would be prepared to deal reasonably. The letter then goes on to sayAsI have said, this situation is admirable. about the same; and it would appear as The only thing is that the existing building is not such as the Commonwealth Government probably would put up, but it would be very difficult to find a site equally good, and it might be advisable to get an architect's opinion that Mr Lyons has property adjoining upon the possibilities of the existing building, and what could be done both internal^' and externally to make it suitable to the requirements I do not know. of the Commonwealth. There is nothing whatever in the papers to lend one to suppose that Mr Lyons, knowing that the Commonwealth was negotiating for the property, stepped in front and put on an increased price. C""n the contrary, it will be noticed that there is a difference between the two proposalsbetween the one submitted by Messrs. Hampton and Sons and the one submitted ing reference to a frontage of 164 feet at the price of £180,000, and the latter having reference to a frontage of 201 feet at a price of £230,000. One cannot argue -from that, as I have heard it suggested, that Mir. Lyons is making a clear profit of ^£18,000 on the bargain. What Messrs. Hampton and Sons would have been able to offer to the Commonwealth is only in the realms of conjecture. but I notice that the superficial area is about the same. the same property. property, it is) very clear that Messrs. Hampton and Sons must have known precious little about the property they were selling when they offered a frontage of 164 feet, while the real frontage was 201 feet. be seen that they only speak of "" about "" 164 feet frontage. mean an error of 25 per cent. ! and Sons were the agents for the vendor. membered that the superficial area is about the same in both cases. bers, as' a matter of fact, are in precisely the same position as I am, and no better. I have gone through all the papers veryin concluding that the same property was referred to by both agents. though, in the juggling, they have cut a piece off the back and put it on the front. this, but whether that be on option or not caterer ? understand, is a very wealthy man, and, like others in the same position, I suppose he is investing his money in London. It is quite possible that the site offered by Messrs. Hampton and Sons is not identical with that offered by the Lyons firm. probable that it is the identical .site? It is a corner site, and the 201 feet may go round the corner, while the other measurement may go only to the corner, as is the usual wav of measuring. rather unusual for the vendor of a valuable site not to describe it to the best advantage in the matter of frontage.

Lyons, by securing this option before the Commonwealth came on tihe scene, has been able to make some profit, and that the Commonwealth has not been able, perhaps, to buy as cheaply as they otherwise should, but that is all that can be said. There is obviously an absolutely good faith on the part of every official and expert who has been consulted by the Commonwealth. --ther e is no suggestion in the papers of anything in the way of sharp practice. In to-day's newspaper there is a letter in which attention is called to the variation in the values attached to this property by Mr Howard Martin, the President of the Institute of Valuers, London, who was employed to act for the Commonwealth. At first view there appear to be discrepancies, but an examination of the valuer's reports show his valuations to be consistent. He writesIn my opinion, the present market value of this site, if in the market, cleared, and free from tlie existing lease, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. His previous estimate pf £i54>30° "" f ° the purposes of investment as between a willing buyer and a willing seller"" takes account of the existing leases, which run for four years, and reduce the value of the land to any one desiring immediate possession. is £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 . years. value of the leases cannot be regarded as £16,000. which they would return in the period for which they have to run. ther valuation of from £200,000 to £220,000, Mr Martin takes another position. ^He had written that the market value, if the site were cleared and free from existing leases, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators and others wishing to use it straight away, and £154,300 subject to the leases referred to. But, he subsequently added that, having regard to the fact that an unusual opportunity for acquiring a site specially advantageous for our purposes now presents itself, we should do well in giving up to £210,000. that he did not come to that conclusion at first? stance, he was asked merely to value the site, not to take into account the special advantages which the Commonwealth might get by acquiring it. valuation he knew what the property was sought for. to Captain Collins, he saidI am instructed that fhe property is freehold, and to be sold subject to a lease for twenty-five years from Midsummer, 1887, with an unexpired term of about four years, subject to a ground rent of £4,000 a year. Assuming the property is free from disadvantageous restrictions and from outgoings other than the ordinary rates and taxes, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease and for the purpose of clearing the site and putting up upon it a new building for the occupation of the purchasers when possession can be obtained on determination of the existing lease, the property is worth, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, One hundred and fifty-four thousand three hundred pounds (£154,300). r But we had to consider the actual position apart from the contingencies therein mentioned. Although we had no reason to consider Mr Martin other than a competent valuer, we thought it advisable to obtain an independent valuation, as a check upon his, and therefore sent this cablegram to Captain CollinsObtain and telegraph not later than 23rd November independent valuation Trafalgar site land only, irrespective of buildings thereon, by competent valuator unconnected with Martin. The valuation of the buildings would have required a close examination of them, which would have made it known that we were having a second valuation made, and we desired an entirely independent valuation, without the knowledge of any one interested in the building or concerned with the previous valuation. The reply received! from Captain Collins wasReferring to your telegram 19th November, employed leading firm valuators who do much Government work. That is, work for the British Government, I presume.

London. of London, and I think that we must accept the testimony of our officers. I propose to read to honourable members some statements made by Mr Martin. He savsThe want of depth of part of the site is, to some extent, a drawback to its value,but, in my judgment, the present building is not so planned as to turn the site to the best account. As regards position, I consider the site suitable for a much better building, and one of the best in London either for shops or offices or for a public building. Then, as regards the existing buildings, he writesThe quality of the materials and workmanship . . .

Necessary repairs would cost £16,000; alterations suitable probable requirements. £30,000 more, whereas new building with additional storey for £65,000. Mr Martin reports that the immediate expenditure necessary to put the building in repair is £16,000, and that if we wish to alter it for Commonwealth purposes we must incur a further expenditure of £30,000, or a total of £46,000. On the other hand, if ' we propose to puli down the whole structure, and erect a new building, an expenditure of at least £65,000 will be necessary. Everything, of course, will depend upon the plans agreed upon. It is obvious that the present building could not remain in use for any length of time without very considerable alterations being made to itIt has been cheaply erected, ancl would not suit our requirements. I do not know that there is any other point to which I need refer, except that the price of £238,000 which Messrs.

One point to which too much weight cannot be given is that a new thoroughfare is to be opened right through the corner opposite this building. This new thoroughfare will come down from the Mall from the direction of Buckingham Palace and terminate opposite the proposed site; and, of course, that would nave a potent effect on its future value as a commercial property. Doubtless there will be a repetition of what happened in the Strand when the King's Way was proposed. which for many years had been at about the same value, increased enormously in demand, and, when the road was thrown openi, the higher values were maintained. is on the opposite side of the Square from the proposed Commonwealth buildings. so; it is on the opposite side of the road. The road comes from St. James' Park, so that practically the Commonwealth buildings will face the end of the new roadway. If the buildings are of the character we desire, we shall secure a standing advertisement of immense value. I heartilv commend this proposal, because I feel satisfied, from my personal) knowledge, that if we waited for a century we could not procure a more -suitable site. Sydney) [.5.28] I agree with the Minister that this is a question which should not have the slightest party aspect, but which ought to be regarded solely in the interests of the Commo)nwealth. If we concede that the Commonwealth ought to have a site in London for the erection of offices, the one question for members, no matter in what part of the House they mav sit, is whether the site is suitable, and, if it be so, whether the price is reasonable ? I . say at once that, in my opinion, the situation of the site is an excellent one,, although' I know that many have a preference for a site in the city. It is, however, quite impossible to get be anxious and willing to a city freehold site of any area and , if we 1 are to have the co-operation of the States, now or at any future time, we shall need considerable space. In rhe heart of the city there are seldom if ever freehold sites of any area on the market. If there is a site obtainable it is generally one the lease of which has 'Sxpired, and the owners of which desire' to malee a fresh lease, usually on considerably higher terms. We are, therefore, almost compelled to go further afield, and. as I have already said, I can take no exception to the situation now under discussion. It is prominent, easy of access from almost any part of London, and in that way suitable. But there arises the question of value; and I must say that I think there have been some smart men at work in this connection. It is very evident that tbe valuation given in the first place by Mr Howard Martin was something close to the mark, namely, Buildings, £ 1 5 4 , 3 0 0 . Mr Martin says in his communicationAssuming the property is free from disadvantageous restrictions and from outgoings other than the ordinary rates and taxes, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease and for the purpose of clearing the site and putting up upon it a new building for the occupation of the purchasers when possession can be obtained on the termination of the existing lease, the property is worth, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, one hundred and fifty-four thousand three hundred pounds (£154,300). The conditions there indicated are those on which the negotiations are now. being carried out, the Commonwealth to enter into complete possession in 1912. In my opinion, as I say, that valuation was fairly near the mark; but then an operator, who knew the Commonwealth was looking out for a site, came on the scene. What that operator has got the property under offer for I cannot say, but he has taken the opportunity, for which I do not blame him, to make a greater or smaller .profit. that is possible. opinion is that the difference in fhe measurement of the frontages in two separate offers does not indicate thar they do not refer to the 'same property. Verv often when negotiations are opened, accurate measurements are not obtained; but it is very unlikely that there are two properties of this area in che same position for sale. I do not blame the representatives of the Commonwealth, but I think",30,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The position may be unfortunate, and I am sorry that any one should be able to make a profit as between the present owners and the Commonwealth; but, even in such case, the question for the Commonwealth is whether the property is worth the money, and the site entirely suitable, as it should be, considering that we are binding ourselves to it for ever. As to the value, I can only say that this property is cheaper than that which was offered to us by the London County Council. The sites offered by the County Council ranged trom 15s. to 18s. and 19s. per square foot rental, though, I .believe, the Premier of Victoria obtained one block at about 13s. 1 am speaking of the Aldwych site in the Strand.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes ; but there was a provision that it must be sold in 1959. the Commonwealth would have to become a competitor, and to keep the land would probably have to pay a high price. Now,.

The honourable member for North Sydney has shown clearly that the configuration of the land presents a serious difficulty, the shape of the block being such as will make it troublesome to design a building which, when erected, will do credit to the Commonwealth, and, while providing for the effective display of Australian products, give facilities for the transaction of the manifold affairs which will come within the for advertising jurisdiction of the High Commissioner'soffice. I wish to speak chiefly upon the I admit value of the site for our purposes, having regard to its locality.

A 'number of honourable members are supporting the erection in London of a large building from a sort of vague hope that some advertisement to the Commonwealth will accrue therefrom. and of Londoners, my experience is that no one there ever thinks of looking at a building. Anv one who has been in that great city realizes that the one impression he carries home with him a.t night is that of the thronging crowds in the streets and the vague indefinable mist which seem to be their proper accompaniment. Even the stranger in. London does not think of looking at the buildings, and it is ridiculous to think of a Londoner taking the trouble to view a £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 building such as is proposed to be erected by the Commonwealth!. If we desire an advertisement we can obtain for the same money a far better one by means of a system of effective organization than is possible by the erection of a fine stone edifice in a city which is f u l l of buildings that must overshadow a structure erected at the moderate cost proposed to be incurred, and the inhabitants of which have hardly any regard for the buildings in the streets they use. It is said that just as an Englishman's home is his castle, so is his office his refuge. English business man in proceeding from the one to the other looks neither to right nor to left, and gives no attention to anything save his desire to reach his destina tion as expeditiously as possible. The erection of the proposed building for purposes of advertisement would do us no good. Those who inspect such offices are people like the honourable member for Hume, who are visitors at hotels in the vicinity, and who, perhaps, in their idle moments, look out of their hotel windows and count the neighbouring advertisements. are not visitors to the city of London, they are not our trans-Atlantic cousins, or our Soutli! African friends, or New Zealanders, who happen to be stopping at the palatial residential hotels of London. We' wish to secure the interest of the great agricultural and commercial classes of England, but we cannof hope to do so merely by the erection of a building in a part of London which is chiefly celebrated for its theatres, music halls, and hotels. I do not think that the Commonwealth' will secure a good advertisement by spending a large sum of money on a site which does not seem to be in the most convenient locality for our various functions. We certainly shall not secure the advertisement which so many honourable members seem to hope will accrue, as if If I know anything of London this £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 building were to be erected in the city of Bendigo instead of amongst the monuments in the heart of the six 01 seven millions who constitute the city of London. I recognise tlie necessity of providing as speedily as possible a habitation in London for the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth, I think that we should ap' proach very cautiously the consideration of this proposition, involving, as it does, the expenditure of a very large sum. .It would 'be interesting to know what became of the negotiations that were in progress a short time ago for the acquisition of nnother site in London, which the honourable member for Hume, who was then Treasurer, described as an ideal one. that ideal site? County Council refused to sell it ai the price that we desired to pay for it. should have been forthcoming before. As to the new site, to the purchase of which "" we are now asked to agree, we have to examine the character of the information relating to it which is contained in the memorandum that has been circulated. We find, in the first place, a serious discrepancy between the first and subse-ini-nt valuations made by Mr Howard Martin. On the 26th June he sent to Captain Collins a letter in which he estimated the value of the site at £ 1 5 4 , 3 0 0 . Within less than a week he made a further valuation showing an advance of nearly The people we wish to interest £ 1 0 , 0 0 0. In regard to his first estimate he wroteAssuming that the property is freehold, subject to no outgoings other than the ordinaryrates and taxes, and to no disadvantageous restrictions on the user, I am of opinion that, subject to the lease already referred to, it is worth One. hundred and fifty-four thousand' three hundred pounds (£154,300) as a site and' building for the purposes of investment ay between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

Apparently some communications had passed in the meantime between him and Captain Collins, but as to their nature we are left entirely in the dark. moments ago I called attention to the numerous conversations proceeding, but there has since been scarcely any abatement of them. I can hear words uttered by honourable members in different parts of the chamber. These conversations are most impolite, to say nothing of their being contrary to the Standing Orders. I ask honourable'members to give the honourable member for Lang an opportunity to make himself heard. Martin wrote to Captain Collins as followsDear Sir,-As you desired, I write in explanation of the paragraph in my report concerning the value of the property as a site for a special building. T do not think there is any site in London with equal advantages of position and nearly equal area, at present uncovered and in the market. . . . market value of this site, if in the market, cleared ancl free from the existing lease, would be £163,750 to builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. But. as the site (like, I think, every Other site of equal area and advantage of position in London) is at present covered with occupied buildings, I think no one for whose -purpose this position is specially suitable, and who requires the whole site for the purpose -of immediately erecting a building for his own occupation, could expect to buy the property and get vac-.mt possession for less than from £200,000 to £220,000; and if you could buy it with vacant possession on completion of the purchase, say, in six or nine months, for any price witliin those limits, I am of opinion that the Commonwealth would be wise to take the opportunity of doing so. I do not know exactly what is meant by that report. In an earlier portion of his report, it is stated that the property now offered to the Commonwealth by Mr Lyons comprises an area of 8,000 superficial feet. and is being sold subject to a lease of twenty-five years-of which the unexpired term is about four years-subjec t to a ground rental of £4,000. Does that mean that the freehold is being sold subject to a continuation of the payment of £4,000 per annum in respect of the remaining four years of the leasehold, and has Mr Martin in his.amended estimate allowed for the cancellation of that leasehold condition, and in some way capitalized the advantages which the non-payment of that rent would confer on the purchaser of the site? He may have been swayed by such considerations in making this increased estimate, although I hardly think so. There is, evidently, something suppressed or withheld' in connection with A few this second valuation. VVe certainly do not know what led to the great discrepancy between Mr Martin's first and second valuations. The property could not have acquired that additional value in the time, and some reason not disclosed in the paper before us must have caused him to increase his estimate from £154,300 to putation. increased estimate, and we are entitled to know that reason. The Minister has not explained, and nothing in the papers laid on the table makes it clear. speaking. In my opinion, the present the Minister to make it clear that the difference in the estimates was based on the capitalization of the four years' ground rent. I understood him to say, although even this he did not assert positively, that the Commonwealth was not buying the freehold subject to any obligation as to leasehold ground rent. Even that is not clearly shown by the papers which have been presented to us. On the contrary, it seems that the purchase was to be made subject to the payment of a ground rent of £4,000 a year. wealth. The purchaser of the freehold cannot have to pay ground rent to anybody else. even freehold ground tenures in Great Britain have life leases attached to them ' -that a certain amount of ground rent has to be paid to somebody in perpetuity even under a freehold title. The land laws of Great Britain are not exactly the same as ours, and if there is any such land tenure it would be as well to make certain that we are not buying this property subject to any lien of that kind.

Here is a site which, for people who want to turn it to commercial advantage for ordinary business transactions, is not worth more than £163.750 on that amended estimate, although a week before it was worth only £154,300, including buildings; but, because the Commonwealth Government happen to want it for their own offices, he considers that they would be justified in paying £65,000' more than the actual value. That is an astounding business proposition to be entertained for a moment, let alone suggested, by any business man. If a similar offer were made of any site in Australia, and the same reasons advanced why the purchaser, whether a private individual, a company, or a Government, should agree io increase the purchase money in that way under such conditions, it would be scouted .as absolutely untenable. I think it is untenable. It is monstrous that we should he expected to pay from £200,000 to ^£220,000 for a site which a week before the same valuer considered to be worth only £ 154,300.

They will have to be pulled down, and new buildings erected, -so that they have to be sacrificed, and can only be regarded as worth what they would bring as old material. According to the report, they are not of a high-class character. Indeed, they seem.to be of the jerry-built type. If they are retained, it is stated in the memorandum that a sum of £16,000 will have to be paid for repairs, in addition to the purchase money, while in the event of the Commonwealth wishing to occupy them as Government offices, the estimated cost of the necessary alterations is ,£46,000. All these sums have to be added to the purchase money, while, if the old buildings are pulled down, and new buildings erected, with an additional story, the estimate of cost is £65,000. In the light of the estimates laid on the table regarding the cost of the proposed site in the Strand, it will be found that we shall not be able to erect a building for anything £65,000.

Mr Martin submitted two valuations within a week, one about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 higher than the other, and later recommended the purchase of the site at an amount which was an increase of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 on the sum first named. It would be most unbusiness-like to ratify this agreement without fuller information. It seems as if, for some reason, a good deal of information has been suppressed, only the most meagre details having been supplied to honourable members. I believe that a plan of the site and a photograph of the buildings on it has been circulated, but I have not seen them, and they have only recentlv been produced. We should not rush into an expenditure of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , plus, perhaps, £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 , plus, perhaps, another £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , for the erection of a new building, plus rates, taxes, nnd other charges, without the fullest examination of all the facts. In my opinion, it would be better, instead of purchasing a site now, to rent suitable premises, even at a charge of £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year, leaving it to the High Commissioner, when appointed, to ascertain our requirements, and recommend the purchase of what he considers the best The circumstances site. In view of the present straitened condition of our finances, the fact that our revenue is shrinking and our liabilities increasing, it would be very unwise to commit ourselves to this expenditure without much fuller information. that we ought to have fuller informationIn a paragraph printed in the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 28th January Last,. I find it stated thatAt the Australia Hotel last evening Mr O.. C. Beale invited a number of representative The honourable member gentlemen to meet Messrs. MontagueG luckstein and AlbertM .

That fact was not brought out by the Minister. the matter. out a strong prima facie case of sharppractice. A few months later, when thisproperty was being offered to the Government, Messrs.

These gentlemen, when here made arrangements withMr Beale for the purchase of twenty pianos manufactured by his firm. There are in Victoria and South Australia today several men who can verify that statement. We knew nothing, however, of that arrangement until the publication of a cablemessage from London stating that the Messrs. Lyons had selected from the many pianos on exhibition at the Franco-British Exhibition, twenty manufactured by Bealeand Company for the hotel that they wereabout to furnish. When Mr Beale was passing through Adelaide on his way toEngland, he gave several gentlemen tounderstand that he could not incur the expense of sending twenty pianos to Eng^ land for the purpose of showing them at the Franco-British exhibition, but for the fact that Lyons and Company had actually ordered them, through their representatives,, who were here last January.

331,Mr Poynton,"The papers beiarBeale's advertisement, however, we have the statement that the hotel in question was to be the largest in the world, and was to be beautifully furnished by Messrs. Lyons and Company, who had selected from the manv pianofortes on view at the FrancoBritish exhibition, twenty manufactured by his firm. It may be a mere coincidence, but it seems to me to be "" cronk"" that these fellows should put in an appearance whilst the Commonwealth Government were conducting negotiations with others for a site. There is another phase of this question which has not yet been touched upon. We have before us' a proposal to expend £198,000 on the purchase of this property, but it is doubtful whether that sum would cover the whole of our liability. Assuming that it would,, the proposition is that 10 pei cent, of the purchase money shall be paid as a deposit, and that we shall pay 4 per cent, on the balance. The arrangement in the first instance was that we should pay 4J per cent. that were suggested, but there was no arrangement. tained for 3 per cent. L had from the Minister in charge of the motion was that the money could be obtained for 4 per cent. What is the position? This Parliament has boasted of the fact that we have hitherto refrained from borrowing; yet we are now asked to enter into what is really a borrowing transaction, and to establish as a precedent the payment of 4 per cent, interest on Commonwealth loans. I venture to say that if such an ar. rangement is made, State Treasurers and every one in opposition to the Commonwealth will point to it as an illustration of what will happen when we take over the debts of the States. If we pay 4 per cent, interest, we shall have in that respect alone a liability of £7,920 per annum, and the rents now obtainable from the property, after deducting rates, commission on the collection of rents, and the wages of a caretaker, lift attendants, and others, will not be anything like sufficient to meet the interest bill on the money to be borrowed. We have the evidence of an expert that an expenditure of at least £46,000 will be necessary to make the building suitable foi our purposes. story, we shall have to expend at least £65 -0 0 0 story cannot be erected without the consent of the owners of the adjoining property. so. In addition to that, in order to obtain immediate occupation of the premises, we shall have to pay the existing tenants something like £25,000 to give up possession. In other words, we should incur in this way an expenditure of about £283,000.. Then there is some doubt as to the continuation of the payment of a sum of £4,000 for the next four years. sible doubt. by Mr Martin to Captain Collins we have the statementThis being so, in my opinion, you would do well to give £210,000, to include the £4,000 a year lease, and take the chance of getting out all the occupying tenants for a reasonable sumnnd within a reasonable time. That statement creates in my mind a doubt as to the continued payment of the sum of £4,000 per annum in respect of the' lease. Then again I do not think that we should be able to erect at a cost of £65,000 a building of the character that we desire. The estimates of the experts show us that, not taking intoaccount the £16,000 in respect of the leasehold, concerning which there is some doubt, this proposal will involve an expenditure of £283,000. At the present time the Post and Telegraph Department is in need of an increased expenditure of from £200,000 to £300,000, for which we cannot provide. We scout the idea of borrowing for works in connection with the Department, yet we are now asked deliberately to borrow at 4 per cent, nearly one-third of at million to enable us to secure a property that we cannot use for the next four yearsLet us have a look at these valuations. looks ""fakey."" ordinary valuation that has ever come under my notice.

In such circumstances, he suggests that £154,300 should be paid for the property. valuation, apparently, did not suit the "" powers that be,"" and it was referred back to Mr Martin. We do not know what occurred between him and those who sent back his report to him, but we know that on the 2nd July-si x days after the writing of the first reportMr Martin wrote as follows to Captain CollinsDear Sir,-As you desired, I write in explanation of the paragraph in my report concerning the value of the property as a site for a special building. I do not think there is any site in London with equal advantages of position and nearly equal area at present uncovered and in the market. I am not questioning the desirableness of the situation. There appears to be a consensus of opinion that the situation is right, provided that the area is suitable for the purpose j but there is grave doubt as to the shape of the block being the most desirable. Mr Martin went on to sayI f any public body or wealthy corporation required such a site it would probably have to pay, in acquiring outstanding interests in the various buildings upon it and otherwise, from 20 to 40 per cent, more than thc mere site value, in order to get immediate vacant possession ; and, as a matter of fact, that has happened in providing sites for most if not all the large public buildings erected in London in modern times. In my opinion, the present market value of this site, if in the market, cleared and free from the existing lease, would be £163,750, I wish to draw special attention to the fact that the first valuation of £ i 5 4 > 3 00 w as this case, increased to £163,7 50. Minister's explanation is that the increase represents the difference between liability for ground rent and freedom from it. The ground rent, however, represents £16,000, or considerably more than the difference between the two valuations. Mr Martin went on to explain that this sum of ,£163,750 was the value of the siteto builders, speculators, or others willing to buy it in the way of ordinary business. But, as the site (like, I think, every other site -of equal area and advantage of position in London) is at present covered witli occupied buildings, I think no one for whose purpose this position is specially suitable, and who requires the whole site for the purpose of immediately erecting a building for his own occupation, could expect to buy the property and get vacant possession for less than from £200,000 to £220,000. May I ask whether this gentleman, when he was engaged to make a valuation of the property, was not well aware of all these Mr Poynton. facts? Did he not know, when he wrote his first report, for what purpose the Commonwealth desired to acquire this property ? That Why did he not say that in his first report? Why was it necessary to refer it back to him for an explanation on this particular point before it occurred to him that the property was worth £220,000? I venture to say that in any ordinary business transaction if one got a valuation of this character and within a week got another valuation from the same gentleman with a jump of £65,000, one would come to the conclusion that the man was either a rogue or a fool. The whole transaction from the moment that these gentlemen jumped in in front of the Commonwealth to secure an option over the site has a very crooked appearance. If I got a valuation like this, I certainly should have nothing further to do with that valuer. I should get a valuation entirely free and independent even of the very source from which he'got his instructions. I say that without casting any reflection, but that sort of thing has happened before, and history repeats itself. There was a chance to make a huge amount of money in this transaction,' and while Captain Collins, our direct representative, may be perfectly innocent of it, there is a possibility that some leakage occurred. I venture to say that there must have been a leakage before those gentlemen stepped in and secured an option over the property when the Commonwealth was negotiating for it. The age in the first place, why not another in the second case? possible. With this transaction as it stands before us, and with the fact, which the papers prove, that our claim was jumped, the best thing we can do is to let the matter stand over. If we do so and deal direct with the owners of the land, we shall come in at bedrock, and have s> better proposition than this is. I feel very strongly on this matter. I do not hesitate to say that I have very grave suspicions. I want the House to believe that I am not imputing any motives to individuals here, but any man calmly reading these papers, and having the information that I have in reference to those gentlemen coming out here, can come to no other conclusion than that this thing ought to be left alone, and that if we want to negotiate for this property we should deal direct with the owner,",41,William Lyne W E Must Trust Now Enabling Them T O Show Their Interest

In the circumstances I must conscientiously do all I can against the proposition, and shall, therefore, vote against it . Colonel FOXTON I entertained some doubt from the first whether it would be desirable to ratify the provisional contract for the purchase of this site, more especially when I read the correspondence which has been printed ana placed before us, and which discloses a certain amount of confusion, to say the least of it, in the valuations placed upon the site by the gentleman specially employed by the agent of the Commonwealth to value it.

Colonel FOXTON Whatever the honourable member for Hume may say it is very significant that after there had heen some proposition by some persons other than Messrs. Lyons, Messrs. Lyons obtained an option over the property over the head of the Commonwealth, and offered it as separate vendors altogether for our consideration. for every honourable member. Colonel FOXTON I did not know until this afternoon that the question was to be submitted to-day. Certain papers have been printed' and circulated to honourable members, and upon those I relied. I am not bound to go to the Minister's office to inspect other papers when a State document is placed in my hands. I have a right to assume that that contains everything of consequence. site would be a most desirable one to acquire, always assuming that we are satisfied that we are not being penalized as to price. There are certain objections to it, and certain advantages in its favour. It i's about two miles from the Bank of England, the Mansion House, and the Royal Exchange. The Aldwych site, which was previously'submitted to the House, and then alleged to be the best obtainable in London, ivas about a mile from the Bank of England, and the right honourable member for Swan, who is entitled to speak on these matters with some authority, urged that it was undesirable because the financial business of the Commonwealth could not be transacted at so great a distance from the centre of the money market. This site is quite three-quarters of a mile further west, and for that reason, from the point of view urged by the right honourable member for Swan, is even less eligible than was the Aldwych site. I admit that eligible -freeholds are not obtainable every day in London, and that, although certain disadvantages in regard to the transaction of the financial business of the Commonwealth in London may attach to this site, it has compensating advantages owing to the fact that it is situated so close to the great Imperial Government offices, and is undoubtedly very prominent. The building conditions connected with it render it also disadvantageous. There are other buildings, the Grand Hotel on the opposite corner of Northumberland Avenue, for instance, which completely overtop and overshadow the building at present on the site. We are told distinctly in the printed correspondence that it will be impossible, without buying out certain rights to -ancient light, to erect on this land a building of greater elevation than the existing one. Apparently, the £198,000 is merely for the purchase of the site, subject to the lease of four years; and we may have to pay £220,000 or £230,000, as suggested by our own valuer, in order to get rid of the particular encumbrance to which he refers. to start building straight away. Colonel FOXTON -Quite'so , or other« ise we should have to wait four years. half. Colonel FOXTON -That time would have to expire before we could pull a brick out of the building. In my opinion, the I admit that the building, as shown in the photographs, is altogether unsuitable, both internally and externally, for Commonwealth purposes. It would require about two years to complete a suitable building, and, altogether, it appears to me that we are entering on a transaction the fruits of which will not be reaped for five or six years hence. I am strongly of opinion that we should first of all appoint a High Commissioner, house him in rented premises, even if we have to pay £5,000 or £6,000 a year rent, and allow him to wait an opportunity to purchase some eligible site. Under all the circumstances, I have resolved my doubts in a way which will compel me to vote against the proposition. [8.42] -It is a good many years since I suggested in this House that there should be a Commonwealth building in London. At that time my intention was that the building should be in the financial centre. I have an idea that finance is government, and that government is finance; and I never dreamt for a moment that the building was not to be regarded as an investment. I shall conclude with a proposal; but, in the meantime, I desire to say that, when I look .at this matter from a business point of",43,William Lyne I Was Not Listen Able To Step In And Obtain An Option Over

In fact, it would appear that one of our Ministerial magicians has only to wave his magic wand in order to make intricate financial difficulties men? The purchase money is £198,000, disappear. modern finance are simply forgotten in the indescribable fascination of the simple soluand the estimated cost of a new building tion afforded by Australian financiers. Would any person invest his private money in such a transaction as that proposed ? We are the national trustees in this House; our constituents sent us here because they regarded us as the best men coming forward in qur various districts. If we put the money of the people of Australia into a venture that would not attract private money, we are not carrying out our trust, and are not fit to be here. What is this building for? The Minister of External Affairs has told us that the officer who occupies it will not have much to do in connection with finance-that it is in a centre to which thousands of people come to attend theatres. But what people do business at night-time when attending theatres ? I had hoped that this building was to be the head-quarters in London of the Australian National Postal Banking Department. I had hoped that our inscribed stock, consols, and various ining, to the purchase money, we have a total vestments would be offered to the British public for sums as low as £ 5 . I had hoped that English, Scotch, and Irish people, who had accumulated a little wealth, would be able to go to the Commonwealth building and buy consols, and that the money could be transferred here by bills of exchange, in order to carry on our industries. To-day, however, I heax that there will be no financial business done at the building. Why are we sending a High Commissioner to England? Is he merely to be a sort of representative of Australia? Have we not had enough of that with our Agents-General? The Labour Party in this House have opposed borrowing; but if we pay £20,000 as a deposit on this building, and owe £178,000, does that mean a loan, or what does it mean? If this building were put up to auction, and did not bring sufficient to cover the £178,000, would the taxpayers of Australia be responsible for the difference? If so, then there is a loan to the Commonwealth at 4 per cent.; and the difference between 4 per cent, on £1:78,000 is £890 annually, -which would represent the increased price we are paying for money, as compared with the States. Yet this is said to be the highest type of Australian finance. Is it any wonder that all over the world Australian public finance is the laughing-stock of financial The complex problems of the rentals amount to £9,740, the estimated cost of repairs to the building is £46,000, would it be? would not provide the foundations of such a building as I should desire. I may say that I have had banking training in the United States, so that I know something about the ""game."" I do not think that the Government ought to pay more than private persons, or should run a business in order to enable private individuals to make fortunes. I understand that after Messrs. Gluckstein and Marks left Australia, and hurried through Canada to England, in order to get the option, the transaction was not completed until after Mr Beale went home. Is that so, or not ? If we add £46,000 for alterations to the present building, to the purchase money of £198,000, we have a total of £244,000 ; while, if we add £65,000, as the cost of the new buildof £263,000. Interest at 3^ per cent., taking into account the cost of alterations, amounts to £8,540, while, if we calculate the cost of the new building, the interest amounts to £9,205.

No Minister could have proposed this transaction more earnestly, or occupied more time ir> its defence, than did tlie honourable member for Boothby, though at the same time he took care to say that the question was not a party one. It is no thanks to him that it is not a, party question. The expenditure of £200,000 ofi the people's money is a people's question. Tbe most severe attack on this proposal has come from the supporters of the Government. The honourable member for Grey .scarified it, and asked his fellow members to reject it.

He said that, though the Minister may have felt bound to bring the matter before the House, he was not required to fight so warmly for a remnant of the Deakin policy.

We are told that it is always well to secure your cage before you catch your bird; but in this instance I think we should first catch our bird-in the shape of the High Commissioner-and let him choose his cage. The High Commissioner to be appointed should be shrewd enough to pick the best cage, or, in other words, the most suitable site for offices for the Commonwealth. We are told that the Government are supported by a reliable authority in advocating the acquisition of this site. The only reliable authority to whom the Minister is able to refer, however, is the temporary representative of the Commonwealth in London, Captain Collins. As an illustration of his reliability in this regard, I would remind honourable membersthat some six months ago, when we had under consideration a proposal to acquire a leasehold in the Strand, Captain Collins reported that it was "" the most suitable site"" in London. We did t.he same officer declaring that another, two miles away, is "" the most suitable."" Honourable members who are anxious to support the purchase of this property have not at their disposal information of a suffi ciently reliable character to justify their doing so. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Grey, we are not prepared at present to provide the whole of the purchase money, and we shall therefore have to resort to what is really a process of borrowing. The first Parliament of the Commonwealth declared itself strongly opposed to borrowing, and surely a Labour Ministry should not be the first Administration to thrust upon this Parliament a policy to which they have individually declared their opposition. If we purchase this property for £198,000, we shall have to finance at least £180,000 of the purchase money. We shall have to pay interest on that amount, and the course to be adopted means in effect raising a loan. I would ask the Prime Minister whether he has examined the schedule in the report presented by Mr Howard Martin showing the rents paid by the tenants of the present building. We are told that the site is the best in London. I have not had the privilege of visiting that great city, and have not met in this House any .one who knows his London as well as did Dr. Johnson. The Attorney-General may know it ; but as I have not been there I propose to test the statement as to the value of the site by referring to the rents paid for shops and offices in the building.

I am inclined to think that if we do acquire it we shall advertise our foolishness in jumping at an offer simply because it has the recommendationof a recent Ministry. The present Minister of External Affairs said that he knew nothing about London and simply took up the proposal as the work of his predecessor. It would be far better for him to withdraw the motion, pending the appointment of a High Commissioner, or until he is able to take a trip to London. He' might well make a visit of inspection during the recess rather tlian take, upon insufficient information, an action that may besmirch the name of a Ministry that is supposed to live for everything that is good and radical. Had he said that he could not take the responsibility of recommending the Parliament to agree to the purchase of this site until he had personally inspected 'it, I should have supported him, believing that he could in that way do far better work for the Commonwealth than by remaining in his office during the coming recess. I do not suggest that he is anxious to make the trip ; but having regard to the enormous expenditure which this proposal involves, I think that he might well make a. personal inspection of the property.

The building is in a dilapidated state, and, according to the experts, an immediate expenditure of manythousands is necessary to put it ""in repair.

If it is such a valuable site in the great city of London why is it used for comparatively insignificant business purposes)? The schedule shows that a suite of three rooms gives an estimated return of £ 7 5 per annum. In what building in Melbourne could such residential quarters be obtained for that rental? Everything seems to point to the value of the property being less than that which has been put upon it .

[9.31] -According to one of the letters from Captain Collins, this site was offered by Messrs. Hampton and Sons for £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 , as a freehold, on 13th March, 1908. A little later, Captain Collins wrote that one of Messrs. Lyons and Company's agents had called upon him and stated that they had purchased the freehold from the. Prudential Insurance Company. That is the position as I understand it, and, alI f the Minister is satisthough I had intended to support the purchase of this site, because I believed in it, yet, owing to the statements made by the honourable member for Grev and other statements which have been made, I feel that it would be wise for the Minister to ask leave to withdraw the motion until further particulars have been obtained, especially in view of the fact that the price has now been increased to £ 1 9 8 , 0 0 0 . TheI should not leave it to CapMinistry should consider that aspect of the matter most carefully. I do not wish to reflect upon them, nor, unsuitable terms.

If the Minister will defer this question he can get a special report, and then the principals can approach the Government. That would be a, wise course to adopt. The honourable member for Dalley stated that Captain Collins had previously recommended the It is impossible at this Strand site as the best site possible.

I agreed with the proposal to 'lease that site, because it was the best available, and I say to-day that it is a magnificent site; although the one in No .

If the .ground floor were turned into a small exhibition of our agricultural, grazing, mineral, and fruit products it would attract attention, and, instead of everybody flocking to Canada, probably ai large percentage of the floating population of Great Britain who wish to better their positions would come to Australia. For that reason the Government should not allow any further delay, -although in view of the facts which I have mentioned we should defer action in this instance until fuller particulars can be subments which have no foothold in the documitted to the House.

That would be a valuable advertisement for Australia. According to the honourable member for Dalley, the rule generally is first to get the cage and then catch wealth. In that, and no more, I corthe bird, but in this instance the honourable member suggested that the procedure should be reversed, and I agree with him. We should appoint the High Commissioner first. Tn the meantime, while negotiations for the acquisition of a permanent site are proceedCommonwealth should expect to get this or ing, let the Government rent a building so that we could start on a small scale to advertise our products and resources. I want to support this proposal, but fuller and more exhaustive inquiries should be made, so lhat we may know that we are not paying more than we should pay, in view of the fact that the site was previously offered to us at a much lower figure. If the Minister would look at the matter from that point of view, he might well accept the amendment. so in the interests, not only of the people of Australia, but of the Government to which he belongs. We advocate the appointment of a High Commissioner and the purchase or erection of a building in London because we want to establish a bureau of information for the people of Great Britain who wish to come here, and whom we desire to see here. We want, not to continue to stagnate, but to progress. For that reason, if it had been shown that this was the lowest possible price, and if the site had not been offered to us previously for less, I should have supported the motion most heartily, because I do not think there is a better site available, nor do I know any other that I would choose in preference to it. mv misfortune that a sudden summons called me from the House at a time when, apparently, a view of this transaction was submitted, based upon some statements in the documents, and also upon some statements or anywhere else. It appeared to me unnecessary to speak earlier, because no I do not think that if we statement could have been more ample or fairer than that made by the Minister of External Affairs in submitting the motion. He concealed nothing of the circumstances of the purchase, or of the character of the site, or of the consideration for the sum required for it. advocacy of it. properly so, because it seemed to him that, regarded as a business proposition, this was an excellent undertaking for the Commondially agree with him. No one pretends that this is a great bargain. No one pretends that the price asked is not a full price. We have yet to learn that it is more than a fair price, but we have also to learn why the any other site below its value. The real question is whether the sum asked is above its value to us. Upon a passage in a letter, which is somewhat ambiguous, it has been insinuated that this particular property was in the hands of other agents prior to its being submitted by Messrs. Lyons. That is just a possible construction; but, as the Minister pointed out, there are two obstacles to that view. What Captain Collins says is that the site I ask him to do was first brought under his notice by Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who said that the total' frontage was 164 feet, with a ground area of 8,600 feet, and that they considered that an offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted. It seems to me the most natural interpretation that this property was not actually in Messrs. Hampton and Sons' hands. Though they knew something of it, they did not know the frontage, but they knew the general area; and they gave an opinion as to the price that might be accepted by the owners.",50,William Lyne I Was Not Listen Able To Step In And Obtain An Option Over

Consequently, we are not certain that it was this whole property to which Messrs. Hampton and Sons referred. It appears to me that it was not in the hands of Messrs. Hampton and Sons, and, for all we know, may have been already in the hands of Messrs. Lyons, of whom it was said that they had purchased it within a montha very vague phrase. We are not clear, however, that this was the property that was afterwards offered; and it appeared to be, so to speak, guess-work on the part of Messrs. Hampton and Sons, who were not the agents or vendors, but had some knowledge that the property was in the market. ton and Sons must have had some authority before they spoke as they did. some knowledge, just as there are land agents in the city of Melbourne who have knowledge of properties which have not been placed in their hands. If Messrs. Hampton and Sons had had the property in hand, they would undoubtedly have submitted it at that, time, or immediately afterwards. Sons do not appear again; and it is certain that they would not have retired in favour of Messrs. Lyonsi f they had seen a chance of getting the business. The fair inference is that they had no right to do business themselves, and merely made an assumption as to a price which might be accepted. in the list which Messrs. Hampton and Sons submitted.

On that ambiguity, to build a suggestion that a property, which might have been obtained for £180,000 is now offered at £18,000 extra profit, is wandering far from, the purpose. question is not whether the property might have been got cheaper at an earlier date. argument to say that the: property may become dearer if we now delay. Colonel FOXTON -It might be cheaper yet, because Messrs. Lyons might forfeit their option. but a vendor is not likely, in face of the valuations which we have obtained, to lower his price by anything worth mentioning. However, that is merely a contingency, which I do not think worth discussing. The question is whether' the priceproposed is a fair one, and the site the best available. The price suggested by the unauthorized agents was £i8q,ooo, and we are asked to pay £18,000 more. had something to go on. could give the prices of various properties in Melbourne, with which I have not the slightest business connection. member for Ballarat could not offer to sell those properties at a fixed price. rized agents; they refrained from doing so, merely expressing an opinion that an I suggest that they had offer for the freehold of £180,000 would be accepted, not by them but by some one else. doubt that those who obtained the option got it for less than the price we are asked to pay. is probable; there may be a very small margin, or no margin. As a matter of fact, the price asked by Messrs. Lyons at first, was, I think, £238,000, which was reduced to £230,000, and then lower still. But the question is whether the price now asked is unfair, having regard to all the circumstances of the situation. We have had the valuation of the Chairman of the Board of Valuators of London, who, we are informed, is of the highest reputation and standing; and his valuation is higher than the price it is proposed to pay. said the price, as between a willing buyer and a willing seller, would be £1.68,000. The plain afterwards that he meant a purchase for speculative purposes; and the words used, I am informed, have a technical It would be just as good an meaning in London, and indicate an exceptional set of circumstances.

I presume that if there were a willing seller and no buyer, the willing seller might come down in price; but when the business basis is reached, under the circumstances I have described, it means bedrock price. The valuator I have mentioned has given reasons for placing a higher valuation on the property than the sum we are offering, having special regard to the purposes of the Commonweath. Here we have a valuator of the highest standi n g ; and the suspicions which have been carelessly cast upon him are, in my opinion, not justified by the knowledge we possess. This valuator knew the purchaser and all the circumstances, and he deliberately advises and defends an offer of a much higher price. Then this Government, with a wise caution for which they deserve every credit, noticing these various explanations, and A'ery properly desiring to place themselves and the House in an impregnable position, from another high-class and independent valuator, with the result that the offer now being made was borne out What reason, then, is there for all those imaginings and suggestions which I understand have been spun in the chamber since dinner? These suspicions are built on mere surmise, and in the teeth of valuations by two honourable professional men, who stake their reputations on those valuations. But the most extraordinary thing of all is to find the honourable member for Grey associating, in some mysterious manner, with this purchase, the name of a manufacturer of this country, with whom he has had some passages of opposition. I think it very unfortunate that on so slender a basis, the honourable member should have connected that gentleman's name with the business. does not deny that the two gentlemen I mentioned were working with Messrs.

What we are faced with is the question whether the price offered is a fair price.

I think his objection was almost entirely to the location. Amongst all the people who have criticised the site, and of the dozens who have communicated with me directly or induectly, all but two consider that the site now under discussion is better than that offered in the Strand. Do honourable members require other evidence that they are not making a bad bargain ? If so, let them take the lowest price which my colleague was able to obtain on offer from the London County Council, and reduce it to a freehold basis. The Aldwych site, though good in itself, is inferior having regard to Commonwealth purposes. Colonel FOXTON to the city. cording to the late Treasurer. three authorities, out of many dozens, who are of that opinion. As I was pointing out, if the Strand site be put on a freehold basis, it will be found to be dearer than the Trafalgar Square site. Unler those circumstances how can it be said that we are making an unreasonable bargain? I do not say that we have got anything remarkably cheap, because I regard the price offered as the f u l l price; but the site is worth it to the Commonwealth of Australia. As to the Strand site being nearer to the city, I questioned a number of authorities on this matter in London, and was told that in these days of taximotors, a distance like half-a-mile or a mile is nothing. question is less than three-quarters of a mile from the City.

But it already needs a general office, which should not be located in the C it y ; such as'ite would be useless for most of the purposes we have in view in establishing ComD i d Mr Beale deal monwealth offices in London. in London are, first, the City proper, in which the financial transactions of the Kingdom and of a great part of the world are carried on, where it is most desirable for those engaged in finance to have an office. The other is the district about Trafalgar Square and Parliament House, where most of the public Departments, with which the High Commissioner must keep in touch, now cluster. Trafalgar Square is the great centre of populous and travelling London. It is close to the Charing Cross railway station, and to the station of the new "" Twopenny"" tube, which daily absorbs thousands more than any of the other stations on that line.

482,Mr Henrywillis (Robertson),"that has taken place in regard to it. It is about time that a High Commissioner was appointed. It is contended by the Minister controlling Colonial Affairs in London that, although he has made representations to the Australian Government in respect of many matters, no action has been taken, and there can be no doubt that Australia is greatly disadvantaged by the nonappointment of a High Commissioner. It has been urged that, as a financial proposal, the motion is objectionable. From all points of view, however, I fail to see that the transaction would not be a profitable one. It is proposed to acquire the property for £198,000, and interest on the balance of the purchase money at 4 per cent, would be something like £8,000, whereas the revenue from rents receivable would be £9,740 per annum. VVe should thus have a balance of over £1,700 in favour of the Commonwealth. Assuming that the present buildings were considered unsuitable for the purposes of the Commonwealth, and a new structure were erected at a cost of £127,000, we should have to pay further interest amounting, at 4 per cent., to £5,080, or a total of £13,080. On the other hand, the present tenants are paying -within a few pounds of £10,000 per annum, so that, on that basis, we should secure offices suitable to the requirements of the Commonwealth at a cost of little more than £3,000 a year. That would not be an excessive rental. It must be remembered, however, that the States of the Union would rent offices in the Commonwealth buildings, and, as they would doubtless be prepared to pay a fair proportion of the cost of maintenance, the expenditure that would accrue to the Commonwealth would not be more than about £2,000 per annum. I fail to believe that in any of the big cities of Australia we should be able to secure for anything like that rental business premises suitable for our requirements. To obtain a desirable building in London at that figure is a proposition that commends itself to me. of London. great that it is both urban and suburban -unti l we have there some one of abilitv What the honourable member would describe as the City of London is that part of it which is in the vicinity of the East End. are the Citv limits in that direction. the site is in the centre of a very populous part of London. It is an imposing situation. Nelson's monument is in the vicinity, and the present building is surrounded by many public institutions. There is also plenty of open space. I do not profess to be a judge of the situation, but I know it, and should say that it is most suitable fos our requirements. Although it may not be actually within the City of London, it is surrounded by a population numbering some millions. It is said that London is empty after September in each year, although one can still find millions roaming its streets. This site is in the centre of the business and official part of London, and I think that we ought to acquire it. Honourable members in another place have thrown out the proposal, but, on further consideration, they might be disposed to reverse their decision if this House agreed to the motion. not intend to occupy the attention of the House for more than a few minutes, since the announcement made by the honourable member for Ballarat has practically knocked the bottom out of the debate. It is evident, however, that there is in this Parliament considerable dissatisfaction in regard to the way in which information is prepared for our use. It appears to me that many honourable members are not satisfied that this proposal has received the careful attention that so great a business transaction demands. We have not in London to-da.y any one upon whom we can implicitly relyto carry on our business arrangements there. tirely unjustifiable. pressed is entertained by more than one honourable member, and it is unfortunate that such should be the feeling. I make these remarks as leading up to the point that, even if the motion is not carried, some good will have been done by its submission if, as the result of the debate, the absolute necessity for the early appointment of i«. High Commissioner is clearly shown. We shall have no satisfaction until we have in London a representative who is prepared to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility for vast Commonwealth undertakings and skill, on whom we can rely. member be prepared to approve of the actions of a High .Commissioner? to trust a High Commissioner, where I should not be prepared to have confidence",55,William Lyne I Was Not Listen Able To Step In And Obtain An Option Over

No. He has simply expressed an opinion to .

As to the suitability of the site, we must remember that we have to carry on in London two differing classes of business.

The schedule to the report supplied by Mr Martin shows that the building contains district messengers' offices, a shop occupied by the Aerated Bread Company, and some small offices. It is on the wrong side of the road for nusbess purposes. It is down the hill, and somewhat out of the way. It is certainly in a part of London to which people go when they wish to book their passages to various parts of the world.

The speech delivered this evening by the honourable member for Ballarat was _ the most plausible to which I have ever listened; I do not think that anything could have been cleverer.' The honourable member for Grey brought certa'in facts under our notice, and I must compliment him upon the way in which he handled the material at his disposal. Having listened to his speech, it ' would take more than the eloquence of the late Prime Minister to convince me that there is not in connection with this proposal something in the nature of WhatI have seen recently associated with other public transactions. might I suggest that the honourable member should not discuss it further.
