Wednesday, 16 July, 1984",". took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. ter) [3.1] -(B y leave) I have -with deep regret to announce to the House the death of Mr William Harrison Story, who for nearly twenty years was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, having served as a senator for the state of South Australia, and subsequently as a member Of the House of Representatives for the division of Boothby. I am sure that all honourable members who knew the late Mr Story must have hoard of his death with very great regret. We all know the services he rendered to this country during his long parliamentary career. Most of us who were in the Bame Parliament with him have very pleasant recollections of the period when he served as Government Whip. He had a gift of absolute imperturbability on all occasions, and he was known to members of this House as a man who, no matter what might occur, was always ready and able to carry out the duties of an efficient Whip. Wo all have the deepest appreciation of his services as a member of many committees of this House, and in the performance of his duties to his.constituents. I feel sure that it -would be the. wish of the Honse to have conveyed to those he has left behind our deep sympathy with them, and our great esteem for him as a man and as a parliamentarian. I move That this House expresses its sincere regret at the death of William Him-ison Story, for many years a meinber of the Common ivealSfi Parliament, and places upon record its appreciation of his meritorious public services, and ment of the pools, it will be prepared to airtends its profound sympathy to his family in their sad bereavement.

Some two months ago, representatives of the wheat pools proposed for the four wheat! growing states waited upon me aud asked whether thei Government would guarantee the pools. I pointed out that, if four separate pools were desired, the question was one which must be dealt with hy the governments of the states concerned. The conference held yesterday merely discussed the existing position. As four separate pools are desired, the four state governments concerned are now giving consideration to the matter. The Commonwealth Government has indicated that, if action is taken for the establishsympathetically consider the giving of assistance in the form of a guarantee. (BouTke-Deputy *",12,Setup

Juue (vide That the bill be now read a second time. the indulgence of the House, and with your permission, Mr Speaker, I desire to introduce myself in my new role of Acting Leader of the Opposition, in the House of Representatives, a position which I have the honour to occupy in the absence of the leader of our party, Mr Charlton, who is about to proceedto Geneva to attend the Assembly of the League cf Nations. So far as I am able, I shall endeavour to uphold the dignity which appertains to the position, of spokesman for this party. this may exist m the minds of some honourable members, because of language in which I indulged last week. I can only plead that I was then the -victim of a bad example; and while I am aware that a bad example is no justification for bad conduct, I point out that it was from a newspaper of this city that I learned that it was alleged that certain honourable gentlemen who sit behind the Government had decided to "" plunder the Treasury,"" and it was from a gentleman who is now a member of the Government that I obtained the phrase "" drop the loot."" Those bad examples I shall not follow again.

The bill proposes to appropriate the sum of £2,000,000 for the construction of two cruisers for the defence of Australia. To discover the reasons for this proposal. I turned to the speech made by the Prime Minister when introducing the measure. The right honourable gentleman on that occasion saidWe should never lose sight of the fact that during thp last ten or fifteen years the position has completely changed. He also stated that the position had changed because the Empire had lost its pre-eminence at sea; because Great Britain was now, "" l i k e ourselves, a free democracy "" ; because the rise of a "" free BILL. democracy"" suffering from ""short sighted vision "" and "" lack of knowledge "" made it doubtful whether, in the future, we could rely upon Britain's assistance; because we must allow for a period during which the "" free democracy"" of GreatB r it a in would be "" against the maintenance of even a one-power standard "" ; and because GreatB r it a in , "" hard pressed w i th the war burden,"" and burdened w i th a free democracy, might concentrate upon the defence of Britain, to the detriment of the out-lying parts of the Empire. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) interjected that ""we have had some evidence of that already,"" and the Prime Minister replied, "" That is so."" The Prime Minister further went on to show that the position hadchanged because the I m Doubts of my ability to do perial conference had affirmed the responsibility of each portion of the Empire to provide for its own defence; because the League of Nations had come into being and was "" the greatest hope of the world to-day""; because behind the Leagjue of Nations there was i u all countries a revulsion of feeling against war, and because "" the aspiration of the overwhelming bulk of the peoples of most countries is to be r i d of the hideous arbitrament of war."" Finally, the Prime Minister alleged thatIt is the desire of every man and woman in Australia that we should"" go forward to promote a reduction of armaments ia every possible way. In face -of that desire to decrease armaments, the Government proposes to increase them. The Labour party accepts the statement of 'the Prime Minister that it is; the desire of every man and woman in Australia to decrease armaments, and it proposes to act in accordance .with that desire. Its members, therefore, will not vote for millions of pounds' to be spent upon additional armaments against that desire. The Prime Minister, when dealing i with the Washington Treaty, said that the conference had achieved a great work, even if it had done nothing more than stop the competition in naval armaments between Great Britain, the United States of America, and Japan. He claimed, however, that it had not only stopped the competition in naval armaments, but had so restricted the construction of naval bases as to make it almost",18,Papers

56,Mr Anstey,"U p to the h i l t ; andevent, we must contemplate two contingencies. The first is that "" a great expeditionary force may be sent against us."" Having set up that bogy, he immediately knocked it down again by admitting that "" we can set aside this contingency a3 a practical impossibility."" Then he explained why. Plis second contingency was that a raiding force of a minor character might attack us. the reasons why no sustained attack can be made upon us by proving conclusively that, owing to the location of the naval bases, an attack by a large force would be impossible. To meet the possibility of a raiding expedition, two cruisers are said to be required to protect our trade routes. other parts of the world are very numerous, and no one pretends that two cruisers could protect them. they are traversed by ships of all nations, and an attack upon them would be an assault upon the shipping, not only of this continent, but of every nation of the world. As tliere is no plausible argument for the building of the cruisers in the statements with which I have dealt, the case for the Government's proposal boils down to the contention that they are wanted because, in time of war, we should need munitions from overseas. it is essential that we should bring from overseas a great part of our munition requirements, because we cannot economically establish works to supply our requirements But what is there in war or preparations for war that is economical? May we not naturally assume that the most economical proposition for us would be the establishment of works in Australia for the manufacture of all forms of munitions so that we might be in a position, if we were attacked, to turn out everything necessary to defend the lives and property of the people of this country? Whilsti t might be contended that this would not be an economical proposition if the establishment of such works would involve us in an annual loss of £50,000, £100,000, or £200,000, surely the construction of works for the supply of such essential munitions w it h in our own territory would be a f a r better proposition than the maintenance at the cost of £100,000 or £200,000 a year of two vessels that would be floating up and down our coast year after year, gradually becoming obsolete awaiting and anticipating a war that may not come. Whether the establishment of munition works would be economic or non-economic, by the adoption of. that policy we should at least be carrying on work w it h in our own territory, finding He stated employment for our own people, and building up reserves for our defence that would not be open to attack upon any ocean highway. From the stand-point of defence we should not then be dependent upon supplies that could only come from overseas, and which might in the hour of The routes from Australia to need, together with the cruisers built to defend their transport, be lost in the depths of the ocean. Our armies might Besides, be useless because w it h in our own territory we had not established manufactures to supply their requirements. I say that it is infinitely better from the stand-point of defence that we should expend the m i l lions which the Government proposes to expend on ships on the establishment of factories within our own territory. In stead of spending £100,000 per annum on the maintenance of ships it would be better, even from the defence stand-point, to spend what the proposed cruisers are estimated to cost in the establishment of We have been told that -munition factories in Australia, even though that should involve an annual loss equal to the cost of maintaining the ships. Foi"" these reasons we are opposed to the policy of the Government. There would in modern munitions. appear to be no common ground upon which the Government and the party on this side can stand. Wej u s t if y our attitude with the statements made, not only by the Prime Minister, but also by the press of this country. One newspaper in this state said a few months ago that if thia country was invaded our soldiers would be murdered for want of economic backing. What an absurdity it would be to provide spectacularly for soldiers and ships without the necessary economic backing to maintain them in the event of war. We do not believe that the conditions of the world w ill permit of war for many yearsto come, or u n t i l the nations have recovered from their present financial position. We are quite prepared, to admit and recognize revolutionary conditions in France and Russia, and to agree that the time might come -when Australia would have to defend its ideals, and for this purpose we should take the necessary steps to secure to the nation the necessary economic backing -against a breakdown of the metal plants, That is the wisest and soundest course which the coun toy can adopt. In this connection I propose to put before honourable members certain considerations which have been suggested by Mr H.. W. Gepp and others. Amongst ether things, this gentleman has saidScience has revolutionarized the ant of warfare. Science has made the problem of Australia's defence much more possible tlian was 'the case in 1914. Tbe effective defence of Australia calls primarily for an aerial and submarine unit, and also for the supply of the necessary equipmeui for those -services. He goes on to point outhow necessary it is that during war we should maintain thu primary production of the country. Certain fertilizers at present have to be imported from overseas. Russia and other -countries found that they were cut off by the process of war from necessary supplies, and the products of those countries annually declined because they were deprived of the fertilizers upon which they 'depended. tralia that are now productive, might, if wewere cut oEE by war from .necessary .supplies, not produce anything. The soil would still be there, and the rainfall might not diminish, but because of the lack of artificial fertilizers the crops would f a i l. within Australia the manufacture of the fertilizers we require. 'cut off from supplies of the phosphate rocks of the Pacific, there are mediumgrade, deposits in Australia which would tide us over in the event of war. But they can be utilized only by a policy of economic preparedness. We have adopted no policy of economic preparedness to en-sure that our primary producers shall be able to carry on in time of war. Fuel oil and high-grade -spirit for combustion engines are essential in.war as in .times of peace, and we ought to organize so that we may have in Australia sufficient oil reserves for defence purposes. -steps are being taken towards building up such reserves. The statement is made that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has -a capacity of 400,000 tons of basic and foundry 400,000 tons"" of basic steel ingots. there come acid steel, shell steel, barrel steel, Mr Anstey. benzol, toluol, phenol, and naphthalena. We have been reminded that there should be reserves of these essentials to guard and adequate defence of vital economic areas in order to guarantee that they function in the hour of necessity. Newcastle is such a vital area necessary for the defence of Australia. Half a dozen guns in position around Newcastle to defend these things essential to defence would be of infinitely more importance than half a dozen guns on a ship floating up and down the coast. Half a dozen guns behind cheaply constructed earthworks would be more economical, and a t the same time more effective for the protection of Australia. Sulphur and sulphuric acid are absolutely necessary for defence, and thousands of tons of these materials axe at present produced annually from BrokenH ill concentrates. There are no national reserves of these things, but there should be. It would be infinitely better to spend the nation's money in the building up of these reserves Millions of acres in Ausin preparation for war than to spend it in the way which the Government proposes. Cotton is an essential of defence, and consequently the cotton industry should be regarded as a national industry, and should be extended. Nothing is being done in this direction. The chemical in We should take steps to secure dustry should be developed for the production of acids, because, without nitric If we were acid none of the ordinary forms of propellants and explosives can be manufactured. Plants for the production of nitric acid should be erected in Australia. The manufacture within Australia of essential medical supplies including anaesthetics has been well advanced, but provision should be made for reserves. Preparations for defence mean more and mere the organizing of the essentials necessary to keep defence going. Forevery man. in the battle line there are tons of metals, chemicals, and foodstuffs needed. The Government are proposing No to build up the spectacular side of defence, but what is necessary is that we should bnild up provision for the requirements of our navy at sea and our armies on land. We on this side say, let pig iron, and a capacity of us begin at the foundation. W it h the From newspaper statement to which I have referred, honourable members on this side ammonia, ammonium sulphate, are in agreement. We have the same opinion' as to what is necessary in the d&development of effective defence. We say to the gentlemen of the press responsible for that statement, "" We are with you, and are prepared to put into practice the principles which you have enunciated."" The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), last year, speaking before the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, said that the development of our industries, trade, and commerce were of more importance to ' the defence of Australia than are the armies of Australia. Tbat development : is fundamental. We must' have the financial, power and economic reserves. It is not necessary only to have men; we must have the power and capacity to keep them in the field. The Labour party stands not for what is merely spectacular,, but for what isfundamental,, important, and imperative. A ll talk about defenee is meresham if we are not getting down to the real and essential preparations for defence. The Labour party, standsfor the development of those industries which, whilst fulfilling definite, useful purposes in times of peace, have a necessary part in defence. It stands for peace-time production methods so planned that the change from peace to war manufacturing can be rapidly effected. zation of plants and rolling-stock are essential. found wanting in essentials when it has tofight for its life. The Labour partystands for the extension of an aerial fleet, a fleet the most economical and numerous, a fleet capable of the most I'apid concentration at a given point, that can go across the continent, and is under no necessity to go round it. It stands for aerial stations and aerial supplies in all parts of Australia; for an aerial fleet capable of rendering public service in time of peace as well as ia war. It stands for shore defences of vital economic centres, for effective staff work and standardization, the tabulation of our economic resources, and . the building up of essential reserves. On all the grounds I have set out we must oppose the policy of the Government. present conditions of the nations of the world, there is no danger at present threatening us from the American continent or from the European continent. The only ground upon which the Government can seek to arouse the fears of the timid is the possibility of danger from Japan. The Prime Minister has pointed out that it would be absolutely impossible for the Japanese to land amy large expeditionary force in> Australia, because of the distance from their base. He has pointed out that the only risk is from a raiding force. We say that we are determined to carry out the economic and social purposes of the movement to which we belong, and we shall not be diverted by any fear aroused in the minds of the people that an enemy may come. We say clearly and definitely that, so far as Imperialism is concerned, we will have none of it. So far as the transport of Australians overseas in the future is concerned, we will have none of it. We will have, none of the policy of Imperialism. We stand for the economic and social ideals of the Labour party, and, should it be necessary to defend the ideals and purposes for which our movement stands, we shall defend them. Wb seek the most effective, soundest, and most permanent means of defence. We seek the. establishment within our own territory of every means by which to susStandarditain the life of the people. We stand for the supply within Australia of our imThe nation should not be mediate needs. We desire that this country shall be self-contained as. far as. possible in respeet of all those things requisite for the life and defence of the people. We stand for the extended production of all these things within our own. borders, and if there isany essential which we cannot produce, we stand for gathering andi building up reserves of it in time of peace to be prepared for war. Behind all these things there is the fundamental consideration of the enormous debt that presses upon this country, ancl upon all others. One of the newspapers published in this city not long ago made the statement that taxation presses heavily upon and squeezes the life out of industries in this country. The problem is a world-wide one, and we are faced in Australia with the necessity for considerWe believe that, owing to the ing how we may get rid of our load of debt. Whilst it is true that the Government proposes, as far as possible, to build the cruisers out of excess revenue, we know that in other directions it is augmenting the debt of Australia. Qur debts grow more and more, and our interest bill increases year by year. The great industries of the country have to bear the burden of our enormous debt and increasing interest payments. load upon our industries as great as an indemnity imposed by a foreign country. We must have reduced taxation for the relief of our producers, and we must, at the same time, take the steps I have outlined for the defence of the nation. At this moment, there is a clear line of demarcation between the policy of the Government and that of the party on this side in outlook, in ideals, and in what is considered necessary for the future, and I therefore move That after the word "" T h a t "" the following words be inserted:"" as efforts are being made by tlie President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain to convene another conference to deal with the question of further disarmament, and in view of the early sitting of the League of Nations, it is the opinion of this House that expenditure on naval construction should be deferred for the present. If the League of Nations is the hope of the world, as the Prime Minister has said, we should anticipate with confidence that it will solve some, of our difficulties in the future, and should certainly not give way to despair and despondency. The fundamental principle of the League is that no nation shall encroach with impunity on the soil of another nation. When that is incorporated in the laws of the nations good must result. How futile, then, will be the expenditure of this vast sUm of money. pounds in constructing the Australia, and then, in conformity with the decision of the Washington Conference, we sent her to the bottom of the sea. It is quite probable that after the next disarmament conference we shall be asked to do the same thing with these two cruisers. Why, then, should we waste our money in building them? Important international conferences may change the mind of even this Government, and so cause all its expenditure on these cruisers to be useless. A report in to-day's press states tha£ the Government is considering no^ merely the construction of these vessels overseas, but the purchase of two which Great Britain has on the stocks. seem that Great Britain does not want these vessels. They are being built to Ifr. Anstep. provide work for the unemployed, and the British Government is prepared to sell them. If it should be necessary to find still more work for the people of These represent a Great Britain, that Government will begin building two more; and I dare say if this Government wanted those two it could purchase them also. If Parliament agrees that two cruisers are necessary for our defence, this is the country in which they should be built. The contention of the Labour party is that 11 we shall do better for the defence of our country if we build up our economic resources and provide shipbuilding yards in this country where cruisers may be both built and repaired."" for Defence) [4.19] -Honorabl e members who listened to the speech just delivered by the Acting Leader of the Opposition will recognize that there is, as he said, a great gulf fixed between his party and supporters of the Government on the vital question of Empire defence. It will also be realized that honourable members opposite will take any step to postpone facing the issue, and make any suggestion to prevent anything ^from being done. The Acting Leader of the Opposition asked glibly who was likely to be our enemy, and from what quarter might we expect an attack. He might just as well ask a man who insures his bouse who he thinks will set fire to it, and when he expects the .match to be lighted. Expenditure on defence is, after all, the payment of insurance for the safety of our country. The We spent millions of honourable member said that our munitions resources should be built up, and that certain other things should be done, but that nothing whatever should be done to develop a policy of naval defence, because, forsooth, the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain are calling another conference to try to arrange for further international disarmament. But he reminded us that the present British Government is not staying its hand in building cruisers of -the description which this Government proposes to secure, and it is common knowledge that the Government of the United States of America is speeding up the production of this particular type of vessel.

Watt).,"bas theunanimous approval of lionorable ; members-. -With many features of the speech w it h which the Prime Minister( Mr. Bruce) moved the second reading of this b ill , the House has every reason to be disappointed. The right honourable gentleman told us that gestures of peace must not be gestures of disarmament, and the in ference to be drawn from his remarks was that although we might profess to the world to be desirous of disarmament and peace we must keep distrust alive and continue to build up armaments. A lot has been said and written in Australia and other part's of the world about the Pacific Ocean being the scene of the next great war. The Prime Minister told us that Australia has no reason toapprehend danger at the present time from the nations bordering on the Pacific, but that we must continue building up armaments, because we may be menaced from those quarters in the future. Anattempt is being made to scare us. In the words of the nursery rhyme"" the goblins will catch you if you don't watch out."" agree w it h the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) that the League of Nations is not a guarantee against another world war, and the reason is that it is not a League of Nations of the world, but only a league of some nations, and while some of the principal nations, voluntarily or otherwise, remain outside the league it cannot speak for a l l nations. IndeedI am convinced that so long as the present sysiteni ofgovernment continuesi n so many countries the League of Nations will be an ineffective means of ensuring the world's peace. Honourable members opposite and the daily press are very fond of the argument that Australia would have been taken by some other nation years ago if it had not been portion of the British Empire and had not enjoyed the protection of the Royal Navy. But that is mere assumption-. Even the Prime Minister said that it would be impossible for a hostile expeditionary force to land troops in Australia and capture the .country. is protecting us. sumption ; the history of the world's wars and the opinions of experts contradict the Prime Minister's contention. Australia has not been attacked in the past and will not be attacked in the future because the capturing of this country is too big a proposition for any one, or even two., nations to undertake. Something waa saidby interjection regarding the sinking of the Australia. We were told that that vessel, had to be sunk,, because it was obsolete or nearly so. The Washington Treaty also is supposed to have had some bearing upon the fate of the Australia, but it could not havo had much, because. the Government sank one old vessel and now proposes to build two new ones. The proposal to defend Australia with two cruisers is mere stupidity. What could two cruisers do against: a hostile fleet? If Australia's defence is on the water,, we must build Hoods. Do honourable members think t h a t a nation which had aggressive' intentions towards Australia would be so sporting as to send against us only cruisers because we had only cruisers? J$o; it would send out its largest engines of war, and our cruisers would be sunk before they could get within range of the enemy vessels. I The annual upkeep of these two cruisers will' amount to about ,£250,000,. and that nioney might as well be thrown into the ocean, for they will be quite ineffective. We members of the Labour party are prepared as a party, and would be. prepared as a Government,, to make ourselves responsible for the defence, of Australia. We must be careful,, particularly in the present disturbed state of the world,, that in formulating a policy of defence we do not add to the distrust of nations and cause them to suspect that we are. preparing, for .aggression. No t one of the nations engaged in the last great, war,, however well prepared for the struggle, admitted that it was arming for a war of aggression. Can honourable members tell me of any nation in modern times which, while building up armaments and engines of destruction, did not tell its people that they were intended only for defence, and that because another nation was so strong in armaments counterbalancing strength was essential, to safety ? So the race of armaments proceeds.

Engines of war t h a i can operate only on the sea-board, or within avery limited distance oif it , cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as armaments that could be used in aggression. Let us give to the nations of the world .a guarantee that we shall never initiate hostilities, and in proof of our bona fides build only such engines of warfare _ as can be used for purely local defence. Sucli a policy would be Australia's best assurance of safety. The Prime Minister told us that the two cruisers are necessary to defend t'he Australian trade routes. How could they do that effectively? not carried to any extent in Australian vessels. Our produce is carried by the vessels of all nations, and that is another guarantee of our safety. If any nation, ignoring the lessons of liberty, were so -stupid as to attempt to conquer Australia and interfered with the shipping ot neutral nations engaged in carrying our produce to the world's markets, it would bring disaster upon itself within 48 hours. I realize that the House is justified in asking me what I know about defence matters. I do not claim to have much knowledge other than what I have gained from the reading of history, but I House the opinions of experts whose authority nobody can reasonably question. I shall now quote some of the prominent naval and military authorities of the world, particularly of the British Empire, 'to prove my contention that the lesson taught us by the last war is that Australia's first line of defence is her coastline. In the Times of the 30th October, -after the armistice, Admiral Lord Fisher, writing on the question of defence from the British point of view, saidI t is as clear as daylight that the future of war on the sea absolutely precludes the use of any war vessel except submarines, therefore why keep any of the present lot. We Cruisers that must also scrap all our Admirals and superior officers, who won't do for the new jobs. Put them in a museum like Greenwich Hospital, keeping only submarines and their commanders. All we want is the present naval side of the Air Force, costing a few millions; yet the Army estimates are over £400,000,000 a year, after the most devastating armistice known to the world.

I was unable to give the Dardanelles proposal any welcome, for there was the Nelsonic dictum that "" any sailor who attacked a fort was a fool."" No one in this chamber will contend t h a t Lord Fisher, Admiral of the British Fleet for years, is not an authority on the subjects of naval defence and the lessons taught by the late war. Brigadier-General Sir G. G\ Aston, of the General Staff of the Royal Marine Artillery , also engaged in the Naval Intelligence Department at the Admiralty, Professor of Fortification Australian sea-borne trade is at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, member of the Gunnery Manual Committee of the Foreign Intelligence Committee, and Secretary of the Naval Reserve Committee at the Admiralty, pointed out, in a book that he wrote on the Spanish-American war, the weakness of ships' guns against those of forts. He saidSliips may have heavy shell, but .heavy howitzers which give a steep angle of descent they have not. For absolute accuracy of elevation, the use of clinometers with spiritlevels is required, and these are difficult to apply at sea, because a perfectly steady platform is required for their employment. Where the harbour is sheltered by high ground, observation of the fall of each projectile cannot be intend to place before the obtained from the sea; and, furthermore, the bombarding ships do not, as a rule, wish to come within range of the coastal forts, which have the great advantage over them which we have considered on a former occasion. That statement supports my contention that when bombarding land defences to cover the landing of troops all the disadvantage is with the war vessel. The same authority, in his work Amphibious Wars, saidShips are built to fight each other, and not to fight forts. The ordnance mounted inland is on a steady platform, with aU sorts-of appliances, such as autosights giving the exact range automatically and increasing the accuracy of fire. And these appliances cannot be adapted to ships. Besides, other things have to be dreaded by the ship, such as mines and torpedoes, whicli can be made specially dangerous near a defended harbour. Ships must be built to float, and therefore only a certain portion of their weight can be devoted to protection. While with forts no such economy in weight need be exercised. A fort can be made almost invisible from long range, while a ship at sea is always aconspicuous target. Finally, ships only carry a certain amount of ammunition, and if this is fired away against forts, there will be none available for use against hostile war vessels, which are their proper objective. Sir 6.. G. Aston also instanced the small £10,000,000. amount of harm done by such bombardthing like that amount to make Australia ments during the Russo-Japanese war, self-contained for defence purposes.'

Although the treaty makes it very difficult for any of her neighbours to take the offensive against her, it does not prevent Japanf r o m taking action either to the east or the south. I think we may reasonably hope for peace in the Pacific for a considerable time; but who can say that a change may not come, and that there may not be serious trouble in the East. The code of eastern nations is not our code, and the position in China is not as satisfactory as we should like it to be. We have to be prepared against any possible attack by a foreign power, and the only defence which can be effective iu the near future w ill be found in cooperation with the British fleet. We must turn our attention to . naval defence. There are two axioms to be remembered. One is that no nation can successfully attack Australia unless she has command, not merely temporarily of the Pacific, but of the seas. No nation could successfully attack Australia unless the British fleet were employed in other parts of the world, 'and could not come to our assistance in the Pacific. The other axiom is that it is impossible at present, and will be for some time, for us to defend ourselves without help. Our men are.brave and resourceful, and everything that soldiers should be, but they cannot fight without arms and munitions. We cannot produce these in Australia at present, nor shall we be able to do so for many years to come. We must therefore turn our attention to naval defence. It is a great pity that the Imperial Government decided not to proceed with the construction of the Singapore naval base. That decision has placed us in very grave danger. If trouble arose in the Pacific, it is doubtful whether the British fleet could come to our aid, for we have no facilities for either replenishing its fuel supplies or cleaning its ships. If trouble occurred between Australia and Japan and I were in charge of the Japanese operations, I would immediately seize Singapore and, perhaps, Hong Kong. The treaty What would be Australia's position if that were done by an enemy? It would then be almost impossible for the British navy to help us. There is not. a particularly kindly feeling between Egypt and Great Britain at preThat was a sent, and if the Admiralty attempted to send battleships through the Suez Canal some Egyptians would not think twice about blowing them up. If they did not do it to spite Great Britain they certainly would do it for a bribe-and a bribe would undoubtedly be forthcoming in time of war.

We are unable to do anything to alter the mind of the present Imperial Government in regard to the Singapore base. It is, therefore, our bounden duty to take all possible steps to co-operate with the British navy so that some measure of assistance might be available to us if we should need it . I do not know whether I ought to give to honourable members some information I have respecting the relative strength of the Imperial and Japanese navies.

As a matter of fact, Japan knows more than we do about onr defence policy, and she also knows what the British Empire, generally, is doing. friendly with us just now, but it cannot be said that our policy in racial matters is conciliatory. A day may come when the Japanese w ill be inclined fco speak to n s in a very different tone of voice from that which we now hear, and in that day we must look to the British navy for protection. .navies, in order to operate effectively, must have properly equipped bases. Seein g that the British Government has resolved not to proceed with the construction of the Singapore base, Australia should seriously consider whether a suitable base cannot be established somewhere else. It cannot be said that we .'have one at Sydney, for the docking -f acilities on Cockatoo Island! are' inadc-quate for modern battleships. MrE . RILEY dock can take a vessel of 20,000 tons. 'battleships run to 40,000 tons, and 'Cockatoo Island dock is out of the question for them. I do not propose to dis<cuss at length the debatable subject of ""the efficacy -of the capital ship as a means <oT defence. Some people .say that in .these <days we should 'be turning our attention ; to submarines and aeroplanes -with a view to relying upon them. I am prepared to -accept the dictum of our naval authorities, -ifor they are more able to decide a matter like this than any one else. The leading naval authorities of the Empire say that 'we must still depend upon capital ships. When tbe Prime Minister made a remark tto this effect a few days ago, an honorable member opposite interjected that the naval authorities said this because they wanted to keep their billets. countenance such statements altogether. 'The chief officers of our naval forces must be placed on a higher plane than t h a t. I accept their statement that we '-must stiU -depend upon capital ships. One -objection to relying .on aer.opla.nes is 'that 'their range of operation is still comparaifcively limited; and we cannot safely def e n d upon the submarine, for some antiisubmarine device is always being in vented ^Capital ships are invarialbly accompanied in action by aeroplane carriers, <and immediately .an enemy ai r force is sighted, planes are launched from these carriers to give battle. Therefore we cannot safely rely upon aeroplanes to keep The Japanese are capital ships from approaching our shores. I suggest to the Minister for Defence( Mr. Bowden), however, t h a t we are paying too little attention to the installation of antiaircraft guns. Practical experience has certainly proved that these weapons are not very effective in destroying aeroplanes, but thay exert a great moral effect. They Modern should be installed in each capital city, and at our main seaports. They are not very costly, for the calibre never exceeds 4 . inches, and is usually from 2^ to 3 inches. In addition to developing our naval defence force I submit that it is imperative for us to maintain a force for .land defence purposes. If we failed to do so, and an enemy bombarded Sydney and landed an armed force there, it could prevent any assistance from coming to us. If , for instance, a squadron of the British navy was known to be on its way Tbe Cockatoo Island to Australia, a wireless message could be despatched forbidding it to approach any nearer, or Sydney or Melbourne would be destroyed. We ought to have a sufficiently strong military force available to offer a good measure of resistance to the landing of an enemy. Experience has proved the wisdom and, indeed, the -imperativeness of organizing a m i l it a ry force on a nucleus basis. We should have a nucleus army in peace time -that could be expanded rapidly to meet our requirements in a time of war. In peaoe times it would be chiefly concerned with training commissioned and non-icommissioned officers.

Our small arms, ammunition could be manufactured at Maribyrnong, but it would be wise to encourage private firms to install machinery for manufacturing small arms ammunition so that in time of war our supply could be speedily augmented. orable member is getting a little wide of the bill. Sir GEANVTLLE EYEIE tend that it is necessary to maintain land forces for two purposes-(1 ) to assist the air and naval forces ih preventing an enemy from effecting, a successful landing on the coast, and (2) t& resist the euemy if he has been successful in the initial stages and effected a landing. For those purposes we need a mobile force, so that we can rush troops to any threatened point. motor cars. cars, especially armoured care, are very handy, but they are not very adaptable for fighting. What is the role of cavalry or light horse, and what proportion should mounted troops bear to other forces? I take it that the role of the light horse would be to prevent, if possible, the landing of an enemy, or to deal speedily with the enemy after he had landed. If that is so, there is a vital defect in the mobilization of our forces. The mobilization stores for the light horse regiments are at certain centres; they are not at the head-quarters of the regiment. That is a very great mistake, because if a light horse regiment were required to rush toany threatened point, it must first travel 100 miles in an. opposite direction in order to gather up its mobilization stores and kit: That arrangement should be altered. Not a great deal of extra expenditure would be involved in. keeping the mobilization stores at the head-quarters of the regiment. could be got ready in a very brief time and rushed away to the point of danger. In regard to the proportion of light horse to tbe rest of the military forces, the peace establishment is-infantry , 13,000; light horse, 4,500; and the war establishment-infantry, . 100,000; and light horse, 15,600. Numerically the infantry force would be six and a half times stronger than the light horse. A greater proportion of cavalry is needed in the Australian army, and I am quite sure that if more encouragement were given to the officers! and men of our mounted regiments, many more regiments of light horse could be raised in the country districts of all the states. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the light horse would 1 be the most useful military arm if AusI contralia Were invaded. never fail. never known them to fail, but they are not getting the training necessary to fit tkein to pl'ay their part in a defensive war. Those men who went through the big Avar, and others Avho bad received training prior to the war, are efficient, but the young fellows in the light horse regiments to-day are not getting adequate training. The term of annual training is ridiculously short. The troopsare required to. undergo ten days' training per annum, namely, six days in camp, and four days of home training split up into odd hours and half days. If the annual training is to extend only over ten clays, for goodness' sake concentrate it in a continuous camp. I guarantee that troops will' gain six times as much knowledge and training in a ten days' continuous camp as they get in a six days' camp and four days' home training. The greater part of a six days' camp is. occupied i i i getting tlie men into camp, settling down, and striking camp. But with a ten days' continuous camp we could give the men some very useful training. arms of the service. I am speaking as an officer commanding a cavalry division.

I regret to have to say that honourable members opposite are against any practical suggestion to cooperate with the British Navy. We must co-operate with Great Britain. We shall, be absolutely secure so long as the British Fleet is with us and is supreme upon the seas. Once we stray from British protection, we shall be a prey to any hawk that may sweep down upon us from the sky. There are many countries watching Australia, but, while we are part of the British Empire, and not recreant to the trust placed upon us by the people of this country, we can hope to live for many years in peace and comfort. I was particularly interested in the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey). AlthoughI cannot support his amendment, I would certainly further any effort made to limit armaments. I also agree that it is particularly desirable that this great continent should be self-coutained respecting the manufacture of munitions and instruments of war; but I go further. It is my belief that the great majority of the people of Australia stand for the adequate defenoe of our great Commonwealth, and desire such a scheme of defence as will, at least, meet the minimum requirements for the preservation of our own safety and territorial integrity. If I appreciate Australian sentiment correctly, and I feel sure I do, what is wanted is a defence policy of our own, including our own navy and air force prepared for any emergency, and ready and willing, should the necessity .ever arise, to co-operate with the forces of the Empire, to keep ever inviolate the great British Commonwealth of Nations, of which we are proud to be an important member. I feel sure that all Australians will willingly, subscribe to a policy of mutual assistance and co-operation with the rest of the Empire on all questions of defence. The defence of Australia has gone through what may be described as three periods: First, that period during which we were entirely .[85] the honourable' dependent on the Mother Country for defence; second, the period when we made a small monetary contribution to the United Kingdom towards the cost of our naval defence and during which we established a volunteer army; and third, the period from 1909 onwards when we established compulsory service, and laid the foundations of the great Australian Imperial Force which in the last war was the wonder and admiration of the whole world. Unfortunately, at this stage we appear to have undone most of what we had accomplished. Step by step we reduced our Citizen Forces until it became a mere shadow of what it should be. Even so, this skeleton force has not been given sufficient money or time fbr training to enable it to become efficient. Our navy has also been reduced until it is weaker now than it ever has been. The HMAS. Australia is now but a great and glorious memory. Our light cruisers and other surface craft are fast becoming obsolete. We have no modern submarines, and our naval personnel has also been considerably reduced. It is universally recognized that modern wai'fare requires the most intimate cooperation between naval and military forces and air-craft. In this latter most vital arm we are also miserably weak. It must be bitterly discouraging to all our fighting services to realize that they are hopelessly and incompletely equipped for the desperate tasks that they may be called upon to undertake. I hope the new defence programme of the Govern-, ment will enable this Parliament to raise out of the ashes of the old orders, new and efficient services, worthy of all that has gone before them, and sufficient for the great tasks that are yet ahead of them. This will not be achieved unless such a programme appeals to the national pride and spirit of the Australian people. I am a great believer in the League of Nations and its future usefulness. I am hopeful that some day it will be a great factor in keeping the peace of the world. However, with three such great nations as the United States of America, Germany; and Russia outside its fold, it cannot be that great factor in the maintenance of the world's peace that we are all hopeful it will ultimately be.

107,Mr J. Francis,"If we do nofcSpeakingi n Sydney recently, in reference to our Navy, the Minister for Defence saidIn 1921 we had 21 vessels in commission, and to-day we have only 12. As to effective fighting ships, we had a battle cruiser, 3 light cruisers, 7 destroyers, and 6 submarines. Of these 17 vessels we have now only 6. That official statement shows the necessity for immediate action. every one in Australia is f u l l y seized w i th the necessity for prudent action, consistent with our limited population and financial resouroes, to ensure the maximum of defence for this country, and I trust that the Government will lose no time in pushing ahead with its naval construction programme. In 1910, when the British Empire had a twopower naval standard, the late Lord Kitchener, in his report on the defences of Australia, saidIt is an axiom held by the British Government that the Empire's existence depends primarily upon the maintenance of adequate and efficient naval forces. As long as this condition is fulfilled, and as long as the British superiority at sea is assured, then it is an accepted principle that no British dominion can be successfully and permanently conquered by on organized invasion from oversea. Buti n applying that principle to Australia, Lord Kitchener remarked that considerations of time and space could nob be disregarded. He showed that the concentration of force in one theatre might be compulsory for the Navy, that in other seas British naval forces might remain for a time inferior to those of an enemy, and that some time might elapse before the command of these seas could be assured. Now that we have to accept a one-power naval standard, this possibility is even more real. Lord Kitchener also said that it was the duty of all self-governing dominions to provide a military force .adequate to deal promptly with any attempt at invasion, and thus to ensure local safety and publio confidence u n t il the command of the sea had been decisively and compreHe points out, further, that the provision hensively asserted. imperative is the need for suoh a milinon-commissioned officers at courses tary force to-day?

In 1921 the necessary, through lack of funds, to rescheme of training was re-organized in fuse the applications of many officers the hght of the experience gained in the and nou-commissioned officers to attend Great War. Under the new scheme, the Army was to consist of five infantry and two cavalry divisions, complete in every auxiliary arm. That plan has been so interfered with that it leaves us with a mere skeleton of an army. L e t me give the House the statement of the In spector-General of our forces , SirH . G. 1 Chauvel, regarding the present condition I feel sure that of our citizen army"" The military board has had to reduce defence measures to a nucleus basis owing to financial stringency and the result of the Washington Conference. The present nucleus numbers 37,658, which in the event of war will have to. be expanded, to an army of 140,000. Of the 37,658, some 31,000 are boys of 18 and 19 years, and they only receive ten days' training a year for two years. He also statedThe upkeep of the establishment of officers and non-commissioned officers is the most serious problem of the system, and upon this the short period of training, has a very direct bearing, for it must be remembered that the effectiveness of the forces as a nucleus will depend very largely upon the Capacity of the omcers and non-commissioiied omcers to assume control of, and to instruct, the large influx of recruits required, on mobilization, to complete the various units to war establishment. Notwithstanding the progress of which the trainee is capable, the limited period does not, and never will, enable the instruction of therank and file to proceed beyond the elementary stages^ for the reason that each year exactly half of those to be instructed are raw recruits and tbe remaining half little more. It fails in consequence to sustain the interest of actual officers, or to create it amongst the potential offioers and non-commissioned officers now serving in the ranks. A considerable number of the officers of tbe late A.I.F. have continued to serve, and to these, in a very great measure, is due the progress already made. Under present, conditions it is becoming increasingly difficult to retain their enthusiasm, and in many cases it is only their spirit of patriotism In his report, and loyalty which keeps them with tlieir units. Except in certain technical units, thei'e is no alacrity on the part of potential leaders to accept eitlier commissioned or non-commissioned rank, or, if tliey do accept the latter, to continue to serve after their period of compulsory training has passed. How much more of funds for the training of officers and schools of instruction.' Is this not, in effect, striking a crushing blow at the very basis of the present nucleus system? Sir Harry Chauvel also statedOur nucleus army is 700 officers sliort of the establishment, and the shortage in non-commissioned omcers (the potential omcers of the future) is proportionately much greater. From that statement it is clear that the present con^ion of our forces is far from satisfactory. I was actively associated with our citizen army from 1912 until I was elected to represent the constituency of Moreton in this House. From my experience and recent investigation I am satisfied that the way the defence system of Australia has of necessity been carried on of late is disheartening to all who are connected with it, and is very materially lowering the standard of efficiency. I read recently in a Melbourne journal the following reference to the present conditions of our compulsory training system, which I think summarizes the position well:An efficient compulsory system has the effect of impressing upon the Australian youth the fact that he is individually responsible for the defence of his country. Obviously, the moral argument holds good only if the system is efficient. As at present carried on it is far designed specifically to prepare them for more likely to demoralize boys than to inspire them with healthy patriotism. Training under conditions which teach next to nothing, and impress the trainees with its waste and futility, can only have an exceedingly bad effect on all intelligent minds. Waste, inefficiency, and discontent are inevitable when we have such a lack of continuity in our defence policy. remind the House of the sound warning given us by the late Lord Kitchener, in the report I have already referred to: It must be distinctly recognized that a national force maintained at ;a high standard of efficiency can only be produced by the work of years, and that such work must be steady and continuous; any divergence irom the policy decided on may, and probably will, lead to chaos and useless expenditure of money. I hope that the new defence proposals of the Governinent, which are to cover a period of training of at least five years, will provide for effect being given in their entirety to the recommendations of the Inspector-General of our forces to remedy the obvious defects in our system of training. the period of training should be increased from two to three years, and that there Mr J. Francis. should be an increase in the annual period from ten to twelve days, the extra' two days being added to the continuous training. Concurrently with the increase in the citizen force training to three years, the senior cadet training should be correspondingly reduced to one year, thus leaving the total period of service the same as at present. Senior cadet training would then begin in the trainee's seventeenth year, and would continue for one year only before his transfer to the Citizen Forces. Lieutenant-General Chauvel points out that this would have the effect of reducing the strength of the senior cadet organization by one-half,' and would enable it to be handled by the area staff with a minimum of outside assistance. The one year of preparatory training in the senior cadets would be devoted to the establishment of touch between the trainees and their area staff and units, medical examinations, issue of clothing, and other administrative work, and to ascertaining the suitability of the youths for allotment to the several arms of tlrje Citizen Forces. In addition, there would be time to give the senior cadets a limited amount of recruit drill and elementary musketry instruction, their Citizen Force training. He also points out that a reduction in cost would result, particularly in regard to uniforms. If youths were supplied with uniforms at seventeen years of age, when they were more developed physically, their outfit would not require to be replaced during I the remainder of their service in so many instances as at present, when the issue takes place at the age of sixteen years. I should like to see greater care exercised in the selection and fitting of uniforms: A trainee never will have any regard for his unit, or respect for the uniform, while he is compelled to parade in the ill-fitting and unsightly clothes one too often sees. By cutting off one year's training at the commencement of the trainee's service and putting it on at the end, when he is better fitted, by reason of his age, to be exercised fully in military work, together with the' appropriation of the necessary funds to enable training to be satisfactorily carried on, we shall, I feel sure, place our whole military organization With him, I believe that on a sounder basis, and, while giving greater satisfaction to all ranks, ensure a much, better return for the money expended. The importance of air defence cannot be over-estimated. Yet our air defences are hopelessly weak. quate air force cannot be improvised when we are threatened with attack, and it will always be difficult to maintain, even in time of peace. can hope to do is to for m a nucleus service, which can be readily expanded in time of war. However, unlike our defence system, this nucleus must be-given every possible opportunity to become efficient. It should also be developed in co-operation w it h civil aviation. Happily, civil aviation is rapidly gathering strength in Australia, and it w ill , I hope, continue to develop. effort that w ill have to be made by Australia, if she ultimately is to have an adequate air force, may be gathered from the finding of the American Aviation Commission, whose report presented to Congress since the war contained the f o l lowing :(a) That any future war will inevitably open with great aerial activity in advance of contact, either upon land or sea, and that victory cannot but incline to that belligerent able first to achieve, and later to maintain, its supremacy in the air. (b) That no sudden creation of aerial equipment to meet a national emergency already at hand is possible. It has been proved within the experience of every nation engaged in the war that two years or more of high pressure effort has been .needed to achieve the quantity production of aircraft, aircraft engines, and accessory equipment. The training of personnel, including engineering, production, inspection, maintenance, and operating forcescovering some 50 distinct trades and some 75 industries-ha s proved itself a stupendous task when undertaken upon the basis of war emergency alone. (c) That for economic reasons no nation can hope in peace time to maintain air forces adequate to its defensive needs except through the erection of a great reserve and personnel, material, -and producing industry; through the encouragement of civil aeronautics, commercial aviation and transportation development must be made to carry the financial load. Enough has been said to show the magnitude of the task by which the Government is confronted, and the urgent need for commencing this work in all its departments. air force, I should like to add my tribute to the splendid success of the great flight round Australia by Wing-Commander Goble and Flight-Lieutenant Mclntyre. By this exploit they have added yet another wonderful achievement to the already splendid record of our flying services. An adeAs a Queensland member, I wish to congratulate the Ministerf o r Defence on the provision which is now being made for the immediate commencement The best we' of the survey of the Great Barrier Reef. A t a meeting of the pan-Pacific Congress held in Melbourne in August last, thc following resolution was carried:That, in view of the scientific and economic interest attached to the Queensland coastal waters within theBarrier Reef regions, the Government of the Commonwealth is specially urged to undertake a detailed hydrographic survey of this area at the earliest possible moment, and to make available funds The tremendous and facilities to. enable the Navy Department to carry out the work without delay. I am particularly glad that they are giving effect to that resolution, and to many similar ones, carried throughout Australia on this most important subject. The Great Barrier Reef extends for more than 1,200 miles along the eastern coast of Queensland. Vessels bound for the East Indies or the China Sea proceed northward between the Barrier Reef and the coast, through what is known as the Inner Channel. Charts of the reef still bear the inscription, "" Soundings and reefs by Captain Flinders."" Such charts must necessarily be hopelessly incomplete. A further instance of their incompleteness is furnished by the fact that a few months ago H . M . A . S . Fantome reported three uncharted shoals at 19 feet and 23 feet in the Hillsborough Channel, where a depth of 13 fathoms is shown on the charts. L it t l e is known of the direction and set of currents in the vicinity of the reef, and in addition navigators on the east coast are exposed to special dangers from hurricanes and other conditions not experienced in other parts of Australia. Storms cannot be controlled, but it is within human power to give' the sailor reliable; charts and clear sailing directions. His anxiety would then be lessened, and in all probability the sacrifice of many lives would be avoided.

108,Mr Mcneil L (Wannon) [8.18],"Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) is a reasonable one, and should be accepted by the Government. Throughout the world to-day statesmen, writers, and thinkers are expressing a strong desire for universal peace,, and members of the Opposition contend that in these circumstances the construction of the two cruisers should be postponed for at least a few months. We do not know what agreement may soon be reached by the nations of the world regarding the l i m i tation of naval armaments.

Although honourable members opposite are extremely anxious to put their defence policy into operation, they have abandoned two important aids to defence. They have abolished the harness and saddlery factory, which served a very usef u l purpose during the war, and they have sold the Commonwealth woollen mills. .

It would be stupid for members on this or the government side of the House to say that Australia should not have a defence policy. No man would be so foolish as to say that Australia could do without a defence policy. While we are extremely fortunate in our isolation, in being many thousands of miles from the warring nations of the world, the fact remains that, with modern weapon* of warfare, w it h aeroplanes and poison gases, and the latest inventions of scientists,, anything may happen to us.

But in the very first sentence he says that the defence of Australia was primarily a naval problem.

Honourable members cannot charge the Government with taking this action before consulting eminent author it y .

The honourable member for Bourke( Mr. Anstey) says that it is essential that our air force shall be so developed that it will be. able to fly over this country, and. there will be no necessity for it to go round it . We have established in Australia to-day the longest cross-country air service in the British Empire. That service has been maintained without an accident for over twelve months.

I say further that that is the primary object for which the federation was established. members wil l recollect that for 40 years in this country we were talking federation.

In 1898 that Constitution was put to the people, bufc was not carried by a sufficient majority in New South Wales.

That country has been and is observing every treaty and contract it has made, but the Japanese de not on that account say that they w ill have no defence. Japan to-day is spending at least 42 per cent, of the whole of its revenue on defence. This is in a time of peace, and w i th only peaceful neighbours! If we under similar circumstances proposed expenditure at the same rate, we should be proposing in this £2,500,000 , but something more like £25,000,000. We do not ask Japan, in view of her warlike expenditure, whether she is going to strike at Australia. We recognize that it is not merely fche right bufc the duty of every nation to preserve its integrity, and to make its own arrangements for its defence.

119,Mr Bowden,"Whethe r we can orI ( Mr Bowden) upon his speech, and thank him for the well-deserved remarks concerning the Acting Leader of the Opposition. about this bill, and particularly about the attitude of Japan in relation to naval armaments, to which some honourable members have referred. Eifty years ago Japan was in the stage that Europe was in during the Middle Ages. Bows, arrows, and plated armour were then her war equipment, but now she is right up to date. adoption of ironclad battleships she has possessed the strongest vessel afloat. Two years ago the Renown, which is now regarded by naval authorities as not in the front rank of war vessels, was anchored at Yokohama close to the strongest vessel then afloat-and it was built in Japan. Although Australia has inherited all the advantages of our western civilization, she has not yet built a big battleship. We shall never be able to do our own work if we follow the advice given to us by the Minister for Defence. He said just now that it was better for us to import than to make our big shells. That is always the free traders' cry. It may be all right while the highways of the sea are open. During the last war the largest battleships that the world has known had to be locked up every night at Scapa Flow because of the danger from submarines, mines, and aeroplanes. Those mighty engines of war did not dare to sail the seas as a 100-ton sloop of the days of Nelson would have done. Australia should aim at self-containment. I recognize now, as I did when I volunteered for active service during the wai:and was rejected because I was over 60 years of age-that while the human spirit remains unchanged somemeasures of defence against aggression are necessary, but I do not think that the building of two cruisers will protect Australia in any way. We shall act wisely if we adopt the suggestion made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition to reduce our war debt by £2,500,000 instead of spending that amount, in building cruisers. The total cost of Australia's war service up to the 30th June, 1922, was £439,334,293, and if the amount spent in sending comforts to the troops were added the figure would be well over compliment the Minister for Defence £500,000,000. Of that total cost, £132,338,581 has been paid out pf revenue, and £306,995,712 is still owing. Those figures are to be seen in the latest A good deal could be said Year-Book, at page 393. Who pays the interest on this huge debt? The wealthy classes in the community certainly pay some, and so do the middle classes, but it is also true that every person who drinks a cup of tea, and every child who enjoys a sweetmeat, contributes to it through the Customs duties. It is sad to reflect that even the children of the At three periods since the men who were killed in the war are obliged to assist in paying it Why do not our wealthy patriots come forward and say, "" The interest on this awful debt shall be paid by the wealthy people in the community."" Honourable members may say that £2,500,000 is not much to reduce the debt by, but we must begin somewhere. Australia has had a surplus of revenue over expenditure in every year since 1917-18, with the exception of 1918-19, when there was a deficiency of £402,703, and 1921-22, when the deficiency was £209,903. The accumulated surplus up to the end of the last financial year was over £10,000,000. A considerable part of that amount should be used to reduce the war debt, otherwise the heavy interest payments, which amount to about £20,000,000 annually; will cripple the country. The rates of interest that we are paving on this huge debt vary from 3 per cent, to 6 per cent., and the sooner we can reduce the principal the better it will be. The Government would find every party in the House supporting it if it decided to adopt such a policy. Unquestionably there is wealth enough in Australia to meet the debt. It has been> said that if a super millionaire had comein 1914 with £1,200,000,000 he could have bought the country At 30th June, 1915, it was estimated that Australia's wealth totalled £1,600,000,000, and the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) told us a week or so ago that it was now given as anything up to £3,000,000,000. We can afford to do something definite to reduce our debt, but we are not doing as much as England in that respect in proportion to our population. A press report stated a few days ago that it was estimated that the United States of America",44,Elliot Johnson Bu T That Party Used I N Time Of Peace As Well As I N Time
120,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.45],"would entirely liquidate her national debt in 30 years at her present rate of payment. How long will it take Australia to meet her obligations a.t the rate she is aeroplane.' exploration, Australia has going. spending £2,500,000 on cruisers which could do next to nothing to prevent a hostile nation from attacking us. Certainly if Japan became aggressive, they could not prevent her from occupying the country. I think, as I said as long ago as 1905, that if trouble ever arises between Australia and Japan, -it will quickly be made an issue between the east and tbe west, and all the white races will be linked up in the struggle. Germany will lead, the Teutons,; Erance, Italy,, and Spain the Latins; Russia, the Slavs; the United States of America Anglo-Saxon Celtic races. I agree with Mr George Marks, who wrote an excellent book,. Watch the Pacific, which I read recently,, that we cannot possibly hold Australia against an attack, unless our sister nations assist us. Of course, I do not agree with all Mr Marks's conclusions. Two cruisers are a ridiculous defence provision, for they, like the great battleships in the .world war, will be frightened to, sail tbe seas for fear of. submarines and aeroplanes. The aeroplane is destined to become an increasingly important factor in Australian defence. Honourable members will be interested to know that Mr Louis Brennan,, who appealed to the Victorian State Parliament years ago for help in perfecting, his. torpedo invention, has now invented an aeroplane which can poise. That is a wonderful, thing, and will be of much more service to Australia than any battleship could be. I read an interesting article in a recent American publication .which stated that battleships could have very, little hope of surviving a welldirected attack from aeroplanes. the point of view of man power, it is worth remembering that, in war by aeroplanes, the lives of comparatively few men are risked. Only two lives are endangered with each aeroplane, whereas hundreds of men will be on board every cruiser of the kind it is proposed to obtain. may operate is very limited. If we were to spend £2,500,000 in building aeroplanes, we should be able to protect AusDr. Maloney. tralia much more effectively than we can possibly do by adopting the Government's, proposal. According to the latest I cannot see any sense in 8,000 miles of coastline to patrol. One aeroplane can operate effectively over an area of 500, or even 1,000 miles, but the biggest gun used in the great war had a radius of only about 50 miles. I do not think the government of any country in the world will suggest that Australia, with her limited population, is likely to have aggressive designs on the territory of another nation. Our defence expenditure is purely and simply for our own protection. To organize effectively, we must have the most mobile force possible, and that is an air force; It could reach, and Great Britain and in a few hours, a point which it would the take a naval or military force weeks to reach. A big air force could be used for commercial purposes in time of peace, but battle cruisers are good for nothing except war. I cannot remember ever having heard of a battleship or battle cruiser being used in mercantile service. My friend, Mr King O'Malley, once suggested that when nations were at peace, battleships should be dismantled of war fittings, and reconditioned for commercial purposes, but, so far as I know, that has never been done in the world's history. With a big aviation organization we could educate our fliers in time of peace to defend the country in timeof awful war,, and then no nation, not even Japan, ceuld say that we were irritating it by building, up a big navy. By the time these cruisers are completed they will be out of date, so rapidly does invention progress. Could anybody have foreseen 30 years ago that the streets of Melbourne would be crowded with motor cars as they are to-day, or that a horse-drawn cab would become a rarity in Melbourne and Sydney. Professor Luff,, who was a stuFrom dent with me when I was doing, my medical course, was then already an eminent chemist, predicted as far back as ihe early eightiesthat within this century a meeting of chemists would become of more importance in the prevention of war than a meeting of generals.

His version of the incident is different from the generally accepted one. capacity and the active brain of the honourable member for Richmond, and if I had as many years to look forward to as he has, I might attempt to do what he suggests, but as history may not be my forte, I merely give the facts as I know them. I should be prepared to consign to a lunatic asylum any one who In the past the would claim that the battle cruiser Aus: tralia could have defended the long coastline from Brisbane to Perth. It was the Japanese fleet that helped us' to keep at a distance the German squadron, which had guns that would have enabled it to stand 20 miles off Sydney and bomb that city, or to enter Port Phillip Bay and aud I hope that a destroy Melbourne, or to destroy Perth and Adelaide. Do we not know how the German cruisers disposed of the English fleet on the western coast of South America, just as they in their turn, were disposed of and sent to a watery grave when they passed to the east coast of South America? We should approach Japan in the name of reciprocity. Japan taught the world a Those who are keenly lesson by seeking the advice of Britain's greatest philosopher, Herbert Spencer. In his letter to Marquis Ito, Herbert Certain words made use of by Spencer advised Japan to avoid entanglements with other nations through selling land to foreigners, or allowing them to take shares in Japanese companies, particularly in shipping companies trading on the Japanese coast, or permitting them On that account I to take out mining rights. By keeping foreigners at a distance, he said, Japan would be saved, but he added the following words of caution:-""Remembe r always that nations are very apt to believe what their missionaries and traders tell them."" We should approach Japan in the spirit of reciprocity, saying, "" Y o u cannot blame us if we follow your splendid example. You garnered your knowledge from our greatest philosopher. Japan We want to keep Australia for the Australians just as you want to keep Japan for the Japanese."" That is the way in which to approach the nation which acted so loyally towards the Allies in the recent war. Unfortunately for China, during that war Japan forced 21 articles upon her, despite the protests of America and other nations. The British Government did not see their way clear to make a pro-1 test at the time, but at the Washington conference, nineteen of the 21 articles which were particularly offensive to China were wiped out. On a recent visit to ChinaI had an interview with Dr.",47,Elliot Johnson Bu T That Party Used I N Time Of Peace As Well As I N Time

127,Dr. Maloney,"If I _ had theSun Yat Sen, and I alluded to the fact that at this conference the danger of war had been removed by the elimination of nineteen of the articles. He said, "" Yes, but the two points remaining are so important to Japan that unless the European nations will assist China to have them eliminated, Japan will always be able to control us. You may have seen, when you came up in the steamer, that there are three Japanese gun-boats overawing Canton. Of course, they are not here for a hostile purpose, but we know what their presence means. There are also three British gun-boats. here because some bandits have made a capture, not on the main line between Canton and Hong Kong, but on one of the feeders to that line. If Japan secures control of China, her object will be to convert China, as Germany converted Austria, into a recruiting ground for man power, and to utilize China's great coal and iron fields-the greatest in the world. With our 430,000;000 people added to her 70,000,000, Japan will thus have 500,000,000 people under her control. How easy will it be for her then to ask India to help her in securing Asia for the Asiatics, or to be led by her to the conquest of the world. 350,000,000 people in India, Japan would thus have 850,000,000 people under her to and go on fighting for ever."" That is what we nave to look forward to if China is dominated by Japan. My opinion is that Japan took those advantages in self-defence, just as she did with Eussia before the Eusso-Japanese war. I am convinced that Japan, as a loyal nation, would, if the League of Nations, or the nations at another Washington conference, asked for the elimination of those two articles, set China free, and thus possibly save the world from an awful debacle. In the defence of Australia, two cruisers, in comparison with 2,0*00 aeroplanes, would count for nothing. I have asked experienced naval officers how they would like to approach a country like Australia with transports carrying an army of 30,000 men, and to face 200 hostile aeroplanes. They told me that in those circumstances they would prefer to be on a submersible instead of on a . surface vessel. Instead of quoting great authorities like Jackie Eisher. and Admiral Scott, I ask honourable members to look at the illustrated periodicals published in America to see the results there of the Washington Treaty. In the advance of armament and invention, the leading men of the army and navy of the day have always been against innovations. I ask those who doubt this to go back to the time when "" Brown Bess"" was discarded for the rifle. All the great experts of the United Kingdom were against the use of the rifle. Naval experts were opposed to the first proposal They are to armour ships. When a French ship engaged in the Crimean war hung huge chain cables over her sides for protection from land bombardment, the ""experts said it was a ridiculous action. When the Merrimac, during the American civil war, was armoured with iron plates, experts said that that expedient would answer only for a little time. That view was dispelled when the Monitor, a small armoured vessel, built by Ericcson, the Scandinavian genius, fought and sank the Merrimac. To gain a f u l l knowledge of the evolution of the ironclad, we must go back in history 200 years to Formosa. The records in the Parliamentary Library As there are will show that the remains of the original ironclad of Formosa were dug out from the sands 25 years ago. Two centuries leadership, and could afford ago, Japan proposed to invade Formosa lose 20,000,000 every year with an army of 200,000 men. The annals pf Japan, agree with those of Formosa that the ironclad rode down the Japanese fleet ship after ship, as the old Roman ships of war rode down those of the Carthagenians, thus preventing Japan from transporting her army. There is therefore reason to doubt the opinions of experts, and I prefer to accept the opinion of a man like Brennan, the inventor, against that of any naval or military expert. The Renown, when visiting Australia, was one of the very latest of English warships; but .before completing her tour, she was ready for the scrap-heap, or for alteration to make her a mother ship for aeroplanes. If the proposed two cruisers are built, they will be obsolete in three years. I protest against the spending of this money; but if it is to be spent, then by all means build the cruisers in Australia. Let our Australian tradesmen learn how to make war vessels. They will never learn how to do : it if workmen are imported from another country for this purpose. iWe should build up our steel.. and iron manufactories to enable us to make our own war appliances. ships, even England herself had to import certain metal alloys for plate-making. Let us follow her example and import the alloys we require. England will surely not refuse one of her own children the formula for plate making to enable Australians to carry out the work of naval construction. I know of one man who, in the manufacture of clothing, has had experience in Switzerland, the United States .of America, England, and Australia, and he assures me that he has never met better workmen than Austravesters, makes the same statement. Why cannot Australia do everything that Japan does? In 60 years that nation has become a. great manufacturing country. It"" is time that we put our house in order. T shall certainly ob ject to the building of Australian .cruisers in England, not that I have lost my love for the Homeland, .but because it is necessary that we, the -descendants of the British race, with all its inherited instincts and power, should -follow its example. America is very little colder than Australia, and what she has Idone surely -we;can do,. I hope that the Minister will give proper-consideration to the amendment moved by. the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and, In the interests-.of Australia, accept it. I find it difficult to believe that the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) will Have the unanimous support Of honourable members opposite. Every one who listened carefully to, or has read, the measured words of the Prime Minister when introducing this bill,.must have been greatly impressed with the importance of the question of defence. The preservation of peace and the declaration of war are major acts of policy, and a proposal of the kind now before us should not be treated in a spirit of caprice. A solemn responsibility to the states and the people of Australia rests upon the Federal Parliament, making it incumbent upon us to treat the question of defence not as a party matter but as a national problem. Party politics should find no place in the discussion of defence. Its petty pressures and activities should not influence the consideration of the subject. The preservation of peace and the undertaking In constructing battleof a war are essentially matters of general public policy. The armed forces of a country are the means by which it hopes and expects to maintain its integrity, and we must notj therefore, allow our defence arrangements to depend upon some minor consideration of finance. It is essential in order to arrive at a true basis for the maintenance of armed forces that we should review our position both 'strategically and politically, and I venture to assert that if that is done it will at once be found that our defence requirements exceed our capacity to provide adequately for them. Therefore, we have to seek outside aid, and it is fortunate for us that so far aid from the Mother Country has always been forthcoming. But we have not now that sense of security we previously enjoyed. Circumstances have entirely changed during recent years, and speaking as one who has had some experience of war and war measures, I feel bound to say that I cannot conceive of a situation in Europe which would permit the vessels of the Royal navy to carry on a major engagement in the Pacific. Even if the naval forces required for such an -engagement were available, I cannot see how any action could be successful with. out bases and other necessary facilities. state of the House. [Quorum formed.'] bers are, of course, aware of the incidents associated with the ill-fated voyage of . Admiral Rojestvensky, who during the Russo-Japanese War twenty years ago, when in command of the Russian fleet, left the Baltic with the intention of going to Vladivostock. Very early on the voyage there was the Doggerbank incident, and throughout the voyage harassing experiences were encountered, until finally when the ships reached Eastern waters, owing to being without a base, they were compelled to coal and effect repairs at sea. Consequently, when the fleet eventually came into contact with the Japanese vessels at Tsu-Shima, its position was most precarious.

In his second-reading speech, the Prime Minister said that the first cruiser would be built in Great Britain, but he was unable to give the House definite information regarding the building of the second vessel. He stated that inquiries were being made with a view to having this' work carried out in Australia. lia manufactures her own service rifles, at a cost of approximately £16 each. We could import them for about £8 each; but, because it is realized that if we were in trouble and isolated from our friends, we should have to manufacture our own rifles, no objection is raised to the higher expenditure involved. Should the building of this cruiser in Australia place"" the Commonwealth in a position to build ships as well as she manufactures rifles, I, for one, would not object to any reasonable increase in cost and time of construction. ' Buti f , on the other hand, to build cruisers in Australia simply means the assembling here of parts manufactured in Great Britain, it is doubtful whether increased expenditure would be justified. The money could, perhaps, be used in other directions with greater advantage to the country. At the earliest possible moment the House should be taken fully into the Government's confidence regarding this important matter. T am unable to support the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), but shall vote for the second reading of the bill, ilfr. D. Cameron. The Government has done the right thing in establishing a trust fund in connection with the Defence Department. It is to be regretted that this action was not Such unproductive taken earlier. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I have had some difficulty in understanding the expenditure of the Defence Department. Even after the Estimates have been passed, providing for the expenditure of certain sums of money for definite objects, it has frequently happened that the money has not been expended. I remember that of one amount of £175,000 which was voted by Parliament, £15,000 only had been expended to the end of the year. When such a state of affairs exists, alteration The sums expended for such in the administration of a department is desirable. Some honourable members have stated that we on this side are not in favour of defending Australia. Yet the Labour party is the only party which has done anything practical towards the defence of this country. There has been no departure from the original policy of the party in this connection. Before the next election that policy will be presented to the people of Australia, Austraand I venture to say that it will meet with their approval. When the Labour party proposed to build a fleet for Australia, Sir Joseph Cook, now the High Commissioner in London, and a few of his supporters in this House, proposed as an alternative that we should offer a Dreadnought to Great Britain. As a good Australian, I did my best' at the time to prevent that being done, and advocated that the vessels for the protection of Australia should be owned and controlled by Australians. I have yet to learn that this parfcy has departed from that policy. We come now to the proposed construction of the cruisers. It is depressing that, in this national Parliament, we should be called upon to consider proposals for the construction of these instruments to destroy human life. It should be our endeavour to bring about a better feeling among the nations of the world. The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) made reference to the League of Nations.

The committee baa endeavoured to show that Australia can become self-contained, and honorable members will be able to see from the report that there is very little in the way of munitions that cannot be produced in this country. A factory has been prepared, and machinery has been ordered, to produce 4^-inch guns, and miachinery is on the way for the production of 18-pounder shells. The small arms factory at Lithgow is now able to manufacture machine-guns. The whole of the ammunition required by the Defence Department is capable of being manufactured in Australia.

I have, sat on many committees; and I feel proud of my association w it h The Great the men who. brought to theconsideration of this report so much, zeal and earnestness.

It will be noted that the expression used was "" pick,""> not "" pack."" 2. The Administrator has heard no comment or' expression of public resentment, nor has any been conveyed to the Minister. 3. See answer to No. 1. The third question has not yet heen answered. I admit that the word "" p i c k "" should have heen used instead of "" pack,"" but I claim that that is a distinction without a difference. These statements of the judge were made in the case of Storey v. Quelch. to that case, the secretary was involved in another, and this is what the judge said on that occasion:As the Government was prosecutor before the board, it was most improper that be should have influenced the Administrator in the appointment of the board. If the Administrator could not have selected tlie board without Mr Storey's help, he might have counteracted the prosecutor's influence by consulting the applicant as to whether the persons suggested by the Government Secretary were, iu her opinion, fair and impartial. The opportunity which the Government Secretary seems to have had to do what might be termed "" packing the bench,"" lends a sinister aspect to the whole of the proceedings of the board. Not only should the judiciary be f a i r and impartial, but those qualities should be apparent to the public. Are such statements by a judge conducive to that feeling of security to which the inhabitants of the Northern Territory are entitled? I ask the Minister whether he is aware that the costs in the hospital case, which the Supreme Court ordered Charles Barnett Storey to pay, have been paid out of the taxpayers' money. amounted to £10 10s. As the judge in his judgment in that case made strong comments on Storey's attempts to pack and dominate the board of inquiry, does the Minister consider it f a i r that public moneys should be so expended ?

A t this hour I do not intend to keep honourable members for more than a few minutes. I wish .to bring under the Immediately prior notice of the Government certain statements appearing in the Brisbane press regarding excessive overtime worked by Commonwealth Bank employees in Brisbane without overtime payment or teamoney. The matter was submitted to me w i th the request that I should bring it under the notice of the Minister concerned. This not only concerns Brisbane employees, but those in other branches of the bank throughout Australia. On the 10th iiist. I asked the following questions of the Treasurer:1. Is it a fact that overtime is being worked by employees of the Commonwealth Bank in Brisbane without overtime payment or teamoney? 2. Isi t a fact that these employees worked 130 hours in two weeks? 3. Will he take whatever steps he deems necessary to see that these employees are paid at overtime rates for all overtime worked by them? Unfortunately, owing to a printer's error, the word "" bank "" was l e f t out after the word -"" Commonwealth,"" and consequently the Minister was not able to answer my questions as I desired. I based Those costs those questions on the following extracts from the Brisbane Daily Standard'under the headings "" Excessive overtime alleged -Charg e that 130 hours in two weeks were Worked by the Commonwealth Bank employees. No overtime paid, nor tea money."" To be forced to work Over a spread of 65 hours a week, with time off for meals, but without any extra payment, for two or three 1 weeks consecutively, is a startling state of affairs which might well be considered impossible in Brisbane to-day.

The immediate cause of this overtime work is the half-yearly balance, although the ordiThese extracts show that employees of the nary trading banks during the same strenuous period only exceed the customary working time by a very few hours. The Commonwealth Bank employees feel that they have a grievance. They formed, in Queensland, what is known as the Queensland branch of the United Bank Officers' Association Commonwealth Bank branch. antagonism has been shown to the formation of this branch by Mr Kell, the acting governor of the bank. Just after the branch was formed in Brisbane, a high official of the bank arrived there, convened a meeting of Commonwealth Bank employees and suggested to them that they should refrain from joining the association, and should instead form a guild of employees within the service of the bank. The Commonwealth Bank employees feel that they cannot secure justice unless they are linked up with the United Bank Officers' Association. Acting Governor, Mr Kell, a log of claims in regard to working hours. This should have been replied to by the 30th June, but as no reply has been received by the association they are now taking steps to have their claims settled by arbitration, either before the Public Service Arbitrator or in the Federal Arbitration Court. I should like to refer honourable members to an extract from another Brisbane newspaper to confirm the statements made by the bank's employees. This newspaper published the following statement:A number of conditions of. employment of the Commonwealth Bank ofncials in Queensland are considered by the employees to be hartime every night in the week. assing and unfair, and consequently considerable dissatisfaction exists.

I do not believe that honourable members will stand for employees of an institution established by this Parliament being worked for 130 hours in two weeks without overtime payment or tea money. I am told that . strong That is a disgraceful state of things, and, further, there should not be this vicitmization of men courageous enough to form amongst their fellow-workers a branch of the United Bank Officers' Association. I ask the Government to inquire into the matter immediately to see whether the statements which have appeared in the press are true, and, if they are, to take up the question with the Acting Governor of the Commonwealth Bank with a view to having the grievances of the employees of the bank justly considered and fittingly remedied. Recently they lodged with the I can endorse everything that has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde). The first quarrel I had with the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Denison Miller, occurred when he was asked by Mr Higgs, the then Treasurer, to meet me. He said definitely that he would not pay for overtime, and would not even give tea money to those who worked overtime. I pointed out to him that in the service of the least desirable banking company in Melbourne tea money was given where employees were asked to work overtime for only one night in a week. Sir Denison Miller would not give tea money, even though his employees were worked overI ascertained that that was the rule obby visiting branches of the institution in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. sured me that, as far as he could possibly Mr Kell is continuing the practice inonly to say that it is iniquitous and",55,Adjournment Northe Rn Territory Judiciary Com
