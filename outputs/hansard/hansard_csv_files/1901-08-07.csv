Minister, in reference to a statement made by him at Ballarat on Monday night last, if he will inform the House what steps, if any, have been taken in regard to the vesting of the administration of New Guinea in the Commonwealth. If any steps have been taken, what are the reasons for the course adopted, and have the Imperial authorities been communicated with on the matter ? definite steps have yet been taken, but the matter has been tbe subject of communication with the Government of Queensland, and of consideration amongst Ministers. The position is this-if honourable members. think it interesting to hear a few of the facts bearing on the question : Under an agreement, the result of tlie Imperial Conference of 1887, the administration of British New Guinea was intrusted to the Government of Queensland, with the condition that, in matters beyond ordinary matters of administration, the States of Victoria and New contribufcories towards tlie cost, should be consulted. A.n administration fund of £15,000 a year was established, to which the three States contributed in equal parts. There was a further contribution towards tbe up-keep of a steam-ship, and, I think, of a couple of steam launches, which was maintained for a time by the Imperial Government; but when it ceased, the £15,000 a year contributed by New South Wales, toria was increased to something over £20,000 a year-sa y £^2,000 a year. In 1898 the original agreement expired, but there had been collected in New Guinea, from its ordinary revenue, a fund called "" The Accumulated Revenue Fund,"" which, when tbe contributions from the States ceased, was applied towards the cost of the administration of tbe Government there. Unfortunately, however, in the absence of contributions from the States, that fund became more than exhausted, and provision was made, either at the beginning or in the middle of this year, by the three States which had formerly contributed towards the cost of administration, for finding a sum of £7,000 for the purpose. Another sum of £3,000 has yet to be .provided, and must be provided in some way or other by the 30th September. I had the opportunity of a short and friendly, but nofc a formal conversation, with the Administrator of NewI desire to ask the Prime Guinea, Mr Le Hunt, when I was last in Sydney, and from the facts I gathered then, and the papers which have been transmitted to me, I am of opinion fchat there will be considerable difficulty with regard to the administration of British New Guinea, unless the Commonwealth shortly takes the matter in band. The total sum which the Commonwealth will have to find for the administration of New Guinea will not be larger I cannot say that any than the amount formerly contributed by fche three States I'have named, and ifc is my intention, when communicating with the Imperial Government, to suggest that part of the amount should be found by them-a t least during the bookkeeping period of five years, which is the period of difficulty with regard to fche Commonwealth finance. That is as far as the matter has gone. Ministers are at one with me in the attitude which we have taken on the subject, and I , am now on the point of opening up communications with the I m perial Government, the Government of South Wales, which also were Queensland, and the Governments of the two other States which in . the past have contributed, so that we may arrive at some reasonable proposal in regard to the administration of New Guinea. I am not, however, disposed to act in this matter-eve n if it were rightfcodo so, and it is nofc-withou t the authorization of Parliament, and any proposition which the Government have to make on the subject will be duly laid before both Houses offchisParliament. The finanQueensland, and Viccial burden does not seem to be likely to be a large one. In tbe first instance £15,000, and afterwards £20,000 a year, was found by New Soufch Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, and if that amount were found by the whole Commonwealth, the expenditure per head would be less than the expenditure per head on fche population of the three States named. The main question of policy for this Parliament to decide will be, whether it is right to cause to be handed over to us, ifpossible, tbe administration of British territory in New Guinea. I would add one more word about a group of islands which",14,Petitions

I have nothing like as much information with regard to them as I have with regard to New Guinea; but it seems to us that if preliminaries can be reasonably arranged, and the burden of the Commonwealtli not unduly increased, it might be a desirable thing that we should acquire .the control of tlie Solomon Islands so far as they are in British bands, eitheras an adjunct to New Guinea and part of the same territory, or as another territory ' of the Commonwealth. That, however, is a matter to be decided by circumstances. Honourable members will see without my addressing any argument to them, that the matter presents very grave grounds for consideration in relation to the many questions which press upon the Commonwealth with regard to, not only the Pacific Islands, but also' the conditions of its own industry, and that it is eminently a matter which cannot be settled by ' the administrationalone, but must await their proper consultation of this Parliament. will not ask the Imperial Government to make any contribution.

24,Mr Barton,"I m o v eon this broader question has in some of them not yet arrived, but yet I believe that an immense majority of the people of Australia, not only taking the Commonwealth as one, but in each State separately, are in favour of dealing with this question in such a way that a uniform law may reap its natural and legitimate advantage of prevailing universally throughout the Commonwealth, so that leakages, which can now take place in one quarter notwithstanding strong legislation in another, may no longer be peraiitted to take place. To indicate what has taken place in the various States, I will give a few particulars ; but I will preface these by stating what has beeu done in Natal. A t the present moment I am going to confine myself to the main features of the Rill which are contained in clause 4 which, in reference to prohibited immigrants really concentrates the main purposes of the Billi n the first sub-clause. The first part of the clause provides :The immigration intofcheCommon wealth of the "" graphs of this section (hereinafter called "" prohibited immigrants "" is prohibited, namely :(ct) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out and sign in fche presence of the officer, a passage knows that if an officer could call upon of 50 words in length infcheEnglish any proposing immigrant to write 50 words lungnnge dictated by the officer ; There are further provisions dealing with select, there is no man in this Parliament persons likely to become a charge upon the who could pass such a test, and, therefore, public or charitable institutions, idiots and it cannot have that interpretation. insane persons, persons suffering from diseases of a certain character, persons who have been convicted of crimes involving a honourable member. certain punishment, and prostitutes or persons living on the prostitution of others. As that intention. I'said before-not , however, to tlie extent of wishing to sacrifice any of the other prointention of the law or not, I say that visionsI think the main provision of this it is quite within the competency of the Bill as concentrated in the first sub-clause colony of Natal. I have no desire to of clause 4, is tlie one about which any labour this point, ancl if honourable members battle Ave may have amongst us-if there will allow me to go on without interruption, should be any-is likely to be waged. Now, they will see that I wish to deal with this legislation of this kind, as far as the British matter in a perfectly reasonable spirit. I colonies are concerned, began, as honourable only desire to point out the legislative scope members are well aware, in Natal, and if of the provision in tlie Natal Act, not for honourable members will compare tbe prothe purpose of making any comparison in visions of the Natal Act, as I read them, favour of the present Bill, but with a view with tbe provisions in the first sub-clause of to enlighten honourable members as to what clause 4, they will see the extent of the difference between that Act and the Bill now before tliem. The provision in the where.

35,Mr Bruce Smith,"It is a pack of fictionA n HONORABLEMEMBEH -It is hypocrisyifc is necessary for him to spell properly. I can quite understand the mental attitude of certain honourable members towards a great question of this kind, when one of them interjects that it is a pack of hypocrisy and of fiction. fiction in the honourable and learned member's estimation, but, as this is justifiable legislation infcheeyes of the Government and of the bulk of honourable members of the House, we propose to proceed with it. I have stated the provisions of the law in Natal, which define a prohibited immigrant asAny person who, when asked to do so by an officer under this Act, shall fail to himself write out and sign in the characters of any language of Europe an application to the Colonial Secretary in the form set out in the schedule. I take that. to mean "" any language of Europe"" which may be selected by the officer. If the applicant fails to pass the test which is there prescribed he is a prohibited immigrant. In New South Wales the law is thatAny person who, when asked, shall fail to write in his own handwriting in some European language and sign an application to the Colonial Secretary in the form as given in the Natal Act, or in a form oE similar purport, proclaimed from time to time by the Governor, in substitution there for shall lie prohibited. In the Bill introduced into South Australia in 1898-and I merely wish to refer fco the form in which that Bill was proposed, because honourable members will recollect that it was not carried-tli e provision was thatAny person who, on being asked by an officer, .fails to write out, in the presence of such officer, ' a prohibited immigrant as "" a person other in characters of the English language a, passage of fifty words taken by the officer from a South Australian Statute or an English authorI do not know what reason prompted that discri m inationAnd append his name in his own language, shall be a prohibited immigrant. The Victorian Act of 1899 contained a provision similar to the New South Wales law, except that the Commissioner of Customs was substituted for the Governor. honourable gentleman will have a copy of the provisions taken from other Acts printed and circulated ? going to ask the House to proceed with the discussion on the second reading of the B ill I do nofc know whether immediately. I will see that honourable members get the fullest information before the debate proceeds. able gentleman have them printed in the form of parallel clauses? in the way that is best calculated to afford It may be a pack of information to the House. I will not pledge myself to parallels. In Western Australia in 1897, an Act was passed which set out that a prohibited immigrant should includeAny person who, when asked to do so, fails to write out, in the characters of any language of Europe, a passage 'in English of fifty words in length, taken by the officer from a British author, and append his name in his own language. Honourable members will see, therefore, that in some statutes, the words "" any language of Europe"" are used, whilst in others, the words employed are "" some language of Europe."" I am quite willing to follow my honourable friends opposite in agreeing that, in both cases, "" some language of Europe"" was understood. In the Bill, which did not pass in Soufch Australia, the English language was tbe term used, whilst in the Western Australian Act, the words, "" a passage in English of 50 words in length,"" were used. The Tasmanian Act describes a prohibited immigrant asA113' person who, on being asked, shall fail to write in the presence of the officer (a collector of Customs) in some European language and sign an application to the Colonial Secretary in the form us given in the Natal Act, or in a form of similar purport proclaimed from time to time by the Governor in substitution there for. The New South WalesA c t of 1899 describes than of British birth or parentage, who when asked, &a., shall fail to write out in any European language ""-of which a form is given in the schedule, although it may be changed as is provided for a certain number of words. The Act also provides that "" An y person dissatisfied with the decision of the officer may appeal fco the nearest stipendiary magistrate, whose decision is final."" Where this Bill differs from some of the.othersI think from all the right is that tbe person who is to be examined by the officer must have the passage dictated to him by that officer. This provision is inserted in order that there may be no mistake I will, but I am not on fche part of the officer as tofchepassage tendered to the person for his writing out.",18,Immigration Restrictio Nbill Second Reading

I did uot mean to suggest that he should putdown the words which are to be asked. I referred to the character of tlie literature-sa y 50 words from tbe leading article, of a daily newspaper. to do that. The administration in this respect of the Bill will be within the discretion of the Minister. He will have it within his discretion to change the passage to be submitted in sucli a way as to prevent the possibility of any collusion or of any attempt to learn off a passage when the applicant knows no more of English than is contained in that passage. The chief difference between this Bill and the provisions of the Acts to which I have referred is that the English language is indispensable, and the words must be dictated by the officer. I have had no hesitation in regard to making tlie English language indispensable. I do not see what claim there is on tbe part of any one seeking admission, who may be undesirable, to choose the language in which his test shall be taken. Subject to any objection which may arise on the ground of international comity, it is firmly established by the well-known case of Musgrove and Chun Teong Toy-if it needed to be established -that there is a right on the part of governments and powers as between each other-and the whole of the British Empire is looked upon by foreign nations as one power-to exclude such persons from their territory as seem rfco them undesirable. Mr G-. B. EDWARDS -What about the French Canadians ? ber will give me a little time he will see that I shall deal conclusively with questions of that kind. That right exists ,on the part of civilized powers inter se. We propose, however, not to rest on that niere right, because discrimination in the application of it is likely to lead to trouble. We propose, therefore, to add to the sanction of international law the sanction of what is called municipal law-that is our own internal law to anextent which I do not propose to do will enable us to meet any objection 'of this kind, and at the same time to satisfy conditions laid down by the Empirei n its dealings with other powers. In other words, having seen that there are difficulties in tlie application of The right honourable this doctrine from time to time-that its application, as a matter of international righfc has led to objections on the ground of a violation .of international comity or cour-r tesy-w e see no reason why we should, not ebnvert this into an equal law, applying, so far as the power given to us is concerned, equally to all persons, without distinction of . race, colour, or origin, in order that in our dealing with the law ourselves, subject to our own responsibilities to eaeli other, we shall not be subject to interference by any power whatever. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN That is fcbe whole point of a Bill of this kind. all Bills of this k in d ; honourable members will see that sucli Bills on the subject as have been passed, crystallizing into law powers of this kind, have not been subject to any objection on the part of the Imperial authorities, nor have they been made the subject of any protest by powers outsid.e. Ifc is because the Bills have been based on the educational test that objections have been avoided. The moment we begin to. define-the moment we begin to say that every one of a certain nationality or colour shall be restricted, while other persons are not, then as between civilized powers, amongst whom musfc now be counted Japan, we are liable to trouble and objection, which go to postpone the making of our laws and which lead to difficulty i u tbe application of tliem. These things should -therefore be avoided. I am fain to confess that I see no other way except to give a large discretionary power to tlie authorities in charge of the administration of such a measure.

Sir Henry Parkes' Bill dealt with the Chinese alone. defiance of the Imperial authorities.' of the Imperial authorities, because I am credibly informed that the Royal assent to that Bill was asked for by telegraph and given. There was never any intention on the part of Sir Henry Parkes to practically defy the Imperial authorities, although on one occasion he delivered himself under circumstances of provocation of heated words, which I am sure wereno part of his political character. We are in this position : As to the undesirableness of certain, classes of immigrants, I suppose we are all practically agreed. I suppose we are all agreed that this is an evil in itself even more carefully to be watched than that other serious question of the importation of South Sea Islanders into Queensland. Unlessthis importation be watched with the utmost care, I am convinced that become even a greater evil. Without desiring to go to any unnecessary extreme in this matter, I think it is right we should crystallize into this law the powers which internationally we absolutely have-power s which any other nation can exercise against us if fchey choose-in order that in the wise exercise of administration, without leading to any breach of international comity or to any. complications, we may lay down conditions which do not discriminate between country and country, between race and race, or between origin and origin, but which, at the same time, gives us powerfcoexercise a wise discretion in admitting or refusing to admit immigrants whom all Australia has practically agreed shall not enter within her bounds. That is the. position of fchis main provision of the Bill. I might quote from a despatch from fche Secretary of State which puts the position of the Imperial Government beyond all doubt.

An Honorable MBMBER -The case is of no value. or not we have put this Bill into a shape which makes similar objections impossible.

58,Introducing. I N This Despatch Mr Chamber,"basis of sueh distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire. Disqualification by educational tests Such as are embodied in the immigration laws of various colonies, is not a measure to which the Government of Japan or any other Government can take exception in behalf of its subjects ; and if the particular tests are not regarded as sufficiently stringent, there is no reason why more stringent and effective ones of a similar character should not be adopted. But disqualification for certain employments on the sole ground of place of origin is a measure to which any Government concerned may reasonably object, and in the present Bill the aboriginal natives of two continents and of the Pacific Islands are disqualified solely on that ground. I quote that merely to show that there are difficulties which have arisen on other occasions, and which might arise in this Bill in another form, but which are avoided by the Bill as it stands. have the despatch printed ? objection. statement on the subject made by the Attorney-General of Queensland.. some time ago I gave the substance of this despatch to the press representatives in Melbourne. statement made by Mr Chamberlain in the House of Commons. a remarkable similarity to it ; our memories are different. The passage I have quoted will show honourable members that a certain stand-point may be taken with reference to legislation of this kind if precautions are not observed,and yet it will show how easy, it is to avoid difficulties of the kind by adopting the care which Mr Chamberlain himself appears to have indicated as proper in bis despatch. That is the course we have adopted, although not claiming any originality in the provisions of this Bill. We have had plenty of other Bills to guide us. We do not pretend to say that we have evolved something extraordinary or something particularly novel. I wish to lay ifc before honourable members, however, that there is a direction which has. proved f u t i l e ; that there is another which has proved successful, and that it is the successful direction which we are pursuing, not claiming any merit for it , but simply adopting it because it is the tmly road to similar success for ourselves. information as to the success of fche restriction Acts in Natal and New South Wales1 honourable member for the interjection, for it enables me to quote from an interesting conversation which I had with Mr Moor, who represented Natal at the celebrations in connection with the inauguration of the Commonwealth. Mr Moor told me that the NatalA c t had been successful, but he said it had been adopted too late. He remarked : "" My strong advice to you is to . legislate on this subject early. We have, locked the stable door after the horse has gone out."" I suppose that the wrong horse had really come in before the stable door was locked. Honourable members will know that before legislation in Natal was passed, imported alien and coloured alien labour, quite apart from Kaffir labour, I have not the least had inflowed to such an extent that it was in an enormous majority in that countiy. It practically remains so to-day, notwithstanding thafc further influx is stopped to all intents ancl purposes. That is a lesson I might mention that to us, and it is for that reason thafc I welcome fche interjection which reminded me to put ifc before the House. It is a reason for us not to wait until dangers become almost insuperable, but to legislate against the thing, no.t because it is a pressing killing danger at the moment, but It seems to me to bear because, even if ifc is nofc, it may in a moment become so. that this legislation will stop it ? as it has stopped it elsewhere. If we find that it does not, then we shall come to the Legislature for further power. Honourable members need not have any doubt in this connection. If a measure of this kind proves ineffective in preventing the influx of that class and race of persons who ought to be kept without the limits of a white-Australia or a civilized Commonwealth, then we are not going to rest upon failure, but .march forward to success. Honourable members, in whatever part of the House they sit, may take it as being one certainty that, if we remain in office and find a measure of this kind effective, we shall bring down legislation which will make it thoroughly effective. We shall do so, not only for tlie reason* generally urged,",21,Immigration Restrictio Nbill Second Reading

These are the fears which ProasI did when a youth. There is one more fessor Pearson expresses.

77,Mr Bruce Smith,"Has the honourable visions of the Bill, some of them exist in",25,Immigration Restrictio Nbill Second Reading
78,Mr Barton,"Yes, I 'have considered within paragraph (a). But I take it thatto the soil, it is inconceivable that in a matter of this kind they are likely to frustrate or belie national interests in the exercise of the discretion vested in them. But unless the Bill is so safeguarded as to give that discretion, the particular complications which are likely to frustrate legislation of the kind are likely, to be effectuated in facts. I am not going to delay honourable members with any long description of the remaining clauses. It is provided that persons possessed of certificates of exemption, which wherever they are granted will be given for such reasons as I have laid down, will be excepted from the prohibitory provisions of clause 4. It is recognised that it would be unwise in some extreme cases to prevent the admission of certain persons. If , for instance, as we are told over and over again, a prince in his own countiy desired to visit our shores he would be exempted. We have seen such princes visiting Australia in the past. princes coming here as cricketers, as my honourable friend reminds me. There are some things which it would be high-handed and arbitrary to do. This is not a distinction between rich and poor; but a distinction belonging to humanity and civilization, and that alone should be intrusted to the Government in administering such a measure. Members of the King's land or sea forces are exempt, as are also the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government. The master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel at any port in the Commonwealth are also exempted; but this exemption is subject to a most stringent provision, partly taken from a proposal which was in the Victorian Bill some time ago-perhap s not quite so stringentto the effect that a master of a vessel may be required by the officer under the measure, before being permitted to clear out from or leave the port, to muster his crew in fche presence of the officer. Theni f it is found that any person my opinion deportation, where a person has who according to the vessel's articles was one merely entered our territory, and has been of the crew when she arrived at the port, and who but for that would be a prohibited immigrant, is not present, the person in question is not to be excepted by the measure, but is to be considered a prohibited immigrant. Otherwise he would have been present at the muster. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN It is a large order to make the captain liable. large order, but self-preservation is the highest law; and I have no doubt whatever that, in accordance with that principle, this is a desirable provision for the Commonwealth to enforce. Then' it is provided that any person duly accredited to the Government of the Commonwealth by the Imperial 05 any other Government is to be excepted; and there are provisions excepting a wife accompanying her husband, and excepting children apparently under the age of eighteen years. These are exceptions which will go far to satisfy honourable members thafc it is not intended to create any undue hardship under the Bill. Ifc is also provided that a certificate of exemption may be granted to a person who can satisfy an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth. abused. authoritiesfchatthe Commonwealth has been his home, it is presumptive evidence that he is of a'class tolerated in the Commonwealth. Certificates of exemption are to be in force for a specified period only, aud there are provisions against the evasion of the measure. There are also provisions for the temporary landing under a bond of persons who wish to satisfy the officers of the Commonwealth that they are entitled to land, but this is to be done under the condition of the forfeiture of the deposit in case of the person not making that proof, and being then obliged to leave. A prohibited immigrant who contravenesor evades the provisions of the measure isguilty of an offence for which he will be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than six months, and todeportation. I admit that there are difficulties in regard to the matter of deportation, but I think that they are difficulties which the House is inclined to face. In guilty of an evasion of the provisions of this measure, can be carried out without any particular liability either of litigation at the suit of the person deported, or of complications arising out of international la%v.

A question for tlie consideration of the House will be whether the administration of the measure can be properly conducted if the masters, owners, and charterers of vessels carrying prohibited immigrants are exempted from any proceedings against them if such prohibited immigrants are allowed to land, seeing that the persons coming within that definition are persons whose class will subject them to tlie suspicion that they are prohibited immigrants. It will be said that the kind of persons who are likely to be a charge upon the people of the Commonwealth-person s who are idiots or lunatics, who have loathsome or infectious diseases, or are prostitutes, or persons living upon prostitution, will be very difficult to detect; but on shore it does not seem very difficult to detect them ; and if it is not veiy difficult to detect them on shore, it ought to be possible to detect them at sea. Sir almost impossible. always very fair in Ms arguments, and we shall listen to him on this subject with attention, but at the present time. I do not seehow we caii.safelyadminister thelaw without some such provision as that in the Bill. The Bill also gives a permissive powerwhich is not to be used unduly or hastilyto the Minister or a collector of Customs to detain any vessel from which a prohibited immigrant has been landed. The detention is to be for safe custody only, and is to ceaseIf a bond with two sufficient sureties to the satisfaction of the Minister or the collector be given by the master, owners, or charterers of the vessel for the payment of any penalty which maybe adjudged under this Act to be paid for the offence or default. If default is made in payment of any such penalty, the officer may seize the vesseland the ordinary proceedings are thereupon to be taken for forfeiting and condemning her; but if the bond is met, the vessel is to suffer no further detention. Apart from minutise, I have now explained the principal provisions of the Bill, and I have done so at some length, because I thought that it was due to the House to be explicit and frank in its discussion, and to put, to tlie best of my ability, all the considerations affecting tlie minds of the Ministryi n regard to it . It has been found desirable to make a distinction between this and the companion measure dealing with tlie importation of South Sea Island labourers, which is shortly to be introduced. Honourable members have known from the beginning that I proposed to bring in two Bills on the subject of immigration restriction, and there is already on the notice paper a motion dealing with the other Bill to which I refer. The reason why the whole matter has not been dealt. with in the one measure has been explained over and over again by me in this House. The questions dealt with by the twomeasures stand on quite different footings. It is scarcely in order for me to go into the question with which tlie other Bill -.will deal,' but I may point out to honourable members that in discussing that measure we must take into consideration the conditions under which the employment of South Sea Island labourers within the Commonwealth has grown up, and the conditions under which it may best be abolished. Thati t must be abolished bring forward the other Bill. I am acting My honourable friend is now in accordance with a promise which I made to the country before Parliament assembled, and which I have since made to this House, that I would deal with the whole subject in two separate measures, to both of which I hope to obtain the assent of Parliament.

93,,"I find that in some Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) I thinkof £ 2 5 fixed by this clause will work very harshly against some of the smaller brewers in Western Australia. The fee is a heavy one to start with, and will be specially felt by the brewers employing in some cases only three to four men in Western Ausbralia where no fee is payable at the present time. In tbe north in the Coolgardie country the breweries are 60 miles apart in some cases,"" and it will be impossible to have an officer to watch each one of them. The brewers can only be harassed by the imposition of such a heavy fee, astheiroutput cannot be regulated, nor can they be watched in the way that the Minister proposes. Some arrangement might be made by which the smaller breweries should have to pay a smaller licence-fee than the larger breweries, because it seems ridiculous that a brewery employing only two to five hands should be taxed to the same extent as the large breweries in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, employing, in some instances, thousands of men. The Minister might devise some means by which graduated fees might be imposed, because these small breweries have many disabilities to contend with, in the way of heavy carriage rates, which place fchem under a considerable handicap), notwithstanding the high prices they get for their beer. intended as a tax, but rather in order fco secure some contribution towards the expense connected with keeping an eye on the breweries, and after what fche honourable member for Coolgardie has said, ifc seems to me there is very little doubt that the Western Australian brewery, however small, will require as much looking after as a large one. In introducing federal legislation we must deal uniformly with the various States, and I find thab while no fees have been charged in Western Australia or South Australia, in New South Wales the licence-fee for a city brewery is £30, and for a country brewery £ 2 0 , and in Victoria and Queensland a £ 2 5 licence fee is charged. We have, therefore, provided for what has been generally imposed, and the difference between the case of the large and small brewer is met by the excise duty on the output. I think that wherever a brewery may be situated, whether it be in Western Australia or Queensland, the proprietor ought not to object to pay 10s. a week for the pvivilegesjie enjoys. Clause agreed to. Clause 14 (How security given). Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -This clause is a departure from our Victorian Act, inasmuch as it provides for a cash deposit. Ifc is in the option of the collector to demand a cash deposit, instead of the bond as provided for in the Victorian Act, and in the case of a large -brewery the deposit would amount to as much as £6,000. The hardship inflicted on the smaller breweries would be relatively asi great, and I would like to see provision made for the acceptance of an approved"" bond. that the collector, if offered a reasonablebond, should insist upon a cash deposit, as. such a thing would be monstrous. This clause was taken from the Customs Act, which provides for a bond to be approved by the collector; but it was pointed out that in some cases this would be rather inconvenient, and that the option might be given to merchants to give cash security. cash deposits. infcended to meet all parties, and I am sure that it will not be exercised in an arbitrary way. explanation will be quite satisfactory solong as it is understood thafc the present, custom will be adhered to except in special cases.

100,Mr Kingston,"I recognise that i tClause 20 (Duty of brewers). . Sir AVILLI AM M c MILLAN (Wentworth) -Unde r this clause it is provided that no brewer shall sell spirits in any place within 50 yards of his brewery. I understand many brewers sell wines and spirits, and that, as a matter of convenience, thei r wine and spirit stores are situated within the same block as their brewery premises. It has been pointed out to me fchat this provision, which is supposed to be directed against distillation on the brewery premises, is absolutely useless, because tbe brewery is so open to tlie public and to the employees that it would be impossible to have any illicit distillation g6ing on there. This provision is in the New South Wales Act, but it has been practically a dead letter, and I would suggest that it should be excised from the Bill, because, while it would involve many brewers in great expense, it can be of no practical use. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I intended to urge tlie same point in connection with paragraph (4) of clause 20. Perhapsi t does not apply so much in Victoria, but in other States such a provision will prove a very great hardship to those who are already carrying on businesses by selling in a brewery. Considering that the penalty for a breach of this clause is £100, I think the Minister should so amend it as to meet the difficulty to which reference has been made. according to tlie statements of officers who are experienced in the working of Customs Acts-it is undesirable to allow spirits to be sold in a brewery or in close proximity to it . No doubt there are some cases in which the practice has been permitted. ' The Government are prepared to insert a provision to meet the difficulty which has been suggested, by inserting after the word ""or,"" in paragraph (b), the words "" except by permission of the collector."" Clause amended accordingly, and agreed to. Clause 26 (Computation of duty). Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -In connection with this clause a' point has been raised by the honourable member for Bendigo, which he has asked me to deal with. Under clause 5, a question was raised as to the definition of quarts and pints, and the Minister gave au explanation which was satisfactory. But the latter portion of the Tariff Bill. this clause provides that fche actual contents shall be taken to be the dutiable contents, unless a contrary intention clearly appears in the Act imposing the excise. I think thafc it would be better to deal with this question of quarts and pints, and of reputed quarts and pints in this Bill.. It would be satisfactory if the Minister gave us an assurance that when we come to deal with the Excise Bill, he will provide for the anomaly that would be created if we allowed quarts and pints, and reputed quarts and pints to be considered the same thing. The brewer at the present time pays 12s. 6d. on a hogshead of beer, whereas under the provisions of this clause he would have to pay something like 17s. 6'd. per hogshead. The matter is too serious to allow of this clause being passed without some .assurance from the Minister that it will be dealt with when the ExciseB ill is under consideration. provides that in tbe absence of a provision to tbe contrary in the Excise Bill, honest measureI use the word in its nicest sense -shal l be insisted upon, and that the reputed quart or pint shall be in reality a quart or pint so far as duty is concerned. I prefer to deal in this Bill with the general question that bottles which are represented as holding a certain quantity, shall be considered to hold that quantity for the purposes of duty, unless some different provision is made on the subject. We know that there is apractice, which is recognizedfcosome extent, that six quarts, twelve pints, and 24 half-pints go to the gallon, instead of four quarts, eight pints, and twelve half-pints. Honourable members will notice that this provision will only apply if the Act imposing the Tariff does not make a different provision. No doubt there will be some provision made on the subject, but I cannot say whether it will be of the character desired by the honourable member for Melbourne. I think, however, that we ought to lay down the rule which I have indicated. far from supporting the honourable member for Melbourne, I feel inclined to move for fche omission of the words -"" unless a contrary intention clearly appears in the Act imposing the excise.""

104,Mr Kingston,"That can be altered byby the Tariff. Clause 129 of the CustomsB ill provides thatWhenever goods are sold or prepared for sale ns or are reputed to be of a size or quantity greater than their actual size or quantity, duties should be charged according to such first mentioned size or quantity. That is very distinct. Mr ""KINGSTON -This exception really is not necessary. ought to be made uniform. Why should a man in importing liquor have to pay not on the actual but on the reputed contents, whilst tlie local brewer is allowed to do otherwise ? In Victoria the excise and the import duties are the same. The State Parliament has adopted the same scale for both, which is a correct principle to follow. Here, however, we are acting differently. Having passed a provision that imported goods shall pay according to their reputed contents, we have no right to allow the local brewer to evade the payment of revenue by paying on the actual contents. I presume that we are adopting these provisions on. the assumption that they will be put into force. If it is all a farce, if we intend thafc this provision shall be altered by subsequent acts, we should leave it out of tbe Bill altogether. The clause in its present form gives greater opportunities to the colonial manufacturer than to the importer. ing emotions. The honourable member for Melbourne suggests that the clause should be altered in one. way, while the honourable member for North Sydney desires to have it amended in a precisely different direction. In all the circumstances, I think the committee will come to the conclusion that it would not be a bad thing to let it alone. It will be absolutely necessaiy fco deal with the matter under the Tariff. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melresult 1 bourne) I should like the Minister to acknowledge that' he does not desire to charge duty on more than the contents of these vessels. If be does that I shall be satisfied, but it is too serious a clause for us to pass without having some statement of that kind. I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that there should be no difference between beer bottled here and imported bottled beer. I should like to see the Minister, in a moment of weakness, yield a little more. He has done some good in adding the last lines to the clause, and as this matter affects a large industry, I hope he will give us some idea of what he intends to do. couraging. In soothing the fears of tlie brewers I have excited the apprehension of the importers, and really I do nofc care fco move further. As far as tlie request for an indication of the Government's intentions is concerned, I would assure the honourable member for Melbourne that we will deal witb this matter either one way or the other, and that it will come up for consideration in connection with the Tariff. Minister for Customs mean by this provision that he is goingfcocharge the same amount upon a reputed quart as he would upon the actual quart 1 These bottles are manufactured here and exist in large quantities in the States. We are bound to recognise that this standard of measurement does exist at tlie present time, and to alter it in the way proposed here might be to render all these bottles absolutely useless, and leave them on the hands of the people. A difference in regard to the dufcy may have that result. The Minister of Customs ouglit to let us know whether it is the intention of the Government to act upon the clause. If it is, then there is every reason for going to a division on it . his Tariff yet. correct it might mean that a brewer would have to pay exactly the same on a dozen bottles of the ordinary size as he would be called on to pay upon eight of the actual quart bottles, and the bottles' now in existence would become so much dead stock. No man starting afresh would buy any but the newer class of bottles. would have to pay a little more for his beer. Under these circumstances I think it is well that fche committee should divide on this question. I do not think that we ought to allow the clause to go through without some protest. Clause agreed to.

That means that in cases like the Cascade Brewery, in Tasmania, whose store is 2 \ miles away from the brewery itself, duty will have to be paid at the brewery, although really all the work is done at the store. I recognise that there are some difficulties in connection with the matter, but I would ask the Minister to consider whether nothing can be done to meet cases of the kind. makes provision for placing the duty stamp on the outside of the case where bottled beer is packed in cases. These cases are often old, and the stamp might very easily be rubbed off. provide in this case, as in paragraph (6) that the stamp shall be affixed to the face of tlie cart-note. thafc there are few instances of the description honourable member for Melbourne.

If we are going to allow the beer to be carted 2 miles before we collect the 1 duty, we shall, perhaps, be asked to allow it to be carted 50 miles, and we shall never be able fco draw a line. I do not hesitate to say that, if any attempt is made to meet cases of this description, the result will be disastrous so far as expense is concerned, and it will lead to loss of revenue. As to the matter of fixing stamps to cases, as provided in paragraph (c), the responsible officers tell me that it is much better to have the stamps on the case when beer has to be sent any considerable distance. It is safer from tlie point of view of revenue; and it also enables any officer to see, by a are no such conditions in Victoria. glance at tlie' cart-note, that tbe duty has been paid.

I understand that this is rather a grievance, especially in a State like New South Wales, I think ifc would be well to where beer travels very long distances by rail and by river, and sometimes takes 30 days to reach its destination. In such cases the brewer would be unable to obtain a refund I would point out of the duty.

121,Sir William Mcmillan,"Yes ;the time limit, and to increase the percentage limit by 5 per cent. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHA RN (Melbourne) -The honourable member for Wentworth was wrong in stating that this clause was evidently founded upon Victorian legislation. ascertain there is no legislation in existence that provides for anything less than the refund of the duty on tlie whole of the beer that is returned, provided the officer is satisfied as to tlie genuineness of the claim. I should like very much to see the Bill kept in line with existing legislation on this matter. Instead of stipulating that onetwentieth shall be the minimum quantity taken out, we should provide for a refund of duty on an}' beer sent back. I also think that the«30 days limit is too short. This1 means thafc the brewer in many cases will have to pay duty on valueless beer. In New South Wales and Soufch Australia beer has to be sent very long distances by rail and river, and very often it takes two or three months fco reach its destination. I think the time limit should be extended, and that the provision in regard to the percentage should at least be modified. In my opinion it ought to be taken out altogether. presented fco me by brewers thafc they take returns of beer from customers, and allow for them on the accounts. * Under this clause brewers will be compelled to pay duty on liquid that is not used for human consumption, and whioh has not been paid for by their customers. were imported and duty was paid on ifc, should there be a refund if the purchaser found the stock to be unsatisfactory ? MrM c CAY sells stock to a man and it is found to be unsatisfactory, it is nofc the custom for the seller to take the stock back. Bufc in fchis case, if a brewer sells beer fco a customer and some of ifc goes bad, he credits the cus-tomer with the bad beer which, he takes back from him. In tlie one case the seller does not take the goods back, and in the other case he does. I do not profess to know much about brewing and the sale of beer, but the case having been represented to ine, I felfc it to be my duty to bring it under London from which he exports, is not rethe Minister's notice. This Bill proposes a departure from the existing practice, at any rate so far as concerns the legislation of Victoria. If the beer is actually returned and credit is' given for it to the buyer, surely that beer is not fairly liable to duty. the proportion one twentieth mentioned in this clause is rather too small, and that the time allowed for the return So far as I have been able to of the beer is . too shorb. Curiously enough I remember appearing in a case at the end of last year, in which the charge against a carter was that he had tapped certain barrels of beer. When the beer was delivered at its destination in the country, it was found to be something less than 100 gallons short of the proper quantity. The explanation was that the beer had to be delivered a long way back in the country, and ifc took something like 30 days to get there. That was the excuse of the carter for consuming 100 gallons of beer. If the Minister is going to make any allowance as to quantity, I think it should be a tenth. might give way on this point. The object is to get duty on beer which is used, not on beer that is not consumed. The provision' as to one-twentieth of the beer having been censumed should be altered, and the time for the return should be extended ; because there are certain parts of Australia where the distances are great and from whence it is impossible to send back tlie beer within 30 days. the committee to the extent of making the one-twentieth an eighth and the 30 days 60 days. Although this provision is not founded on any existing legislation, ifc is justified by the defects of existing legislation. It is wonderful how lenient we are in regard to brewers. First their hogsheads of beer only pay duty on 50 gallons, and we also make an If the honourable member allowance on half-hogsheads and kilderkins. We extend a greater tenderness to them' under existing legislation than to any other manufacturers or importers. Suppose a manufacturer pays customs duty on an article which he imports, and afterwards finds fchat his customers do not like it ; he is not able to get a refund. If a man pays duty on spirits and does not find them to his taste he cannot get a refund. The importer in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, although he may have a house in sponsible for the quality; but the brewer is the manufacturer and can make good beer if he likes, and can take care of it.

The same condition has to be complied witb in Queensland. Schedule agreed to. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -Before the Chairman leaves the Chair, I should like to say that those interested in this measure are much indebted to the Minister for having agreed to the recommittal of tlie Bill for the reconsideration of so many clauses, considering that it went through committee as it did last week. B ill reported with further amendments. AUDI T BILL. Royal assent reported. Debate resumed (from AugustI , vide page 3441) on motion by Sir JOHN That this Bill be now read a second time. though I realize that the House is probably tired of this debate, and that anything I ' may say is likely to have been already said, the question is of such vast importance that I should like to say a few words upon it . In my opinion the control of the defences of the States by a central authority is one of the greatest justifications for federation. The divided authority and administration of the past was becoming almost a public nuisance. That can well be illustrated by a reference to what occurred in a neighbouring State about a year ago, when certain disturbances broke out in China. The Ministry of New South Wales on that occasion came down to theLegislafcive Assembly of that State, of which I was then a member, and asked their approval of the despatch of some 200 men, known as the Naval Brigade, to China. AlthoughI and others protested against tlie men being sent, as involving a useless and foolish expenditure, inasmuch as all the military powers of Europe, together with America and Japan, -were interesting themselves in restoring order in China, we were met by the answer-""Al l you say may be very true, but that jealous little State of Victoria, which is always trying to euchre New South Wales,"" Once a brewer has ascertained and to pose before tlie world as the leader of the Australian States, has arranged to send asmall number of men to China, and we musfc follow suit."" As a result the people of New South Wales were committed to an extravagant and useless expenditure. Whilei t appears to me that there is no provision in the Bill now before us which would allow of the despatch of an expedition of that character without the approval of this Parliament, I trust that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, whose capable speech on the subject.

But the ports of Australia might be blockaded for years, and we should suffer no serious inconvenience because we are capable of. feeding and clothing our own people. Once we start to create an Australian navy we must go on and keep pace with every modern improvement. A ship built to-day will be practically useless ten years hence. Once we begin this sort of thing let us do it with our eyes open, and know that it is to be done at an enormous expenditure. The English fleet looks very well on paper, but after all said and done its true strength depends on its more modern vessels, and tlie mad race for naval supremacy is going on now more ferociously than ever. believe, 1901 is a year of extreme activity. The British Parliament has voted over £16,000,000 for the construction of. ships and armaments alone, quite apart from other naval expenditure. She is adding fifteen battle-ships and twenty-two armoured cruisers to her fleet. Other countries are doing exactly the same thing, although not to that extent, because it is not necessaiy. Prance is adding six battle-ships and five armoured cruisers to her fleet. Germany is adding nine battle-ships, and Russia nine battle-ships and nine cruisers. Even Japan, during the first six months of this year, has added two battle-ships and three cruisers to her fleet. And so it goes on year after year. started this game I guarantee that it would cost more than the taxpayers could stand. Honourable members should take seriously into consideration the fact that this Bill, in clause 37, gives the Government power to build ships without asking Parliament for authority. If we are to establish a navy, then it should not be a toy one. It must be one up to date, else it would be useless. If we were to start with six battleships it would cost eight millions or nine millions, ancl practically every year we should be adding a million to the expenditure on our fleet. The position of Tasmania presents the only difficulty in the matter. Australia could nofc be successfully invaded, nor do I think that any hostile power could successfully blockade our ports. very slight if we except fche position of Tasmania, which might be made a depdt for a foe. But I think we would always be able, without the necessity of having expensive battleships, to send sufficient men to Tasmania to eject any force. Our true policy is to abandon all idea of having a naval force. I hope'that honourable members will realize what a naval force would mean. We might have a dozen warships and yet one substantial battleship could riddle the whole lot with a few shots. We must have ships up to date, aud if we once started we must go on year after year meeting every modern improvement to keep our navy up to a proper standard, and that would 'involve an expenditure which this Federation could not undertake. We are part of tlie British Empire, and if old England became involved in some great crisis and found herself confronted with perhaps two or three first-class EuropeanI n England, I powers, it is perfectly true that she could nofc spare great battleships out here. Some authorities have gone so far as to say that she would even abandon any idea of keeping a great fleet in the Mediterranean, and would concentrate her whole strength in the Channel to defend her shores, once she had met with any slight reverse. But still there would always be a class of vessels which would be useless for modern warfare, and yet would be quite good enough to face an}' ships which any foe would be likely to send here, or vessels that would at all events be useful as quick cruisers for conveying troops to Tasmania for the defence of that State. AVe should fortif y our capitals, and, what is of equal importance, our coal depots; and we Once Australia should entirelyI use the word "" entirely "" advisedly-rel y upon the land forces for the defence of Australia. Furthermore, these land forces should be established as nearly as possible on a purely voluntary basis. I am in entire accord with fche honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in his denunciation of what is called militarism, and I should deplore it iffchismilitary spirit were to be greatly fostered in Australia. We have been going through a period of excitement in Australia, and we shall pass through the inevitable reaction, and, per1 haps, the danger is that the reaction may go too far. I consider it will be necessaiy to have a body of thoroughly trained military men to work our forts and for the -purposes of instructing the other branches Our risk isof our defence forces; but I hope this House -will always put its foot down against any undue fostering of pure militarism. We should strive to encourage rifle clubs in every possible way; but I think it is absurd to provide that any forces or corps now in existence shall remain in existence under the BiU. Surely we must change our conditions iu the light of modern experience. I do not profess to know much about these matters, but I know enough to quite realize that such a picturesque force as tlie lancers may be useless I say ""may be""-in modern warfare. Why, therefore, should it be provided that any such force now in existence shall be retained 1 We must reform our defence forces in the light of the best experience we can get, and as mounted rifles seem to be much more effective than lancers, I trust that that particular arm of tlie service will be encouraged 1 throughout Australia.

Imperial soldiers, and my right honourable However, what I wish to say is that, whilst I am opposed to the construction of a purely Australian Navy, at Australian expense and to be under Australian control, I trust the Government will ask the Parliament to rise to a proper conception of its responsibility and vote an adequate sum towards the support of the British Navy. W it h all our talk about patriotism, we are now giving an insignificant vote of £126,000 per annum as a contribution from United Australia to tbe British Navy. I almost wonder that the British Government accepted it. Whilst the people of Great Britain have for years past contributed not less than 12s. per head towards thesupport of the navy--and it will cost something like 15s. per head this year for the same purpose -we , the people of Australia, are paying towards the support of the navy of the Empire, of our loyalty to which we so greatly boast, a paltry £126,000, which works out at something like 8d. or 9d. per head. Surely this is not worthy of a great Commonwealth like this, which boasts so freely of its loyalty. Loyalty and patriotism have not much respect from me when they are exhibited only in time of excitement and hysteria. I want this Parliament, in a time of peace, when there is no hysteria, to rise to a sense of its responsibility, and vote a far greater sum than the miserable amount we are now paying towards the Imperial Navy. I do not desire to go into the details of the Bill, but I wish to refer to the danger pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne of giving the Ministry of the day too much power under the emergency clauses of the Bill. I am entirely opposed to any idea of enforced service. We have required no enforced service in England, and neither are we likely to require it in Australia. Wheni t comes to a question of forcing our citizens to fight our glory will have departed, indeed. I shall be in favour of excising from the B ill anything that bears the slightest resemblance to a provision for conscription. I am glad to see the Minister for Home Affairsi n his place, because I wish to refer to a matter. upon which he has expressed himself. I remember hearing or reading of some Member of Parliament in New South Wales having asked the Minister for Home Affairs, while he was Premier of that State, if he was going to allow New South Wales to be made a recruiting ground for enlisting friend said "" No , "" and that he would take care nothing of the kind was done. I noticed that a question was asked of tlie Prime Minister here the other night in reference to the same matter, and that the Prime Minister, without giving a definite answer, said he would have sometliing to say about the matter later on. I do not understand quite what was meant by these questions and answers; but, if they mean that the Imperial Government are desirous of enlisting men in Australia for service in the British Army or Navy, and that our Government will attempt to prevent them from exercising that liberty, then I , for one, will be entirely at variance with the Government.

Too much has been said from time to time upon the question of sending Australian troops abroad. I agree that it is necessary for the defence of this country that we should take early steps to build arsenals and ammunition factories, and to provide ourselves with our own armament and ammunition. As was pointed out by the last speaker, should a crisis arise Australia could not depend upon getting her necessary armaments and ammunition from England. In Queensland, when the war in South Africa was at its highest, it was a very difficult matter indeed for the Government to obtain rifles, ammunition, and armaments generally. In ' point of fact, it was almost an impossibility to get them. The Government could not even supply the rifle clubs with rifles. That was the unfortunate position which Queensland occupied, and it only serves to emphasize the danger to which we are likely to be exposed in the event of any international crisis occurring in which England may be involved, if we are not able to rely upon ourselves. We should cultivate the quality of self-reliance. I hope that in any scheme which we may adopt the necessary steps will be taken to establish our own arsenals and ammunition factories. We were told by the honourable member for West Sydney that we had contributed during the last decade, in connection with the maintenance of the Australian auxiliary squadron, something like £1,250,000 sterling, whilstthe actual cost of the vessels, exclusive of the flagship Royal Arthwr was between £700,000 or £800,000. The total cost of the vessels was about £900,000. A moment's reflection can induce only one conclusion, namely, that the vessels comprised in the Australian squadron are practically obsolete. type at the time. MrM c DONALD take up this first line of defence it is far better for us to make a start immediately. Let us be honest to the people who sent us here and tell them openly that it is necessary, for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth,' to incur an enormous expenditure for the creation of a navy. It is idle to assert that we must depend upon the navy as our first line of defence if we are not prepared to bear the burden involved in the formation of an efficient navy. I am not altogether of opinion that the navy is really our first line of defence at the present time. We can defend our shores without a navy; but if we are going-as has been hinted by the Prime Minister this afternoon -to take charge of a number of islands in the South Pacific and also of British New Guinea, the result must ultimately be thatwhether we like it or not-w e shall have to go in for the creation of a navy. Whatever the cost may be, I would rather that we owned two or three vessels than that we paid any subsidy to the British Government for the use of vessels over which we have no control. As has been pointed out, if a crisis occurred in Great Britaini t is very questionable whether England could render us any assistance at all. The only assistance which we could render to the Empire would be that we could defend ourselves. When I hear honourable members talking glibly about rendering assistance to the Empire generally, and of the supremacy of the British navy, I am led to speculate whether they have ever really considered the question at all. I would further point out that prac1 tically every ten years these war vessels become obsolete. Hence, if we intend to go in for this first line of defence, ifc is obvious that the Commonwealth must incur an enormous expenditure. Only the other day we read a cable in fche newspapers which stated that, owing to tlie improvements made in their submarine boats, the Erench nation claimed to be the strongest naval power in the world. We all know that for some years past France has been devoting considerable attention to the construction of submarine boats. Only about a week ago we saw thafc the successf u l experiment had been attempted of running one of these submarine vessels 140 miles under water. 100 now. If it is necessary to MrM c DONALD I understand that the French people are building a very large number. It is quite reasonable to suppose that these vessels will be successful, andif they are, it behoves us to consider what, is the value of the British navy. The British navy in such circumstances would become practically valueless -The result must be that attention will have to be directed to devising some means for counteracting the power of these submarine boats. We do",39,Forrest

But, from what I can gather, those built by the Erench people are absolutely the best known to science up to the present time. The secret of their construction remains with tlie French Government. also. marine boats at present in tlie British navy are a mere notliing compared with those invented by the French nation. From time to time it has been urged that Australia requires this naval defence, and also a large standing army. 1 think too much has been made of what Australia requires in the way of defence. It has been repeatedly stated that Australia is likely to be invaded. A few years ago the ciy was that tbe Chinese were going to invade our shores. Now that nation has been thrust aside, and it is urged with much persistency that there is a -danger of Japan swooping down upon us either for loot or to divide up the country. . From tlie tone of some of the speeches which have been made, one might be pardoned for thinking that we were almost on the verge of an invasion. I believe that Australia's isolation is her strongest means -of defence. We have been repeatedly told by very eminent men that the 21 miles ol sea between England and the -Continent is worth 1,000,000 of men to her. If there be any truth in that statement, then Australia is in a very much more secure, -position. In any case, Australia's position is very secure at'the present time. If we -improved our various fortifications, I think -that our power of resistance could be made such that no army in existence -could successfully invade our territory. It has been said that the Continental powers have a dozen schemes by which they could -invade Great Britain, but the difficulty is in getting the men there and in keeping them .'supplied. That is exactly the position which Australia occupies at the present time. It -is quite true that a hostile nation might be .able to land troops at Port Darwin, but what would be the use of them when landed? 'The whole of their supplies would have to be -conveyed to them, so that I do not share :some of the fears which other honourable .members entertain. European power which is likely to attempt an invasion of Australia, for the simple reason that they could .not afford it . Quite apart from the financial aspect of the MrM c DONALD I understand that question, no nation could afford to send the' men. The whole of Europe is so armed at the present time that no nation could allow 50,000 or 60,000 of her trained men to be deported to Australia. Present conditions, therefore, are such as to make Australia very safe from invasion. We are told that J apan is the nation which is bkely to come down iipon us and to loot our large cities, or to invade Australia. Buti t appears to me that Japan has her hands fairly f u l l at the present time with Russia. Moreover, her financial position is such that I do not think she could attempt such a task. I repeat that our isolation, together with the volunteer forces throughout Australia, is sufficient to enable us to defend ourselves. I disagree with those who urge that we should take our share in tlie defence of the Empire. I ask tliem if they really know what the defence of the Empire means. The Empire has now probably a hundred troubles upon hand that may result in war at any moment. After all, our risk of invasion and of trouble either from a European power or even from Eastern nations practically results from our connection with the Empire. This matter has not been touched upon at all. We know that the task which Great Britain has set herself means an enormous amount of taxation, and sooner or later she must break down under its weight. She cannot stand ifc. If she is working on the theory that she is going to remain equal to two of the greatest naval powers-rememberin g that Germany as well as France and Russia and other European powers are making every effort to secure enormous naviesthen she has set herself a task that is going to press very heavily on the masses of the people. come tax ? Mr M°DONALD -Even with an income tax she must ultimately break down.

Are we, as a democratic community, prepared to contribute large sums to the defence of the Empire without having any legislative representation 1 Is any honourable member prepared to vote large sums for that purpose without representation for the Commonwealth ? The very basis upon which, not only the Commonwealth, but England itself is carried on, is that wherever there is taxation there shall be representation? Herei t is proposed to contribute to the defence of the Empire by land as well as by sea. If England is going to continue her policy of keeping up an enormous navy, and we are going to pay in proportion to our numbers, then we must be prepared to take an equal share in the weight and burden of it . I , for one, am opposed to it . I do not think it would be wise for us to try in any shape or form to levy heavy taxation simply for the sake of keeping up an enormous navy, or to enable us to contribute generally to tlie defence of the Empire. We know that in all cases of Empire those parts which are' farthest from the centre are generally in the most danger. The centre of an Empire is tlie point at which capital accumulates. It is never found in tlie very extremes, and I for one will always raise my voice against any attempt to tax tlie people of the Commonwealth in order that we may assist in the defence of tbe Empire. What, after all, is England doing at the present time ? She is merely sending armies abroad in order to open up markets from which we get very little benefit. The opening up of these markets is generally to assist a class of individuals, which certainly is not conducive to the best welfare of the Empire as a whole. In such circumstances I will always be opposed to any attempt to increase our contribution towards the cost of tlie navy, which is supposed to assist in the defence of Australia. I shall be opposed not merely to any increase in that contribution but also to its continuance. If we recognise as a Parliament that it is necessary to have this first line of defence we should be honest enough to the people of Australia to come down and say so, and to be prepared to pay for it. If we are not prepared to pay for it , then we ought not to talk of it.. member prepared to allow allfchevessels of defence of fche Empire. I think fchat the the auxiliary squadron to go away from our clauses relating to that matter ought to be shores ? prepared to allow them to go away. If it is necessary to have any warships at all, I would say let us pay for them ourselves and control them. In Australia the great mass of the . people are even worse off than they are in Great Britain. We find out here fchafc wealth only contributes from 17 to 20 per cent, of the taxation, which means that the great mass of the wealth producers of this country bear the -biggest burden. Whetheri t is in the maintenance of a standing army or otherwise, it is the great mass of the wealth producers who have* to pay the piper. It is all veiy well, therefore, for some of our honourable friends to tell us that it is necessary for us to contribute fco the defence of the Empire. They know very well when they say so that it is not going to interfere with the particuar class which they represent. If it is ever proposed, I hope that those honourable members will be sincere enough to come forward with a proposition for a big income tax or a direct land tax to meet the extra cost. So far as the Bill itself is concerned, it has had a most extraordinary career.

In rny opinion, the colonies will never stand a policy of that kind.

167,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"I do notregarding the subject of defence is very much akin to the .feeling .prevailing elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth. people of Western people of the rest of Australia, are not in any sense extremists. individual cases of people who are open to be called jingoists, and. there may be some coining under the designation of Little Englanders; people view the whole question in a thoroughly sensible way, and while they are all opposed to war, and regard it as a very horrible thing which they would like to see abolished, they recognise that they have to look at it from a matter of fact point of view, and that while all the nations of the world are armed, it is necessary for the people of this country to defend themselves against any possible foe by which the Commonwealth may be assailed. The views of a majority of the people of Australia are crystallized in the motto "" Defence not defiance."" They merely want to' be able to hold what they have got, without extending their possessions, and without indulging in any jingoism or extreme views of that nature. nise that that preparedness for war which is so necessary, is the very best guarantee for peace. One of the lessons which has been taught-or taught-by is that in one respect at any rate the scope of warfare has been changed, and that the men who are now valued in the field are not those who merely fight with their rifles or other weapons of war, but with their brains. success of the Australians in South Africa. Each man fought as a unit, but each exereised common sense; and yet, at the same time, they all fought as an organized body. The Boer war has shown us that, in order to be successful in warfare, armies should be treated as composed of individuals, the past have been regarded. lesson of the war is that it was not the guished themselves most, but rather the untrained men who went from these and that is the class of men on whom we shall have to rely if ever Australia is in need of soldiers to defend her shores. The position. of the Commonwealth is such as will necessitate a larger defence force . than is necessary for most other countries. Mr Kirwan. comprise an area extending over 3,000,000 square miles, and our population amounts The to about 3,700,000. That is a very small' Australia, like the population for such a huge area. We should never' forget that we hold that area not There may be a few merely for ourselves, but as . a heritage for the civilized people of the future. Another matter we ought to consider in connection with this subject is the position of Japan as but the great mass of the regards* Australia. It is well-known that Japan for many years has been very ambitious to establish colonies for her surplus population. Not so very many years ago, the United States only just forestalled Japan in the annexation of tlie Sandwich Islands, and it is an open secret that Japan is very desirous of emulating Great Britain by establishing in Asia a nation somewhat akin to Great Britain in Europe. Japan wants colonies, and is very eager to extend her possessions. If at any time Great Britain were involve'd in a foreign war, and Japan happened to be engaged in the same conflict on the opposite side, I do not think there is the least doubt but that the first direction in which Japan would look with a view to attacking the Empire, would be toThey -equally well recogwards Australia. She would probably endeavour to secure some of the huge uninhabited areas of the north, or the west, with a view to developing the energies which ought to have been of her surplus population. ' Por this the recent war in South Africa reason the question of Commonwealth defence is of almost primary importance. The honourable member for East Sydney, in his speech on this Bill, referred to the military system of Switzerland. I was much impressed by what he said. His description That was the real secret of the of the citizen soldiers of Switzerland fascin, ated me, and led me to believe'that perhaps some such system might be applicable to the Commonwealth. I was, however, somewhat disillusionized when I looked up a book on the subject in the library-Tli e Swiss Confederation, by Sir P. O. Adams and C. D . intelligent Cunningham. Prom that book I came to the rather than as soldiers in conclusion that such a system would be abAnother solutely impossible so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The inference I drew professional soldiers who distinwas that it would be too costly a system to adopt here, although it is true that the sysStates; tem in Switzerland is very much cheaper and more efficient for the money expended than the' military system of any other country in Europe. On looking up the cost per man in the principal European armies I found a number of figures which showed me We that, although the cost in Switzerland is low, ycfc it is considerably too high for application to the Commonwealth. Tlie annual cost per man in the army of Great Britain-namel y £ 6 4 10s. 4d -is higher than in any other army in Europe. Spain comes next with a cost per man of £56 2s. 4d. ; next comes Austria-Hungary with a cost Of£ 52 12s. In France the cost per man is £ 4 6 13s. 6d., and in Germanyi t is £ 4 6 . the advisability of adopting a uniform gauge, In Russiai t is comparatively low, £ 2 2 16s.; whilst in Switzerland the cost per man is down as low as £ 7 . But though Switzerland compares very favourably in respect of cost with the armies of Europe, yet £ 7 per man would be too much to pay in Australia. According to the Minister for ""Defencei n introducing the Bill, the number of adults in the Commonwealth capable of bearing arms is about 954,000. That seems to me to be very much overestimating the figures, considering the population of the Commonwealth; but if the number were only half that stated by tlie Minister, it would be far more than the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth would permit, if we had an army composed of all those men capable of bearing arms such as was proposed by the honourable member for East Sydney. The cost would run into about five or six million pounds per annum, which is considerably more than we could possibly spend in military affairs. The system adopted in Switzerland is one, however, that must commend itself to us, inasmuch as every individual citizen there is required to bear arms. danger with which the standing army usually threatens constitutional government is not to be feared in the case of Switzerland, because there every citizen is a soldier; and where that is so a country has nothing to fear from inilitary dominance. The Swiss system is so efficient that it has been admired by military men throughout Europe, and the simplicity of their military organization is such that it might be followed with considerable advantage by the Commonwealth. In this connection I should like to refer to a subject which has been touched upon by many honourable members, and which I might term tlie gold lace question. I know two or three companies the efficiency of which is impaired by the very high cost of the officers' uniforms, inasmuch as men hesitate to prospect of advancement, the high.price of the gorgeous uniforms required by officers debarring them from accepting promotion. In a democratic community such as this, we should have no tailor-made officers, and no man should be debarred from advancement by reason of his poverty. We cannot separate the question of defence from the question of railway communication between the States; and in this connection and the question of connecting the various parts of the Commonwealth by railway, must be considered. The Commonwealth cannot build a navy, and it is. absurd to talk of such a thing at the present time, in view of our financial position and the many calls made upon our finances; but, in the absence of a navy, it seems to me that to defend Western Australia from the attacks of an enemy that State must be connected with the others by railway. When the people of Western Australia were considering the advisability of entering into the Union, the Constitution Bill contained a clause which provided that the Commonwealth should protect every State of the Union against invasion, and we interpreted that provision as an absolute mandate upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth to sanction its construction. In fche absence of such a railway, we, in Western Australia, are in no better position, so far as defence is concerned, now than we were. in before the accomplishment of federation. I agree with those who object to that clause of the B ill which makes military service in the event The of emergency compulsory. It seems to me that the clause is almost; an insult to Australians. I am sure that if an emergency arose there would be no need to force men to join -the service, because they would gladly volunteer, and it would be much better for Australia to be defended by willing volunteers than by men who had been pressed into -the service, because it is well known that volunteers fight better than pressed, men. A well-known military authority, Major-General Edwards, in a report which.he made on the subject of Australian defence some years ago, put forward several recommendations which it might be advisable for this Parliament to carry into effect. He recommended that the defence force corps should be amalgamated into a fortress corps, which, I think, would be a much better name for the perjoin them because they see no manent arm of our service. He also advocated the establishment of a military college for the education of officers, and the extension of the rifle corps systema recommendation which, I am sure, will be well received by honourable members, and which meets with the approval of the people generally. No arm of the service could be so useful in time of emergency as rifle corps, provided that the practice of the members is kept up, and a certain amount of drill is given to them. I am in accord with those who have spoken against the establishment of a standing army. We want no standing army in Australia, as standing armies are known in Europe. I also approve of the idea that no citizen soldier should be required, without his own consent, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. I am sorry that the Minister for Defence is not here to-night. If he had been present, I might have had a great deal more to say about the matters' which I have mentioned, and other matters. I wish, however, to refer, in conclusion, to some statements which have appeared in the Perth press, and which I hope' will either be contradicted or will be accepted as true. Honourable members have referred to guards of honour and the ceremonial parading of troopsfunctions which, to my mind, are utterly useless. But I find from the Western Australian, an eminently respectable journal, that when the Minister for Defence recently arrived at Fremantle, a company of the Fremantle infantry, in f u l l uniform, was drawn up on the South Quay as a guard of honour, and that at Perth there was another guard of honour, composed of a detachment of 100 of the rank and file from the Public Service Corps, under Captain Hunt. In a subsequent issue of the same newspaper, I read thatOn arrival j'esterday, the Right Hon. Sir John when we know in our hearts thafc we cannot Forrest, Federal Minister Eor Defence, was met at Fremantle by one guard of honour, and at Perth station by another. Every man present received five shillings payment for his services, and the paltry compliment has therefore cost the Finance department £50 and upwards. The calculation of cost was made on the assumption that both guards of honour were composed, as the Perth guard was, of a 100 men. I do not know whether the statement is 'true, but I have seen no contradiction of it, and I mention it so that tlie Minister may have an opportunity of dealing with it. A number of honourable members talk about economy, but vote the other way, and I commend the statement to their consideration. facts of the case to be known, and I think Mr Kirwan. that we should have f u ll information regarding the cost of these guards of honour. AlthoughI am somewhat unready to take part in this debate, as I was under the impression that the Government would proceed with the consideration of the Post and Telegraph Bil l to-night, 1 should like to say one or two words upon the measure, because I consider it one of the most important that will occupy our attention. We have to defend ourselves whether we like it or not. It is an obligation of our citizenship which none of us can shirk, and I take it none of us wishes to shirk; at any rate, I for one do not. I recognise that we must respond to the obligations of a twofold citizenshipwe being citizens of Australia, and as such, citizens of the Empire at large. That being so, the obligation is laid upon us to pay regard not only to tbe defence of our own country, but also to the larger question of defending the Empire of which we are proud to be a part. A t the same time. I do not think that we should do well to parade our military strength before the world to any greater extent than we are obliged to do, and I could not help but feel that the Minister for Defence made rather a show of himself when he stated with so much unction that we had 970,000 men capable of bearing arms, and between 20 and 60 years of age. I believe that he included in that number all the men in Australia who are between 20 and 60 years of age, not leaving out of account the halt, the lame, the blind, and the many who are disqualified in other ways from the performance of active military duties. I do not think that we shall do any good-by this silly parade of our fighting strength to the world, put so many men into the field, and that even if we could we have not the means to equip them. It contributes neither to our own welfare nor to the strength of the Empire, nor can it affect the minds of those in other parts of the world who may, perhaps, look upon us with envious e3es, tor make a false statement of our strength, because they know as well as we do what our military strength really is, and what the efficiency of our defences would bein time of war. A t the same time. I feel that the obligation is laid upon us not only to do our duty to our continent, and to defend our race, our homes, and our commerce, but to have some I should like the respect for the exigencies of the' Empire at",43,Forrest
168,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"large. I should like to say a few words ou a matter which was referred to by the leader of the labour party. I take it that this statement is typical of many others emanating from men who believe that our -defence should be confined to our continent -that we should on no account go beyond the confines of the continent in defence of the Empire, no matter what the urgency may be. I do not subscribe to that doctrine. I believe it would be better to meet the foe away from our shores than to wait for him to come here and get a footing on our -coasts. of the Boer war t ings of the Boer war I do not think it would be a good tiling for us to sit idly by in case Our traditions, our prejudices, our preferof a combined attack on the Empire and to let an enemy land on our shores, and then drive him off. That is not my way of defending ourselves. I can conceive, and -any honourable member need not stretch his imagination very much to conceive, of a combination of European powersagainst England, provoked by the very jealousy arising from her success, o wing to the possession of these successful outlying colonies and dependencies. I should imagine if such an attack were ever made it would be our obligation and our duty, as we have seen it to be in South Africa, to defend our. Empire even though it should be away from these shores. In going to South Africa to fight there, we were just as much defending our hearths and homes in Australia as if the enemy had been fighting on this continent. I believe that if any serious menace were to come to South Africa, which I regard, and many other honourable members and authorities regard, as the key of our Empire, it would result very injuriously to our safety and our commerce here. I am not one of those who believe we should stay here until the enemy gets a footing on our shores, but wherever"" the need is seen for our defence force to demonstrate themselves, that is the point to which we should betake ourselves i u defence of tlie integrity of the Empire as not want it to be inferred from thisas it might very, well be-that I am in favour of the raising of a standing army in Australia, with intent to deport it on the slightest possible provocation. I do not know what the future may involve for us in this regard, but I think that in the near future, and so far as we may see immediately ahead, there is no need to put the whole defence of this continent on any other than an absolutely voluntary footing. Whatever is done in defence of the Empire away from our shores should be done, as has been done in South Africa, spontaneously, and from the feeling of loyalty inherent in the people, which, after all, is our best and surest safeguard. I do not believe either-and this has been made clear by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-that we can follow slavishly the Swiss model. We cannot make all our people soldiers. It seems to be inconsistent with fche very genius of our race to put this compulsion on citizens,fcomake soldiers of them whether they choose to be so or not. ences, our national leanings have more to do with the determination of this great question so far as Englishmen are concerned, and so far as Australians are concerned, than anything else. Perhaps our insular position has led us to have a horror of these conscription clauses. Whetheri t is our insular position, or something arising from our inherent love of independence and libertywhatever may be the predisposing causewe are not with those who take readily to this idea of compulsory service, compulsory mobilization, but we adhere to the principle of voluntarism. I hope we shall not depart from the voluntary principle in building up the defence force of Australia. There is no. parallel between ourselves and other countries which have adopted conscription. For instance, there is no parallel between this country and Switzerland. The Swiss are a small community hedged in by warlike powers. Here we are a parta distant part, it is true-of a mighty but scattered Empire. What may be an ideal condition of affairs so far as the defence of Switzerland is concerned, is not necessarily ideal in its relation to ourselves on this continent. I believe we have a right to share the responsibilities of the Empire as well as its privileges. But I am against the latent conscription in the Bill, and in committee I a whole. I do hope to be with those who seek to eliminate that very idea. It has been said to us that what is embodied in the Bill exists, as a latent power in the Constitution, and in our form of social organization. That is very true; but there is an essential difference between a latent power which may be a power ready to be called forth from a sense",46,Forrest
169,Mr Conroy,What! after the teachings,47,Forrest
170,Mr Joseph Cook,"Afte r the teachof oiii' moral obligation, ancl a latent power ready to be called forth by reason of a legal obligation which we have imposed on ourselves. I believe there is a latent power to defend the country inherent in all States who set themselves up as organized communities. But I want to see this done from a sense of moral obligation and loyalty rather than as the result of the exercise of a power which we choose to put into the hands of the Executive, to work their own sweet will with regard to the fighting that has to be done in defence of the Empire. In other words, tins is the difference; whereas now this latent power can only be called forth by the Governor General, with the advice of his Executive Council, and with the consent of Parliament, if we pass .the Bill on its present lines we shall give that latent power into the hands of the Executive Council, to be disposed of as they may deem fit, without resort to Parliament in the last extremity. I want the right to send these forces away from our shores to be subject to the control of Parliament, and, if ing on a condition of affairs Avhich may possible, to be in its absolute direction. send troops away without consulting Parlia^ ment. offer made to send troops away without consulting Parliament, we want the Executive to feel that they can only do that kind of thing when tlie will of the people has manifested itself unmistakably. I do not want the Executive to be able to commit the Commonwealthbehind the back ,of the people in connection with any secret negotiaus -We are isolated, girt by the great tions as to the defence of the Empire at any point. I want Parliament to have the right to control our military operations, no matter where they may be undertaken. Therefore, I may be. found in committee with those who seek to eliminate the emergency clauses, and to define the term "" emergency "" in a very different way. The reason why I am so anxious that Parliament should not give over this power to the Executive is because war is not like any other undertaking. A blunder in the shape of a declaration of war, and in the commitment of ourselves to warlike obligations, cannot be remedied like any ordinary legislative blunder we may commit. A blunder of that kind can never be recalled, and may result in very serious consequences to the Empire. Isolated as we are, and away from the warlike obligations of the world at large, we have time to consult Parliament, and the Government should only take these extreme and stringent steps after parliamentary sanction has been deliberately obtained. Before the Executive can be given these plenary powers in regard' to the defence force of the Empire, I believe Ave shall have to go fuither, and give the Executive a voice in the determination of peace' or Avar, as it affects the Empire as a Avhole The time Avill not be yet, I knoAV. Imperial federation is a matter which may grow-w e cannot make it by any machinery; but I believe the time will come Avhen these States will have to be consulted at the seatof Empire, and Ave shall require to have some say in the determination of all those larger matters of policy which affect the destiny of the Empire. Before we alloAv the Executive the same plenary poAvers as exist on the Continent of Europe, particularly as exist in London, there must be consultation Avith our Executive on the part of the Home authorities before entering into or embarkland us in very serious consequences. What has led to the conscription on the Continent ? It has very often been a fighting emperor, or it has been tlie contiguity of Avarlike nations. In other Avords, geography and national character have had a very large influence in determining these methods of conscription in older countries than ours. Our position seems to naturally exempt us from the obligations arising out of the idea of conscription. Por instance, we have no Avarlike nations in contiguity to broad sea which rolls between, us and the warlike nations of Europe, and I hope Ave shall not set up to be a fighting people, to seek to enlarge our territory across the seas. I hope we shall develop peaceful ideals-commercia l ideals if you like, social ideals-that Ave may make social experiments, as I believe Ave are doing in a way and to an extent Avliich they dare not even dream of in some of the older countries where their conditions are very much more complicated. In a word, our methods are to be those of peace, not those of war for the sake of dominion, and for the sake of conquering other nations. We have no motive urging us to the methods of conscription. We have no motive Avhich should lead us to adopt this method of compulsory mobilization, which.",47,Forrest
171,Mr Sawers,No offer to be made to,48,Forrest
172,Mr Joseph Cook,"If there is anfinds so much favour onfcheContinent, and which is always without exception resorted to. Before our eyes -we have standing out as a beacon light the great Continent of America. In this respect I am prepared to go to America to see what we ouglit to do in the immediate future. We have been told by various thinkers, writers, and authorities that we can never hope to be a great nation unless we become a warlike people. The contrary of thafc is seen to be fche case on the great Continent of America. They have shown to the world unmistakably that they may be great without necessarily being warlike. In looking to the requirements of the moment, we should look fco tbe Continent of America as a beacon light to guide us in what .we are to do immediately ahead. There, as we know, they have built up the finest commerce perhaps in the world ; they certainly have developed their resources in a way which soon bids fair to become without parallel. They have built up a great nation in every respect, and they have -done it with just sufficient soldiers to police their shores and territory. Our danger of invasion is a very remote one. We are awa}' from Europe, and the balance of power is so even amongst the nations that no one of them could afford to send a marauding army here to despoil us. Therefore we may feel ourselves to be absolutely secure from attack by a European power at present. W it h regard to the Ea'st, I have no such fear as some others entertain that we are likely to be attacked by Japan. I think that great nation has its hands f u l l in grappling with the powers that are contiguous to it ; and that it will continue to have its hands too full, diplomatically and in every other way, in maintaining its position amongst the great nations, to permit of its casting longing glances towards Australia. Moreover, I am vain enough to believe that if the Japanese should contemplate a descent in armed force upon Australia we could make it very uncomfortable for tliem, even though we have not their overwhelming numbers. A t any rate, I have no fear of these invasions, and fco my urge us to follow the military methods of Europe or to adopt any system of general mobilization. , A t the same time we ought not to forget that we are a commercial people. We are sending away from these shores £140,000,000 worth of commerce every year. Of every £ 7 worth of our produce we send £ 5 worth to foreign, markets, and therefore an obligation is laid upon us to see that our commerce is properly policed. That leads me to the idea thafc we should always be in favour of keeping a navy upon our coast, of at least the same strength as the one we have to-day. I would not, on any consideration, advocate the sending away of that, navy from our shores, but I believe we get that navy at a very cheap rate, and that we should always keep it, as far as possible, for the protection of our commerce. Yet, strange to say, the question of naval defence is one that is left entirely out of the Bill, except for a plenary clause which practically gives the executive power to do what they like in this matter hereafter. We may take it that the Bill does not contemplate the immediate establishment of a naval force of any description, and I do not go with those honourable members who think that we ought not to have any navy at all, unless we can set up one of our own. It seems ridiculous to argue that because we cannot run ships of our own, we should not have any at all. I believe that the ships provided for us by the Home Government are furnished at a ridiculously cheap rate, and that we ought to be grateful for them. Reference has been made in the course of the debate to the fact; that we have already contributed £700,000 towards the maintenance of the Australian auxiliary squadron, but supposing that we have spent such a sum, we have had in return for it the guarantee that the protection of the navy of the Empire would be at our disposal. We have had this assurance for a sum of money that would have been barely sufficient to buy a very second rate battle-shipa sum representing only half the cost of a first class battle-ship; and I think we should look at the matter in a common-sense way. Our commerce is protected fully and completely now, as we have all the .strength of the British navy at our command in the time of emergency, and the amount we pay is a very small contribution indeed. I am not mind there is nothing to quite clear that we ought not to take some immediate steps to form the nucleus of a naval defence force. I speak with bated, breath on these matters, because there are honourable members who know so much more about them from practical experience than I do, but it seems to me that we might very well t r y to form the nucleus of a defence force. I am not quite sure that I would not sooner see some step taken in the direction of forming a naval, rather than a military college, because I think that we should endeavour to train men accustomed to the use of ships, for warlike purposes if necessaiy. We should defend our forts and protect our coaling stations, of course, but what is the position of our naval brigade at present? We all know that our naval brigade is more properly a land force dressed up in naval uniform than anything else. We have no ships for them to practise with, and they can get no training on the water, and we might make a commencement in this matter by endeavouring to bring about a better attitude on the part of the Home Government on the question of the naval training of our men here. Por instance, why should not our men be allowed to go on board some of the warships in our harbors in order that they might be put through the minutiae of naval drill. I do not see why England should not send out some of her warships that are not quite up to sailing away to give the enemy battle, in order to afford our men the opportunity of having instilled into their minds the rudiments of training in naval warfare. AU these matters might be arranged at very little cost indeed, and we might make a beginning in the training of our men in «the arts of naval warfare in a manner that is not possible at present. ships of its own ; there are two in Queensland and one in South Australia. member has only to name the ships in order to show at once that he is joking. TheB ill before us seems to contemplate the continuance of military caste, and the continuance also of unbusiness-like methods as aj)plied to military matters. What we want to do, perhaps, more than anything else is to exercise a better and more acute business-like control over defence matters. I believe that we could get more efficiency than we have hitherto attained without exceeding our present expenditure. Sir Robert Giffen the other day wrote an article in one of the magazines on the question of a business war office, and I think we have need to betake ourselves to the learning of a similar lesson here. I remember sitting on a military commission in Sydney recently, and the one thing that was borne in upon our minds more than anything else was that in the defence affairs of our own State-and I dare say it is much the same in other Statesthere seemed to be an utter lack of the application of those business principles that we follow in all our ofcher affairs in l if e ; and if we could organize our Defence department on more business-like lines, we could not fail to achieve a higher degree of efficiency, even though we incurred no more expense. I believe that our militia should not be abolished, but that on tlie contrarj' they should be encouraged, and should exist side by side with the volunteers. The difference betweenfchetwo forces afc present seems to be largely a matter of temperament. There are many men who would not join the partially-paid forces, but who would gladly become members of a volunteer corps, and, on tlie other hand, there are men who would prefer to be paid for their services. It seems to me that the two forces can very well go on, side by side, in friendly rivalry, or harmony, or whatever it may be termed, under our present conditions, at any rate. In this way, we should, as individuals, discharge our moral -and legal obligations in regard to the defence of the EmpireI mean by the payment of our partially-paid men. If we have no conscription, our liability and responsibility as individuals are as great as if we had, and surely the men who give up their time and attention and leisure hours to the cultivation of the arts of defence, are entitled to some return if they care to take it . Therefore, I would not abolish tlie partially-paid forces, but would rather encourage them side by side with tlie volunteer forces. The Bil l appears to mefcoprovide for an administration that would be too much' centralized. Por instance, I find that a sergeant cannot be appointed without reference to the district commandant. Surely the commander of a company ouglit to have the power fco single out a man and appoint him as a sergeant, and, consistently with a unified control of the whole army, -we should do well to .allow the responsibility for details of administration to rest upon the subordinate officers as far as possible. I think clause 15 of the Bill might be altered in a way that would be very beneficial to the service as a whole. It is provided at present that a man may enter the service in an official capacity, that is to say he may become an officer, without undergoing any examination beforehand. It is at this initial point that so many men, who",48,Forrest

It is a distinction which ought to be abolished. We should pay them both alike when they are performing the same kind of duty. Social influence exercises an ill effect upon our forces at the present time. We were told at the military inquiry which we conducted in New South Wales, by a man high in the command of our forces, that the reason why many of the officers were selected for the command of the men who went to South Africa was because they belonged to good families. Youngsters of twenty years of age, who lacked all previous training, were sent away as officers, whilst old, seasoned, trained men, who were anxious to go, were set aside. The only reason which could be assigned for this indefensible action when ifc was inquired into, was thafc some of tlie youngsters belonged to good families ? orable member that 1 in command in New South Wales. at tbe inquiry.

In other cases men were set aside who there was reason to believe had every qualification, and had passed very that when a volunteer severe military tests. military officer who was sent away behaved well. nevertheless, the statement which I have Why the permanent mentioned was deliberately made before tlie committee. In my judgment no man ought to gain a military command simply because he has social relations in the State services. The only test should be that of merit. Whether a man comes from the ranks or is of high birth matters not. So long as he has the qualifications to lead, he is fche man who ought to conduct operations in warfare. That is the class of man upon whom we must rely if we are to have an efficient force.

Buti t occurs to me that we cannot do better than take lessons from those who have already seen' actual warfare. Only the other day Colonel Kelly came back to tell us that one lesson which the war had taught him was the absolute necessity of being equipped with modern arms.

186,""" Mr Joseph Cook","I believe t h a t ;to cultivate the art of good shooting, we shall by consequence lay ourselves out for tbe steady and persistent encouragement of our. rifle clubs. We shall do for them immensely more than we have ever tried to accomplish in tlie history of these States. If we encourage our men to the fullest possible extent to become good shots, we shall be laying broad and deep the 'first' foundation for a good sound national defence. I believe we should begin early in this matter. believe that we should begin with the cadets, and train them up to the use of the rifle in sucli a way as to make them proficient marksmen by the time they have reached manhood. Without the necessity for conscription and simply by relying upon the encouragement given to to tfye voluntary spirit which is within us all-the spirit to defend our hearths and homes-w e can build up a defence which will make us impregnable tb all outside powers, and give us a defence which shall be adequate to all immediate purposes. In addition to cultivating accurate marksmanship, we should absolutely lay it down in this measure that all positions in our defence force shall be open to whoever cares to aspire to them. When we have done that, and brought to bear a business-like aptitude in tlie administration of our defence office, we shall have done all that our immediate requirements seem to demand. The ideal to be kept in view can be stated in a very few words. While steadily pursuing our ideal of peace, we should at the same time be prepared to defend our Empire, if needed. listening for the past couple of months to some of the great military speeches which have been delivered, I feel to-night that I am a military man. The fact of the matter is that I think T am upon horseback. Indeed, it has seemed to me as I have sat here from day to day listening to these splendid military orations, that we were almost iu an eternal struggle for our own national existence. Yes: I can hear the shots from the Japanese guns. . jections. Mr O'MALLEY -Really, it seems to me that we can hear to-day the sounds of military preparations. been reading the Argus again. Mr O'MALLEY -Tli e Argus! As that is politically a negligible quantity its barking has no more effect upoii me than has the bite of the Australian flea upon the tail of the American eagle. However, it seems tome that we can almost hear the music of the boisterous drums; yes, the silver voices of heroic bugles calling our military men from the hills, the mountains, the dales, and thevalleys. Yes, I can see vast multitudes I gathered together listening to the impassioned orations of heroic orators calling upon the people to defend their country against tlie invasion of rabbits and bandicoots. ReallyI must confess that for 30 years I heard the same cry in the United States, "" We are going to have an invasion."" When I lived in Mexico, I heard the same cry that I hear now in Australia, "" Somebody is going to invade us. We cannot tell which nation it is, but surely some nation is coming."" Ever since I have been in Australia, a period of thirteen years-wit h the exception of tbe little time that I spent in TasmaniaI have heard the same cry of "" an invasion,"" bufc the only invasions that I ever read of are invasions of rabbits. To-night, therefore, just for a few moments, I want to dwell upon the reason of this thing. I take ifc that this is a democratic governmentI take it that it is resting on justice, that it is regulated by law, and that there are a reasonable lot of people to manage the affairs of this country. That is the way it looks to me; but, perhaps, I am mistaken. Let us look afc the Bil l which is before us. It is absolutely f u l l of the wildness and sublimity of romancemilitary romance. But ifc is just a little too strenuous to quite satisfy the ideals of the romantic military people. These are not the days of Napoleon nor of Hannibal, neither are they the days of Alexander. The nations cannot sneak an army into a country now Before that army starts they send a wire. Before ever they start somebody sends a wire-som e newspaper m a n to tell us that they are coming. of course. Mr O'MALLEY -Yes certainly. Before they are on the ship another wire w ill come"" The Japanese army have started."" All we want is a national police force. I remember that one time when I was in England an Englishman said to me, "" Supposing that Lord Wolseley. landed in New York to-morrow with 200,000 red coats,",51,Forrest

If they landed at Carpentaria they would eat themselves i -out of house and home before they got half way to Port Augusta. I do hope that the Australian j>eople are reasonable. I understand that reasoning with men who have renounced their reason is like administering medicine to dead cats. But I know honourable members are intelligent, and that is why I talk to them. ""WouldI be in this Housei f I had not confidence that I .should meet a lot of reasonable men here ? Long before an army sailed from Japan or China should we not have the news of their intended departure? members know the very morning upon which the American army sailed for Cuba1 D i d they not know it upon 13th April, 1897 ? Did we not know at Kalgoorlie, -and did not I have to give an announcement that tlie Americans had won? I did not get a wire. There was no trouble .about that at all. I knew that tlie Americans would win, because we belonged to the Anglo-Celtic people. What is your British babe-h e wants to fight from the -very start. Then why talk about not being able to fight the Japanese? They have to bring -coal and provisions upon their ships. Look at thetrouble which Admiral Dewey had to get munitions, supplies, .and coal with which to go to Manila. If the British had not allowed him to get his supplies of coal in Hong Kong before he was ordered to clear out under a sort of -understood veiled threat business, where would the Americans have been at Manilla?

Let us as look at the matter from another stand-point. Suppose the foe lands at any of these places, If the Japanese landed here we they have to live. Where are they going to get thensupplies from ? How are they to live ? Are they to live on rabbits t ill they can get into civilized parts ? It is preposterous to talk of an invasion of Australia. There is another little point bearing on this matter, and that is in regard to training. I have done with the question of invasion, because I do not think there is any nation in the world which could invade us. Three or four hundred of us went to South America to take tbe Mosquito Kingdom, but we found that they were too strong for us, and we did not attack them. We recognise that every nation that trades' with another has an interest in that nation. Did not honourable The Americans are getting a big trade in Australia, and even if Great Britain were not able to face the music when an enemy threatened, the United States would step in and say"" No! We have a little trade out there, -and you cannot interfece."" D i d I not talk to fche United States admiral in the Town-hall here, and did he not say"" These are a great people, and I regret that we do not get more trade out here."" That was his first thought. I say right here that there is no fear of any invasion, and I We are a fighting people. do hopefchatwe shall not go in for a military oligarchy. Every great democracy that has been crushed has been crushed by military despotism-by the ""man on horseback."" I admit that war wastes 'the accumulation of the people. A few men grow into great opulence and wealth and great importance, but it casts a great gloom over the vast multitude of the people. They recognise that they have to pay the taxes. We do not want a military despotism, or the ""man on horseback,"" in Australia, and that is why I suggested the other day that the only uniform which the men ought to wear was a button on the shoulder. If we do away with the feathers, if we do away with spurs-and I have often seen the spurs worn by these military men tear the dresses of the ladies, with whoni fchey dance-w e take all the military glory out of these chaps. If they want to earn their living _ by butchering, instead of developing industries for the advanceof the people, let them go at it ; but I am going to oppose any system that has an idea of establishing in this country any sort of a military organization which is going to interfere with the people. United States they have regiments of millionaires' sons, and barracks, and guns. They have two or three hundred thousand men there under"" the volunteer That is a most dangerous system to a democracy.. feather flock together, and when there is trouble you will see them crossing the stream together. "" Don't swap horses while you are crossing 'the stream !"" But we do not consider that we have any streams here to cross. I believe in a drill system. ing the young men a little discipline, so as to make men of them. I wish we had every larrikin in Melbourne in a barracks for a couple of months, anyhow, once a year. The country boys will join, and will learn something about military discipline, but the vast multitudes in the cities will not do so. We could have our (Mil-masters ing out into every town and teaching the young fifteen should be compulsory to close up their places of business and to go out and drill on the squares on those particular afternoons. have travelled the United States since the Spanish war find that it is a great drill camp. Prom the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the snow-capped regions of the Arctic north, it is one great camp. In fact they are even drilling the women That is all we need in this country. simply want to train men so that they can march and countermarch, and then teach them to have confidence and self-reliance. Once we have done that, there can be no danger of invasion. military spending thousands of pounds of the people's money, or of loan money. I am going to oppose loans. Let us tax ourselves to meet tbe future, and not go on mortgaging posterity, because it is not we who pay; we only pay the interest, and we hand down the payment of the principal. build up this what will be the result ? In two or three years it will be obsolete. We have this new submarine 'cigar-shaped which slips under tlie ocean for twelve or Mr O'Malley. fifteen hours and blows up our big warships, and we may have an army in balloons dropping lyddite on our cities before long. What does it mean? In the Let us put all this aside and establish a national police force. If we have drill masters we can send them into the country to drill the men to fire the enemy out. system. Then we should have a national gauge of railways. If we had a war at Cooktown, by Why is it so ? Birds of a the time that the Queensland army would be defeated the New South Wales army would get to the line, but the Victorian and Abraham Lincoln saidSouth Australian armies would be playing hookey and quoits at Albury, waiting for trains. Such would be possible Under the present system. And yet we hear of all this I believe in teachmilitary glory. I want Australia to rest on industry and love, and on intelligent application to progress-no t on military despotism, and not on cunning or violenceso that we shall all work together to advance this country to be the great country that every one is talking about. goThe honourable member who has just sat down has thrown quite a new light on some men on twelve or of the subjects relating to defence, and I afternoons a year, and it think 'there is a good deal in many of his for the men remarks. I am not going to deal with them now. I do not want to touch on the details of the Bill or on the very many interesting Those who points in connection with military matters that have been raised during the debate. This has been a most interesting debate. I have listened to the greater part of it patiently, and have enjoyed the tone of the speeches. I certainly think it would be difficult to have speeches couched in a more there. democratic strain' than we have heard or We which On the whole could be in better taste. They were filled generally with ideas of Iof ty patriotism, and a determination to go in for such defences as will best enable Australia to work out her own career. The debate If we set up a great has been of an exceptionally democratic establishment, it will mean nature. We have had speeches in which it has been laid down that we ought to have a citizen soldiety. Old-world military ideas are to be completely discarded; everything is to be up to date. We are-starting a new nation and a new defence force with it. AVe are not trammelled by old conditions, If we and we have the advantage of a recent great military system war-fough t with modern weapons and modern armaments for the first time-for our guidance. The question that has been ship occurring to me right through is, "" How are we going to get all these democratic notions",52,Forrest
192,Mr Batchelor (South Australia),"of ours within the four comers of the Bill""? That is the difficulty. I see nothing of these democratic proposals in the Bill. It has been described as a skeleton measure. It is not more than two or three years since a measure almost exactly similar was introduced in the South Australia Legislature by the right honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs, Sergeant Kingston. That Bill was introduced before the Boer war, before the advantages of a citizen soldiery had been proved, and before federation at all, so that the similarity between the two measures has not failed to impress me. drawn up half-a-century ago ? half-a-century ago. It was only two or three years ago. that belong to half-a-century ago. point out is, that although the speech delivered by the Minister for Defence himself in introducing the Bill was democratic, if we pass the Billi n its present form we shall pass it on lines precisely the same as those we should have adopted before these latest democratic ideas took possession of us. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The must withdraw the Bill. ment withdraw the BillI am afraid that when they set to work to t r y and find out what kind of measure will be acceptable to the majority of the honourable members they will have a difficult task. I am not suggesting fco fchem that they should withdraw it . AVhatI want to say is that really the whole thing depends on administration. As a skeleton it might do very well with some alterations, ashave been suggested by the honorable member for Northern Melbourne and others, whose amendments I shall certainly feel impelled to support. The whole Bill depends upon administration, and I have been wondering whether we can trust the present Government to administer the Bill in the spirit in which this House has certainly shown, by the speeches delivered, that ifc desires that the military affairs of tbe country should be conducted. A t the head of the administration we have the Righfc Honourable Sir John Forrest, who, unfortunately, has not been present to hear the speeches upon the Bill. member for Eden-Monaro would not like to place the penalty upon his bitterest enemy of reading all the speeches made in Parliament. It will, however, be the duty of the Minister to read the speeches on this subject. argument for the Minister to read. of tlie honourable member who has just resumed his seat, for instance, would require the services of a very expert shorthand artist to convey them properly. I hope the Minister for Defence will carefully read the speeches made upon this Bill, because the House and the country are absolutely t determined upon having the military affairs of. the Commonwealth conducted on more democratic lines than have hitherto been followed. I am sorry to hear to-night that the Minister, when he is travelling about, has a guard of honour at every place he visits. That looks as if the simplicity we desire to see introduced into our military affairs is not likely to be carried out. his Court dress ? the right honourable gentleman at tlie celeGovernment brations connected with the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament, and certainly he was the mos,t gorgeous in all that dazzling throng. But I can to some extent tcust the Minister for Defence-because he is full of practical .common sense-to discard this kind of thing when he starts out to administer the department. One thing the Government have done which makes it look to me as if they really did not mean what they have said about having a citizen soldiery,, wherein every man from the lowest rank will have a clear opportunity of rising up to> the position of a general. If we had local administration by men who understood the conditions prevailing in Australia, and who had been trained in the work of governing a citizen soldiery, there would bea probability of what we have been promised in that respect, and in the direction-, of a reduction of the expenditure connected! with the high positions, being realized. But, as a matter of fact, we find that the Government have sent to England for an Imperial officer, trained under Imperial conditions, and knowing notliing of tlie conditions prevailing in Australia.

203,Mr Batchelor,"I recollect seeingam mistaken, bnt I am assuming, from what I have seen in the newspapers, that we are to have an Imperial officer, possibly with South African experience, but who at any rate has been brought up under a system which has utterly failed, and which has to be entirely reorganized in order that it may meet the needs of tlie times. We have seen, with some regret, in connection with the British Military department, the spectacle of a squabble between the late Commander-in-Chief of the army and the political heads of the War Officei n Parliament, as to who is responsible for all tbe mistakes which have occurred lately. But although that organization has failed, we are going to it for a man whom we expect to come here and rule our citizen soldiery under conditions of which he can. necessarily have had no experience whatever. Can we expect such an officer to discard elaborate uniforms and do away with all the flummery, frippery, and froppery that so much hinder real efficiency in military matters ? Seeing that the Government propose to go outside the States of Australia altogether, and to import some officer who -cannot be conversant with what we desire to. see brought about, it is idle for us to make democratic speeches on military matters embodying ideas which cannot be very well embodied in the Bill. regret that we have to discuss a B ill like this at all. Certainly, in the opening session England had not had possession of the ports of this Parliament, there was quite enough work for us to do in regard to other matters without having this Bill brought in. I 'take this opportunity of expressing my exception to it, because it is perfectly clear that the time that will be occupied in the discussion of this measure will leave us so -much less opportunity for the discussion of other Billsi f they are to be brought before Parliament before Christmas. But the Bill having been introduced, it is incumbent upon us to consider it . In the first place I have no hesitation in saying that the Bill has been drawn by officers belonging to the old school of aggression instead of we must have a business man at the head to the school of defence. It is only with the school of defence that, I believe, Australia wishes to deal. Certainhonorablemem""bers have expressed the idea that we ought to take our part in the defence of the Empire. I altogether protest against that opinion. We have nothing whatever to do with the -defence of the Empire while we have no voice in regard to the wars that the. Empire takes upon itself. It might be a different thing if we had such a voice. A t tlie present time all that we can be expected to do is to provide for the defence of our local forts and to guard against invasion. Beyond that we are not called upon to do anything, nor should we advance beyond it . It is quite possible that the High Commissioner for Australia, when he is established in London, may at some time be required to notify to a nation with which England happens to be at war, that Australia will not engage in the contest, but will hold itself as a neutral body. Holding that view as strongly as I do, it seems to me to be clear that all we have to do is to provide for the defence of our shores. If the. last war in which Great Britain has engaged has taught us anything at all, it is .that no nation can well be invaded. Invasion to-day is an extremely different thing to what it was a few years ago. It must be remembered also, that although we are a continent in size, we are still an island, and that all troops coming here for the purposes of invasion would have to be transported in ships. If honourable members really consider what war is under present conditions, they will realize that if twenty transports were to come and t i y and land soldiers on our shores they could not land a single man, and that 50 or 60 riflemen on the shore could hold that force at bay: If in South Africa, she would not, even with her powerful navy, have been able to land a single man. We have seen 30,000 soldiers barred by a single river like the Tugela. Surely we should learn lessons from facts like that; and if-the military men will not learn the lessons themselves, and are so' wrapped up in their own ideas of war that modern instances have no weight with them, we must set them aside. Mr O'MAXLEY -We want .a business man at the head of our defence force. member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, says, of the army; we must, at all events, have men who will not refuse to learn lessons from events that have occurred under our eyes. One clear and distinct lesson is that invasion is hardly possible so long as the people rely upon themselves, and have the courage that may be expected from a worm, which, we are told, will always turn.",55,Forrest
204,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),I very much,56,Forrest
205,Mr Conroy,"As tlie honorable and shot, too. would give the Government power to get the very best arms and ammunition that can be bought. I would also allow the creation of two kinds of corps that cannot be established in a day. The first is an engineering corps, which is much needed in time of war. From personal knowledge of engineering officers"" who have served infcheTransvaal, I can say that in war, as in everything else, common sense rules the day, and those officers who possessed common sense were far more useful than any one else. The second corps that needs to be established is an artillery force. Men need to be trained in the use of artillery, and you cannot have artillerymen springing up at a moment's notice; although fche Boer war has shown us, even in this respect, that men can rapidly learn to use artillery so as to become ecpial to the most experienced artillerymen in the world. It has been proved that bush gunners have been far more useful in war than men trained at Shoeburyness, Aldershot, or anywhere else. I only say bhat in this spirit-that tlie man who is fighting for his home, and who is used to the country for which he is fighting, is capable of rendering a very good account of himself in conflicts with the enemy. Bad as the war has been in South Africa, I am convinced that no nation except Great Britain could have undertaken it at all, because no nation except Great Britain could have transported the troops to the scene of battle; and I am sure that the troops of otbev nations would have gone down, in the same way as our men did in the early battles. What we have to fight against is the introduction of what I may call tbe trained military system. I was myself at one time a volunteer, and having some knowledge of the use of the rifle I on one occasion happened to proclaim rather too loudly the opinion that, given 1,000 bush irregular troops, I would beat 10,000 of the best trained men who ever went into the field. So much exception was taken to thafc statement by my brother officers that I felt I could not work with men who held the idea that troops should be massed together in a body where they could be shot down by a few riflemen. That is one of the reasons why I withdrew from the corps. The old idea of officers, f u l l of their I so that men who could not join unless they [224] ideas of drill, was to keep their men massed together. How would it be possible to mass men together if any invasion took place 1 The first order given is to get as far apart as possible to avoid rifle firing. Experience has taught us that we ought to give up unnecessary drill. I agree with bhe honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, that the Bill appears to have been drawn up in 1896 or 1897-perhap s by Sergeant Kingston-and embodies the ideas which were then current. I suppose one of the worse things that can happen to a man is to be trained to military pursuits. The stories which we hear from South Africa of the officers trained in the English military schools almost exceed belief, and tlie honourable member for Parramatta stated that even in New Soufch Wales positions have been given to certain men on account of their family influence. An officer who has returned from South Africa told me that he woidd prevent any man who could even remember that he had a grandfather from holding a commission, and it behoves us to do all we can to put an end to the nonsense and tommy-rot which has grown up in connection with fche military forces of the Empire. This officer told me, among other illustrations which he gave of the peculiarities of English officers, that he heard a man who was in command of a considerable body of troops, and is still in active service, complain in affected tones, "" I came out here without enough toothpicks, and I cannot get any here that I like."" What folly it is to train men like fchafc. Mr O'MALLEY -They are merely dancingmasters. of the English officers themselves said to an Australian officer, "" Do not go away with the idea that all English officers are fools."" ""No,"" said the Australian officer, "" m y father came from England, and he was not a fooi; but I should like to know where some of these officers come from."" The reply was, "" I do not know, but it seems to me that every influential family in England has opened the door of its private idiot asylum and got its members positions in the army."" We want to do away with that sort of tiling. All thafc is necessaiy here is some system for the calling of men together in the case of emergency. This could be done in a week or a fortnight. I do not object to the formation of militia regiments,",56,Forrest

208,Mr Conroy,"I understand that onereceived a certain amount of pay may become members of our defence force; but I hope that our defence will be conducted mainly by volunteer regiments. ' If people will not fight for their country, in a spirit of patriotism, in time of invasion, they should be wiped off the face of the earth, and another race should take their place. But to resist invasion, no such thing as drill is wanted. War is coining back to a state of things in which the mind must triumph. One hundred men with brains, and skilled in the use of the rifle, will be equivalent to 10,000 men who have been trained by rote, and whose power of initiation has been drilled out of them. In the framing of provisions for the retirement of officers at certain ages, those who are responsible for the Bill seem to have lost sight of the fact that some of our volunteer regiments largely owe their existence to the popularity of the man at tbe head of them. I could name afc least two instances of the kind in New South Wales, where tlie public spirit of the colonel and the interest he takes would add enormously to the expense of the in everything appertaining to the advancement of his regiment are responsible for its strength and efficiency, and there must be many other such cases. thafc the honourable and learned member knows of ? South AVales Lancers for one, b\jt I am not anxious to give names, because there may be other instances of the kind with which I am not familiar. If the Government aid -the rifle clubs, they will do almost all that is necessary for our defence. I do nofc think that there should be any permanent men, except such as are necessary for manning particular forts. To show the absurdity of official recommendations, I would point to the fact that it has been proposed fchat the Commonwealth should fortif y Thursday Island. That might be very well if we had a fleet, but as we have no fleet, and are intent only upon fighting in our own defence, the proposal seems an absurd one. Then ifc has been suggested that the enemy might land at Port Darwin or other places of the kind, but it is forgotten that if they did so, it . would cost them ten times as much fco prosecute fche war as it would cost us to repel them. If they held such a place for a short time then, they would find themselves in such bad straits, that they would soon wish to gefc away. I think that if we see that ports, such as Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide ancl Newcastle could not be entered by boats straight away and the formation of a corps of submarine miners ; and a few torpedo boats would be sufficientfor tbe purpose-w e should do all that is required. Bay? enemy of 50,000 men would land, there, because once they disembarked they would never be able to get away. They would never be able to find their way even to Monaro, which is reminiscent of many recollections to the honourable member. knows nothing of the sharp-shooters there. for Eden Monaro, in mentioning Twofold Bay, has shown why even Monaro should nofc be chosen as the federal capital j because if we have to fortify thafc port it federal government. I am sure that any man who really understands what war is will see how impossible it is for any nation to bring a body of men there. Once the men landed they could never get away, and they could not force an entrance into Sydney. They would be unable, once they disembarked, to gefc away, because a very few sharp-shooters could clear them all out. We have seen already how small an impression artillery can make against riflemen, especially when protected by pibs, and we know that ships of war could not carry sufficient stores. I am sorry that nobody has moved an amendment that the Bill be read a second time this day six months. When I consider the spirit in which it is drawn, how much its authors have dwelt on the past, and how unable they have been to take fche lessons of the Boer war; how, in fact, they have declined to profit by the experience which all other nations have gained, even if we have not I should have been only too glad if some one had moved that its second reading be postponed until this day six months, and I would have voted accordingly. with the contention thatfchisis not a very important Bill.

I . am with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, in the expression of regret fchat we cannofc incorporate the ideal type of militarism in a measure of this kind which we would like. But by means of discussion and by amendments where we can see our way to introduce them, we may be able to bring about the constitution of a federal form of defence on those lines which we think will accord wifch our democracy and with the principles of a good, efficient, and effective defence. We were led to suppose that the B ill was fche outcome of the united wisdom of the leading commanders in Australia or the military authorities. But we have been informed to-night that it is practically a reprint of a Bill which was introduced by a former Premier of South Australia, Mr Kingston, who now fills an important position in this Parliament. I find that this contention is largely borne out by a document which came into my hands to-day. It is entitled "" A Further Report of the Pederal Military Commifcfcee,"" and in the 4th section they sayAs the principles embodied in the Bill drafted by the committee have been repeatedly altered, and continuous, and whose payment will beas their recommendations on the alterations prein accordance with certain prescribed rules. viously submitted to them, which were forwarded Then there is to be a purely volunteer force, to t l | | Minister on the 15th instant have not whose services will not be continuous, and been adopted in the draft submitted to them on to whom no payment will be made except in the 20th instant, they consider it unnecessary to repeat their former objections, which in their times of warfare. Power is also given to the opinion still hold good. They therefore respectauthorities to establish rifle clubs and to fully request that if the Bill is brought before fche form cadet corps. The principle is also .

This is a report which was submitted by jects, and between the ages of 18 and the military experts, who were asked fco 60, shall be subject to be called upon to advise fche Governmentupon the Bill. perform nnlitaiy service. First of all the From what little experience I have had of unmarried men between the ages of IS militarism, I do not think a Bill which and 30 are to be called upon, then those-, would recommend itself fco military experts between the ages of 30 and 45, then the such as we have had in the States up to the married men and widowers without present time, is likely to be acceptable children either to myself or to others who take a more and democratic stand on this matter. I quite between the ages of 45 and 60.. agree with those, speakers who have conThe provision that these men may be called tended that the militarism with which we upon to take up arms in time of need seems have been acquainted largely a repetito me to introduce that obnoxious Contition of that which obtains in the old country nental system of conscription, and in so far and in the old world,-is a militarism which as it goes in that particular direction, I does not harmonize with our ideas of freeshall oppose it. I am opposed to any form of dom and democracy, is a militarism which conscription, no matter in what shape it maywould be inimical to that freedom and fchafc present itself. I believe that, in a countrydemocracy which we are so desirous of which is well governed, the patriotism) building up in this new nation. A t the same time, we cannot gefc away from the fact fchafc we must have some form of defence, that we must make provision against dangers which may assail us from without, because I bold that it is cnly from without fchat dangers are possible. That being so, the next consideration we have is fco devise that form of national defence which will harmonize with our free institutions-wit h our democratic ideals-and , at the same time,, secure for us that protection which is necessary, and which we are striving to obtain. The question arises-wha t form should that kind of defence take ? The Bill proposes, first of all, thafc the form of defence shall rest in an active service which shall be constituted, a certain reserve force withdrawn from it , the formation of rifle clubs and the formation of cadets, presumably amongst our schools and so forthOur defence forces are to consist firstly of' permanent men, who are to give uscontinuous service, who are to devote themselves wholly and solely to military matters, and whose-salaries and keep are to be a charge upon the Commonwealth. It is also proposed toestablish a militia whose services will not bea period of six months, who are British subbetween the ages of. 18-45, and finally the men of the people will be sufficient to call forth voluntary service in its defence sufficier.it to meet its requirements. If a country is so badly governed that the people believe that they will be better off under a foreign yoke, conscription is not going to save it; and if the people are so degenerate that they require compulsion in the form of conscription to take the place of patriotism, then they are in a condition in which conscription will not -save them. T believe that this is a retrograde movement on the part of those who framed the Bill, and that it isproposing to impose upon tbe free people and institutions of this Commonwealth the methods -and measures of the old world that ought to have been swept intooblivion long ago. ""We should look upon our military defence as something in the shape of an insurance against possible loss, and deal with it accordingly. miums we are to pay for that protection are not of such a character that the benefits to ""be derived will practically cease to be benefits for a minimum we get a maximum amount of efficiency and protection. shall have as small a permanent force as possible, and shall depend for our protection mainly upon citizen soldiery in the most effioient'and best equipped form. We should make our insurance against the risks oi invasion as cheap as possible for the whole community. Federal Government we are hampered in many ways, and particularly in the direction of raising money to defray the cost of the Pederal Government. We have to face that wretched provision, the 87th section of the Constitution Act, known as the Braddon blot, which requires us to raise so much money for purely State purposes, in addition to that required for federal and the larger our expenditure for defence purposes, the heavier will be tbe burdens of taxation on the people, and the greater will be the general dissatisfaction with respect to our federal form of government. want to avoid anything of that kind, and, therefore, our expenditure in the direction of defence and other matters must, for the next ten years, be kept down to a minimum. With regard to the direction which our defence movement should take, some honourable members say that our defence operations should be confined to Australia, and that we should only concern ourselves with Mr Brown. land defences, making no provision for operations beyond our own. shores. I disagree entirely with that ""contention. We ' ace a part and parcelof the British Empire, and our. location is such that if we wish to have an effective defence we must be prepared to strike a blow outside of our own borders, and not wait until the enemy bas obtained a footing on our shores. I would go a step further and say that the commercial interests and the freedom and tlie true progress of the people of this Commonwealth are so bound up wifch the parent stock that we must lookat this matter from the stand-point of the Empire as well as from the Standpoint of our own Commonwealth. There is a good deal in fche contention thafc we should, have a voice in the making of war. ""We may wish to have some say in the matter; but wars are We should see that tlie prenofc made by us or by the British Empire for the mere sake of war. Wars are forced upon us, and tlie main question we have to consider is, are these wai-s vital to the at all. We should see that Empire as a whole or not ? If wars are amount of premium vital to the Empire as a whole, then I say that we, the peoples of the Commonwealth, If we set up this ideal we must take a hand in them for our own protection and for our own liberty, and we must be prepared to consider the position from that stand-point as well as the standpoint of mere local defence. Another reason why we should look, at fche matter from the naval as well as from the land defence stand-point At the commencement of our is that we have an enormous commerce. We are looking to the outside of our own territorial bounds for the consumption of our surplus goods. In comparison with our population, I suppose that we carry on as large a commerce as does any nation. If we are to maintain that commerce, and if . it is essential to our progress and welfare, it is necessary that we should do something to expenditure, protect it. AVe are not going to protect it by creating an armed soldiery within our shores, and by confining their operations to ""OUT territory. In this connection I may mention that in a work on The Federal We Defence of Australasia, by Craig, which is published in the old land, tbe figures relating to our commerce are brought up to 1895. I find there that the British commerce in that year totalled in value somethingKlte£9.70,000,000. Of this amount, the self-governing States of thisCommonwealtli practically contributed about £143,000,000 per annum, or one-seventh of the total commerce of the Empire. As against that sura, the cost of the British navy which protects and maintains this commerce amounts to something like £20,000,000 per annum, of which these States contribute about £268,000. other words, the States, while having about one-seventh of the total commerce of the Empire, only contribute about 1-7 5th of tbe cost of protecting and maintaining that commerce. The mother country contributes the remaining 74-75ths, or about £19,700,000. of the question which, in estimating the form of defence into which we should launch, we should be very short-sighted, indeed, if we overlooked. The same work goes on to deal with the exports of the States. It shows to what extent those exports are carried on with the motherland with the -different colonies, and with foreign countries. Ifc is summed up on page 39, where the writer saysThe Australian colonies are a proud part of the armies become .a drain upon the resources of Imperial Empire, second only in trade and wealth fco India. The past and present progress of Austhe countiy in every possible form, without tralia is nothing to what ifc will be iufchefuture. returning anything by way of compensation, The imports aud exports between fche United except as a sort of insurance, as a kind of Kingdom and her colonies are greater than thafc guarantee against outside aggression, if that with foreign countries. They totalize £50,000,000 for imports, and £1)0,000,000 for exports. The should ever threaten them. That is the imports from home ports showed 32 per cent., kind 54 per cent, of intercolonial imports, aud 14 per authorities ""seem inclined to impose upon cent, from ofcher countries. The proportion exus. I do not know what the experience of ported to England amounted to 42 per cent., to other colonies 44 per cent.., and 16 per cent, to the ofcher States has been, but our exofcher countries. These figures briefly indicate fche extent to the efforts of our high military adviserswhich we are doing business wibh bhe have been wholly in tlie direction of mother country, the extent of our oversea creatingfchenucleus of a standing army in business, and of our business with foreign our midst-of getting together a number powers. Those who say that the operaof men whose special qualification and tions of our defence forces should be purpose in life should be militarism. Anyconfined bo bhe limits of the Commonthing in tbe nature of a citizen soldiery wealth seem to lose sight of the has been regarded by these military important fact of bhe wealth of our nation. experts as inefficient, and has been They do not seem to realize fchat we should discouraged as much as possible. Those look beyond OUT own coastline if we are to military experts and fchis prevalent idea protect our wealth and our people to the f ull of defence have recently received a rude extent that is necessaiy. If we are going 'shock in South Afiica. to do justice all round, tlie burden which the result of the experience gained there has hitherto fallen upon the mother countay will be to show thab these old-world ideas musb be borne by her children so long as are about worn out, and thab after all a bhey are prepared to share with her in the citizen soldier is not such bad advantages derived from fchis source of terial for fighting purposes, as we were led creating wealth. The only way in which I to suppose prior to that event. If bhe price can .see that this can be done is by mainof bhe defence of the Commonwealth of taining within our own waters, if nofc Australia is to be tbe creation of a large costly war vessels-to which objections have standing army, consisting of a large number been raised on tlie ground bhab they are of men whose whole idea and purpose in no sooner constructed than they become life is merely militarism, who contribute obsolete-a t least some torpedo-boats, that will enable us to do our fair share in defending the wealth that we are sending from and bringing to our shores, and which In goes bo create our national prosperity. It is my firm opinion bhab we are working on safe nabural lines when we work in kainiony wibh the mother country, as far as it is possible for us so to do. Our land defence and the equipment of our soldiery is a matter which more particularly affects ourThis is an aspect selves, and in which, under the central conti'ol of bhe Federal Governmenb, we oughb bo attain a higher degree of efficiency at a, less cost than we have been able to attain hitherto. The old world idea of militarism) considers that bhe besb form of defencebhe besb sysbem of militarism-is bhab which drafbs the flower of the oouufcry from the avocations of production, from practical citizenship into large standing armies, where men are really converted into parts of a huste milibarv machine. The sfcaudinsr of defence which our military perience in New South Wales is that I trusb that manothing to the development of the resources of the country, and who are a burden on the taxpayer, then I say, "" No kind of militarism like that for me."" I -believe thafc ifc will be necessary to have a -certain number of men devoting themselves to military purposes so as to secure efficiency for the rank and file of the citizen soldiery, bufc our permanent forces should be limited to that, and that only. We should never look to a permanent force as the main source of our defence. I am not, however, altogether in love with the proposal that a citizen soldiery should be composed purely of volunteers. I did believe that the man who was prepared to volunteer his services was, perhaps, the best man to have, but I am forced to admit from experience that has been obtained in America, and from the general trend of events there, thafc the pure volunteer is not altogether fche great -friend of democracy that we were led at one time to suppose. It is found in America, under the conditions which obtain there now, that tlie great rank and file of the toilers are unable to devote themselves to a purely volunteer movement. prevented largely not only by lack of time, but by their inability to bear the expenditure that is absolutely necessary in connection with it. The purely volunteer movement has therefore got into the hands of wealthy men, ancl is being used by those wealthy men as a means for enforcing upon the people their demands in respect of the settlement of labour disputes. found in America fchafc these wealthy volunteer soldiers are as much the enemy of the democracy of the country as the paid soldier was I can clearly forsee thafc the same conditions may be brought about here. The ideal form of citizen soldiery which I favour is that which will give an amount of State assistance sufficient to cover fche actual cost of those who take part in it. They do not want to be paid for their time, but the expenditure which they have' to incur should be covered, so that every citizen of the Commonwealth may have an opportunity of enrolling himself in the defence of his countiy ancl of securing thafc efficiency in military knowledge which the various means adopted to that end provide. In our country districts it very often happens thafc a man has to ride 15 or 20 miles to a centre in order to receive drill instruction. presence in that centre costs him two or Mr jBrowu. three shillings. Such an expenditure would not be a matter of much concern to him if it only occurred once or twice,.but when it becomes a regular and necessaiy thing, in order to obtain efficiency, it excludes a number of deserving men from tbe movement, and leaves this militarism in the hands of those who have a little more wealth at their disposal. I want to see all men placed upon an equal footing with regard to the opportunities offered to secure efficiency in this form of defence. The ideal lines on which to start a system of the character that I should like to see established, and which, I think, would accord with our democracy and free institutions, are first of all to lay the groundwork in our public schools. Let our free s'chools and colleges be the drilling grounds wherein the first principles are imparted. Necessary military knowledge would be imparted in that way, and the boys would be better scholars for it. Drill instruction should form part of the publicschool curriculum throughout tlie Commonwealth. The proposal to establish cadet corps should also They are be carried out, and a certain amount of physical training and knowledge of military movements obtained in that way. Then, again, the establishment of rifle clubs in every town and country centre should be encouraged. One of the essentials of efficiency on the battle-field an essential greater than that of the mere knowledge of military tactics-is the ability to shoot and Ifc has been to shoot straight. . It is only by the establishment of these clubs that such ability can be secured. It can be obtained in this way at very little cost to the State, and without the necessity for establishing anything in the nature of a standing army. The establishment of cadet corps, the creation of rifle clubs in town and country centres, the formation of militia or citizen soldiery regiments, with jusfc sufficient payment to cover their out-of-pocket expenses, so as to place the poor man on an equal footing with the rich man, and the formation of a small permanent force to control and give greater efficiency to the citizen soldiery-these , in my opinion, constitute the ideal form of land defence. Apointwhich has been touched uponis that of military dress. 1 agree with those honourable members who say that the plainer our military uniforms, the less expensive they are, the more they will be in harmony That means that his with our ideas of a citizen soldiery. The more expensive they are, the worse it is for that particular form of soldiery. Asi t is the man and not the dress that fights, I fail to see any great need fpr a large expenditure in that direction, or for insistlook to the great Empire to which we belong, ing that expensive uniforms shall form part of a man's equipment. Another matter I should like to see taken in hand is the establishment of a State factory for the manufacture of small arms and ammunition. There is no use having the human fighting material unless we have something for it to fight with. We must have weapons and ammunition, but so far, whilst we have good fighting material in the Commonwealth, we are lamentably deficient in this respect. The only way we can remedy that deficiency is by establishing a factory of this descripduty to fight in the defence of our tion, and I prefer to see that factory under direct Governmental or State control rather than in the hands of private enterprise. I cannot say that I am altogether in love with tlie Bill. It does not meet my ideals, and I hardly see how it is going to be amended in order to meet them. But an army is not made ou paper, and the mere passing of this Bill"" will not create an army. This is only a means by which the powers that be are enabled to bring the army together, and what we should see to is not only that our Bills are framed, bnt also that the departments are administered, on democratic lines. That will be the work that will concern this Parliament later on, when the formation of a Military department is completed. When that takes place I shall endeavour to see that the military system is in harmony with fche democratic ideals of the people of the Commonwealth, and"" with free institutions. A t the same time. I am not going to lose sight of the fact that we owe a duty to ourselves and to the Empire to which we belong, and that in fulfilling, that duty we should do justice by the old country and by ourselves. I am not goingfcobe led into limiting the military provisions to a mere land defence. I trust that the Government will realize that, in order to protect our commerce and to maintain our position, we need to look"" a little further afield. England has maintained her proud position not so much through her land forces as through her navy. Therein lies her strength, and therein will lie our strength. As far as patriotism is concerned, whilst I am a native Australian, and hold that the highest patriotism to which I or any one else can claim is to see to the defence and the promotion of fche interests of the Commonwealth which we arenow building up, I do not limit my patriotism nor my ideas of nationhood to the shores of Australasia. I ancl am prepared to work hand in hand and in harmony withfchafcEmpire to build up the future progress and welfare of tbe Commonwealth. House is not too tired of this very long debate, I should like to add a few words. I am averse to war, but I quite recognise that we must expect invasion at some time, unless we are prepared fully to repel it at any time. "" The price of liberty is eternal vigilance "" ; and it is our first and highest liberties. The ideal system of defence appears to be, first a small permanent paid force ; then a large militia; next a still larger body of cadets; and finally a huge army of volunteers. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the strength of a chain is measured by the strength of its weakest link, and the link that is going to fail us is the volunteers. It will be recollected that the honourable member for Wannon pointed out how necessary it was to keep up the spirit of the volunteers by arousing enthusiasm, but in almost the next sentence he pointed out that this was found almost impossible in actual practice. How is this to be accounted for 1 Simply because it is contrary to human nature. Men will, in times of danger whichfcheyvisibly see, make large sacrifices-an y sacrifices-in defence of their liberty; but when there is no danger apparent, they will not consent to make those small daily sacrifices which arc required to learn drill, the movements of troops, how to shoot, and the discipline of a soldier. It will be found in practice almost impossible to get a body of volunteers large enough to defend our shores. For this reason I very greatly sympathize with the views of the honourable member for West Sydney, who delivered a brilliant speech upon this Bill. I should like to see something akin to what he suggested taken in band. His idea was compulsory, short service, which should be undertaken by every able-bodied man in the Commonwealth. I sympathize with that view, which I believe is the only true solution of the military problem now before us., : Englishmen have a holy horror of compulsion, and I need hardly say that Australians have a still greater hatred of that",58,Forrest

I do not believe there is any man in the House who has another opinion on that subject. tralians to fight in another country, I decidedly oppose any such movement. If I had tlie power 1 would sell New Guinea and Solomon Islands to whomsoever liked to bid for tliem, and I would be content with the four corners of Australia. We shall have quite enough to do to fight for ourselves without thinking of extending a magnificent Empire. I think that accords with the idea of Australians. Australians generally believe that we ought to be content with Australia. 1 do not think that the great United States of America have made anything by their attempt at Empire. I do not think they will ever make anyt h in g ; on the contrary, in less than 50 years they will be very sorry that they ever went out of their own boundaries. Australia is big enough for me. I do not wish to take up the time of the House at this late hour; but I think that something ought to be done in the direction of organizing a force of volunteers. last speaker spoke as if it might be possible to raise a sufficient body of unpaid volunteers to defend the Commonwealth. If that is at all possible, it is decidedly the best movement of all, because it would not press too heavily on our finances. I think that with the assistance of our able Treasurer we could easily find money for tlie rifles and the ammunition ; but' the trouble would be in finding the millions of money required to pay the men, owing to there being such a large number. I am afraid it is rather Utopian to expect that the men would all work for nothing, so that we should attach some expenditure under that bead. But I believe that the patriotism of Australians is so great, and the value of Australian commerce is so colossal, that, even if it came to the worse, we could raise by a tax sufficient -money to inaugurate such a system as this. MrA . C. GROOM I should like to move the adjournment bf the debate if the Prime Minister will consent. External Aifoirs) -I think we may consent to the adjournment of the debate at this hour, although it is a few minutes earlier than usual. A f t e r my honourable friend has finished his speech to-morrow, I hope that honourable members will not take it ill of me or think that I am wearying them if I add a few remarks to au already long deW it h regard to calling out Ausbate.

It would be very convenient if honourable members had some idea as to the sequence of business, so that they might come prepared. . MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) I would ask the Prime Minister to state when it is the intention of the Government to move the second reading of tlie Pacific Islanders Bill? External Affairs), in reply I expressed the intention of fche Government on this The subject on a recent occasion. I told honourable members that the second reading of the Immigration Restriction B ill and the Pacific Islanders B ill would both be moved before the Tariff was-brought on. I am happy to say that the further expected report of which I spoke in making that announcement is likely to toe received by the end of fche week, and there will be received about the same time, I hope, further information for which I am telegraphing, and which will be circulated. Before the Tariff is laid on the table, and' therefore before fche Customs Regulation B ill has been through the Senate, the second reading of the Pacific Islanders B ill will be moved. I cannot say any more than that at present, because honourable members will recognisethe difficulties which beset the Government in the arrangement",63,Forrest
