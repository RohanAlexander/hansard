On the 1st of February last I issued a writ for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Dalley in the State of New South Wales.

I regret to have to inform the House that during the recess there occurred the death of Mr William Guthrie Spence, formerly a member of this House. move That this Rouse expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable William Guthrie Spence, who was for many yeai'B a member of the House of Representatives, and for some time Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth; and extends its sympathy to the wife and family of the deceased gentleman. Mr Spence ceased to be a member of this House in 1919, but there are many still here who can recall his genial personality, to Mrs. Spence the foregoing resolution, and and who learned of his death with feela copy of the speeches delivered thereon. ings of very sincere regret. He had reached the age of four score years at the time of his death, and had lived a life of great activity, and one ever directed towards the benefiting of his fellow man. I am sure that honourable members on all sides recognize him as one of the great pioneers of the Labour movement in this country. Many enjoying privileges to-day owe those privileges largely to his unwearying' efforts and his devotion to their cause. Mr Spence had a long parliamentary career, and rendered service to his country in the Parliament of New South (Hon. Sir Littleton Wales, as well as in the Commonwealth Parliament. He attained ' office as a Minister of the Crown, having been Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth, and for some time Vice-President of the Executive Council. He has passed away, but his record of servioe will not be forgotten, and all who knew him will hold his memory in kindly recollection. I desire to express our regret at his death, and also our sympathy with those whom he has left behind. associate myself with the sentiments which have fallen from the lips of the right honourable the Prime Minister. The late Mr W. G. Spenee was well known throughout this oountry, and was practically the -pioneer of the Labour movement, industrial and political. He did magnificent work for his fellows which will ever be remembered with gratitude, and gave excellent service to his country as a member of this House and of the Now South Wales Parliament. He was constant in his parliamentary attendance, and carried out his duties faithfully and conscientiously. It Will be, I hope, of some consolation to his aged widow and his family I to know that he won the respect of every member of this House. Mr Spence led a life which commended itself to the people of this country. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by MT.

On the other hand, Australian manufacturers of such leathers contended that they were very largely able to supply what was required. 2. The same conflict of interest as that referred to above is likely to arise in regard to iron, steel, and copper products, and each case can only be dealt with on its merits. Any application for tariff alteration or by-law concession that has been, or may be, made will be investigated and reported on by the Tariff Board and carefully considered by the Government. DR. E.

Morris, whose term as medical inspector at Australia House expired in October, that he and a member of the staff of St. Thomas's Hospital, London, had been deputed by the High Commissioner to visit Geneva and inquire into the Spahlinger treatment, and that' they were so .impressed with it that they recommended that Australia should be given the opportunity of investigating the process; further, that a draft contract, approved by both parties, was drawn up, but for some unaccountable reason the High Commissioner listened to a lay opinion in opposition to the professional opinion appointed to investigate? 2.

Groom) -On tbe 13th August last the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) asked that during the recess certain information should be prepared concerning employees of the House of Representatives. I have had the detailed information asked for prepared, and the return will be laid upon the table of the Library to-day. Debate resumed from 4th June, 1926 (-""wZe page 2691), on motion by D r . EAKI.E PAOH That the bill be now read a second time. ment of the debate on this measure, but, as I . understand that the Prime Minister desires to speak now upon the subject, I shall reserve my remarks unti l a later stage. ter and Ministerf o r External Affairs') 1 4 . 4 ] , I am very much obliged to the onorable member for waiving his right to speak now to permit me to intervene in the debate. The bill was introduced in June of last year, when the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) made his second reading speech upon it ; but, as material' alterations of the measuro are to be proposed, it wil l probably be convenient to the Housei f , at this stage,. I indicate generally the nature of those amendments, so that honourable members may he able i u continuing the debate to direct their attention to the points with which I propose to deal. The measure is of grave and serious importance to Australia, becau.se it concerns the financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, the financial relations between the two great instruments of government uuder our Constitution by whioh the public affairs of Australia arc conducted. The basis of our Federation is co-operation between tbe Commonwealth and the States. Each authority has its own separate and Telegraphy Act Regulations definite sphere of activity, but from time to lime there must be co-operation between them on questions of mutual concern. A t the present time there are considerable differences of opinion beauthorities. A deplorable spirit of antagonism has come about, and has considerablv intensified during the last three months. This we must greatly' deplore, no matter what our shade of political opinion, and whether we view questions from the angle of Commonwealth or State interests. If this spirit continues to exist, its effects w ill be disastrous for Australia. We must, therefore create a different atmosphere and better feeling. Upon my recent return from abroad I was much struck by the existence of the conditions to which I refer. I had just travelled through the United States of America, and had had an opportunity to hear there, at first hand, of the problems and difficulties with which the people of thai country had been . faced in the . evolution of the constitutional relations of the Federal and State governments. It was made very clear that whenever serious differences arise between those authorities and mutual antagonisms are engendered, the progress of the country IF retarded and its prosperity diminished. Since my return I have stated publicly that this Government is desirous of doing anything possible to find a solution of the presont difficulties, and to check the growing spirit of antagonism between the State and the Commonwealth authorities. I trust that what I shall say to-day, and the action which the Commonwealth Government is now prepared to take, will prove to the people that we arc sincere, in our desire to put an end to this hostility. I ask the House to view this subject, not in a party spirit but with the realization that we arc the representatives of",22,Papers

131,Mr Bkuce (Flinders,"Prime*Ministhe people in the Commonwealth sphere of action. We must so conduct ourselves that no charge of unfairness to the States can be made against us, and that we cannot rightly be accused of wishing to in vade the realm of State authority. We must make it clear that we are not endeavouring, because of the power that accrues to the central government by reason of its ever-increasing resources, to dictate financially to the States, or to place them in an unfair or invidious position. But the matter in hand is one for this Parliament to determine, and every honourable member must exercise his own judgment in arriving at a conclusion as bo the course to he followed. I recognize that to-day there is a considerable body of opinion in this country to the effect that the present Government desires to aggrandize the Commonwealth at the expense of the States, that we wish to bring the States into some form of financial tutelage, and desire to invade realms that legitimately and properly belong to them. I give my assurance to the House and to the people of Australia that Ministers have no such desire. It is our desire not merely to give the States absolute justice, but, so far as lies in our power, to deal with them generously, and we do not wish to invade fields in which the State authorities alone should function. great . national questions arise from time to time, and these present problems of administration which must be dealt with on a national basis, and by co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. wish to work with the Statesi n a spirit of understanding, mutual trust, and respect. That is the attitude of the Commonwealth Government in connection with this measure, and I desire to express it definitely and clearly. This bill has created intense feeling in the country, and many persons appear to believe that it has been introduced to deprive the States of certain rights, to place them in a nosition of financial embarassment, and to render it impossible for them to carry out their legitimate functions. Some go so far even as to suggest that this measure is an attempt by the Commonwealth Government to bring about unification by the nnancial strangulation of the States. We have, therefore, to consider now whether, without departing from principles that are vital, there is anything we can do which will make the State authorities see clearly that t h k Parliament will not permit injustice to be done to them,' and that the purpose of the measure is to give them fair and equitable treatment in a financial readjustment 'which is essential in the in terests of the whole of the people, and particularly of the State authorities themselves. For this ' reason, the Government asks the House not to go forward with the whole of the proposals out-lined last year, and with regard to which necessary measures were brought down. We propose that Parliament should pass the measure amended in such a way as to provide for the cessation of the per capita payment, that, is, the payment to each State of 25s. per head of its population. We ask that that payment shall be terminated on the 30th June next, and that the States shall be invited to a conference to consider methods by which the new financial position can be adjusted without detriment to their in terests, and to prevent their financial embarrassment. A t that conference, the whole question can be looked at from every angle, and every possible method considered. Jn order that the Statesf may not be forced to some rash decision, and to prevent their financial embarrassment during the financial year 1927-28, But we propose that clause 7 shall be altered to readSubject to the terms of any agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States and adopted by this Parliament, the Treasurer shall, during the financial year commencing on On such questions we the 1st day of July, 1927, make payments to each Statei n equal monthly instalments of the amount specified in the schedule opposite the name of that State. The amounts specified in the amended schedule that will be brought' down will correspond w i th the per capita payments that the States would have received for the year 1927-28 had no action been taken. A t the suggested conference the States would be asked to consider methods by which this financial readjustment could be brought about. On behalf of the Government I say that Ministers would go to that conference with absolutely open minds, and without prejudices respecting the scheme that we have already submitted. We are prepared to examine any alternatives. I shall indicate some of the methods for a readjustment that could be reviewed and considered by the conference. I remind honourable members that the scheme recently submitted had, of necessity, to be one that the Commonwealth could put into operation itself owing to the impossibility of arriving at any agreement with the States. I do not say who has been to blame for this, but since the Government submitted its proposals to the States' representatives of the States have never been prepared to discuss the methods by which an alteration could be made of the financial payments of the Commonwealth to the States. If the States will meet us, we are prepared to consider any scheme and' any method that may be suggested. The States should have confidence that fair and equitable treatment, because in the scheme which was proposed by the Commonwealth in 1923, there was a provision designed to make each State £100,000 better off than under the capitation arrangement, and the scheme now proposed would make each -State £50,000 better off than it is at present. We have Baid frankly that if there is thought to be any mistake in the figures on which our calculations have been made we are prepared to appoint a commission of independent persons to consider them, and to rectify them, if , after investigation, they should be found to be wrong. I mention these things to show that the Commonwealth has indicated that it is desirous of giving fair and equitable treatment to the States, and is giving more assurance now of its wish to help them, and to see justice done than was given in 1910, when the per capita payments were commenced, and the States received £3,000,000 less revenue annually than they had been getting under the Braddon provision of the Constitution; and, again, in 1919, when there was proposed an annual reduction of the per capita payment by 2s. 6d. until it should reach the sum of 10s. of any characterwas then proposed. I think that the States can come to the suggested conference in absolute confidence that they will be fairly treated by the Commonwealth. methods for the determination of this somewhat difficult question that could be considered at such a conference. One that has been discussed a great deal during the last four years is the evacuation of certain fields of taxation by the Commonwealth to the maximum of its finanMr Bruce. cial ability in order to enable the States to recoup themselves from as wide an area as possible for the loss of the per capita payments. We are prepared to consider the whole field of-direct taxation, and not to limit the discussion to the particular methods that have already been suggested. We will examine any proposal to see if it is practicable. Another suggestion, and one which has been very freely discussed recently, is the establishment by the Commonwealth of a sinking fund for the debts to the States. There is a great deal to commend that. But there is something that I should say with regard to the proposal recently put they will receive forward by Mr Warren Kerr. The establishment of a sinking fund, if practicable, would be admirable, and would do much to improve the credit and the financial status of the States; but it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to take any action of that character without their co-operation. I think this House would take the view, and prob. ably most people outside, that for the Commonwealth, without the agreement of the iStates, to say it would establish a sinking fund, and thus take over a State obligation, would be tantamount to telling the State authorities that they had not shown sufficient intelligence in the conduct of their financial affairs-it would be dictation by the Commonwealth to the sovereign State Governments, which they would resent. But should the representatives of the 'States and the Commonwealth meet in conference and agree upon some scheme, the position would be different. The method that has been mentioned is certainly one that should be exhaustively examined. Another suggestion that should be considered is the assumption by the Commonwealth of some part of the State debts. There might be a full consideraNo compensation tion of the present indebtedness of the Commonwealth and States, and an endeavour might be made to arrive at a policy in regard to the provision of sinking funds, and the general conduct of There are many public borrowing. The need for considering the establishment of sinking funds for State debts, and for some proper basis for the whole of the borrowing by States and Commonwealth and the fixing of rates of interest, was brought home to me when I was recently in London. Shortly before I arrived there a pamphlet was issued attacking Australia aud her not suggest the transfer of State debts finance in a manner which created an exat that conference. traordinarily bad impression among the investing public, of Britain.

Under the present system it is possible for the Commonwealth Government at any time to cut off all the payments now being made to the States, and to give to them no compensation of any kind. honourable members w ill appreciate the need for agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, so that the financial position of the latter may be placed upon a sound basis. evil of the existing arrangement is that one government raises revenues which another, having no responsibility to the taxpayers who contributed the money, expends. That has always been recognized as a wrong principle. The definite term in regard to these payments having expired seven years ago, the time is opportune for a readjustment of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States on a rigid basis, so that each government may be directly responsible to the taxpayers for the raising of the moneys it expends. Those who contribute to the revenue have a right to say whether or not they approve of the manner in which their contributions are being expended. ten years' road agreement cuts across that principle. say that the Government is already departing from that principle, notably, in connection with the provision of funds for great national purposes, such as roads. that every State which is receiving money under the FederalA i d RoadsA c t has made an agreement with the Commonwealth for the expenditure of that money upon specific works. penditure is agreed upon, the two governments contribute the money and control its disbursement, and each is responsible directly to the taxpayers for the money it raises and expends. arrangement there is no departure from the principle that I have emphasized. There is, however, one clear violation of that principle, and it will continue; I refer to the grants in aid to States whose needs and developmental obligations exceed the capacity of their people and finances. finitely provides for such payments, which are necessitated by the disparity in the stages of development reached in the different States. The last point with which I wish to deal is the inequity of payments to the States on a population basis. The per capita system means that the State which has the largest population, is most Surely advanced in its development, and has therefore fewest problems to solve, will progressively receive more and more from the Commonwealth, while States like Western Australia, with small Another populations and great developmental problems, will fare the worse. In other words, the State which is best able to provide for its own needs wilt continue for ever to receive the greatest share of Commonwealth money. That inequity is aggravated by the policy of tariff protection. The tendency is for secondary industries to develop in the most populous centres, and unquestionably the more populous eastern States are deriving the maximum of benefit from the protectionist policy of the country. Thus the States that benefit most through the tariff receive also the largest payments from the Commonwealth. I have stressed three reasons which make the discontinuance of the per capita payments essential, namely, the financial insecurity of the States under the present system, the inequity of payments upon a population basis, and the bad principle of one authority spending the. revenues raised by another authority.. This Parliament will shirk its duty if it does not take action to put our .financial relations with the States upon a sounder basis, by affirming that the per capi,ta payment must cease, The answer to that objection is leaving the method of re-adjustment to be discussed by the Commonwealth and States at a later date. As to the proposal that the Commonwealth should again seek a conference with the States The basis of exwith a view to getting^ their concurrence in the discontinuance of the payments, I remind honourable members that we have already met the representatives of the States, who have very definitely declared In that that they are not prepared to discuss the surrender of these moneys upon any terms. I do not blame Sltate Treasurers for their attitude. Who, if he were in charge of a State treasury, would be prepared to give up a revenue of £2,000,000 which was raised and handed to him by another authority, and face But the Constitution dethe prospect of having to raise the money",28,Employees Tween The Commonwealth And The State

Naturally, the States are not prepared to yield revenues they have enjoyed in the past aud assume new taxation obligations. of action rests with this Parliament. The need for re-adjustment, however, is vital and pressing; and when the Commonwealth has taken the initia l step ments, the States will be prepared uo discuss ways and means. surers would not be human if they consented to discuss ways and means before their "" moral right, "" or whatever other basis of claim they are relying upon, had proved untenable. the alleged right of the States to a share of the Customs and excise revenue. Such a right must have either a constitutional, legal, or moral basis. Obviously, the States can have no constitutional or .legal right or they would take action in the High Court to prevent the Commonwealth Government from proceeding with its proposals. If the States have any right at all to the continuance of the payments it must be a moral one, and I propose to show briefly that no such right exists. A t the time of federation, it was obvious that the obligations of the Commonwealth would not necessitate an expenditure approaching anything like the amount of Customs revenue that was then being received. The control of Customs had to be handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament in order to' obtain unif o r m it y in tariff matters, and an arrangement was made which involved, broadly, that the States, during the first ten years, should have returned to them three-quarters of the Customs receipts. revenues were so large that there was, in addition, between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 which was not required to meet the expenditure of the Commonwealth. back to the States. Section 94 of the Constitution providesAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. There are two points that I wish to stress in considering that clause of the Constitution. One is that it is the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth that has to be returned to the States, and the other is that the payments are to be made on such a basis as the Commonwealth Parliament deems fair. The principle of paying so much per head was evolved The responsibility long after the framing of the Constitution; at the time of federation, it was not in contemplation. A t the end of a 10-year period, a new arrangement was made, under which the States were to of discontinuing the payreceive, for a period of ten years-unti l 1920-25s . per head of their population. State TreaI t was proposed at that time that the people' should, by amendment of the Constitution, extend the period indefinitely beyond ten years. The question was put to the electors, but they refused I turn now to to accept the proposal, and Parliament agreed to the payment for ten years only. When the basis of payment was changed from three-fourths of the Customs revenue to 25s. per capita, the Commonwealth gained in revenue £3,000,000, and the States were deprived of that amount. It is worthwhile recalling how the case was then stated. It was not a very kindly act to take £3,000,000 from the States, but the action was justified, and was agreed to by the people because the increasing obligations of the Commonwealth had reduced the amount of surplus revenue. The two obligations that were particularly under consideration at that time were naval defence and old age pensions, which were recognized in 1910 as Commonwealth obligations which would reduce the Commonwealth surplus revenue. It was because of that, and not because of any moral, legal, or other claim, that the per capita arrangement was made, During the 10-year period following 1910, the Great War occurred, and, as a result, the surplus revenue of the CommonBut the wealth disappeared. Not only that, but. there was such a shortage of revenue from sources which it was contemplated would supply the Commonwealth, that the Commonwealth had to invade the sphere of That amount was also handed direct taxation, which it was contemplated should belong exclusively to the States. In 1919 the position had become so acute under the burden of the war that the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) approached the States with a proposal that their per capita payment should be reduced by half-a-crown a year until it had reached 10s. The States did not welcome the proposal-n o one expected that they would; they resisted it oh the ground not of moral right-w e heard nothing of moral rip-hts then-but interests. has no surplus revenue to distribute to obvious that that surplus could be made any one. Legitimate revenues have been to disappear by repealing taxation. I do more than exhausted by obligations that not think that any honourable member the Commonwealth has had to assume. who has advanced that contention will In addition to those commitments for be prepared to uphold it after he has which part of the revenues of the States seriously considered it. Although many were taken away in 1910, namely, naval honourable members may quarrel with the defence and old-age pensions, we have method proposed by the Government for since which have wiped out the surplus sider that the proposal to evacuate fields revenue, until to-day we have, if of taxation is wrong, they cannot successanything, a deficit. the Commonwealth have more than have assumed and the expenditure to balanced its revenue, and will continue to which we are committed, that the States do so, unless it invades fields of taxation have a moral right to part of our revenue. reserved for the States, and, having gone It has been found impossible to reach an into those fields, remains there.
