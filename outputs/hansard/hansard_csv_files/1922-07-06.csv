2,Motion By Mr Jackson,"in Parliament ussenibled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to ParliamentThat the following words be added to the proposed Address-in-Eeply :"" but we regret that your Advisers have made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions."" ister and Minister.for External Affairs) [2.33] I am sorry that I was not able to be here yesterday, when t i e Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) moved his amendment, but I have informed myself as well as I could by a perusal of the press reports of his speech und from the notes taken by my honourable colleagues. It would serve no good purpose to remind the honourable member that he has taken a very unusual course in moving two censure motions without an interval between them. In his speech in support of the amendment now before the House bo covered, for all practical purposes, the ground traversed ""last week in his first attack. BeforeI come to the honourable member's charges, there is a matter of procedure to which I must refer. According to the newspaper accounts of yesterday's proceedings, exception was taken by some of the honourable member's party to the moving of the adjournment of the debate by the Minister then in charge of the House. When I was informed that the Leader of the Opposition intended to move au amendment on the Address-in-Reply, I said that if he desired the adjournment of the debate I would consent to it , but that otherwise the discussion should continue. token by the Government was the proper one. In moving the adjournment of the debate, we followed an almost invariable custom; to do otherwise would have been an act of discourtesy to the Opposition. HadI been present, however, and heard from the honourable member's own lips that he took exception to the proosed adjournment, the debate would not ave been adjourned. Let me now deal with his charges seriatim. The honourable member claimed credit on behalf of his party for the results arrived at through the Washington Conference, for the reference of the wireless agreement to the Parliamentary Committee, for the expansion of telephone and telegraph connexions, and for the reduction of the defence vote. He did not disclose the grounds on which these claims were based, and an examination of the facts w ill show them to be without foundation. The honourable member claimed kudos for himself and his party for what was done at the Conference at Washington.. During the many years that I have been a. member of the House, I have known, audacity, under the whip of party exigencies, to go to great lengths, but I have not heard any statement quite so audacious as this. The honourable gentleman said that the Labour party was responsible for the appointment of a delegate to represent the Commonwealth at Washington, and that attention had been drawn by the Labour party to the need for Australian representation there. No doubt the Labour party did draw attention to this matter;-. I should be surprised to hear of anything in the wide world to which, at some time or another, the Labour party has not drawn attention. But, as the honourable member has claimed credit for the achievements of the Washington Conference, seeking to make it appear that without theefforts of the Labour party no good thing would have come out of Washington, I must quote extracts from that very inconvenient publication known to o l woXXoi as Hansard, to show where the honourable member and his party really stood in reference to Australian representation at Washington. On 6th October last (Hansard, vol. XCVTL , page 11717), the h o n orable member is reported as sayingWhat are we here going to do? I have not The course a word to say against Senator Pearce personally, but I venture to say that the Government could not have picked a more unsuitable man for the job. And, two pages laterThe Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce!,. who has been appointed to represent Australia at the Washington Conference, is the most unsuitable person that could have been selected. . . . In the circumstances, the Government could not have made a more unwise selection. . . . . We cannot eee the possibility of the Disarmament Conference being a success unless it comprises representatives of the different political parties throughout the world. I therefore move as an amendmentThat, the motion be amended by omitting all the words after ""That"", with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the following;",13,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
3,Upon Which Mr Chabltom Had Moved,,14,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
4,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nwords:"" in the opinion of this House the Disarmament Conference to be held at Washington is of vital importance, and that Australia should be represented thereat by a representative of the Government and each of the other parties, and that the decisions of such Conference should be subject to ratification by this Parliament."" The honourable gentleman's attitude was supported quite naturally by honourable members who spoke on his side. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr sition of honourable members of the Official McGrath) was amongst them; on page 11792 of Hansard -we find him sayingThe Australian delegate at Washington should not heBitate to. tell the capitalistic authorities of Great Britain that never -again will an Australian go to the aid of Britain in any war in which they may be assisting a yellow race to fight white men I have no faith in Senator Pearce, and no expectation that he will utter such sentiments as those. I do not believe that he is a pacifist. I am not at all sure that he will advocate disarmament. Then the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), referring to Senator Pearce, saidTo send him seems to me like sending a publican to a Prohibition Conference. On the same occasion, the honourable mem-, ber for Batman( Mr Brennan) saidAllI can eay on that point is, as I said by way of interjection, that thc Government could have only made one worse choice, and that would have been thc Prime Minister himself. It is clear, therefore, that if any good thing has come out of ""Washington, and if my distinguished and right honourable colleague has come back, as he has done, having covered himself with distinction and credit, it is not due to honourable gentlemen opposite, for they not only did all they could to prevent him going, but they urged a course whichi they knew was quite impracticable. They suggested that there should be' substituted for Senator Pearce some other representative, and that he should be accompanied by a representative from each of the other political parties in this Parliament. They did that, though they very well knew that it was not for us to decide how many should go. United States of America issued the in vitations, and restricted the number of representatives from each country invited. The Dominions as such were not recognised at all, but went by virtue of the fact that they were partners in the British Empire. As the attitude of honourable, members on the other side, or most of them, to wards t i e British Empire is perfectly well known-and it is known that the party are opposed to the British Empire, even when they do not say so-it must be said that not only is the honourable gentleman's party not entitled to the credit for the achievements of tbe Washington Conference, but that all that has been gained has come despite the policy and the oppoLabour party, and that they are not entitled to claim any share whatever in the splendid results of that Conference. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Wireless Agreement, claiming this also to be due to the aotion of his party. Doubtless the honourable member referred to those subterranean machinations' by which they manage to influence the affairs of the world, let alone the affairs of the Commonwealth, but of which we see not the faintest signs above the surface of things. But the honourable gentleman's, party is not entitled to any credit in this matter. On the other hand, whatever has been done has been done despite their opposition. What are the facts about the Wireless Agreement 1 The honourable gentleman finds himself in this position: Whilst he takes credit for the 'agreement, be says that it should never have been executed. I think it may be said that one could secure unanimity on the other side for the execution of only one thing and .that is myself. Let me state the facts relating to this matter. A motion covering a dTaft wireless agreement was put before this House, and agreed to. The motion readThat the House approves of the execution by the Prime Minister of the agreement proposed to be made between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a draft of which has been laid upon the table of the House, subject to investigation and approval, with suoh alteration as they may deem necessary, by a Committee to consist ""of six members of the House of Representatives, two nominated by the Prime Minister, two by the deader of the Opposition, two by the Leader The Government of the of the Country .party, and three members of the Senate, such senators' to be Senators DrakeBrockman, J. D. Millen, and Wilson. When this motion was submitted, debate ensued, the honourable member and his party opposed the motion, a division waa taken, .and the Leader of the Opposition and his party voted against it . Whatever there is of virtue, either in the motion itself, the Committee whioh the motion created, or the decisions of that Committee, or the agreement, or its execution, comes as the result not of the support of the honourable gentle,, man and bis party, hut despite their opposition. They wore beaten in the division on the motion. The House authorized, and in fact directed the Government to take certain action subject to certain conditions which were set out in tbe motionThat the House approves of the execution of the agreement proposed to be made subject to the investigation and approval of a Committee to consist of six members of the House of Representatives, and three members of the Senate. The Committee was appointed; it met and considered the matter at great length, and by eight votes to one recommended the ratification and execution of the agreement. The only dissentient member of .tbe Committee, the honourable member for Batman, about whose attitude on this matter a certain amount of mystery seems to prevail, did not put in his minority report until a few days before, the assembling of Parliament. No doubt the honourable gentleman will say that this belated dissent has no political significance whatever, and that, its relation to party is so remote as not to be measurable. AllI have to say to that ia that while he may tell that to the marines or to his constituents the people of this' country will never believe it. The facts are then that the agreement was signed because this Parliament by a specific motion directed the Government to sign it, and neither for the idea, the motion, tbe Committee, or tbe agreement itself, are the Leader of the Opposition and his party entitled to one iota of credit. ' The honourable member next takes credit for the proposed expansion of post and telegraphic facilities. It is true, of course-and one must give the devil his due-that honourable members opposite are alwaysin favour of expanding every thing. Insignificant as I am, I have had the' honour of their support than one occasion when I have moved motions which expanded matters in which they . were vitally When it is a question of imposing new burdens by tbe expenditure of public money, one may always rely with confidence on tbe support of honourable members of the Labour party, and it is no Ur. Bughes. doubt true that they have always said that they were in favour of the expansion of postal and telegraphic facilities ;but the Leader of the Opposition must forbear with me a moment while I remind him of one or two rather painful facts. He and many of those who are with him to-day were followers of mine in days gone by. We were in office for years. We had ample opportunity to. do a great many things. We had an overwhelming majority72 members-in both Houses. The honourable member was not then, as he is now, a member of a party-poor , forlorn, rejected,and despised, compelled to resort to most abject and miserable expedients in order to attract attention. On the con. trary, he was a member of a party whose word was law. I invite him now to tell us what any of the Labour Governments, including my own-becaus e we want to be perfectly fair in the matter-di d for the telegraphic and telephonic communications of Australia. He cannot deny .that we could have done a good deal more in a direction which he now sees possible. I claim that the present Government is entitled to the credit of having'done and shown the way to do far more for tlie expansion of postal and telegraphio facilities throughout this country than was done by any preceding Government, and that the credit is not to be shared by the honourable member or bis party. They did not do these things when they had the power. If they had the reins of power now they would, owing to the forces which control tlnin, destroy this country. The honourable member, having taken credit for the contemplated expenditure of somo millions of pounds on postal and telephonic facilities next claims credit for the reduotion effected in the defence expenditure. There is something in this assertion which makes me a little apprehensive. When I see the honourable member associated, as he is now, with people whose ideas were abhorrent to him on more a little while ago, I cannot but feel a little anxious when I learn that he and those with him approve of anything that' interested. this Government has done. We know very well what their attitude was towards this country during the war, and what their suggestions were when Australia was standing with its back to the wall arid literally fighting for its life. We remember their: counsels for a premature peace, and their protests against reinforcements. done in regard to the Defence Forces of Una country that has secured the approbation of such, a party? say no now fact that the honourable member takes credit for and supports the action of the Government in this regard is a rather sinister circumstance. During last session the honourable member did a ll that he could to put the Government out of office. He moved motions which, had they been carried, would, as he must have known, have destroyed the whole M i l it a r y Defence Force of this country, thrown tens of thousands of men out of work, and rendered the Commonwealth helpless before her enemies. We must never forget that the honourable member's motions which, if carried, would have destroyed the Defence Force of Australia, were moved long before the Washington. Conference had made a reduction in military expenditure possible. Even at a time when the honourable member Baid that such a Conference could not succeed, he wished us to go f a r beyond what we bave done to-day. For the present reductions the Government, and the Government alone, are responsible. If there be some things for which, credit ia due, which, since the honourable member supports them, I begin to doubt-the credit belongs to the Government, and not to the honourable member, who would have had us disarm and leave ourselves defenceless in the face of the enemy before the Washington Conference had yet met, and arrived at those momentous decisions which have changed the face of the whole world, and particularly the Pacific. The honourable member then spoke of immigration. Apparently' he is much concerned about this matter. I am not quite clear as to what his charges are in this connection. Nor do I know what is his attitude towards tbe question. The other day, in bis attack upon the Government, I understood that the gravamen of his charges was that we were about to bring hundreds of thousands of people to Australia, which was already thronged with unemployed men.' I gather now, and the honourable member w ill correct me if I am wrong, that we are now charged with doing nothing. proper scheme. before the honourable member. They w ill speak for themselves. The foundaI shall tion of tbe immigration policy of more about this matter the Oommonwealth Government was the than to remark that the resolution agreed to at the Premiers' Conference in 1920, which gave the Commonwealth charge of immigration affairs overseas, and of the transport of' i m migrants from overseas to Australia, .and lef t to the States the responsibility for dealing with immigrants when tbey reached our shores and tbe right to determine the number and class of immigrants to be admitted into each State. If fewer immigrants are arriving than we should like, it is solely the States who are to blame, unless it can be shown that the transport facilities provided by tbe Commonwealth are insufficient. But that is not alleged. I stated the matter very clearly at the Premiers' Conference held in January of this year. I shall read an extract from a report of the proceedings. I saidI t is for each State to come forward with a concrete scheme. Nothing can be gained by a general discussion on them; but, of course, it is not for me to say what you are or are not to discuss. I propose to settle, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, the matters outstanding between Sir James Mitchell and ourselves in order that we may get that proposal dealt with. I have asked two' gentlemenThey were Senator Lynch and Mr. Gregoryto look at the lands over there, and afterwards,. as I have told Sir James Mitchell, we shall have to reduce the matter .to a form of agreement; but all that can be done between ourselves. It has nothing to do with the other States. This other general scheme, however, has to do with every State, and with the Commonwealth, and I Bhould like you to eay that you wiU give instructions to your Agents General to look at the matter in a more friendly spirit. Honourable members w ill bear with me while I deal with this subject a little fully, because it is a very important matter, and I hope my friends will not object if I touch very briefly upon one or two phases' of it that were not 'referred to by the honourable gentleman. Immigration as a practical policy must be considered under three or four heads. The Commonwealth is co-operating with the Statesi n every one of these.",14,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

6,"What, Then, Nave We Mr Hughes","L e t me put the factsThe lines of its co-operation are very definite, and the co-operation is as complete as the circumstances permit. The Commonwealth has a very clear-and practicable policy, .which it has endeavoured, and' is still endeavouring, to carry out. First of all, there are these concrete schemes to one of which I have just referred, . and with which I shall deal in detail later. scheme of nominated immigrants, under which persons now resident in Australia nominate their friends in Britain or elseboys, the ""Dreadnought"" boys, and the where. assisted passages. This is an excellent form of immigration, if it be on a wide enough scale, because the immigrants have friends lo go to, and these give them counsel and'aid, and set their foet upon the right road. Assisted passages are granted under various minor schemes. For example, in New South Wales the Commonwealth Government are recruiting agricultural trainees, known as "" Dreadnought "" boys, at the rate of sixty a month, for the State of New South. 'Wales. In connection with the Fairbridge . Fatrm. School, in Western Australia, the Commonwealth. Government recently decided to co-operate with the Western Australian Government by providing portion of the maintenance cost of the school. The maximum contribution of the Commonwealth has been fixed at £2,600 per annum, and the total cost to the Commonwealth, is not to exceed £10,000, spread over a period of five years. About 2,000 British officers of the IndianA r m y will shortly ba retired owing settling them on the land. to the intended reduction in the A r m y establishment in India. These officers aire wealth immigration polioy. young men in the prime of life, and thoy will each receive as compensation a sum of between £1,000 and £1,500. In response to inquiries recently made by General Lord Rawlinson, I have given an assurance that the Government will extend a hearty, welcome to any of these officers who may choose to settle 'here. I to all thc States. a representative to India. New South Wales has definitely offered to set aside 800 irrigated farms for theso omcers, I .hope that the other States will not lag behind. tween £1,000 and £1,500, and is in the prime of life, it is dosirable from every point of view that they be secured for Mr Bughes. Australia. The Commonwealth Goverm' ment have offered to send a represontatiys to In d i a to give all information that tie' officers may require, or alternatively ' to pay the expenses of two of thoir number to Australia in order that they may see the country for themselves. These' constitute what may be termed the 'subsidiary schemes of our immigration policy. There Then there is the are the nominated immigrants, who are given assisted passages, and those other schemes, such as the Dr. Barnardo Homes Theee are brought out here hy Fairbridge Farm. Then wo have the scheme of the South Australian Government, who are bringing out ' 6,000 boys, w i th a view to placing them with fanciers and training them for the work of land settlement. In all these schemes we are co-operating with the State Governments. NowI come to the greater schemes which aim at developing the great resources of Australia by bringing out large numbers of immigrants from B r i tain and settling them on Crown lands. W it b Western Australia a draft agreement has been drawn up, and it sets out, w it h some wealth of detail, the circumstances under which we are prepared to co-operate w it h the Government of that State. Broadly speaking, the agreement is one for settlement in which the States and tbe Commonwealth-and since the passage, of the Empire Settlement Act, the United Kingdom also-ar e to co-operatei u bringing people to this country and Land settlement is a sine qua non of the CommonThe Government of the Oommonwealth is not a party to any immigration proposal which has not for its object the settlement of men on the .land. I have already referred to the Western Australian undertaking, which I hope w ill shortly bo completed. I bave discussed at great length w i th the Government of New bave communicated this matter South Wales a scheme covering large Victoria has sent areas of land, both irrigated and dry, in different ports of that State, and I am very hopeful of being able to conclude a satisfactory agreement. I have been in close touch lately with the Premier As each officer will have beof Victoria, and only yesterday I had -a communication from him, setting out in broad outlines a scheme in which he wishes the Commonwealth Government to oo-operate. We are looking into the matter now, und although we cannot coioinit ourselves to details, I have said in the most unqualified way that we most earnestly desire to act in co-operation w it h the Stale Government. Th'e Premier of Victoria has set out that the whole object is to settle men on the land. That is the policy of the State of Victoria, und it is the policy of this Government. H i g h Commissioner of the Commonwealth has recently signed an agreement with the British Government relating to providing portion of the passage money for approved immigrants. agreement the B r it is h ' Government boars half the cost. parties is limited by tbe terms of the agreement. The rate at which immigrants arc coming in this year shows a great improvement over last year. The total number of assisted immigrants who arrived during ]921 was 14,677; while the number this year, if the present monthly average is maintained, w ill be 24,652. This, of course, ia still very f a r from satisof 5th January, 1922 :factory, but wo anticipate that when the Western Australian scheme is in f u l l operation that number w ill he doubled. AndI do not hesitate to say that only in this way can this country be developed, and shall wo be able to obtain results from the co-operation of the B r it i sh Government and tbe State Governments with the Commonwealth, which w ill , I hope, mark a t u m in g point in Australia's careor, and indicate to the world our settled determination to show ourselves worthy of the inheritance of a continent. It has been suggestod. I think, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that the Commonwealth rejected the i m migration proposals of Queensland because a Labour Governmont is in power there. That is quite untrue, as I shall prove by dore himself. What the Commonwealth sets out to do is to assist immigration. Tho responsibility of dealing w i th unemployment in the various parts of the Commonwealth belongs to the States, and not to the Commonwealth Government. It is an unfortunate fact, as I showed on Priduy last, that the number of unemployed in the State of Queensland is greater than in any other State. That is most regrettable, out it is also the most complete condemnation of the policy of honourable members opposite, either in esse or in posse, that ean be imagined. But it does not affect the position: that the immigration' policy of the Commonwealth must not be used by the States to settle unemployment of their own citizens. L e t me now read to the House what the Leader of the Labour Government, in The Queensland has to say about the inatter. On 1st July, 1921, when a deputation of dore saidUnder this lie knew that there was depression in Queensland aud unemployment. Unemployment was rendered more acute because oi this depression, The liability of both and there wns distress in the pastoral industry in particular. The financial stringency was having a bad effect on industry generally. At the present time, the Government could not offer the unemployed relief work. The Government could find employment ior thousands of men if the funds were available. He had formed his own opinion that an expenditure of £15.000,000 over the next lour or five years would make land available for 10,000 settlers, say, and find employment for 50,000 adults. The following extract is from the Argus Asked to-day what Queensland was doing in the matter of immigration, the Premier( Mr Theodore) said "". . . The Government had not abandoned hopes of tha Upper Burnett scheme. . . . It would endeavour to finance a vigorous land settlement achemo in the near future. This was one of the chief means of solving the unemployment problem."" I commend to the Leader of the Opposition those words of wisdom from Mr. Theodore, that the only hope of solving the unemployed problem is not the socialization of industry, is not tbe polioy represented by the flamboyant resolutions passed at the recent Labour Conference in Melbourne, is not any of those solutions which the honourable member urged upon us, but is the simple, time-honoured way, initiated hy Adam, of going upon the land dore said, in Brisbane, on 5l.h January, 1922This is one of the chief means of solving tlie unemployed problem and making for the development and progress of the State that is so necessary, and strenuous efforts will be made by the Government to have such a scheme definitely launched this year. Speaking at the Premiers' Conference on l'8th January, 1922, Mr Theodore saidEvery State Government was restricted in its' finances at that time.

9,And Producing More Wealth. Mr Theo,"recognise that, on account of the unemployed situation, we ought to open up lands for settlement, and to absorb intending immigrants in that way, but we could not finance big schemes at that period. Wc got no assistance from the Commonwealth to help us to finance any such scheme. At the present time, we arc endeavouring to finance the scheme ourselves, and if we are to succeed in putting this BuTnett scheme into operation we must look to our own resources, because the Commonwealth,, it seems, will continue to ""dilly-dally"" with the matter. We hare had no difficulty in getting all the you will present a definite scheme, settlers we want on the perpetual leasehold system on our Crown lands, and we would have no difficulty, if we could get £2,500,000 to build those railways and roads, in getting applications for 3,500 settlers in twelve months, if the area were made available under perpetual leasehold. We could get tbem in Australia. We do not know what provision we can make to take immigrants from overseas twelve months hence; but if we can get assistance to open up land for settlement on a progressive scheme, our conditions will become such that we will be able, not only to reduce OUT unemleast twelve months' preparatory work on ployment difficulty, but to absorb a very large number of new immigrants, and that is the main thing. There are two or three points that Mr Theodore emphasized commend to honourable members opposite. no way of solving the unemployed difficulty unless we develop land settlement, and the second is that immigration is the main thing, and that immigrants must be settled upon the land. The third point which emerges f r om all this is, despite the fact that a Labour Government is in power in Queensland, unemployment is very prevalent there, as Mr Theodore has testified in the three extracts I have read. a press interview on 31st January, 1922, Mr Theodore is reported to have saidMr Hughes had said the Ministry wanted positive' assurances that the money would be used for immigration only. That was a new feature of the controversy. The Queensland Government did not ask for money, to be used for immigration, hut asked for money to be used for the development of the Burnett Bchemc, which would have the effect of enabling the State to absorb thousands of newcomers. That is the point upon which Mr Theothat we wil l not make an agreement witb dore and I differ. duty of the Governments of Australia is immigrant twelve months' work on the to look after their own fellow citizens, and land, and a block of land at the expirathat, so far as unemployment is concerned tion of that term. I do not know whe-of Commonwealth Publio Service-that duty Ur. Bughes. falls] properly upon the States. It is the duty of the States to develop land settlement in order to deal with their own unemployed. It is the function of the Commonwealth to deal with immigration, and we say to the States, "" If yon desire immigrants, and will make arrangements for them to go upon, your Crown lands, we w ill assist you. ""We will advance you millions of pounds upon an arrangement that may be arrived at if which will show where every penny is to be spent upon reproductive works for the purpose of building railways and roads, clearing and preparing the land for the immigrant."" We laid it down, further, that a condition precedent must be that the immigrant be given twelve months' workupon the land. We are insisting upon this condition witb every State. All immigrants axe to go on the land, and all are to foe guaranteed at .the land, and subsequently a block of land upon which to settle. The Commonwealth scheme of immigration, therefore, does which I not and cannot cause unemployment, but the very reverse. We shall not cause The first is that there is one man to be unemployed. All will be employed ipso facto. But Mr Theodore, having got himself up to his neck in debt,, I suppose, wanted the Commonwealth to lend him money to provide work for his own State's unemployed. We could not do that; honourable members would scarcely expect us to da so. That is why we were unable to finance the Queensland Government witb their Upper Burnett scheme. I take it that what I have said is sufficient answer to dore said, "" We will absorb Australian applicants for the land first."" That is quite r i g h t ; he.ought to do so. But he must do so with his own money. We will assist him to absorb immigrants; but I insist that the State must absorb its o.wn ' unemployed. The Commonwealth, will see to it that the immigrant does not compete w it h Australia's unemployed by ensuring that the immigrant shall be settled on the land; and I repeat I say that the first any State unless it can guarantee every course, outside the scope of the ther the honourable member for Hunter is",19,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
10,I N The Course Of All That Has Been Advanced. Mr Theo,"in favour of immigration or not. It is very difficult for any one to know his views upon, this subject. I do not think he knows them himself, for the position of his party at present is very much like that of the siok man who, upon being asked in the morning how he was, said that he could not tell until he had read the doctor's bulletin to be published in the paper later that day. The Labour party does not know from day to day where it is upon any particular: subject. I do not know whether there is an individual member of that party in this Chamber who, if he were put up against a wall, and threatened with a firing party, could state what is his party's programme. It is protean. Let me now deal with coal. Coal has for the honourable member for Hunter an attraction suoh as honey has for the fly or the bee. The honourable member is in a. difficulty about coal, but he is merely in the same position as every one else in this country. We are all in trouble about coal. . Yesterday I bought some coal. I took the trouble to work out the cost, and found that it amounted to £3 6s. per ton. Coal appears to be a rather expensive luxury for a poor person, like myself, who is obliged to buy the commodity in dribs and drabs. But this experience is common to almost all of us. SoI have come here to-day, being cold and very far from well, because coal is very far from being cheap. The honourable"" member for Hunter finds himself in a most difficult position. Let me state what that position is. A little while ago the honourable gentleman stood up in his place, and delivered what, in the case of another man, would, have amounted to a panegyric upon a. measure that had been passed into law upon my own initiative. I allude to theIndustrial Peace Act. The honourable member said it was the finest piece of legislation ever passed in this country Certain other people did not agree with him; but that was his formed opinion. The honourable member far Darling( Mr Blakeley), for example, regarded the act as a covert blow at what waa then the very, child of his bosom, namely, the Arbitration Court. But last week, or a, few days before that, the constituents of the honourable member for Hunter applied to the Court for an injunction, or a mandamus; and it now turns out that the Tribunal is ultra vires the Act Those whom the Industrial Peace Act was brought into existence to benefit, have themselves destroyed it. a docision to that effect? it is not the fault of the honourable member's constituents. WhatI want to know is this: In what position do I stand? I bring in certain legislation. The honourable member's friends, Messrs. Baddeley aud Willis, come to me and tell me that they have a passionate desire to obey the law. Of course, I know that they have not; I bave known those gentlemen for a long while. But I ask of them, '* What is it they want? "" They tell me, and the honourable member for Hunter agrees with them. In fact, there is a general consensus of opinion upon what is wanted by these gentlemen. Even the mine-owners agree. All are opposed to the Arbitration Court. There is talk of direct action, of strikes, of confusion. The Industrial Peace Act is thereupon brought into force, ,and everything goes as merrily as a mar-, riage boll. There are, of course, some stoppages, which tbe miners explain away. Everything is still going on all right and promises to continue to do so, aa long .as tbe tribunal created by the Act churns out at regular intervals an increase in the hewing rate, in the current rate of wages-which , in the opinion of the honourable member, is what the Tribunal was created solely to do. But at length there comes a frost a killing frost. The employers say they, want a reduction of 33-J per cent, upon the rate of payment. Immediately the matter is referred to the Tribunal. The honourable member for Hunter and his friends, Messrs. Baddeley and Willis, fear that the Tribunal will not do what thoy hold that every arbitrator is supposed to do; that is to say, give a verdict in their favour. Therefore, in that frame of mind, they say, '' We will lay the Tribunal out."" And they do so.

""When, the other day, I mentioned the . price of small coal in England, the honorare making huge profits, but I should like able gentleman said I knew nothing about eoal. That is quite true. I am not a coal miner; but I am a citizen of this country, .and I buy coal privately and, as was made by the owners that the hewing head of the Government, buy a great deal of it. Above all, I am concerned in the welfare of our people, and when I am asked to deal with this question of unemployment, I affirm that the problem is very much aggravated, even if it is not caused, by the present high price of coal. Despite all the contradictions of the honcost of living, theu we were told that the orable member, it is true that the price of small coal, out of which coke is made, is very much lower in England than it is here. 1 The honourable member for Hunter is reported to have stated that I said the English price was 9s.

But non-coking smalls must be ruled out of consideration, because we were talking about the cost of coal out of very much ton""o with crippling our foreign which coke is made.

I have said, times out of number, that as the cost of living comes down, wages also must come down. That is the universal law the world over. The honourable member for Hunter, or another honourable member opposite, had something to say about tbe high profits of the coal-owners. I believe some mine-owners to point out that there was a studied silence on the .part of the coal miners in regard to this matter until the suggestion rate should come down. So long as the Tribunal' was giving increases to the miners and, naturally, making possible greater profits for the mine-owners,, nothing was said, but as soon as it was proposed to reduce the wages of the men, proportionate only to the decrease in the owners were making huge profits. Probably, some of them are, and perhaps the best remedy would be to compel them to compete in the markets of the world. At tbe present time, as tbe honourable memin coal has almost entirely disappeared. That is a very bad condition of affairs for the country generally, and the coal-owners beginning of this year, Messrs. Baddeley and Willis asked me not to l i ft the coal their request.

24,Mr Hughes,"I am telling the world, u n t i l coal gets down to the world's mice! I am sure we can produce coal here as cheaply as anywhere else in the world. duced cheaper here than in Great Britain. for one moment that in order to produce coal at the world's price the hewing rate would have to be so reduced t h at our miners could not maintain their present standard of living, I would not agree to it . But that is not the position at all. Some of the miners are making very high wages indeed, h ut some are not. mine-owners are in exactly the same position ; some making huge profits and others unable to show any profit at all. That is the cause of the whole trouble, as the honourable member for Hunter knows very well. I regret very much that any attempt has been made to interfere w it h this reference to the Tribunal, which was brought into existence at the suggestion of the unions. It has worked very well, and has, at any rate, maintained a greater degree of peace in the industry than existed before its appointment. One fact emerges from all this trouble. Things cannot go on as they are. If unemploymenb is to decrease prices must be readjusted to world conditions. To-day I received this telegram from Mr Donnelly, secretary to the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures. Resolution carried at meeting of New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures that a request be telegraphed to the Prime Minister, that whatever action lies in the pow^T of the Commonwealth Government that would tend towards reduction in price of coal sliould be immediately taken, as the high price of coal is one of the chief causes of present industrial depression and consequent unemployment. It is no use burking the facts, for there they are. Coal is the raw materiul of perhaps ninety-nine out of every hundred manufactured articles i u this country. It enters into each manufactured article from 10 per. cent, up to 70 per cent., and unless and until it is reduced in price we cannot expect to be able to compete successfully and so provide employment for our citizens. I do not mean to say that the prioei should be reduced by cutting wages and leaving the profits of the mine-owners just where they are. The Sydney Morning Herald recently had an excellent leader on the subject. pointed out that the suggestion had been made that the necessary sacrifice should be mode by the men while nothing was said about the mine-owners. It dis. agreed w i th that view, and contended that this was a time fox both parties to make sacrifices if any had to be made. W it h that I agree; it expresses my own I know. If I thought opinions. I now leave the questiou of coal, and come to that of sugar. I shall not go into it at any great length. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) seems concerned about the high price of sugar. He is, of course, against reducing wages, The for he believes in wages being high. Y e t , curiously enough, he wants cheap goods. May I point out to h i m that there is one obvious way to get cheap sugar, and that is to get black-labour sugar. If the honourable gentleman doos not believe in that course, I recommend h i m to go and see the men engaged in the cane-fields. Leth i m watch those men at work ; and if he ean, then come and say that they ought to work for less than they are getting ing humbugs about the matter; there is no way in which we can get white-grown sugar unless we can induce men to go to the tropical and semi-tropical' parts of Australia, and do the hardest work that men can be called to do in this country. Personally, I would sooner do firing in the gas-works than cut cane. We have to face the question; it is a fundamental one. We have to make up our minds to use black-grown sugar, or else pay the price for white-grown sugar. We cannot t discuss this great question now; but it will have to be faced. The Leader of the Opposition says that the Colonial Sugar Befining Company is making great profits. The figures I have here are those which I quoted when the sugar agreement was before the House. The refining charge of tbe company is £ 1 l is . per to n ; the selling charge 7s.. per to n ; and cost of management £ 1 per ton, or altogether £ 2 18s. One penny per lb. is £ 9 6s. 8d., and £ 2 18s., I should say, represents about 5-16ths of a penny; but this honourable members can work out. If the price of sugar is high to-day, it is notbecause the Colonial Sugar Befining Company is getting exorbitant profits.

The fact is, as the honourable member knows perfectly well, that we had to pay u p to £ 1 0 0 per ton for sugar as a result of the shortage in the Australian crop; and as we were selling sugar at £ 4 6 la. 6d., it was necessary for the Commonwealth to recoup its loss,, and thab is being done. It has been said that we have long ago made up that loss, but there is not a word of truth in the statement. overdraft. As soon as it is made up, sugar will drop immediately in price. However, this question cannot be dealt with -as a. side question cn an occasion like this. from interested quarters about sugar, but I invite Ihose who talk so much to see the conditions under which sugar is grown. I invito those people to visit the great State of Queensland, at which some are sneering as if it were some foreign country.. The men in that great industry in our Northern State are doing their best-and their best is very goodto develop our Vast and wonderful tropical lands. There are people who talk about Java as a place where cheap sugar may -he got; let those people go to Java and see how sugar is grown there and compare it w it h the conditions obtaining in Australia. I have figures prices of sugar in various of the world to-day. the price is £46 Is. 6d.; in the United Kingdom, £48 10s.; and in New Zealand, £48 10s. f.o.b. Auckland. retail prices are-Australia, Kingdom, rica, 6 cents, or 3d.; New Zealand, 4Jd. to 5Jd.; and South Africa, 5d. We must remember that in South Africa all sugar is grown by coolie labour, and yet the price is 5d: per lb. sugar here at 5d., if it were not that we havo to make up the amount we lost through buying overseas sugars when the price was high. disclose affairs. could be sold here at a very much lower Mr Bughes. All I oan say price than that which we now pay, and that the jam and other industries using sugar cannot compete in the markets of the world as a result. What are the facts? Java whites are quoted at £18, or landed I say that the charges here at £ 3 0 6s. 4 d . ; CubaB £ 1 4 15s., landed £28 16s. 4d.; American granulated £20 5s., landed £29 10s., and Belgian granulated £20,. landed £29. These figures show that imported sugars are only about . l d . less per lb. than the price of Australian coarse sugar, which is £39 15s. Australian j a m manufacturers who manufacture for export get their sugar at 30s. per ton less than the world's parity to-day. Remember, it is the oversea trade to There is still an which we must look; we have long ago exploited our own comparatively restricted market. All these facts have to be assimilated. The extentto which our export trade is growing is not, perWe hear a lot of talk haps, generally recognised. Sometimes, too, it is forgotten how for many years we in Australia had the cheapest sugar in the world, and nobody w e n suggested that the sugar-grower in Queensland ought to bring his price up to the world's parity. I remind honourable members again that not only j a m manufacturers, but the manufacturers of milk, confectionery, biscuits, and the like for export get their sugar at 30s. per ton cheaper than tbe world's parity, while such goods going into England get tbe advantage of tbe English preference, so that the man who exports to the United Kingdom, as the majority of our manufacturers do, are in a much better position than are the manufachere showing the turers in any. other part of the world. countries I repeat that the price of sugar to-day In Australia is regulated only in part by ' t he contract, and in part is the result of the high price at which foreign sugars had to be purThe chased during the shortage.

He complained that we had not indicated that we intended to increase We could sell these pensions. He brought in this reference almost as an afterthought, at the tail-end of his speech. Every one desires to do whatever is possible for the aged, I think those figures the invalid, and the unfortunate, but we a fairly satisfactory state of have to consider fhe circumstances of this It is said that imported sugar country. The Leader of the Labour party knows very well what our financial position is. Theodore* well put it , "" The States now find themselves limited in many ways by finance."" Invalid and old-age' pensions to-day are on the same basis as that on whioh the Labour party p u t them when the scheme was first introduced. The Government recognise to the f u l l their obligations ta the aged, the invalid, the unfortunate, and are endeavouring by means qf proposals w i th regard to health which we hope to develop, to do something for them. We cannot, however, venture upon proposals that would land us in a financial morass. If we did the Leader of the Labour party would be the first to denounce us. The honourable member's references to old-age and invalid pensions are just an electioneering placard. When they were last before the country, the Labour party put forward .a policy showing what they would do if returned to power. They said that they would increase the invalid and old-age pensions to £ 1 per week; that tbey would provide pensions for widows and orphans, and pensions for children whose fathers could' not whilst they would also provide food, and medical and dental My' honourable friend ' the member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , who was a very effective return showing what it would .cost to give effect to these proposals. He showed that they would involve an annual charge of £17,114,976 in respeot of ipvalid, old-age, and these additional pensions, or a total increase of £11,320,000 per annum over tbe expenditure under these heads at that time. My answer to the Leader of the Opposition must be exactly that made by Mr Theodore to the unemployed when, in reply to a request for help, he said, "" We have not got the money."" The claimof the aged and invalid is, however, a just oue. considered as any other persons in thc community. greater claim. The circumstances of the Commonwealth, however, must be taken into account. It would be well, perhaps, for honourable members opposite to t u r n their eyes towards MeccaI mean Moscow-and see how it fares w it h the old, the infirm, and the unfortunate in that part of the world.

There, under the benign .influence and protection of the dictatorship of the proletariat they are h it on the ' 'head by Chinese mercenaries. As time is fleeting let us turn from this prospect of assassination as a remedy for old-age to the TradesH a l l Congress-if I may in this colloquial way refer to such au exalted body-whic h met in Melbourne the other day. In the all too brief time available after furious internecine struggles between tbe rival factions, they dealt with world affairs which they shortly disposed of in one sweeping resolution which covered unemployment and all other ills from which modern civilization suffers. The aged and the invali d were there in long drawn out attenuated lines. And what did that Trade Union Congress do? They carried the following resolutionThat this CongresB desires to place on record :1. That under its scheme for the socialization of industry there would be no unemployed problem. maintain them, 2. That in its programme of hours and wages unemployment will be considerably minimized here and now. attendance. 3. That provision of food, shelter, and honourable clothing for all citizens in want through depression is the duty and then Treasurer, prepared responsibility of the country through its Parliament. Having agreed to this motion, members of the Congress went home-and tbey all travelled first class. I point out' to the besotted dupes outside that it is in this fashion tbe so-called Labour party now deals witb all matters. It wrangles long over internal squabbles, it dismisses world problems with a windy resolution, and then goes homo-in the first class. Tbis last is their settled habit. It was made plain to us at the recent Economic Conference that representatives of the employees would not attend They have aa much righ t to be the Conference unless they were paid, their expenses. Their expenses rested They have, indeed, a upon this foundation: That they should receive ""an amount equal to the wages they would havo earned if they, had been left at work, plus their hotel and travelling expenses. To this I agreed, and when one wage slave made out his account he put in for a daily wage of £2 5s. representatives.",23,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
29,Mr Blakelkt,"As did the employers?ther they did nor not. A t any rate, they did not go about indulging in canting, whining humbug in regard to the unemployed problem. They did not.talk about the socialization of industry, and the class problem, nor did. they take up the standard adopted by Mr Tom AV«lsh, who having said, ""We are going to have the same kind of accommodation for the seamen on board ship as is provided for first class passengers,"" then got me to prothe highest possible respect as a man, vide him with a first class railway ticket and reserve him a sleeping-berth and first class accommodation while the crew had to travel second class and sit up all night. What canting humbug this is! What do these people care about the unemployed? They live on them. There are many other points with which I ought to deal, but I am afraid I cannot do so at this stage, and must bring my remarks to a conclusion. members opposite, as one can see, are brought very low. They take counsel one with another, but no man dare lead, for leadership is not an attribute of sucb a party. T i e Labour party of today does not breed leaders. members of the party receive instructions, and even these are contradictory They do not know what their objective is. Their position is like that of Mr Theodore, who, at the Brisbane Conference in 19'21, said, "" Must we' swallow tbese Communistic doctrines without a struggle?"" They were carried, and tbey bad to swallow them Speaking at tbe 1921 Conference, Mr Theodore saidI t was extraordinary that there should be Wales, with its head-quarters at Mncmen at the Conference preaching the doctrines of Russian Communism and the Industrial Workers of the World of America. With very great respect to some of those gentlemen, he stated that they had previously been propounding, these views as opponents of the Australian Labour party. They ought to understand very clearly where they were going. They were leaving the well-beaten path of the Labour movement, and were adopting totally new and strange doctrines, and he was perfectly satisfied that the workers of tlie old tbe timbers of the -temple of Labour havmovement would not endorse such views and principles. He could uot possibly do so. He would have to take some action that would put the Labourites of Queensland on the right track. Since Mr Theodore uttered those words the 1922 elections bave taken place in New South Wales, and what Mr Theodore said has proved to be more than abundantly true. No man in the LabouT movement now knows where he stands. The Conference that met tbe other day reaifinmed the Brisbane objective, and the representatives of the party are to-day men in hobbles, in fetters; their souls aTe not free; tbey cannot decide what they shall do, say, or even think. These two amendments moved by my honourable friend, Mr Charlton, for whom I have show conclusively where members of tbe party stand. They are bankrupt of ideas. They arc torn' in tbe grip of two great international forces. I say that deliberately, and tbey will be deserted by. seven out of ten of the genuine, hona fide working men who are not themselves tied to tbe wheel of these forces, whenever an appeal to the electors is made. I .am sorry that tbe time Honourable of this House should be taken up by such amendments as tbe honourable member has moved. The charges he has made are written in water. This Government must try to carry on tbe business of tbe country without expecting any aid from a The party composed as is the Labour party at present. . Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [4.3] --The administration of the Australian Labour party and trade union movement have far-reaching public consequences in .both political and industrial spheres affecting tbe character of our Parliaments and the relationships of the workers in the necessary production of the country. There has grown up in New South donell House, Sydney, a Tammany junta, under Boss John Bailey, M.L.A., which systematically plunders and exploits the workers and pollutes Parliament. So disease-laden has the whole machinery of the AustralianLabour party in New South Wales become-the germs of corruption having so infested tbe very warp and-woof of tbe Labour fabricing its vitals so eaten out -with rottenness, that internal reform and rectification bave become impossible.

30,"Mr Hughes,","I will find out wheI n 1917, as Labour campaign direotor for New 'South Wales, two corrupt Labour ballots for tbe selection of -Federal Labour candidates for East Sydney and West Sydney came under my notice. I was largely instrumental in having rbem upset. Tbey represented to me an entirely new and isolated development, and, having bad them upset, the matter ended. I shall refer in particular to these again later. In 1919, in consequence of another extraordinary development, namely, an insidious and widespread propaganda of Eussian origin within the Labour movement, I led a successful campaign to prevent the Labour movement adopting, as its political programme what was in essence the Russian Soviet system, Although an active member of the Australian La'bour party for twenty-five years, and one of its leading organizers and campaigners throughout, I had not previously been associated with any in ternal rivalries or factions. But my experience in searching out the Russian white-anting campaign within the political Labour movement in 1919 revealed to me that I was part and parcel of a movement that now had strange characteristics that I oould not mndcrstand. It was at this point that I joined a clean-ing-up crusade. The 1919-1920 New South Wales State election followed, and T' wns again in charge of the direction of Labour's forces in a successful campaign that roturned the Storey Labour Government. Then came the 1919 Eederal election. The late Mr Ryan, who had retired from the Labour Premiership of Queensland to outer Federal politics, was made Federal campaign director, in order to create an official post -that would give h i m some Federal Labour status throughout the campaign. I was appointed, as usual, in charge in New South Wales, wihere Labour wasvery successful. During these two last-mentioned State and Federal campaigns two startling in cidents came under my notice. The first was an amount of corrupt money coming into the Federal campaign per medium of John Bailoy, M.L.A., President of the New South Wales Central Branch of the Australian Workers Union, and the Tammany Boss of New South Wales Labour. This caused me, after the election, to in vestigate tbe Labour selection ballot of the Goulburn State electorate, for wbich Mr Bailey was returned, and I found it grossly corrupt. A t the 3920 State Australian Labour Party Conference for New South Wales, I bad motions placed on the ofBcial'business-paper designed to correct both tbese vile abuses-(1 ) The receipt by the Australian Labour party of corrupt money, and (2) the corrupt manipulation of Australian Labour party parliamentary selection ballots. But Tammany got in early. W it l i a Conference packed by Tammany-wit h the order of business coming before Conference per the hands of an Agenda Committee appointed under Tammany's direction-and with one"" of Tammany's chief agents-William Lambert-presidin g at the Conference-m y resolutions were at the convenient moment ruled out of order, and I was effectively gagged by what I afterwards discovered was a pre-arranged plan. Tammany dictated its own Australian Labour party Executive for 1920-1921 to control the .movement and Government. Bailey selected the ]>crsonnel, and had his own factotum made returning officer. The rest was easy. The coming into power of the Labour Government provided Tammany with its golden opportunity. Tammany hastened the death of the State Labour Premier, John Storey, and Con. Wallace. In an obvious reference to these two men atBathurst, 17th Ootober, 1921, James Dooley, now New South Wales Labour leader, saidSelf-seekers within the Labour movement are our only danger. lie intrigue against leaders. Many have gone down under it. The movement cannot live unless these are abolished. The late John Storey appealed to me, as this Tammany gang was worrying him and precipitating his fatal illness, and saidThe Labour Conference approaches. I must go away a sick man. Try to save the old movement from a pack of savages. My Ministers will help you. That was John Storey's last .Labour message. When he returned from Englandi t was plain that his l if e was spent. Even then Tammany was sharpening its axe far him, as Cecil Last, one of Tammany's subordinates, blurted out in the press, and the public reception I organized in. the Sydney TownH a l l was in tended as a checkmate to the villanies of the gang. I appealed openly, frankly, and publicly to the Labour movement prior to the 1921 Conference to rescue itself from Tammany, by means of a four-page signed explanatory circular, part of which appeared i u the public press on 27th March, 1921, the following being an extract :Unless some well-reasoned steps are taken to prevent a recurrence of what happened last year, there will be a dictated Executive with a pliable, and, therefore, dangerous, majority, and God only knows what may happen with a Labour Government in office, and an unprecedented industrial crisis in existence. Before going to England Mr John Storey informed me that the major time of Ministers was taken up trying to prevent intrigue and abuses. I gave my word that I would help within the movement to resist an uneducated nnd uncouth dictatorship. Another development of the 1919 elections, the first time in all my experience in the management of Labour campaigns in this State, was that large sums of money originating from sources not' made public were not bond fide administered. It would take too long for this nauseous subject to be dealt with in detail. To put a stop, to all the potentialities for corruption in this state of affairs also became a moBt vital matter. There are moneyed interests in Sydney that wlil bribe thoir way through anything, and squeezing Governments in all manner of devious ways is their favourite get-rich-quick scheme. The Labour movement iB in serious danger of being overwhelmed with illicit money. I appeal to the delegates to the 1921 Conference to aet unitedly together to' prevent our described the corruption of John Bailey great and glorious movement being dragged in the mire of selfishness and corruption. Percy Brookfield, M.L.A., was assassinated on his way from BrokenH ill to Sydney to direct his own campaign amongst the 1921 Labour Conference delegates, aimed at this same Tammany menace. The following I'B taken from Percy Brookfield's appeal to the New South ""Wales Conference delegatesThe question arises, are these corrupt Australian Workers Union duplicate tickets only used to fake selection ballots, or ore they sold forced on New South Wales, the Labour for gain by those who control them, or ""both? Men who do this sort of thing are capable of anything. r Any one winning a selection by means of this faked vote must knuckle under to tliose who control tlie vote, otherwise it wijl be used -against them at a subsequent selection ballot, and they will lose their positions The fact that there are duplicate tickets in existence may explain how it is that certain executive officers have a monopoly of union positions. Certainly if it can be used to fake Mr J. H. Cam. selection ballots it can be used in ballots for the union executive. Without this corrupt vote this vicious Tammany gang are powerless, as the gang of sycophantic creatures who crawl around them only do so in the hope of having this faked postal vote operated in their favour. However, it is time this corrupt vicious gang were cleaned up. They are a menace to the workers. Time does not permit of a description of the villany and the criminality of the 1921 Labour Conference. I explained it in the New South Wales Sunday Times on 16th A p r i l last. There was undoubtedly a good majority for a. clean up; but Tammany having control of the official machinery governing the admission of delegates and the direction of Conference, and finding itself cornered, rallied a sectarian campaign to its aid, and just managed with all its corrupt practices to save itself from defeat. I was again gagged in the 1921 Conference by the chairman, Mr Lambert, refusing to "" call m e "" when I rose to speak on a dozen occasions. Whilst Conference was still sitting I issued an invitation to delegates to meet me in tbe Southern Cross Hal l on 31st March, 1921. I sent a special invitation explaining the purport of the meeting, by hand, to Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, Boote (editor of the Worker), Grayndler (general secretary of bhe Australian Workers Union), and Hinchcliffe (Worker manager). Mr Grayndler I learned was in Melbourne. Of those named only Mr. Boote attended. For two hours I and his Tammany junta to the delegates. Bailey blocked any further action in Conference by commencing a libel suit for £2,000 damages, which he withdrew later on when I gave him eight days' notice to set the case down for hearing. It was in pursuit of my inquiries for the defence of this libel suit that I discovered the widespread nature of the activities of this Tammany junta. An extraordinary election having been Government was smashed at the polls on 25th March, 1922. On 2nd A p r i l, after exhausting every other avenue, for the first time. I published a carefully-considered and mildly-worded ^ analysis of Labour's deplorable condition, with a constructive appeal to the whole of New South Wales Labour to join together in an effort to publicly and candidly put our house in order as absolutely essential if!.we were to be rehabilitated in the contributions in that time.

But the auditors' report has been suppressed, and the report of the Australian Workers Union Convention severely censored, so that the members shall not know how they are cheated and robbed. The manner in which the fund faking of the Central Branch is hushed up shows that the majority of the delegates to the Australian Workers Union Convention, who are mostly officials, are afraid of an inquiry"" for fear of light being let in on tbe whole administration of the union. In connection with the 1919 election for the chief executive of the Australian Workers Union, a committee of inquiry was appointed, and it found that votes were cast for hundreds of faked members' names appearing in the Central Branch books. It was also discovered that the Central Branch had obtained au undue number of duplicate members' tickets from the Worker office. Mr Carmody, an old Australian Workers Union organizer, and constantly in touch with it , states that he has seen large numbers of unsold Australian Workers Union tickets being destroyed in the Central Branch office, but they had the voting slips taken off. These slips are used for ballot-faking in Australian Workers Union elections and Australian Labour party selections. For the past seven years Messrs. Bailey and Australiau Labour party in New South Wales by the manipulation of the machinery and funds of tbe central branch of the Australian Workers Union.' It was barefacedly announced by Tom Arthur, at a meeting of the Australian Labour party executive, that be was a party to a meeting which included Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, at Orange, 15th July, 1915, where it was decided to trunsfer tlio headthat he put £500 into the Labour camquarters of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union from Orange to Sydney, for the express purpose of controlling the Australian Labour party. As the grip of this gang Las increased, so has ship of the party in 1920. corruption become progressively widespread up to the present intolerable and unchallenged condition. The Rabbit Skin Scheme. During the war, this central branch handled rabbits and rabbit skins for its rabbit-trapper membership. This ran into big figures, reaching as much as £150,000 in a year. No balance-sheet was ever published. Mr J. H. Catts. Some individual members, after the greatest difficulty in the world, succeeded in getting, in typed form, what were alleged to be balance-sheets. A few were thus sent out, but they were never published. I defy any one to show me a Worker report, or a report, of the central branch, or of the union as a whole, or to show a balance-sheet published in any of the official organs. Instead of marketing tbese products to save the charges of the middlemen by union officers, as tbe members were led to believe, they were taken delivery of by Johu Bridge and Company, by arrangement with Messrs. Bailey and Lambert. Clarence Bridge stated on 19th April, 1921, that the skins marketed for the Australian Workers Union by John Bridge and Company reached as much as £3,000 per week, and that Bailey received a secret rebate of 2 | per cent, as commission, amounting to £100 per week. Clarence Bridge' indicates what steps should be taken to substantiate bis statement. He states that while shipping was held up during the war, special permits were obtained to ship skins to America, and that tbe profits from this source alone ran into additional thousands per week. These moneys were never accounted for to the membership. ^ At the 1919 Federal election, Bailey Lambert, have controlled the distributed £500 through the Australian Labour party, stating it was Australian Workers Union money. Some of this went to ""certain Federal members to help pay their election expenses. As campaign director, I challenged this money, that it was not from the Australian Workers Union. When cornered, Bailey admitted that be received £1,000 from John Bridge and Company in a lump sum at the time, paign, and could have kept the whole of it. Mr Blakely, president of the Australian Workers Union' has boasted in the leagues of having defeated me for the secretaryI was excluded from meetings of the branches to put my case, and in my absence the best the honourable member for Darling could get in the district in which he lives was an equal division of nineteen for either side. Previously, in a straight-out contest I was elected secretary, with the present Leader( Mr Charlton) as my opponent. In 1920, following the election and the distribution of this John Bridge money, Mr Blakely, president of the Australian. Workers Union, defeated me for the party secretaryship. Both before and since, the Labour movement appointed me to direct its campaigns. Mr Blakely did not defeat me on service or ability. Certain members thought their campaign contributions came from the Australian Workers Union, whereas this money was -part of the stolen property of therabbit^trappers of New South Wales. These are only some of the cases of maladministration of the Australian Workers Union. Much more could be exposed upon inquiry. The Mark Lane Stevedoring Company. The chairmun of this company is J. K. Trethowan, M.L.C. He is also chairman of the Fanners and Graziers Co-operative Company. In 1920, the latter took over tbe business of John Bridge and Company, and continued to handle the rabbit skins for the Australian Workers Union. At this time the handling of wheat at Darling Island was being carried out by day labour, under the Labour Government. At the New South Wales Australian Labour party executive meeting, 11th February, 1921, Mr tralian Labour party executive subseTyrell stated he had reason to believe that tbe Minister for Agriculture intended giving this work by contract to the Mark Lane Stevedoring Company, thus abolishing day labour. He moved, and it was carried, that a letter of protest be sent to the Miuister by hand nest morning. At the same time, Mr Mills, president of the Wharf Labourers Union, saw me and stated that Mr Bailey was trying to have the Darling Island wheat handling dealt with by contractors. About the same time Mr Bailey moved in the New South Wales Labour Caucus to abolish the handling of wheat for the Wheat Pool by day labour and substitute the contract system by wheat agents. Only five members voted for the proposal. Mr Fitzgerald opposed this vigorously. Mr Bailey had the audacity to have a list made of the votersa threat of consequences by Tammany. . Silo Construction. South Wales Labour Government took office in 1920, the construction of silos was incomplete and suspended. The policy of the Labour Government was day labour. Mr Bailey saw Teesdale Smith, contractor, and offered to arrange the contracts for build-. ing the remaining silos, and see that no objection was made by the Railway Workers branch' »of the Australian Workers Union for the sum of £1,000. Teesdale Smith, in anger, came to me about the matter. I at once rang up the Minister for Agriculture, made an appointment, and reported the matter to him. Later on, one of the country Labour members informed me that Mr Bailey had convened a meeting of country Labour members, and there urged the building of the silos by contract. This matter was reported by me to the' Australian Labour party Conference delegates, 21st Marsh, 1921, together with a long catalogue of corruption. Mr Bailey' chose this item for the issue of a writ for £2,000 damages, thinking that as Teesdale Smith bad since died I could not substantiate my statement. The Australian Labour party executive subsequently white-washed Mr Bailey, in their own words they "" accepted Mr Bailey's assurance "" that there was no truth in the statement, and resolved to pay my costs if Mr Bailey withdrew his writ. Upon a notice by me to set the case down for hearing, Mr Bailey withdrew his writ, and the Ausquently paid my costs, between £60 and £70. Mr Bailey stated the Australian Workers Union would pay bis costs. The Lord Mayoralty of Sydney. In 1920 W. P. Fitzgerald was Labour Lord Mayor. Mr Lambert was an alderman, president of the Australian Labour party, and secretary of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union. A proposal to acquire a coal mine for the city council was under the consideration of Labour aldermen. The purchase price was £75,000, and it transpired that the mine had only cost £5,000. The thirteen Labour aldermen were caucused on it, and a small majority forced the other's to concur. Mr Lambert had ambitions to become Lord Mayor. A canvass of his fellow aldermen showed he had no chance. There were When the New two reasons to get Mr Fitzgerald out' *r the way. Mr Bailey was instrumental in bav.ug John Alexander, one of his off-siders; appointed an inspector under the Profiteering Act. Alexander went to the grocer's shop kept by Mr Fitzgerald and reported that a lady assistant demanded I d . over the fixed price for a pint of kerosene. There was a storm in the Sydney press, aud the Lambert campaign to displace Mr Fitzgerald as Lord Mayor was thereby advanced. Suddenly, the inspector's report disappeared from the files of the Profiteering Oourt. that Alexander stole the report and returned it to Bailey. A motion was then submitted to the Australian Labour party executive that Mr Lambert should be made Lord Mayor for 1921, and that the Labour aldermen should be directed accordingly. On the vote tbere were fifteen for and fifteen against, and the acting chairman ( Mr O'Brien) gave bis wasting vote in the negative But tbe matter was raised again later. Mr O'Brien, being promised the presidency of the Australian Labour party, reversed his vote. Other votes were secured, and by direction of the Australian Labour party executive tbe Labour aldermen were unconstitutionally and i l legally directed and compelled to make Mr Lambert Lord Mayor of Sydney. During Mr Lambert's career as Lord Mayor of Sydney, the press, by public exposure, frustrated a number of burglary schemes, such as tbe coal mine scheme, the metal quarry scheme, the asphalt contract, the wood blocks contract, the electric light poles contract, &c. A t tbe elections tbe Lambert regime was peremptorily cut short, and personated votes alone saved Mr Lambert himself. Financial Administration of the Australian Labour Party. Under the controlling, influence of boss Bailey, tbe general blighting atmosphere of corruption permeated the Australian Labour party office. The participants carry out an understanding of mutual protection. SOth March, 1921. A t a meeting of union officials, at whicli I was present, Mr O'Brien, secretary, Musicians Union, stated he knew that £2,000 had been subscribed by the brewing interests, and £1,000 by tbe bookmakers, and he would like to know who appropriated it . The money did not come into the Australian 'Labour party funds. March, 1922. When the State election campaign Labour party office was bankrupt. Worker had stopped its credit, and it was Mr J. B. Gaits. impossible to issue the official organ-The Labour News. The paper actually ceased publication for one week for lack of funds. On the Campaign Committee I insisted, and it was agreed, that the origin of all moneys offered should be disclosed before acceptance in order that their bona fides could be tested. This There is evidence, was not done. The campaign was conducted with oriental splendour. Before the Australian Labour party executive I charged Messrs. Power and Carey, the president and general secretary, with having received thousands of pounds from unnamed capitalists, and showed from the expenditure that large sums of money must have come from somewhere. Mr. Power admitted, on 4th A p r i l , before the executive in answer to my charges, that he and Mr Carey had jointly and individually received £2,000 in. weekly amounts. As a matter of fact, they presented the accounts for running the Australian Labour party weekly to their capitalist supervisors, and received moneys covering them.. On 7th A p r i l , the night of my so-called expulsion, Mr. Power, who had been reflecting upon the charges I levelled at h i m , stated that he received an .additional £1,000 from, the Premier, Mr Dooley. He had already admitted having received £2,000 in weekly sums. I happen to know that £1,000 could not have been received from Mr Dooley. In the end, all the Australian Labour party debts were paid, the Worker account for Lab our News printing, some hundreds of pounds, was paid, and large sums had been squandered .on alleged election expenses. The safeguards with which I attempted to surround the receipt of sums of money to insure (1) that it was not a sordid and treacherous sale of the interests of the workers, and (2) that it would be checked to see that in the negotiations individuals did not receive a "" rake off,"" were broken down. On 4th A p r i l , Mr Farreil, a member of the executive, demanded information as to the thousands of pounds I had compelled Mr Power to admit having received, but the information was refused. Mr Power stated that a f u l l account would be submitted to the Australian Labour party Conference. Neither the commenced ' the Australian executive nor the Conference had any The account submitted to it covering this money. 1 want to say quibe frankly that I believo that men who accept moneys in secret and sell the power and influence of organized Labour themselves profit by the treachery. Upper House Appointments On the Campaign Committee this year, Mrs. Dwyer charged that g r a f t had been in operation in connection with the Labour appointments to the Upper House. She stated that she knew that £ 5 0 0 was paid in one case. If an inquiry is set up the publio will learn more on this subject. ""The Georgeson Case Mrs. Georgeson alleged that she paid £ 5 0 0 to ai Labour member to secure the release of her husband. A circumscribed inquiry was held, the evidence of whioh was suppressed. This, matter should be re-opened and probed to the bottom. It is amazing that the Labour Conference could have met without a single question being asked about it . 1921 Labour Conference. Bailey received £ 5 0 0 from the Liquor interests to pack this conference, and the money was used to primarily serve the interests of Bailey and his Tammany gang. On 9th MarchI had an appointment with tbe Solicitor-General at 7.30 p.m., to make a round of visits to the Alexandria, Newtown, and. Ryde Labour Leagues. caine half-an-hour late, and explained that be had met Mr Stooke, secretary of the Liquor Defence Union, who said be had given £500 to Bailey to organize the Conference, that Mrs. Benson had guaranteed to'organize a band of forty women delegates from variousparts of the country, and that everything would be well with the Government. Subsequently, at a meeting of Ministers, on 14th March, at the Education Department, Messrs. Sproule, Mutch, and Ka.vanagh, Ministers, being in attendance with myself, arrangements were made to impress upon Mr. Stooke that subsidizing Bailey must cease. It did cease, and within a few days Mrs. Benson, one of Bailey's agents, approached an officer of the New South Wales Alliance, and saidMr Hammond must be spending thousands a year on his prohibition propaganda. For a few hundred we could fix the control of thc Labour Conference, and have the platform arranged satisfactorily and swing the Labour movement. Mrs. Benson was informed that there was "" not h in g doing."" Grit newspaper, dated 20th A p r i l , 1922, and printed at the Worker office, states:A well-known member of Parliament was paid a princely sum to control thc 1921 Labour conference iu the interests of the antiprohibition paTty. This article was read by tbe reading supervisor of the Worker office, and must have been brought to the notice of the management. This corrupt Tammany gang was prepared one week to sell the Labour platform to tbe brewers, and the next week, when funds were stopped, to sell the platform to tbe prohibitionists. An inquiry would reveal that the Labour platform had been tampered w it h to suit wealthy capitalist interests. Over a period of years a platform (policy relating to liquor had been evolved,"" but this disappeared without authority by being dropped out of the printed rulebook and platform. The Labour platform has been tampered with in other important directions. It does not matter where the control of the movement in Sydney is touched, corruption, graft, and thieving are evident. Labour carnivals. In 1919, E Simmonds, George-street, Parramatta, mado a proposition to the Australian Labour party to raise £8,000 net between March, He 1919, and February, 1920. Anagreement was made on this basis for a three years' period. These carnivals are a collection of small side-shows and games of chance. I was a member of a committee which for months in 1921 endeavoured to obtain balance-sheets of various carnivals but failed. We eventually gave it up as hopeless. No balance-sheets have ever been submitted witb tbe accounts to tbe Australian Labour party executive or conference. In 1919 AustraUan Labour party accounts show bulk items of £2,085 received and £1,916 expended in Labour carnivals. The general secretary's report states tbe profit was £156. For 1920 income from carnivals, is shown as £75 and expenditure £53, giving a profit of £22.. No reference is made to the carnivals in the general secretary's 1920 report. * For 1921 income from carnivals is shown as £1,791, and expenditure £114, a difference of £1,677. But Mr Carey, in his report, states the p r of it was over £2,000. The funds by which the Australian Labour party's office is run are so difficult to account for that all this juggling must take place in a desperate attempt to cover up their origin. A perambulating Australian Labour party carnival visiting centres between Murwillumbah and Lismore, being unable to submit accounts, was closed up by tbe Government. Those carnivals were supposed to raise funds from the public for a public purpose. There should be a searching inquiry into their financial administration, and. particularly in regard to those held in Hyde Park aud Prince Alfred Park, Sydney. Australian Labour party art uniou. In 1920 permission was obtained from the Attorney-General to conduct an art union for tbe purpose of establishing a library. This was a fraud on the public. There was no intention .to establish a library. A l though these art unions were run in 1920 and 1921, the only books in the Australian Labour party's oflice are volumes, supplied free by the Government. The 1920 general seeretary'3 report statedWc hope in the u.mr future to have a library of economic and general educational value to the younger members of the movement. The Australian Labour party balance sheet for 1920 shows that £152 was received from the art union, and £156 expended. Those figures are absurd. The 1921 Australian Labour party accounts show £186 as having been received on art union account, and £111 expended. Yet the secretary's report declares that there was a loss of £70. In March last I attended a meeting of tie Labour News Board of Control, where it was decided to take £200 from tbe Art Union Library Account to' keep the Labour News afloat turning out mainly sectarian matter. Matron Lackey (Royal Red Cross Modal), 83 Gray-street, Carlton, New South Wales, made the following statement on 27th April, 1922:I know W. A. Gibb, Mill-street, very well. He is an office assistant at the Australian Labour Three years ago Mr Gibb and his family were very hard up and I took an active part in securing relief for them. Mr J. U. Catti. Since this time, he has been employed at the. Australian Labour party head office Mr Gibb manages with Mr Simmons various carnivals for raising funds for the Australian Labour party. He has an Englishman living with him named J . Collar, who is employed at Huddart Parker's wharf. Gibb pays this man £ 1 per night for attending the chocolate wheels at the Labour carnivals. After the* Labour carnival at Hyde Park about twelve months ago, I saw ninety large boxes of chocolates at Mr Gibb's private residence. I countod them. A t the time of the Parramatta Labour carnival, MT . Gibb's son Fred came to my house and said to his mother, "" Father wants you to come home. He has £100 for you to bank."" I saw Mrs. Gibb's bank-book with deposits of £100, £37, £17, and £35, and other amounts. The Australian Labour party conducted an art union, the permission being obtained from the Attorney-General on the plea that the funds were to be used to establish a library at the Australiau Labour party. . 1 saw between 300 and 400 books at Mr Gibb's house. They are there now. Gibb lent me about twenty of them, which are at present in my possession. About six months ago Mr Gibb managed a carnival at Cessnock for the Australian Labour party, and immediately afterwards took a trip Hansard to Melbourne. Thc railway fares for himself and son, including expensos, cost £40, as Mr. Gibb admitted to me. About four months ago Mr Gibb bought the cottage in which he is at present living, in the name of his wife, from Mr Bathief o r £1,100. Mr Gibb informed me that Mr Simmonds and himself owned a number of the side-shows which figure in the Labour carnivals. The accounts of the general administration of the Australian Labour party and Central Branch Australian Workers Union will not bear careful examination. Both should be searchingly inquired into separately and in relation to each other. In tbe one case I have mentioned in which £500 was received from Mr Join Bridges, but was supposed to have come from tie Central Branch of the Australian Workers Union. Other amounts said to be Australian Workers Union money will be found, upon inquiry, to havecome in ' without having any Australian Workers Union origin whatever. The Labour News. At a meeting of tie Labour News Board on 27th March, 1922, it was stated that £500 bad been advanced from Australian Labour party Carlton, funds-thi s bankrupt Australian Labour party-durin g the first quarter of the party, Macdonnel House. year. A special report dated 20th' Feb-i ruary, 1922, of a committee consisting of Messrs. Magrath, Bartle, and Gibb re tbe Labour News accounts, stated, inter aliaWe find it impossible to say for what purpose cheques for large and small amounts wefe drawn in October, 1921, a Mr Fitzmaurice donated £100 to the Labour News amounts from a number of persons can be traced back over a year that the Worker prints 3,500 copies. About 500 of theso go to subscribers and 3,000 to agents, the effective sales of tlie latter being about 2,500. Who Mr Fitzmaurice is, Heaven only knows. What the official organ of the Australian Labour party lent itself to for this and other amounts might be usefully inquired into. Mr Gibb, assistant secretary, also stated at this meeting that there had been embezzlements, and that if Mr Higgins, who had loft his position as manager and editor without notice, had his deserts he would be in gaol. Fraud and dishonesty w i ll be disclosed in regard to other Australian Labour party officials if a proper inquiry is held. It was shown in March last that there had been a continuous heavy loss on the paper, and that no accounts had been posted since February, 1920. Oarey, the general secretary, reported on 21st January, 1921, for the Australian Labour Party Conference as follows:The Labour News has for some time been meeting all its liabilities from its own advertising and sales revenue. . . . ter for congratulation that we have now the BerviocB of an official organ running on without subsidy from the organization. As a member of the Labour News Board, of which Mr Lambert was chairman unt i l October, 1921, I repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested regular monthly meetings, and asked that some kind of supervision should be exercised over the business. any persons, were financing the Labour News was never reported either to the Board or openly to the executive. The condition of affairs disclosed in March last was not submitted either to the executive or to the June Conference. The whole machinery of the Australian Labour party in New South Wales is manipulated to cover up criminality, graft , and corruption. A t the recent Labour Conference Mr McGirr stated that £ 5 0 notes were put into the hand of Labour members by [10] fat bookmakers to influence the course of taxation, and that wealthy brewers paid the expenses of other Labour candidates. There was an inquiry as to disputes beOther Ministers on matters of Labour policy, but there was no investigation which We found touched questions of graft or corruption. In spite of the fact that what I have mentioned is widely known amongst the leading spirits of the Australian Labour party, and that I havo carried on a campaign within the organization for inquiry and reform extending over more than, two years, tbe last Conference has come and gone without any request for either investigation into or correction of widespread corruption. I have by no means exhaustively dealt with the part financial corruption and graf t play in the Australian Labour party and its associate, the Central Branch of .the Australian Workers Union. I have not entrenched upon any confidences. ' But I have said sufficient to render imperativo in tbe public interest a searching inquiry into:-(1) The administration of a great union which bears the imprimatur of the FedeYet Mr ral law, a union in which the members' bave no means by a general meeting of carefully following and reviewing the administration of their affairs, and which tbe law compels them to j o in by scores of thousands as a condition precedent to It is a mattheir obtaining employment. (2) The control and management of the Australian Labour party which now seeks to manipulate public affairs for corrupt purposes. This is tbe first part of the statement which I feel it my duty to place before tbe House and the country. That unknown persons, or that bit? MrJ . H . CATTS -Yes. . I shall have to return to the subject on three or four more occasions in order to deal witb other matters as vital and important as that to whioh I bave referred to-day, but of a different character altogether. It is incomprehensible that members who are put forward to carry the banner of this organization in New South Wales have not taken a united and determined stand for a thorough inquiry into and a correction of the widespread gross abuses.",26,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

32,Mr Bbennan,"I s this only a littleI n all the years during which I have been associated with the Labour movement, I have never before had any serious differences with my colleagues-certainl y not in Parliament, and not with the executive body in New South Wales. During those twenty-five years no man has given more of the' life-blood of his young manhood than I in tbe hard work of the Labour movement, in the organization of its campaigns, and in the preparation of its literature. It may bave been a misfortune or otherwiseI do not know -that my part in tbe Labour movement was associated witb the organization of its campaigns, and was intimately concerned with its management, but it was impossible for me to see what I saw going on recently without protest. Know, ing that a young man could not obtain selection as a parliamentary candidate unless he abased himself to the Tammany junta, which is up for the highest bidder, it WRB impossible for 'me to remain associated with sucb an organization without doing evorything in my power to root that element out. It is of no personal advantage to me to take tbe stand I have. I could have sat down quietly and winked at the whole situation, but I have reported these matters to the Labour organizations in my own electorate, and I have attended Labour Conferences with resolutions on tlie authority of Cook branches of tbe Australian Labour party, and tbe approval of the Cook Pederal Labour Council, placed on the business-paper in accordance witb every requirement of the rule-book, but tbe motions bave been brutally ruled out of order, because tbe Tammany junta would not allow an inquiry or a correction within the Labour movement. This year, 1922, there was every prospect of a Labour Government being again returned to power to work great good for the masses in a difficult and trying time; but when I saw the Labour Government smashed, because the workers of New South Wales had experienced so much of the treachery and rottenness of tbe AustraUan Labour party that tbey spewed the thing out of their mouths, I realized that it was time for me to put tbe facts before the Labour electors in my State, particularly when the Labour press and the Worker suppress all criticism of the thieves and fakirs. Mr J. B. CatU. I repeat what I have said-and it will have to be repeated over and over againthat Labour, organized through the Australian Labour party, cannot be rehabilitated in the good-will and esteem of tbe country until there has been a . thorough cleaning-out of tbe movement. I bave been amused and somewhat shocked to hear the extraordinary statements and accusations of tbe honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts). As my name was associated witb what be has been speaking about, and as be has taken advantage of the protection which parliamentary privilege affords him to make a lot of allegations and assumptions of a very serious nature, I think it devolves upon me to show honourable members that there is not an atom of truth in any one of those statements. Tbe honourable member has abused all and sundry; be has referred to me as an associate of a gang of corruptionists, and as a person who has manipulated, corruptly the funds of a political body and a great industrial organization. BeforeI deal witb those statements, I would like to mention one pr two matters that concern the honourable member vitally. He stated that the late Hon. John Storey, shortly before his death, had an interview with him and said, "" Eor God's sake, save us from .these savages!"" Mr Storey is a dead man, and that statement was made by Mr Catts after bis death. Mr J. H . CATTS -It was made before his death. made a statement in the presence of several members of the State parliamentary party in New South Wales, that the Eederal Parliamentary Labour party was not worth its salt to allow a man .like Mr Catts inside its ranks after the disgraceful Court proceedings in connection with a certain law case of the honourable member.

He mentioned tbe names of men such as Mr JamesT y r r e l l , Mr Woods, of tbe Wharf Labourers Union, Mr Mills, MrW ill i a m Carey (secretary of the Australian Labourp a r t y ) , and Mr Gibb, who is at present acting secretary.

42,Mr Lambert,"It is the executivepreserved complete silence, and in fairness to the honourable member who is now replying, I ask that he be accorded the same treatment. by honourable members, the honourable member for Cook has been a member of the Labour party for some years, but be offered himself to the National party some years ago before be was selected to represent Labour in New South Wales. exact date off hand, but the information is at my disposal elsewhere. If all that the honourable member for Cook has Baid be true, why did he squeal so loudly when he wad booted out of the Labour organization recently? He was intimately associated with the management and counsels of the Labour movement in New South Wales, and if bis allegations have any foundation in fact, he must bave been a party to all that was taking place, and must be held equally guilty with every other person connected with the organization. The honourable mem-, ber has stated that money was illicitly received by some person or organization. I was president of the Australian Labour party for five years, and I voluntarily resigned from the position. It was not part of my duty, as president, to handle the cash of the organization; that is the duty of the secretary and the finance committee. The honourable member told tbe House that he beard somebody say that Mr Bailey had received £1,000 from tlie brewers' organization, and that he handed £500 to some Labour delegates, and pocketed the balance. alleges that he heard a lady say that she could get £500 from the brewers to pack the Australian Labour Party Conference. That was a most cowardly statement, and slanders a man and woman who, so far as I know, are decent and honest. On the face of it tbe statement, is absurd. The Conference is composed of delegates elected from hundreds of branches of the organization throughout New South Wales, and from the big affiliated trade unions, and to talk of packing such a great body by means of an' expenditure of £500 is ridiculous. It would be necessary for each and every one of the delegates to be corruptible. Usually there arc over 20.0 delegates from all parts of tbe States, and at least 50 per cent, of them would require to be dishonest and ready to sell their vote for a couple of pounds. No doubt, if anything like that was taking place, tbe honourable member for Cook bad a better knowledge of it than I had, and be probably was the gentleman most concerned. He spoke about thc criminality of the Labour Conference of 1921, and seems to be very much aggrieved because some motion brought forward by him was ruled out of order. Tbe honourable member is one who would understand the standing orders of any organization witb which be was connected, and ho knows that most constitutions give tbe right to any member or delegate to move dissent from any ruling by the chairman. I believe that the honourable member for Cook did move some unimportant and superfluous motion in regard to a matter already provided for in the constitution, and bis proposal was accordingly ruled out of order. A motion of dissent was submitted, but the ruling was upheld by about 200 votes to six. Apparently the honourable member accuses the 200 delegates who voted against bim of being dishonest and corrupt, thieves, swindlers, and criminal intriguers. He quoted a remark said to bave been made by the late Mr Percy Brookfield about tbe duplication of Australian Workers Union tickets. All the tickets issued by tbe Australian Workers Union are printedat The Worker office, in Sydney, and the trustees of that newspaper are the only indentors of a particular class of paper. When tbe tickets are printed tbey are distributed to tbe branch secretaries throughout AusHe also tralia in accordance with orders previously sent by them to' the manager of The Worker. These branch secretaries must account for every ticket, and if tbey do not return intact all tickets unissued, they must pay for those that are missing. It is not likely that an oflicer receiving £400 or £500 per annum would pay for many tickets at 25s. each in Order to steal a few votes for himself. It is easy to say 'that the late Mr Brookfield made a statement; the .poor fellow has gone to his grave, and cannot deny tihe allegation. I understand, also, that the machine which prints the tickets in The Worker office has a special numbering device, and that it is almost impossible to imitate or fake that number in any way. On one occasion some bogus tickets did appear in",37,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

45,Mr Lambert,"I cannot state theconnexion with a Labour selection, ballot in the old Naomi electorate, 'but I do not think that the candidates included one member of the Australian Workers Union, let alone an officer of that organization. Mr OoNsroiirc; -It was an Australian Workers Union officer who exposed the corruption. by the returning officer. OEte discovered that some forged voting-slips similar to those attached to the Australian Workers Union tickets had been used in order to record votes for a certain candidate; but those votes were not admitted. An in quiry was held as to the genuineness of the tickets, and the forgery was detected at a glance. Upon that incident tbe honourable member for Cook founds an allegation that there is widespread duplication of tickets in connection witb the Australian Workers Union, that there is. widespread fraud amongst its officers, and that the whole organization is corrupt and rotten. As for the statements of the honourable member for Cook-thos e in which he slanders various officers) of the Australian Workers Union throughout Australia, and dumps them down here as criminals and, altogether, as persons who cannot be trusted, as men who are robbing the workers of AustraliaI would stake my reputation against that of the honourable member at any time. Morally or privately, or from the political or any other stand-point, my reputation will compare more than favourably with that of the honourable member. Moreover, there is not an officer in the Australian Workers Union to-day who cannot say the seme. Each and every individual of those officers is elected, in his own respective branch, by a plebiscite of members; not by any postal vote, but by votes marked in the various camps, or sheds, or quarries, or in whatever place members of the Australian Worhers Union may be employed, by a deputy returning officer. These votes are sealed and addressed to a returning officer in Sydney. No person other than that returning officer has access to the papers, and he does not see them u n t i l he has opened the box concerned, and is ready to count the votes in the presence of two scrutineers. The honourable member for Cook has in its funds as a result of carrying also said that it is about time some searchthrough the scheme. It was a matter of ing inquiry was made into the scheme which I initiated for the benefit of the bush workers in 1918, or thereabouts. This project was known as the rabbit-skin handling scheme. I was then secretary of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, situated at Orange.' I could see that the rabbit trappers, who are mostly members of the Australian Workers Union, were not getting a square deal. The middlemen and small buyers Yes ; it was exposed at the various centres and stations and corners throughout New South Wales wvre buying up the trappers' stuff at less than half the f a ir price. I initiated a scheme, and advertised it , and got, as best I could, into touch w it h practically all of the men concerned. 1 asked the' trappers to send me their skins, and said I .would r u t them on the Sydney auction market, and would get them a fair price. The si'beme was p u t into operation, and 1 put through many tens of thousands of pounds worth pf skins. I received actually, in some cases, as much as in the vicinity of 17s. for 1 lb. of skins, and sometimes as much as £80 odd for about 60 lbs. of rabbit skins. This was at auction. Tho carrying on of the scheme naturally entailed a little labour. I had an expert for a while whom I had trained up w it h the scheme, and I bad also a stenographer. I was getting a rebate from the Belling agents of 1J per oent. in-order to carry on the business, and pay for my labour. That 1J per-oent. did not quite' suffice to keep matters going. I considered, there-, fore, that it would be an absolutely f a i l thing if I were to make a further deduction. I thereupon deducted another $ per cent, f r om the returns sent to me. Tbat was done, of course, witb the f u l l knowledge and acquiescence of the people who were sending me their goods. This$ per cent, made up a total of 2 per cent. Whether the scheme w ill 'be carried on further, I do not know. It has been practically dead for the past six months or more. There have been no rabbits to skin; the drought wiped out nearly all of them. Just latterly, however, the rabbits are becoming more plentiful again, and men are beginning to d r if t out, and to take on trapping once more. Thus, probably, the scheme will be carried on further. I understand that the Australian Workers Union itself is about £ 5 0 behind",38,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
46,Mr Lambert,"organization in order to benefit members of the Australian Workers Union, and also of organizing the men themselves into the union. So much for the honorahle member for Cook and his bald and unscrupulous statement. The honourable member knows that I went over the whole of the ground in connection witb the scheme before the Australian Workers Union, at' an annual convention, and that I produced a balance-sheet there, and was unanimously complimented by the conference of delegates from all over Australia upon tbe way in wbicb I had initiated and bandied the project. Tbe honorable member for Cook made a deliberate and wilfully untrue statement when be said that there was no balance-sheet published in connection with the scheme. A balance-sheet haB been published from time to time, and the whole of tbe accounts in connection with tbe scheme are kept by an. expert bookkeeper in the Australian Workers Union offices. When statements of the kind wbicb have been uttered by tbe honorablo member are publicly made, one cannot rofer to them other than by stigmatizing them as unscrupulous and untruthful-baldly , as lies-and as not being fair to anybody, either inside or outside of this House. It comes very hard upon honourable men outside of this chamber that thoy should be so attacked. It ia particularly hard upon them that a person sucb as the honourable member for Cook, under the protection and privileges of Parliament, should come here and make such a determined and cowardly attempt to destroy their characters. The honourable member has mentioned a statement which be alleges was made to bun by the late Mr Teesdale Smith. It is_ significant that the honorahle member did^ not announce that Mr Teesdale Smith had told him certain things until after that gentleman had died. The honourable member seems to have a convenient knack of doing such things. He made some statement, I believe, at a gathering of bis own friends in Castlereagh-street, at the time of the 1921 Ausbe takon by any honest person. tralian Labour Party Conference. Things wore not going too well with bim at that conference, and he became so perturbed and disgruntled that he got a few of the malcontents around bim. I hardly like Ur. Lambert. to call them Tammanyites, for that would be employing a word which the honourable member himself likes to use, but wbicb expression is so played out that only the honourable member would now resort to it. He gathered these friends about him, and, with a nourish of trumpets and the beating of drums, called them together in a little hall in Castlereagh-street. There happened to be one or two honest men there, and afterwards they made known what tbe honourable member for Cook bad told those present. I understand that there were also representatives of the press present. I do not think they published the honorablo member's statements, -however, for the reason that they were too libellous. I shall now quote an extract from the apology of the honourable member, made in connection witb this business. ' I understand that Mr J. Bailey, a member of tbe New South Wales Legislative Assembly, issued a writ against the honourable member for Cook for a sum of £1,000, OT the like. The honourable member for Cook has just stated in this chamber that he gave Mr Bailey eight days in which to go ahead with the charge. I do not know just exactly what is the legal position in Victoria, but I understand that, in New South Wales, if a person issues a writ against another be has an option concerning when be shall go on witb it ; that is to say, as to when the case shall be dealt with. The extract from the honourable member's apology is as follows -After the denial of the truth of it by Messrs. Alexander Brown& Co., solicitors for Mr Bailey, I accept the, opportunity this evening to apologize in connection w.ith this Teesdale Smith matter. My apology is full, unreserved, and withdraws all imputations that might be considered made. The honourable member for Cook has stood up in his place in the House of Representatives and has made deliberately untrue statements. I have the proof of their untruthfulness. Moreover, as I remarked ab the beginning of my speech, in my own opinion, and in that of very many other men who know the honourable member, his word is one which cannot I do not propose to deal with, every petty insinuation and obviously untrue statement that the honourable member has made here. It is not a very pleasant thing for me to drag into this Chamber details concerning the organization with which I have the honour to be connected. It is most distasteful, indeed, thab such matters should be aired in Parliament, particularly when they are altogether irrelevant to the subject under discussion. But since the honourable member for Cook has been allowed to get this "" dope,"" or "" tripe,"" into Hansard, then, no matter, how distasteful the task, I feel it to be my duty to make reply. In conclusion, I desire to point out that the honourable member for Cook is a disgruntled and disappointed man to-day. He has been kicked out of the Labour party for turning traitor; for being absolutely disloyal to the party. He has been disappointed in his aspirations; his ambitions have not been fulfilled. He has aspired to every position in the movement. I cannot help it if the movement has not seen fit to put him into any one of those positions which he has sought. He has aspired to f ill practically every office offering in the Labour party movement, both State and Federal. But the members of the party, and of the Conferences, and of the executives, have taken the honourable member for Cook at his own face value. They have distrusted him, and under no circumstances have they been induced to give to h i m any position in the movement. Therefore, in his disappointment and chagrin at the failure of his intrigues, he has practically sold the Labour party. Whereupon, I repeat, for turning traitor, he has now been, expelled. Now he is endeavouring to expose a lot of faked or imaginary grievances and crimes, and having made the allegations so often, no doubt he is beginning to think that some' of them aro true. Mr J. H . CATTS -As a personal explanation I should like .to say that the apology to Mr Baileyi n connection witb the Teesdale Smith matter has not been correctly stated by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Lambert). Before the writ was served upon me, I was asked if I would go to the Labour Conference and explain the matter, and accept Mr Bailey's denial. It was .my object to get the whole of the facts before the Labour Conference, and I made a categorical statement setting fort h the facts. It was B. tactical method of getting the facts officially before the Conference. These facts were so terribly damaging to Mr Bailey and others that his solicitor absolutely refused to allow them to . go before the Labour Conference. . I h a d ' drafted my letter in that particular way in order that the whole matter should go before the Conference, b u t they declined to allow it . As a matter of fact, therefore, that apology was not made at all: It was after the refusal, to regard this as an apology that the w r it was issued. The honourable member for West Sydney merely read a few lines out of a threepage foolscap typewritten document, in which I sought to'get a l l of the facts before the Labour Conference. I shall deal with other points raised by the honourable member for West Sydney on another occasion. I am very glad that, in view of"" the Prime Minister's unsatisfactory state of health to-day, the indulgence which he asked of the House was extended to h i m ; but making all allowances for bis ill health I must confess that I have never heard h i m flounder so badly as be did this afternoon in bis attempt to reply to the charges made by the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Charlton). The real issues before tbe House were not. touched upon at all by the right honourable gentleman. He mentioned them, it is true, but then he endeavoured by a. s k i l f ul manipulation of words to evade any specific statement. He accused the honourable member for Hunter of being extremely solicitous now about the. carrying out of, a number of important public works in connection w it b Ibe Postal Department, and wanted to know what tbe honourable member or bis party bad done in connection withthese public works. Without unnecessary boasting as to tbe achievements of the Labour party, at that time, it may be said that the first Fisher Government, which held oflice from 1910 to 1913, carried out, as part of a continuous policy in connection witb the Post Office, a number of important works, such as the undergrounding of telephones, w it h the result that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), as Treasurer, is now receiving a considerable amount of revenue. I am sure the Minister for Defence( Mr. Greene) w ill admit that I am stating the facts. He knows very well that, in order to insure the best results, there must be continuity of policy in big public undertakings, and that it is unwise to shut down on works simply because tbe end'of the financial year is approaching, because",39,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment
47,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong ) [5.43].,"when Parliament has given the necessary authorization there must necessarily be some loss of time before the staffs can be assembled again. . It was the policy of the Eisher Government to insure continuity in the carrying out of such publio works, and, therefore, large sums of money were made available from time to time. trouble. It has not been done hitherto. events, it, was done by the Fisher Administration in connection with the underground ing of telephones, and there was continuity of work. I challenge honourable members opposite to deny this, stateinet, and he must have known there was a ment. On other occasions, I have pointed out these facts to the members of the present Ministry, so they cannot now claim .to be the originators of the proposal . 'When the Prime Minister suggests that the Leader of tbe Opposition and bis party have never done anything to push on with, great developmental publio works in connection witb this great money-earning Department, he is cer-' tainly talking with his tongue in his cheek. My complaint now is that the Government did not make an earlier start with these developmental works that have been outlined. Por some years, there has been absolute unanimity of opinion in the Houso as to the necessity for a more progressive polioy in connection with the Postal Department, and only now, at the eleventh hour, bave the Government come down with a flourish of trumpets ing when it is being done? ing. I am only expressing regret that this policy was not adopted much earlier because the Government have practically had' the assent of Parliament to this course of aotion. ' Nobody is more opposed than I am' to the spending of publio money without parliamentary authority, but when there are 13,000 people throughout Australia waiting to pour money into the Treasury as soon as they can get telephonic connexions, tbe Government would be justified in taking some definite steps promptly to secure the additional revenue. Parliament would readily assent to the expenditure for this purpose. late in the day, bave come down with a proposal to spend about £8,000,000 over a series of years at the rate of about £2,000,000 per annum to bring our telephonic and telegraphic services up to date, but I suppose that before anything is really done, they will await the vote of Parliament for tbe authorization of tbe first loan. of the Department for six months. This is tbe first scheme I took in hand. unfair to the Minister. I know be has been only six months at tbe bead of the Postal Department, but for some three years he has been a member of the Cabconsensus of opinion in this House that these postal works should be proceeded with without delay. there long enough to say that be will refuse to reduce the postal rates, but I think Parliament will make him. me aright, I think that when the Fisher Government introduced tbe proposal to reduce tbe postage rates from 2d. to l d . -and some people regarded that as the greatest reform ever carried out in connection with tbe Post OfficeI voted for tbe retention of the old rate of 2d. On the question of immigration, I want to make it quite clear that my Leader and other honourable members on this sido have said, over and over 'again, that as a party we are not opposed to immigration, provided a scheme is formulated to absorb tbe immigrants, as well as employ our own people. That must be done first. The Prime Minister declared that the States would receive no financial help from the Commonwealth Government unless their immigration schemes insured that tbe immigrants should go upon the land. But what are tbe results? I come in contact with many farmers, and I know what is happening. Only the other day I was informed by a returned soldier farmer that bis experience and the experience of many others waa. that, after about a fortnight or three weeks on tbe land, very many of tbe immigrants gravitate to tbe cities seeking employment. I remind the House of what happened in Victoria.

These men, many of them, are now in our workshops and other city concerns. afraid that the same results will follow the adoption of the present immigration scheme, and that while the Commonwealth Government may advance money to the States for the purpose of settling newcomers on tbe land, by-and-by they will come trooping in their thousands into the towns and cities looking for employment. Only to-day I beard on very good authority bow immigration is affecting men who have been engaged in the Newport Workshops for years carrying out important works of construction. Last week thc order came for the displacement of a large number of them, and though there was no serious decline of work to justify sucb a step, these Australian-born citizens bad to make way for others who have recently been brought from the other side of tbe world.

If tbe climatic conditions are all right, and proper facilities are provided, the Western Australian scheme ought to prove a good one; but, at tbe same time-and I shall be borne out by Queensland representativesI think the Queenslond Government have put forward tbe best proposition up to the present. There are in that State the Burnett lands, ai magnificent tract of country awaiting settlement, fertile, with certain facilities already thera, and others to be provided. When, however, the Commonwealth Government is approached by a State Labour Government to take part in It is an adthe development of. this land, which would provide work for tbe unemployed and for immigrants, no desire is shown to co-operate. Immediately, bowever a scheme is ; suggested in Western Austraha, where the political complexion of the Government is different, the Prime Minister is prepared to offer help. Mr Theodore, because be is the Leader of a Labour Government, cannot induce the Prime Minister to take any further interest in the scheme for the Northern State; and I charge thc Government with, in this instance, drawing an obvious distinction. Tbis afternoon the Prime Minister mado the wonderful statement, that it is the duty of tbe State Governments to see that the people are employed. Tbe Commonwealth Government bave a Post and Telegraph Department and a Works and Railways Department, and they are carrying out, or assisting in carrying out, such great schemes as that on tbe Murray. At present, millions are being spent in giving employment, and millions more could be spent if tbe Government were a Utile more sympathetic. It is the duty of the Government to find employment, seeing that there aire Federal works which, have to be carried out in the various States. Another peculiar statement made by tbe Prime Minister is that to increase old-age pensions would .draw tbe Government into a "" financial morass."" Did ever a more unsympathetic sentence fall from the lips of a Prime Minister, or any other member of this House? Tbe dear old men and women of this land have gone through trouble and trials, of which wo of this day bave had no experience, but of which we have heard, and yet these pioneers, in a time of high prices, are expected to livo on 15s. a week. Tbe honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) read tbe letter of a town clerk in one of tbe coal-mining districts to tbe effect that, owing to tbe revaluations that have taken place, tbe pensions in some cases bave been reduced by 7s. a week. I do not wonder at some public authorities taking action when the Prime Minister states that to increase old-age pensions would lead us 1 into a "" financial morass.'' What would the additional expenditure of £1,500,000 mean to a wonderfully wealthy community like this, especially when we are spending so much money in directions that do not mean nearly so good a return ?",43,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

75,Mr Fenton,"That, of course, comeson the Defence Estimates. must remember that this money paid in pensions will remain in the community. Many of these old pensioners have now to live on "" bread and scrape,"" with, nerhaps, tea with no milk, and very little sugar. They are imperfectly clothed, aud compelled to live in houses that can fairly be classed as hovels, and a few shillings a week would mean much to them. Surely of all who need nourishing food, we must have regard to those in their declining years. We have a revenue of £60,000,000 -ing ut the Conference. He took no part It is true that the Treasurer, Mr Bruce, forecasts an insignificant deficit of about £200,000; but, owing to the Pacific arrangement, great savings can be made, and those savings might well be devoted to relieving the distress of our old people. I am astonished to hear such a stubborn, hard-hearted statement from the Prime Minister as that to which I have referred. The right honourable gentleman leads and holds the Government in the palm of bis hand, and yet he declares that to grant this little extra money will mean leading us into a financial morass. Shame that sucb a sentence should be given utterancei in the Parliament of a country like this! As to the Washington Conference anybody would think from tbe speech of the Prime Minister that everything done there was due to himself; but had it not been for the agitation on this side of the House, and on the part of both press and public, it is doubtful whether the Government would have Bent a representative, Almost '' from the jump ' the Prime1 Minister tried to "" (brow cold water "" on the project; and when Senator Pearce wus on his way to Washington, the right honourable gentleman spoke of the Conference in quite a contemptuous tone, saying, "" The Washington . Conference for what it is worth.'' But I should say that the Washington Conference has been fruitful of far greater results than the Prime Minister ever expected. I think that our protests in the earlier stages of the discussion on tbe representation of Australia at tbe Conference were well justified. No member of the Parliament was more of a militarist, or more under military control, than was Senator Pearoe, and we were opposed to the appointment of sucb a delegate. Our desire was that Australia Bhould be represented by. a man whose very soul was charged witb a desire for the peace of the world, and who would do all within bis power to bring about tbe disarmament of the nations. For tbe most part Senator Pearce's actions, up to that time, showed that his sympathies were in the opposite direction; but, ardent militarist that be was, the discussions which took place in this House had a very salutary effect upon bis attitude at the Conference. . in its deliberations. were absolutely dependent upon the British delegation for tbe expression of our views at tbe Conference; but the honourable member will, no doubt, admit that Senator Pearce was ablo to tender advice to the British delegates as to Australia's attitude. I rejoice that so eminent a man as Mr (now Earl) Balfour was at tbe head of tbe British delegation. I believe that that honoured man went to the Conference burning with a desire to secure, tbe peace of the world, or at least to obtain, so far as tbe Pacific was concerned, a cessation of the iniquitous and moneywasting naval programme being carried on by the great nations. Whatever may havo been the advice ho received _ from Australia's representative bis strong personality, bis fine eloquence, and bis general attributes, to my mind, bad a marked influence on the decisions of the Conference. I have no desire to detract in any way from tbe merits of the other members of the Delegation; but in my opinion he did more than any one else, not excluding President Harding or Mr Hughes, the United States of America representatives, to bring about the results that we applaud to-day. Tbe Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), finding that as tbe result of the Washington Conference he can save something' like £1,700,000 a year on our Defence expenditure, should now use his influence to induce his colleagues to agree that further assistance shall be granted to the invalid and old-age pensioners.

79,Mr Fenton,"I am aware that -weparty, I hope that they will join with ns before very long in expressing in sueh unmistakable torms their views on this matter that the Government will be compelled to liberalize the invalid and old age pensions scheme. The stand taken by the Leader of the Labour party is undoubtedly a proper one. I well remember the speeches made by him in regard to our representation at the Washington Conference. Tbey made a great impression upon me, and I bave a very clear recollection of the earnest way in which he insisted that Australia should be represented. But because tbe. Labour party desired that all political parties in Australia should be represented at the Conference, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has had the effrontery to criticise the amendment to that effect which was moved by our leader when the question was before tbe House. Had the amendment been carried, our representation would bave been extended, and I think that Australian interests would have been safer in tbe hands of three delegates than they were when only one was appointed to look after them. I agree witb the honourable member for Perth( Mr Eowler) that Senator Pearce probably did not have much influence on tbe decisions of tbe Conference, but our object in urging that all political parties in Australia should be represented,, was to insure that tbe Commonwealth should speak witb a united voice. Part of the Peace compact has to do with Labour and labour conditions in various parts of tbe world. Labour, for the first time, has been recognised in a great international document, and it is clear that those who framed the Treaty intended that at future International Conferences the views of Labour should be heard. If they were, the secret diplomacy and trickery now indulged in by some nations would be abolished. That is what we have in view. Without desiring in any way to be boastful, I think we may take credit as a party for tbe part we played in insisting upon tbe representation of Australia at the Washington Conference. As a result of that Conference, I am hopeful that we shall bave peace for a number of years, and that much of the money we bave hitherto been spending oii the Army and Navy will now be availMr Fenton. able for the development of this great country. I come now to the question of wireless. I am glad that tbe Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) is present, since I propose to take exception to the course be pursued as a member of tbe Committee appointed by this Parliament to inquire into the proposed wireless agreement. Honourable members on this side of tbe House, when the agreement was before us, urged that whatever the report of the Committee might be, no. agreement as between tbe Commonwealth Government and the Wireless Company should be entered into until it had been sanctioned by tie Parliament itself. I admit that by the terms of tbe resolution agreed to, this House, to a large extent, removed from the shoulders of the Prime Minister the responsibility for entering into the agreement since it was provided that if the Committee, after inquiry, reported that the Government should expend £500,000 in the purchase of shares in tbe company, the contract should be signed by the Government and the scheme proceeded with. I compliment the Committee on having changed to a very considerable extent tie face of the proposed agreement. Tbe fact that it did so is a sufficient justification for the stand that we took. The Committee considerably improved on the agreement as originally put before, us, but I agree with the minority report presented by the honnan), in wbicb be states that tbe last word has not yet been said regarding wireless, and I am at a loss to account for tbe haste that was shown by tbe Government in connection with the matter. I think that tie honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruoe) on taking oflice as Treasurer should have retired from the Oommittee and have allowed another honorahle member to take bis place, seeing that as Treasurer be would bave to authorize tie proposed expenditure. liked to have resigned from the Committee. aspersions on tbe honourable gentleman, but I think i e should iave resigned from the Oommittee on taking office.

Notwithstanding the authority given 'by resolution of this House to the Wireless Oommittee, I do not think the agreement should have been entered into until it bad received parliamentary approval. glancing oyer the list of shareholders in the' company, and find that, with the exception of the promoters of the company, the shares are held for the most part by big concerns. The Marconi International Wireless Company, for instance, holds 16,000 shares, and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company 33,000 shares. The shipping companies in and around Australia are also among tbe large shareholders. There are Huddart Parker Limited, with 14,700 shares; tbe Adelaide Steamship Company; tbe companies that trade between tbe mainland and Tasmania; Burns, Philp, & Co.; the Holyman Line; Mcllwraith, McEacharn, & Company; and the Melbourne Steamship Coy.

Tbe Marconi companies in London-tbe y are supposed to be two different companies, but they are really only ono-hol d between them noarly 50,000 shares. Their voting strength and their power in this concern will bo very great. Although some of the terms of the agreement have been altered, I understand that, in spite of protests, the wireless .people still bave a majority of representatives on tbe directorate. If that is so, thoy will control tbe company. It is all very well for the Government to say fjhat they bold 500,001 shares, and that tbey can dominate tbe rest of the shareholders by one vote. quite content to give away that one extra vote to tbe general shareholders if I could have a majority on tbe directorate. The majority on the directorate is made up of those who are in the wireless business. The Government are in a minority, and yet are subscribing more than tbe private persons who are in a majority on the directorate. that kind is not right. tbe views of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and I would like the present Postmaster-General and his predecessor in that office to tell tbe. candid what tbe expenditure shall be. truth about wireless. If tjhey were to do so, I think that this House would be very considerably enlightened. Tbe directors may order that more capital bo called up, and, in that event, the Commonwealth Government would be made liable for tbe payment of further big sums of money. I bave been authority for saying that ? Tbese private organizations can always beat the Government; we may depend upon that. It is tbe directorate, and not the shareholders, that decide the policy of the company.

Isi t not a mistake, seeing that we are paying more than the private individuals, not to have a majority on tbe directorate ? Provision to that effect ought to be made in the agreement, but, unfortunately, it is not made. perienced men on a board of directors. understand that the Government bare, a man on the other side of tbe world as their adviser in connection with certain concerns who is tbe head of one of the biggest monopolies in tbe world.

He said there was not a tittle of evidence to show that wireless communication between Great Britain and Australia could be successful as a commercial proposition, and that for such great distances it had not been proved to be practicable. Sending wireless messages over short distances and over long distances are two quite different propositions. When the Government proposes sending wireless messages 12,000 miles through various atproved by the Parliamentary Committee mospheres, and different weathers they are not likely to meet with the success they anticipate. Not one expert who was brought before the Committee was prepared to say. that such long distance messages could be successfully transmitted, yet in the face of that the Committee recommends the Government to spend over £500,000 on the venture, and to be content with a minority of representatives of the gauges, but I warn tbo Governon the directorate. Defence( Mr Greene) says we are going to get out of the Woollen Mills. Next to that, I suppose we shall abandon the Clothing Factory, and then the Saddlery Factory, and, as a last resort, we shall run to the three-hall men to see if they will buy tbe Commonwealth Bank. Tbe Government are already doing that in some directions. In Nauru, and under tbe agreemont with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, we are spending large sums of money, with what result we do not know. It is others who are having tbe final say. We are spending £500,000 in the wireless business, and there is no emphatic evidence that wireless between Australia and Great Britain is going to be a success. None of the experts in Australia-no t even tbe most enthusiastic-woul d venture the opinion that it is going to be a commercial suctional proposal for the amendment of cess. mercial men do not put their money into a. concern like this for nothing. ber himself has put money into concerns on the representation that he would make a. golden fortune, but the expected dividends have not come in. I do not wish to mention the names of individuals, and I bave mentioned only companies, but there is a big Government servant on/the other side who bae an interest in this wireless. He is the man who would be forwarding m formation to this House and to the Prime Minister regarding wireless. I do not say that his reports would be coloured because of any little gain he would get, but it is certainly an undesirable position for a publio servant to be in. He would be called upon to give advice from the other side of the world to the Government in Australia.

If they continue to live in their own homes these people suffer no reduction of pension. secured that amendment of tbe original Act. party has endeavoured to liberalize tbe Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act in every possible way. If the present law is more liberal than the original measure, that is largely due to the action of the Labour party. Under the existing system, aged persons leaving home to live with a relative or friend are deprived of any advantage from or reward for the thrift and sacrifice they have made to secure a home. It is only by constant sacrifice of comfort and pleasure that working people can secure a home, and in their declining years, surely they are entitled to enjoy the advantages which should follow from the assets they bave been able to accumulate by their worthy efforts in earlier life. Although the Government set their face against such action now, I trust they will, at an early date, review the present position and liberalize considerably the administration of old-age and invalid pensions. Whilst tbe amendment is especially directed to the action of tbe Government in connection with old-age and invalid pensions, I may be permitted to direct attention to serious anomalies in the administration of other pensions, and particularly pensions received by returned soldiers and tbe dependants of deceased soldiers. and on the decisions of unsympathetic medical boards, many returned soldiers and dependants of deceased soldiers are not receiving whab is their due, in spite of the promises made by tbe Government and their supporters to those who rendered service overseas. Twothirds of my time as a public man is taken up in the endeavour to secure justice for those who are deprived of pensions rightly their due, and to secure from the Eepatriation Department the consideration which returned soldiers bave a right to claim from it . Whether this is due to secret instructions from the Minister that pensions must be reduced as much as possible I do not know, but many of the cases brought under my notice demonstrate the fact that sympathetic and just consideration is not given' to the claims for pensions by those who were invalided home, or by dependants of deceased soldiers. One case brought under my notice was that of a returned soldier who bad a wife and three children. He died on the 4th January of this year. Although his death took place some considerable time after his discbarge, there is, I contend, evidence to connect his illness and ultimate death with his war service.' A t the time of his death tbe eldest child was three and a half years of age and tbe youngest four weeks old. Tbe family was left in absolutely destitute circumstances, but an application by the widow of tbe deceased soldier for an increased pension, which is rightly ber due, has not received from the Eepatriation Department the. consideration wbicb it merited.

132,Mr Makin,"Tb e honourable memThe reply delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon cannot be regarded as satisfactory. Instead of dealing with tbe subject that should have been the main theme of this debate, he made excursions in all directions, and very seldom approached the real purpose of the amendment. He carefully evaded any endeavour to justify the Government's lack of consideration for the invalid and old-age pensioners. It seems to me that tbese people can only expect to receive better consideration when the party now in opposition occupies the Government.benches. I trust that thc date is not far distant when we shall be able to show, in some practical form, our absolute sympathy for them, by giving them increased pensions, commensurate witb the increased cost of living, by liberalizing the qualifications for the pensions, and by obviating many of the anomalies and unfair aud unjust restrictions now imposed upon the pioneers, who at all timos bave proved themselves to be faithful and honourable citizens of the Oommonwealth. me much pleasure that tbe first words I utter and the first vote I givo in the new session shall be in tbe interests of tbe old people of the Commonwealth. But I cannot say that my fcolings bave been those of pleasure as I have listened to tbe debate as it has proceeded. struck me is tbe fact that although the amendment moved by my Leader( Mr liberalize old-age pensions would be to Charlton) readsWe regret that your advisers have made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions. I cannot find in tlie speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), as reported in Hansard, more than a reference of about three minutes' duration, in a speech, lasting over an hour,'to pensions, the only subject-matter of the amendment. It was painful to me to realize that with an amendment before the House, submitted in tbe interests of the old people of this country, tbe Leader of the Government should spend the whole of his time in talking about Labour conferences and every other subject but the one proporly under consideration. I can well understand the feelings of any old-age pensioner in reading this debate. He will imagine that honourable members pay regard only to their own interests, and give very scant consideration to those of old-age pensioners. I do not propose to follow the Prime Minister's example, and wander from Dan to Beersheeba. I shall confine my remarks to the question of pensions. I wonder how honourable members opposite propose to vote. If they vote against tbe amendment the effect of their action, camouflage it as tbey may, will be to say that they do not regret that the Government bave made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions. If they do regret the lack of consideration for the pensioners of tbe Oommonwealth, they should vote for the amendment. I would rather think of them as voting contrary to their feelings. I would rather not have it said that men, comfortably situated as honourable members on the Government side are, really feel that there is np need to give increased pensions to the very deserving folk whom we call old-age pensioners. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has just pointed out, tbe liberalizing of tbe pensions, might be brought about in various, ways. He has mentioned tbe invalid pension, and I would like to speak upojr tbe same subject. Unless the. father'^jiih au invalid dependant is prepared to-plead poverty or be heartless and -.'.kick his dependant out into the. ""street, there is difficulty in obtaining a pension tor the child, if the earnings of the father What has most average £ 1 per week for each adult member of the family. Another way to permit greater earnings. A pensioner is allowed to-day to earn an average of 10s. a week and still receive the full pension. That rule has been in operation for a considerable time, and it was introduced when the cost of living was considerably lower than it is at present. If we only permitted increased earning sufficient to keep pace with the greater cost of living it would be a liberal act.. The Prime Minister has twitted the Labour party with having said on the hustings' that we would increase tbe old-age pension to tbe extent of 5s. a week. This, he said, according to an estimate of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) would represent an increased expenditure of over £17,000,000. what was said. dealing with a manifesto issued by the honourable member for Balaclava",52,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

155,Mr Gabb,"Honorabl e members oppowrong. I love the old people better tbaa I do tbe young, because I find that the old people are always more sensible. When I was twenty-one years of age, I thought I knew everything; but as I advanced along tbe path of life I realized that I knew less and less. Now, -having reached the age of forty years, I know that those who bave ascended higher up the bill can look back over my head, and have a wider vision. I like to be with tbe. old people, and when I bave that feeling and come here to battle for them, it is not right that doubts should be cast upon my bona fides. No matter' how honourable members opposite may vote, I will not believe that in their innermost hearts they do not regret that an increased allowance is not to bo given to the old-age pensioners. I shall do them the credit of believing that in voting against the amendment they will vote against their own feelings, for I am confident that if party politics were not into increase the old-age and invalid penvolved, and honourable members could be free to consider this matter on its merits, the bulk .of them would vote for an increase of tbe old-age and invalid pensions. I can heartily agree witb tbe last speaker that it seems a tragedy that to-day our highest national interests and our most humane feelings should be exploited for political purposes. during the last few years, tbe sacrifices and wounds of our soldiers practically publicly auctioned by political leaders, and every week for the last two or three months the biggest national industries of Australia being used as political pawns by tbe Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). To-night we are hearing the hardships of the aged poor being exploited for electioneering purposes. The party which I have the honour to lead sympathizes deeply witb the old-age pensioners; we recognise bow difficult is their position by reason of various regulations, which we desire to see altered. But we would like to pay a tribute to the efficient way in which the officers of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department handle their work. There .must be many anomalies in connection witb the pensions, and we admit that during thc last three or four years the old-age pensioners have suffered considerably by the increased cost of living. But one of the primary causes of the increased cost of living is the excessive taxation being imposed by both Federal and State Governments, which withdraws so much money from commercial and reproductive undertakings and is absorbedi n huge Government expenditure. We believe that a substantial reduction in Federal Government expenditure and a cessation of extravagant administration would, be more helpful than any other single factor in reducing the cost of livmgj but especially in view of the disappointing and unsatisfactory statement of tbe national financial position made by tbe Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) yesterday, we are opposed to any further increase in the current national expenditure at tbe present time. am heartily in accord with the proposal sions, and to liberalize the conditions governing them. I know exactly how badly this amendment is needed, and I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members opposite, who are taking no part in the discussion, but are questioning tbe motives of honourable members on this side. It is beyond my understanding how the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Pago) could rise in bis place We have seen, and say, in effect, that not now, but some years hence we may eonsider the granting of this needed reform. In the meantime the old people are starving. Not one word of protest does the Leader of the Country party offer to the proposal of the Government. to pay enormous sums in compensation to the "" brass bats "" wbo are being retired from the Defence Department. Generals and others wbo have been drawing as much as £1,500 per annum for many years are being retrenched, but there is no proposal to pay them 15s. per week. The Government, who cannot find sufficient money to insure that the old people may live in decency and comfort in their declining days, already propose to give large isums in compensation to men who for twenty years and longer have been drawing as much as £1,500 per annum, plus from £50 to £100 for motor cars, plus 25s. a day for travelling allowance and £80 per annum as a command allowance'.",55,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

A major-general receives £950; a brigadiergeneral, £850; a colonel, £800, a lieutenant-colonel, £750; a major, £650; a captain, £625; and a lieutenant, £400. The non-commissioned warrant officer, who may have been a colonel during the war, but did not belong to thc military caste, and, accordingly, had to return to the ranks on his return to Australia, is to receive about £155 compensation for the loss of his employment. Yet the Government can pay enormous sums to "" brass hats,"" many of whom did not serve in the war, and who, in addition to their salaries bave drawn travelling allowances varying from 14s. to 25s. per day, and foT a staff command from £40 to £100 per annum.

Laird Smith) questions whether we, on this side, have any conscience when we pub forward sucb a .proposition. He sbould.be the last man in this House to talk about conscience. for the old-age pensioners. booted out of the Ministry, and yet sits behind the Government without a word of protest, 'talks about conscience! Long beforo the honourable member was thought of I was fightingtho case for the old-age pensioners in the Victorian State Parliament. A former Leader of tbe Liberal party, the present Chief Justice of Victoria, said tliat the old-age pensioners were the recipients of charity. Before the pensions were introduced sons wbo, perhaps, were married and had children, were fined and sent to gaol because they could not contribute 10s. peiweek towards the support of their parents. Tbat was the method which the so-called Liberal party preferred to the sysbem of old age pensions. It was by fights such as we are putting up to-night that the scheme of old-age and invalid pensions was initiated, and before the pension was increased to 12s. 6d. the Labour party had to adopt similar tactics, and ultimately public opinion forced the Government to grant our very reasonable requests. In my own constituency I have, unfortunately, to come into contact with cases of poor old women who have to pay 8s. a week for a room, and they aro required to provide the necessities of life upon tbe remaining 7s. per week. How, in the name of God, can they be expected to do so in these times? I have quite a number of these pathetic old people who come to me every second Monday morning, and I band them over 2s. 6d. witb which to maintain body and soul during the few days following while they are awaiting payment of their pensions. Tbe payment of a decent pension ought not to be a question of increased taxation. Tbe Leader of tbe Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), should bo ashamed of raising sucb an issue in debating tbe question of providing more money for old-age and invalid pensioners. The able member propose to Taise the money? tbe Military Eorcos. If tbe Government were to reduce military expenditure to pre-war standards they would be able to find all tbe money necessary to contribute an extra 5s. a week to pensioners. Respecting the payment of pensions generally, there are other phases which are altogether unsatisfactory. I may cite as an example the case of war-broken men wbo cannot be said to be totally incapacitated, and aTe not given pensions in keeping witb sucb a condition, but who, nevertheless,, are utterly unable to earn a living. The Government make no provision for a man who has bad bis two legs broken; he may starve for all they will do for bim. No doctor will certify that a man who has had both his legs broken is permanently incapacitated; yet I know of sucb unfortunates who are absolutely dependent on private charity.

Labour proposes that some of the money which is being spent iu that direction should be, and could be infinitely more worthily, devoted to the welfare of om very best type of new citizen, namely, the childhood of Australia. Honourable members need scarcely be reminded of the bard case of poor widows witb families throughout tbe land. The breadwinner has been taken, and tbe responsibilities of the mother have become doubled. Her only hope in maintaining ber children and providing the bare necessities of life is to scrub and wash for other people, while her kiddies run about the streets. Surely something should be done in the direction of providing pensions for widows! to be one of tbe first' duties of Labour, when the party to wbicb I belong occupies the Treasury benches, to make provision for this struggling class in the comsuch a way as that be must choose between munity. I have already mentioned that tbe cost of providing, adequate pensions should be the last phase to be taken into consideration. million and a half of money, that money ought to be found. When money was wanted to provide munitions with which to kill people, was there any trouble in finding tens of millions? ever, when money is needed in order to do the right thing by our old-age and invalid pensioners, ana to help others who should be in receipt of pensions, the question of cost is permitted to stand in the way. Tbe amendment of tbe Leader of tbe Opposition, tbe honourable member for Hunter (Mir. Charlton), is very simple. It is very easily remembered, and is 83 easily understood. It consists of an expression of regret that the Advisers of His Excellency have not seen fit to make provision for the liberalization of oldrage and invalid pensions. Honourable members of the Opposition say tbey' cannot understand how any honourable member will be able to refrain from joining in this expression of regret. I state without fear of contradiction, that the amendment, so eminently simple, was framed after most careful consideration and consultation between the Leader of tbe Opposition and bis followers; and I have no hesitation in saying, further, that its objects was not merely to promote tbe interests of old-age and invalid pensioners. I cannot understand the attitude and statements of some honourable members opposite-those , for example, of tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Making, whom I respect as a sincere and straightforward man. I cannot understand his suggestion that the amendment has for its sole purpose tbe advancement of the interests of pensioners. Its object is perfectly clear. It is framed most astutely. It was drafted for tbe purpose of putting honourable members on this side iu a difficult and delicate position. I challenge tbe Leader of the Opposition to deny that be thought to place such honourable members as myself, It ought for instance, in a quandary; that he did not say to himself, "" The honourable member for Eawkner says be is in favour of increasing old-age and invalid pensions. .IfI bring forward this amendment in voting against the Government and against the amendment I will, undoubtedly, place bim in a difficult posiEven if it required a tion. Pori f be votes for t i e Government, and against tbe amendment, the public will say that he is not in favour of increasing pensions."" My friends know that that is.not my position. I repeat that Now, howI am as much in favour of increasing pensions as any other honourable member. I have occupied a consistent position with respect to this subject ever since I came here. When tbe question of granting a pension to tbe late Eederal Chief Justice( Sir Samuel Griffith) was introduced in. this ChamberI opposed the motion on tbe ground that I would be no party to giving a pension in such a caso until adequate provision had been made for people less favourably situated.

Witb regard to the sincerity of the amendment, I would like to point out that it was moved when the Leader of tbe Opposition was attacking tbe Government.

Upon the notice paper there is, as the Leader of the Opposition knows f u l l well, a proposal, in the name of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman), dealing with this very subject. light of day if it depends upon the Government. the motion of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is insincere, but that charge cannot be more truly made against that honourable member than against the Leader of the Opposition.

I have to choose between voting against the amendment-whioh , if it were carried, would confer no advantage upon pensioners-and assisting to bring about the downfall of the Government, and I simply cannot do that. There are many things which I regret m regard to the Governor General's speech. I regret, for instance, that provision has not been made for the reduction of parliamentary allowances. One reason given why our old people and in. valid pensioners are not getting more is that the country cannot afford to pay more. In this Chamber to-day there are those who have deliberately raised their own salaries by £400 a year.

However, I rose for the purpose of according my support to the amendment, because I think I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of tbe working classes if I did not do so by both voice and vote. My further object was to draw attention to tbe specific instances I have brought under the notice of the Treasurer. Honorary Minister) [9.49],I desire to make a few remarks on tbe amendment submitted by tbe honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), but more particularly witb reference to tbe speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). The speech of that honourable member, in .some of its aspects, hardly, it seemed to me, did justice to his years of persistent agitation, during standing in the House. Anyone listening to bim would believe that tbe history of invalid and old-age pensions was a history in which the Labour party bad always done the most it could for the invalid and aged poor, and that every one not of tbe Labour party bad done tbe least possible. I desire to draw attention to a few facts as against the assumption of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I do this to enable those wbo read the debate to come to a more just conclusion than that at which they would arrive bylistening only to bim. The first fact I submit is that tbe Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was introduced and carried through this 'House by the present Attorney-General .( Mr Groom). That Act fixed the old-age pension at 10s. Eor a considerable number of' years, as a member of the party to wbicb tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh now belongs, I endeavoured unsuccessfully to secure an extra 2s. 6d. for the old people. Practically all through the administration of Mr Eisher that agitation was persistently kept up and persistently resisted, for tbe reasons that were given by the Prime Minister this morning. som6 influence over there; why not try your hand now? orable member does not know either what I am trying to do, or what we are going to do. I suggest that tbe proper time for such a debate as this is not now, but when the Budget has been introduced, and honourable members know what the Government propose. I wish to place the fact on record that the agitation .for the increase of the old-age pensions persisted for some years, and that it was only in tbe last years of the last Hughes Labour Government that an extra half-crown was given. Tbis is the record of tbe parties up to that time. The Deakin Government made it possible to bring in an oldVage pensions measure before the ten-years period under the Constitution had expired. Tbat solved a problem that to us appeared insolvableI mean the difficulty of getting over the constitutional provision under wbicb tbe surplus revenue was returned to the States. An Act was introduced, and tbe pension fixed at 10s., and after eight which, I think, Labour Governments were in power for most of the time, we failed to attain our object until near the end of the last Hughes Labour Administration. As against that record, I ask honourable members to place tbe record of the Nationalist party, which has raised tbe pension from 12s 6d. to 15s., and extended it to the blind very much more liberally than ever before. In addition, the Nationalist party has adopted tbe principle now suggested by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), and in some cases, at any rate, provided that other pensions received shall not be counted in assessing the old-age pension; this is so in tbe case of a returned soldier. I submit that tbese facts show bow much more enthusiasm there is among our Labour friends, on the eve of an election, for tbe poor, aged, and infirm, than there is when tbey are behind tbe Government of the day, and bave the .power to do that which tbey are asking tbe present Government to do. I venture to say that if tbey were still supporting a Government led as the Government was by Mr Eisher in the days gone by we should not have had the amendment has increased 60 per cent, since that time.",61,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

HECTOR LAMOND -In that case the request of honourable members opposite is considerably weakened, because pensions bave in tbe interval been increased 50 per cent, so that tbey are entitled now to ask for an addition of only 10 per cent I do not say that the aged people can maintain themselves comfortably on tbe amount given, which is only some' assistance towards their maintenance. I condemn tbe introduction of this amendment in this way at this time, and particularly do I condemn the assertion that has been made more than once in the debate, that all interest on behalf of tbe old-age pensioners lies in honourable members opposite, and that there is no sucb interest on this side. [9.55] I should bave liked to say a few words in reply to the honourable member ( Mr Hector Lamond), but he has so -bungled his facts that it is not worthwhile attempting to do so. It is a matter of history that the Labour party was the first party in Australia to place old-age pensions on their platform; and I have heard the men who left the Labour movement and are now behind the Government make that same statement'dozens of times. That much has occurred since we recognise, and I do not intend to say anything about it We do know, however, that, so far as Eederal old-age pensions are concerned, it was the Labour party Which insisted that tbe surplus revenue should bo placed in a Trust Fund, in order that those pensions might be paid. Those who do not remember that fact have very short memories. ter who has introduced a Bill to increase old-age pensions is on this side, and in this Ministry. bour movement, and tbe Labour movement only, that old-age pensions emanated, and every Labour Government has liberalized the pensions, though former members of the Labour party may be now on the Government side. torney-General( Mr Groom) introduced tbe first Bill, the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) the second, and tbe Postmaster-General( Mr Poynton) the third. .Minister will remember who forced those Ministers to do so. Tbe most remarkable feature of this debate is tbe disclosure of how sore a point the "" salary grab"" is in some quarters; ib certainly does seem to annoy a number of people. We bave. a representative in this House tellingus bow much he sacrificed when be accepted £600,. while tbe others were paid £1,000. Well, I took £1,000 because I was damned well worth it ; tbe honourable member to whom I refer was never worth £600, because he gave only the fag end of bis time here, and it was not of much use to tbe people he represented. The less be says about the "" salary grab"" the better it will be for himself and those associated witb bim. He has told,us that he could not afford to be a member of the Eederal Parliament if it sat out of Melbourne-be could not earn bis fees if be did. Yet he talks of the corruption and roguery of other people. the honourable member referring? Tbe position in regard to tbese pensions is a very peculiar one. We all know that tbey should bave been increased to £1 a week long ago, and I agree witb tbe honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) that the pensioners should get full pay instead of the paltry dole we suggest now. Will the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), at any rate, try to liberalize tbe conditions under which the present pension is paid? other million or two. as much, it ought to be done, because tbe present system is so unfair that I wonder it has been permitted so long. I endeavoured, along witb a deputation, to place before the Minister in control of tbe Department certain disabilities under which the invalid pensioners suffer, owing to tbe cost of living and so forth; and I trust that the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) will give an indication bhat he intends to deal with this matter during the present Parliament.

Unlike some sections of tbe «ommunity, old-age pensioners do not speud their money on the purchase of pianos, or gold wateheB, or motor cars. Tbey spend it on the necessities of life, and so benefit the primary producers. party in this House is a mystery. It should be the first to urge that the invalid and old-age-pensions should be increased, since primary producers benefit more than do any other section of the community from the espendituro of pensioners. Since the war, we havo read from time to time of the departure of many of our citizens for a trip round the world. Those who go abroad take away much of tbe wealth of Australia. Invabds aud old-age pensioners, however, spend all their money locally. People who set out on a holiday trip to tbe Old World lessen the value of Australia's production. These pensioners do not. For the twelve months ended 31st July, 1921, the value of tbe primary products of Australia was £348,183,000, while manufacturers, witb the aid of Labour, during the same period produced £292,526,608 worth of manufactures, or a total of £640,719,608. Yet we are told that Australia cannot afford to give tbe aged and tbe infirm higher pensions than tbey now receive. It is amusing to hear tbe supporters of the Government, who represent the gilded section of the community, protesting against the action taken by His Majesty's Opposition in this matter. We arc simply carrying out our duty, by endeavouring to force the Government to do something in the best interests of Australia. It is our duty to point out to the Government the error of their ways, to remind them of their stupidity and want of knowledge, and to endeavour to educate them to a proper sense of the true functions of government. We do not core a button for the opinions of honourable members opposite. We neither study their feelings nor their positions.

Tbe gentleman, as I have.already said, draws a salary as a Savings Bank Commissioner, and is also, I think, in receipt of an allowance as a military officer, Tbat is the sort of thing that is going on. And yet honourable members opposite say we cannot afford to increase tbe invalid and old-age pensions. The old-age pension scheme is as yet in its infancy. Our liabilities under it must increase, because it is a rule, not only of the Publio Service, but of many mercantile and commercial houses, that when a man reaches tbe age of sixty years be must be dismissed. I am convinced that before long Labour will be in power. The people are anxiously awaiting an opportunity to -record their verdict, and, as a result of the next appeal to the constituencies, my party will be on the Government benches. Australia will then be governed according to Constitutional usage, and will not be subjected, as it is to-day, to the high handed actions of one individual. I am not casting any reflection on the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). I have never said a word against him. Tbe trouble is that he is supported by men wbo bave not the best interest of Australia at heart, and tbe stand that he is at present taking is due largely to tbe company that be keeps.

224,Mr West,"To a position iri conthe. poor, unfortunate creatures who have not the means with-which to sustain life? Ought not they to be of some concern to honourable members of this House? What do honourable members of the Opposition care about embarrassing the Government ? It is perhaps as well that we Labour representatives are on this side of the House at present, because when we get on tbe. other side there will be something of a revolution in the conduct, of business. We shall have to bring the country back to 1913, which was, without doubt, the best year in Australiau history. Very few members of tbe Government bave the same practical work to do that Labour representatives undertake. I never go home without meeting some one who is distressed becauso a mistake or fault in the Pensions Act will not allow them to receive a pension to which they are justly entitled. My experience, like that of. other members of this party, is that the officers of the Old-age Pensions Department do their best. The officers of the New South' Wales Department certainly have met witb my approbation, because tbey bave honestly endeavoured to carry out the provisions of the Act. We ought/to bring that Act into conformity witb tbe' intentions of tbe Australian people. All that I am endeavouring to do and all that honourable members on this side of tbe House are endeavouring to do, is to carry out tbe wishes of the people. Is there a membor sitting on the Government side of the House wbo honestly believes that tbe views expressed by honourable members on this' side, irom the Leader of the Opposition downwards, do not represent the opinions of the people outside ? Cook( Mr Catts) expressed some very good opinions to-day from the Opposition side of the Houso, ration for many years, with Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Deakin, and others, I never thought I would have to be present at suoh an exhibition as I witnessed to-day.. I never imagined that honourable members would sit silently by and hear such a speech without taking steps to remove tbe offending member. It is a deplorable thing, and the less we say.about it the better. If I am in this House for another -twenty years I shall make no reference to it. I think that if it were not for tbe party Whip, honourable members on tbe Government side of the House would be actually in accord witb the spirit of the amendment moved from this side. If the-Government would make a statement to tbe effect that tbe Treasurer, in bis next Budget, would provide for old-age pensioners getting what we are asking for, the Leader of tbe Opposition, I bave no doubt, would be quite satisfied. The honorablo member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has thrown slurs at us for accepting £1,000 a year. Whether he believes it or not, I certainly earn my thousand, and if I get out of Parliament to-morrow I shall not ask a soul for a threepenny bit without earning it. Next June the Treasurer will have an opportunity, owing to the larger amount collected from Customs and Excise duties, to augment tbe Trust Fund out of which pensions' are paid. If tbe Customs and Excise receipts are not large enough for thc purpose, the Government might pay 2s. 6d. less per capita to tbe States, thus reducing the payment from 12s. 6d. to 10s. By this'means the Treasurer could obtain abundant money to pay more liberal old-age pensions, and by so doing he would more than satisfy the community. If be has any doubt about the outcome of tbe next elections, sucb action as I suggest would be a very great lever in his favour, and I believe a majority of tbe people of Australia would commend him for it. I am somewhat concerned regarding the way in which this debate on the Addressin-Reply has .roamed, and I would be very pleased to have an indication from you., Mr Speaker, as to whether honourable members who have spoken to the amendment, and confined their remarks to it, will be prevented from speaking to the Address-in-Reply at a later stage if further amendments are moved. son) -Whil e an honourable member iB speaking it is held that he is speaking both to the motion and the amendment. If further amendments ore moved at a later stage he does not lose his right to speak on those amendments.",65,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

228,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir Elliot John,"ton) ing attention to*i. the neglect of the Govermnent in not bringing forward, in the very comprehensive 'Speech of the Governor General, proposals on the lines indicated. He, as our leader, would be neglecting his duty, and we, who are the niembers of his party, would be neglecting our duty, if we did not support him in drawing the attention of the electors to that deplorable neglect on the part, not only of the Government, but also their followers. The Governor General's -Speech was formulated, no doubt, in the Nationalist party's caucus-room, where the followers of the Government had nn opportunity to put forward their views in regard to it , and to secure the embodiment in it of certain proposals and the omission of others. What evidence have we that the members of the Government party did not discuss the matter of liberalizing the allowance to old-age and invalid pensioners, and that the proposal was not turned down in tbe caucus-room. The decision that the Government should do nothing may thus have been cut and dried'. Tne honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) may withdraw tbe motion that stands in his name on the notice-paper, or he may be taken ill and not be here on the day that it should be moved, even if he wishes to move it. will be flourished over him , so that he may not desire, on that day, to move it. I am afraid the Government have been too much concerned in getting r i d of those very necessary services which were established in Australia during the period of the war to pay attention to such matters as old-age and invalid pensions. It is rumoured in those circles which seem to know of the Government's intentions before Parliament is aware of them, that the Commonwealth Government l in e of Steamers is to be disposed of. We have the statement of the honourable the Minister representing the Prime Minister( Mr Greene), that it is the intention of the Governmenb to get r i d of the Geelong Woollen Mills. I would like to have the opinion of .the honourable member for Corio-.( Mr Lister) on that. Is he in favour of the disposal of these mills, and the cessation of woollen manufacture in [11] I think the his electorate ? His views on the subject would be interesting. The mills were did the right thing in drawestablished to .protect the people of Australia from exploitation, and it is essential, remembering the prices charged and the enormous profits made by private i ndividuals during the war, that the Government should continue to operate them so that, if extortion were threatened, tbey could say to the private manufacturers, "" If your prices are exorbitant you w ill have competition."" The evidence of Royal Commissions shows that there has been exploitation of .the public in the sale of woollen goods, and it is continuing. It is deplorable that influences are being brought to bear on tbe Government to put an end to these mills, and to leave the community unprotected against those whowish to .charge high prices for woollen manufactures. It is not altogether surprising, under these circumstances, that the matter of invalid and old-age pensions has not -received consideration from Ministers. We are not concerned now with what has been done by previous Parliaments in tbe fixing of invalid and old-age pension rates, nor does it matter particularly wbo originated the scheme. . If the rates are too low, or even if tbey are too high, tbey can be reviewed. Some of us were too young to be in Parliament when these pensions Perhaps the party whip were first provided; but it is our duty now to see that proper pensions are paid, and that the pensioners are f a i r l y treated. The insufficiency, of the pensions is not tbe only grievance of the pensioners. Some members of tbe Police Forces and Public Services of tbe States are given, on retirement, pensions equivalent .to half, three-fourths, or the f u l l amount of the salaries they drew, and they are. allowed also to engagei n business, and may make £1,000 or £2,000 a year in addition to their pensions. But the old age pensioner, who has. not had a Public Service salary for the greater part of his life, is told that if he earns more than an amount which, together witb his pension, comes to £65, tbe pension w i ll be reduced. .That is most unjust and unreasonable, andoperates very harshly in many cases. Honourable members opposite have eontended that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), by moving the amendment under discussion, has placed them",66,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

230,Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Charl,"in an embarrassing position. I ask them -why they themselves did not discuss the matter in caucus, and have it referred to in the Governor General's Speech. Obviously, nothing was said in caucus by any Ministerial supporter in favour of raising the old-age and invalid pensiou rates. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has given notice of a motion for increasing the old-age pension to £1, and, no doubt, if the Government would tell us that they intended to do that, the Leader of the Opposition would withdraw his amendment. member may not discuss tbe motion of wbicb the honourable member for Eden Monaro has given notice. ferred to it in passing, and would like to know what the view of the Government is in regard to it ; Not only should the rates of pensions be increased, but tbe administration of tbe pensions system should be liberalized. I know a young man wbo at one time oould bave done as much work as any member of this Chamber, but he has developed a disease of tbe spine, and the State medical officer of the town in which he lives has told me that he is now a confirmed invalid. medical referee, however, will not give a certificate of permanent disability, and, as bis .parents are keeping bim, hie appliBand, and asked that the provisions of cation for a pension has not been granted. Were his parents, who are poor people, to throw him on the street, and were he to become so ill . that the Commonwealth medical referee would give bim a certificate, he would get the beggarly pension of 15s. a week. In another case, that of an old lady suffering from rheumatism, the Commonwealth medical referee would not at first grant a certificate, and tbe appliNotwithstanding tbe fact that this statucation was bung up for months, and tbe applicant bad to travel a long distance and consult several other medical'' men before ber pension was granted. We, on .this side, bave no desire to unduly embarrass Ministers, but we wish to get justice for those wbo are weak and suffering.. I suggest to the Government that where the opinion of the Commonwealth medical officer differs from that of the medical man supporting an application for a pension, tbe application should not be refused until the opinion of some other reputable medical man, preferably from another town or district, is taken on the case. We know that doctors differ, and though he.' might be quitesincere in tbe expression of.it, the opinion of the Commonwealth medical officer might be wrong. Rather than that an injustice should be done to an applicant for a pension, I offer tbe suggestion I bave made, and if tbe Government give instructions for its adoption, it may prevent many complaints in this connection in the future. There is another deserving class of persons who come under the provisions of tbe Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. On tbe 22nd November, 1920, the then Treasurer, Sir Joseph Cook, introduced a short Bill dealing with the case of pensions to blind persons. He said at the timeTt is a proposal to permit a blind pensioner to earn an amount which, together with his pension, will give him the baBic wage as determined from time to time in any State, including the rate now paid in New South Wales, namoly, £4 5s. per week. I regret to state that, notwithstanding the passage of this measure, when I brought under the notice of the late Treasurer, and Tbe Commonwealth also of the present Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), tbe application of a body of musicians known as the Sydney Blind. the Act to which I have referred should be made applicable to them, tbe application was turned down in tbe first place because the information did not disclose their earnings. They play in the streets and accept engagements, and tbey are prepared to make, and bave made, statutory declarations to the effect that their earnings are about £2 15s. eaoh per week. tory declaration was made, tihe Treasurer stated that it was not the practice to give pensions to such men.. He said, "" Let them go into an institution, where they can learn some trade and become self-supporting."" But that is not the object of the measure to wbicb I have referred. It will be found that Sir Joseph Cook said, on tbe second reading of the B ill I am particularly referring to those pensioners who may, in some sense, be considered",67,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply Cexsuke Amendment

232,Mr Cunningham,"I merely reas alongside the blind, people-thos e who are pensioners because of* some disease or other from which they suffer. The blind .pensioners, on the other hand, are healthy people, who can, and do, marry, and have families. The marriage of these people ought to be* encouraged in a country like this, if we are to increase our population. They do all the other things that normal men always do-indeed , they have no disability but their blindness. That furnishes a reason, I think, for treating them in a category by themselves. There are only about 400 of these blind people in the whole Commonwealth, and only about 100 of these are io the various institutions of the States. Altogether it seems to mo that bhis is a concession which ithey well deserve, Why should these men who are married and engaged in a legitimate occupation Anstey, F. be asked to leave their homes and go into Blakeley, A. an institution? Why should the GoBrennan, F. vernment refuse to give them the benefit Considine, M. F. of a measure specially passed to deal Cunningham, L . L. Scullin, with such cases? Tbey are prepared to comply with the conditions imposed. Lazzarini, They keep books and can give information as to their earnings, and yet their application is turned down. I'say it is Atkinson, most unreasonable and wrong that they Blundell, R. P. should be asked to go into an institution Bruce, S. M. before they can receive pensions. I bring Chapman, tbe matter now under tbe notice of tbe Cook, Robert Government in the hope that something Corser, E. B. C. may be done in the interests of these men. Foley,Fleming, W. M. couraged to keep out of the institutions. do not want them in institutions. In my Groom, L. E. opinion, street playing in tbe various Higgs, W. G. cities might very well be left to such men Hill, who are good musicians, and are engaged in a legitimate occupation. Whilst the amendment moved by the Leader of tbe Ppposition deals particularly .with old age and invalid pensions, I hope that some consideration will be given to blind persons making applications for pensions. I trust that honourable members wiE not should receive credit for the passing of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act when.the question before us is really whether pensioners are now receiving a fair pension or not. * I think that there is no honourable member present who will contend that old-age and invalid pensioners are now receiving a fair deal in getting a pension of only 15s. per week. It is most inadequate and unjust, and we on this side are doing only our duty to poor people who are not in a position to make their voices beard in this Chamber in moving an amendment to the motion for tbe adoption of the Address-in-Reply in an endeavour to secure justice for them.
