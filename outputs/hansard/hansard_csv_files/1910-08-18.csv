During the course of the remarks which I then addressed to the Chamber, I referred to a newspaper of which the honourable member for Cook is editor, in these wordsThis newspaper is proposing new methods for the collection of advertisements. I then went on to deal with newspapers generally, and when I spoke of the need for preventing black-mail if newspapers were to be subsidized, did not intend what I said to apply to that particular newspaper. By reason of its juxtaposition, no doubt, the honourable member for Cook took that remark as applying to his newspaper. interjection by the honourable memberAs far as I know, his newspaper directly worked for blackmail. Mr J. H . CATTS -What does the honourable member mean by "" directly "" ? Is the honourable risen to explain, in justice to the honourable member and his paper. When I said that his paper was devising new methods of doing its advertising business, I had in my mind the following letter written by the honourable member to a business firm in Sydney, the concluding paragraphs of which Our policy is co-operationword to the men means "" do your those business firms, who are helping your own official paper along in its great work."" Now, sirs, I think you will see the exceptional value of the Co-operator as an ad-"" vertising medium for your goods You should see to it that the name of your firm is continually in front of them and thus secure your share of their orders. My representative will call on you in the course of a day or so, and, will give you f u l l particulars of advertising space, &c. I do not mean to say that the honourable member} (himself -would be personally I shall look into guilty of blackmail, but I did have in my mind the idea, and I repeat it now, that such methods of collecting advertisements are not in the interests of proper journalism. something approximating to olackmail. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [2.42] I am sorry that our discussions in the House cannot be conducted without honourable members seeking, for party purposes, to cast personal reflections upon honourable members who differ from them. When Hansard is printed, anybody who reads the connection in which the honourable member for Wentworth made his remarks will see that it would be difficult for me to place on them any other construction than I did at the time. AllI say is that the methodsadopted by me are clean and above board, and are generally understood. A newspaper seeks to secure to those who advertise with it as much business as possible. That is what they advertise for, and all that is said in the letter from which the I said, later, in reply to an honourable member quoted is that any business that we can influence with the persons who advertise in the paper we shall be very is not glad to do.

64,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang) Markets For The Produce Of That State. So,"the grading so incorrect, to put it mildly, that we absolutely refuse io buy any produce from Victoria under Victorian Government grader's certificate. This does not only refer to onions, but to potatoes, chaff, and oats also. We had a case last year where the Victorian Government grader passed oats as best milling, the standard set for that vear being, we believe, 39.41b. to the bushel. We' had the oats measured here by a prominent wheat merchant on an instrument used in measuring wheat, and the oats did not go more than 31 lb. to the bushel. We took the matter up with the chief inspector of exports in Victoria, but all the satisfaction we got was a statement that the oats were carefully graded, and. that he could not go any further into the matter. In Mav, of this year, we lost ten tons of onions imported from Victoria at £.3 per ton f.o.b. Melbourne. The market here was £ 4 . They arrived partially rotten and were flattened out as if they had been stored for a month or so. The same month we landed ten tons of ' Brownell' potatoes at a price of £ 4 per ton f.o.b Melbourne. They arrived in a rotten condition, and on this comparatively small' shipment we Tost no less than £13. We had no redress, because we purchased under Victorian grader's certificate. This would effectually do away with Mr Graham's charge that complaints were associated with a fal l in the market here after the contracts had been made. These are only a very few of the instances that I can bring forward of the value of the certificate. It is all very well to protect the Victorian trade, but the importers here should protect themselves by refusing to purchase under such certificates, and our company for one will refuse to purchase in this way until something is done to make the certificates of value."" It is unfair to impute selfishness to the citizens of New South Wales when theyendeavour to protect themselves from the importation of diseased or unsound produce from the other States. They should be credited with the motives with which they declare that they are actuated. is not denied that Irish blight has appeared in a bad form in the Tasmanian potato crop. I do not know if potatoes are inspected before leaving Tasmania. care should be taken to see that none but good produce leaves the State. I do not. think that disease v/hich could not be detected by a careful external examination would develop in produce in the course of a forty-eight hours' journey by sea. nor am I of opinion that the New South Wales inspectors would condemn, as unfit for consumption, fruit or vegetables that were wholesome. I doubt whether the remedy proposed by tlie honourable member for Wilmot, for a state of affairs which is regarded as unsatisfactory, will bring about the result which he anticipates, but I see no objection to the system being given a trial. It must not be forgotten, however, that the protection of the public health is the first duty of the Government of each State. While I shall not oppose the motion, I protest against the action of the New South Wales officials in rejecting unsound produce coming from other States being stigmatized as prompted b) sordid and ulterior motives to the deliiment of Tasmania. The merchants, the consumers, and the producers of New South Wales do not object to the importation of clean on and wholesome produce from the other States. So long as Tasmania sends to New South Wales produce which is sound and free from disease, there will be no difficultyparently the mover of the motion wishes to bring the inspection of produce moving from State to State under one central authority, to avoid the many inconveniences and losses which occur under divided control. I do not know how far the motion, if carried, might lead us, but something should be done in this matter. I represent 'a series of fruit-growing districts in Victoria, and from time to time wellfounded complaints reach me regarding the operation of the system of inspection applied to fruit sent from this to the other States. No doubt the grievances of the Victorian growers are shared by those of Tasmania and South Australia. When a grower wishes to export fruit from Victoria to, say, New 'South Wales, he has, first, to permit its close examination here. So that it may be properly examined, the It fruit is turned out of the cases, inspected, and re-packed, at considerable cost. Having been passed as sound, and in every respect suitable for market, it is put on board ship, and, forty-eight hours later, landed on the wharf in Sydney, where it is again turned out of the cases, and inspected by a man whose instructions are different from those of the Victorian inspector, and who'may condemn it. Under this system growers are subjected to unnecessary expense, and are seriouslv harassed. The fate of the fruit depends on the verdict of the last man who examines it. He may be honestly carrying out his instructions, and there may be, only a slight difference of opinion between him and the inspector who passed the fruit forty-eight hours earlier. The fruit growers admit that inspection is necessary and desirable, but say that it should not",22,Shipped As First Class Merchants Reply To Victorian Minister Government Certificates To Be Rejected

75,Mr Bamford (Herbert) [3.30],"I-1 merely move now for leave to introduce the Bill'. -could net see my way clear to second a motion of this kind, but I do not intend to oppose the granting of leave for the introduction of the Bill. It is the practice of all Parliaments to give that permission, and it would be wrong of us to stifle freedom of speech or liberty of thought. In readily granting the honourable member permission to bring in the Bill for the purpose that he has named, it is necessary to say that I am quite opposed to the method which the honourable member puts forward. £ think it is unnecessary. We already have powers enough under the Constitution to do all that the honourable member requires us to do. The honourable member interjects that we ought to wait for the second rearling, but it may be months before we have an oppoitunity of discussing the Bill .at that stage, and in the meantime an impression might go abroad that, because the House gave the honourable member a unanimous consent to introduce the Bill, we all believed in abolishing the State Parliaments. There is enough discord and ill-feeling already between the Federation and the State Parliaments without our giving any colour to the idea that we want to abolish them. J make these remarks in order that the public may realize that the honourable member is unanimously given leave to bring in his Bill, not because we agree with it, but because we desire to have the utmost freedom of speech. honourable member for Capricornia, I am -quite prepared to see a Bill of this kind introduced, but it occurs to me that the prosume that that may be put forward to-day posal to amend the Constitution in the direction indicated by the honourable member for Herbert will annihilate it. -The Federal compact is a bargain between -States, and any attempt to coerce the States in the way indicated would necessarily burst up the compact. apprehension I should have if such a proposal were carried. AlthoughI am entirely r n o ' opposed to the honourable member's proposal, I should like to see it in concrete deposits of shale in the Commonwealth, it is form before I proceed further with my desirable that a product so important to induscriticism. -[3.34] -Of course, in this matter the Goment in the form of a bonus for the production vernment are not in any way committed to of anything by allowing the honourable memimportance to the Commonwealth, and ber leave to introduce the Bill. That seemed likely to become still more important in so obvious to me that I hardly thought it the near future. necessary to intervene. The honourable n.ember desires to present his views in the shape of a B ill , but I should have much preferred it if he had put them in a motion and had it discussed before bringing in the measure. A marked feature of this Parliament, so far, has been its broadmindedness on all abstract questions, especially questions of great moment, but' not coming within the realm of urgent practical politics at the present time. Whenever time is available for honourable members to put forward their views on issues of great magnitude, those issues ought to be discussed here, so that we may know exactly the opinions held by honourable members and the various phases and transitions of thought in Australia. The Government, therefore, offer no opposition to the first step being taken in this matter; but that in no way commits them to an apnroval of the proposal outlined by the honourable member for Herbert. I sympathize with much that the Prime Minister has said. It would be an improper exercise of cur power if we refused to allow the Bill to see the light of day. If an honourable member desires to put an idea before the House in the form of a concrete proposition, we should allow him to oo so. Of course, it is obvious to us in the House, although others outside may misunderstand the position, that the mere granting of leave does not imply that the House in any way endorses the ideas foreshadowed in the motion, which indicates a scheme for the unification of Australia the entire abolition of State boundaries, and the setting up of provincial councils.

The Royal Nayy itself is also largely using oil instead of coal as fuel. I understand that the Government have had this matter under consideration, and therefore I shall not go into a great number of details, but I hope that the Minister will see his way to give the question further consideration, and urge the Cabinet to give a little more assistance to the industry than is at present proposed. The oil industry may be regarded in somewhat the same light as the iron industry. In these modern days it is almost a necessity that every country should strive to found an iron industry, not only because it is so important in matters of defence, but also because it forms the basis of so many other manufactures, and creates a lot of subsidiary industries. try is rapidly rising to the same plane of importance. Seeing that oil is being used as fuel in the Navy, the industry becomes important from the stand-point of defence, and it also helps or carries along with it many subsidiary trades and manufactures. It is now becoming a necessity for every part of the Empire to try to establish the. oil industry, and if we can establish it in the Commonwealth we shall not only be providing employment for many thousands of Australian artisans, but also helping to preserve our national integrity. member confine this bonus to shale oil ? In connection with the mining industry machinery is used which, I am told, requires oil to drive it, and I have heard from the vendors of various kinds of implements and engines that the dairymen of Australia would use oil engines far more freely than they do if they could be assured of a good and constant supply of fuel oil at a reasonable price. As it is, no one can enter into a long contract with the Standard Oil Company for the supply of these oils, and so secure a steady supply. I have been informed that a gentleman residing in Western Australia, 400 miles inland, has been able to save something like £ i o o o a year by substituting oil en: gines for other motive power that he formerly employed to drive his machinery. He. too. is in the unfortunate position of being unable to rely upon obtaining a constant supply of oil. The Dominion of Canada, which has set us many worthy examples, sees fit to grant a bonus, and a very substantial one, even to the oil-well industry. In New South Wales there are already two or three companies at work. One of them, I understand, has expended something like j£ 1,000,000 in developing its properties, and is prepared to spend a good deal more if it receives from the Government anything like reasonable encouragement. We have, in Tasmania, vast shale deposits, the existence of which has been known for years; but they have not hitherto been a payable proposition, owing to the difficulties in the way of their treatment, and the great cost of refining. Now that fuel oil is coming largely into vogue, however, there seems to be a chance for their profitable development and working, and several companies have been formed, and are being floated, to treat them. Five shale companies have been formed to work The oil indusdeposits in the vicinity of my residence in my own electorate, and they have pegged out an area of something like 14,000 acres. One company has already started operations, and has a large and most encouraging seam to work upon. Althoughi t -has been working for only two months, it has already fifty men on the field, and if these properties are developed to anything like the extent anticipated, we ought to have 2,000 or 3,000 men at work there. In addition to the men actually employed in the industry, many workers would, if it were properly developed, find employment in trades associated with it. In other words, perhaps 1,000 or 2,000 men would obtain employment in a field that would not be open to them if the shale industry were not encouraged. I commend this matter to the consideration of not only the Minister of Trade and Customs, but the Minister of Defence. I trust that when Admiral Henderson visits Australia the Minister of Defence will invite him to inspect a port within 7 miles of the Tasmanian deposits of which I have spoken. I refer to Devonport, and I hope that Admiral Henderson will be asked by the Minister to inspect it and the surrounding country, with a view to that port being made, if possible, a naval base. Should the shale industry in the district develop, as experts seem to think it will, Devonport will probably be the best place in Australia to supply the wants of our local navy in respect of fuel oil.

I hope the Ministry will give the motion before us their very serious consideration, and place shale oil on exactly the same footing that we have placed the other natural products of Australia. largely interested in this question, I may say that there are no honourable members on this side of the House who are desirous of seeing a duty on kerosene. At the present time* tlie keorsene produced in Australia would not meet more than about one-third of the demand, and it will not be able to overtake that demand for the next ten or fifteen years. under such circumstances is simply suicidal. If, however, it was clearly demonstrated that the local supply could meet the local demand without increasing the price to the consumer, I should support a duty; and it is possible that in a few years that state of affairs may be brought about. It must be remembered that kerosene is really only a by-product with the company which operates in my electorate. over the works, and I find that they produce benzoline, naphtha, wax petrol, and about fourteen other oils besides kerosene.; and to say that first-class kerosene cannot be produced here is not true. My own opinion is that kerosene could be produced in Australia at the price at which it is now sold; but that would involve large expenditure on machinery for the purpose of treating and refining the commodity. not compete with well kerosene in any part of the world. pete, even at the present price, providing the other products from shale oil received proper encouragement under the Tariff or by some other means. overlook the fact that in the case of the oil produced from wells and springs. in America, there are not the by-products I have mentioned. instance, the oil produced by the Standard Oil Company from wells and springs is practically kerosene. This difference is somewhat to our advantage, inasmuch as, while they get only oil from their wells, we can obtain from our shale, not only oil, but also by-products of value. The imposition of a duty is practically out of the question. I accompanied the honourable member for Wilmot with a deputation to the Minister which was practically unanimous that a bonus should be granted for the production of crude oil. For some reason, which I cannot explain, the Government has decided to offer a bonus of £io,oooa year for five years for the production of kerosene and some other products, this being the first time in the history of the industry that a Ministry has displayed sympathy with it. While the amount of the proposed bounty is small, the offering of it involves a concession of principle. The Government proposal should encourage companies to expend capital here in the production of kerosene and other products, and should thus benefit, all engaged in the oil industry. It may To talk of a duty assist, too, the opening up of the Tasmanian shale deposits. on by-products enable a company to produce kerosene oil for lighting purposes at a rate at which it would compete with imported oil? 0 Commonwealth Oil Corporation has assured me that if the company were suffiI have been ciently protected in regard to certain products, it could produce kerosene equal to that now sold for lighting purposes, at the price now charged.

Of late,, the kerosene on the market has been very bad. There are large shale and oil deposits in Australia which can be -developed. I understand that even in the Federal Capital area there are shale deposits from which kerosene could be obtained.

I did not know that there were oil wells in Australia. the production of an article which can be made to flow from the bowels of the earth. ried as 1 propose to amend it, will be an intimation to the Government of the wishes of the House, and a guide in the preparation of legislation.

I move That the word "" o i l "" be inserted after the is becoming more important, because we word "" extensive."" The Government has indicated its sympathy with the proposal to encourage the greater production of oil in Australia, which, in my view, might well be assisted by the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. In Victoria, and in some of the other States, large sums have been expended in the encouragement of the mining industry, which has added considerably to the wealth of the country. According to the Year-Book, there are large deposits of oilbearing shale in New South Wales and Tasmania, and, the honourable member for Moreton tells us, in Queensland too. Thus it should be possible to open up oil wells, and to stimulate the production of oil from shale. At the present time, excluding paraffine and other products, Australia imports annually ,£1,190,000 worth of oil. sene. shale and liquid oil deposits, we should make use of our undeveloped wealth, and This would make it stimulate the production of oil, Either by the granting of a bonus, or by the imposition of duties on by-products which will not fall heavily on the consumer. I do not wish to go into details on this subject, because this is not the time to do so; I rose merely to emphasize the need for encouraging in some way what should be a rery large and important industry. and Customs) [4.25] -The production of oil in Australia has been engaging the attention of the Customs Department for some time past. When I was last in office I visited the largest oil works in Australia, at Newnes, in New South Wales, where a large sum of money has been expended on works for the extraction and refining of oil from shale. I am not sure that my predecessor did not go into the matter, but I know that I had hardly returned to the Department when the honourable members for Macqtfiirie and Nepean, and others, directed my attention to the need for encouraging the oil industry, either by an amendment of the Tariff, or in some other way. The Ministry have had the mattei under consideration, and have decided, in view of the importance of the industry, that it should be encouraged. Honourable members on both sides of the House have agreed that it is one of the most important that can be encouraged in Australia, and it are using more oil for fuel to-day than has ever been used here before. Apparently, its use will go on increasing.

It is better to sell it as viding for the omission of the wordcrude oil. do is to grant the bonus in such a way as to make it profitable to refine the oil.

The future may very well be left to take care of itself, and I hope that the amendment will be rejected. trust that the honourable member for Moreton will withdraw his amendment for the reason that any encouragement to be given to the discovery of natural oil wells needs to be forthcoming before the oil itself is actually obtained. covered a natural oil well in Australia a bonus-in respect of it would be unnecessary. The discoverers of such a well indeed could well afford to give a bonus to the Commonwealth. Several thousands of pounds have been expended in boring for oil at Roma, Queensland. members may recollect that the borers succeeded in striking a natural gas which ignited and burnt for several weeks, millions of cubic feet of. gas in that way being wasted. The fire having eventually been extinguished, the company recommenced boring operations, but the drill was dropped down the bore, and could not be recovered. fine lot of miners up there. were made as to how the drill came to be dropped, and those sinister suggestions were multiplied when two or three sets of drills were dropped down the bore in the endeavour to recover the set originally lost. Boring 'operations are at a standstill at Roma, and cannot be proceeded with for some time, owing to the great expense that has already been incurred. To pass a law in favour of a bonus on oil discovered in Australia would be of no service to that particular industry. If natural oil is ever discovered in Australia it will be unnecessary for'the Commonwealth to assist the discoverers by means af a bounty. If the honourable member would propose that some assistance be given to prospectors-thoug h I very much doubt whether this Parliament should interfere in a matter of that kind-ther e might be something in it. The Commonwealth might offer a reward for such a discovery; but n bonus on oil produced from a natural oil well would be a very great mistake, and indeed would be a very wrong expenditure. On the other hand, I think it would be advisable to offer a bonus for the production of refined oil, and I shall support the amendment of which notice has been given by the honourable member for Hunter. journed.

Whatever may be the personal attitude of honourable members in regard to the use of intoxicating liquors, there is, it must be admitted, a general consensus of agreement that the trade in those liquors demands the consideration of every patriot; and there is no question that is so perplexing the minds of administrators and legislators in any part of the world.

But the trade in those liquors, as at present conducted, is an admitted evil. The question before us is that of a bar, and not that of a trade. ber for Brisbane is quite in order. Mr F1NLAYSON I am well aware that this House has no control over the general traffic in intoxicating liquors, exdignity of the House shall not be comcept in one very important particular; and it is to that particular I desire to call attention. The trade in intoxicating liquors is a national evil and a national question; and I very much regret that the question is not dealt with by the National Parliament, so that we might get rid of the conflicting and confusing State laws. Speaker. The questioii is one that concerns Parliament, in so far that some members take the attitude that Parliament should go only so far as public opinion will allow -in other words, be like a wheelbarrow, and only go so far as it is pushed-bu t circumstances arise, even in the case of a man with a barrow, when he has to turn it and drag it behind him. I am anxious that the Federal Parliament should be so in advance of public opinion that there may be no danger of public opinion dragging it. ber seen anything to justify the abolition of the bar ? that in a few minutes. This reform has knocked at the door of every Parliament in the world-ther e is not one that has not, in some form or other, considered it. It is knocking now at the door of this House, and, although we may not be able to deal with the liquor question in a general way, we can deal with it in its particular aspect as affecting this House. Every refusal to deal with die question, or every postponement of it, simply means that the demand will come again with increasing persistency and insistent aggression. I am anxious that this Parliament should not be in any sense a wheelbarrow Parliament, and wait until it is pushed by public opinion, but that the dignity and reputation of the Parliament should be rather of the Excelsior type-onward s and upwards, leading the people towards a higher and better state ber show that any abuse has ever taken place in connection with the bar? while. This House has the inherent right of veto in regard to the use of intoxicating liquors within its precincts j and it is to the exercise of that right that I invite attention. I am as anxiousas any honoiable member who has been here since the inception of Federation that the honour and promised in any degree whatever by complicity, or any appearance of complicity,, in a traffic which is absolutely destructive of the very best interests of this or any other nation. This is no new question here. From Hansard of 2nd August, 1904, I find that, during the first session of the second Parliament, Mr now Sir Thomas, Ewing, who was honourable member for the Treasurer1. What is the average number of individuals who use the refreshment-room at the Commonwealth Parliament House during the sitting of Parliament? 2. What is the average expenditure per individual on spirits per month during the sitting of Farliament this session? 3. Are all spirits paid for by those consuming them ? To those questions, the Treasurer replied1. About 250. 2. is. 5d. per month, or about per week. 3. Yes. No free drinks or free meals are given to any person. I think that shows a most satisfactory condition of affairs then. other Parliament in the world could have such a splendid statement made of it in regard to the use and consumption of intoxicating liquors; and I believe that the position to-day is even better. With all due respect to members of past Parliaments, I believe that the consumption of liquor by the present members is below that average. I desire also to point out that the honourable member for Wentworth, on the 27th October last year, gave notice of a motion in favour of the abolition of the sale or consumption of spirits and other intoxicating liquors within the precincts of Parliament, going even further than I propose today.

I should presume on the intelligence of honourable members, if I were to point out that the use of intoxicants, so far from assisting the work of the House, is a menace to the proper conduct of business. If it is merely possible that any member may be led astray and made unfit for the performance of his duties with credit to himself .and dignity to this Chamber, the bar should be removed. is like having a tiger snake in one's bedroom. advance of public opinion.

If some of our former members have succumbed to the undue use of intoxicants, it is news to the older members of this House, and I do not consider that that statement will help the honourable member and his cause, which is good enough to stand without recourse to sensational statements which, I think, cannot be substantiated. much desired alcoholic refreshment could get it by crossing the street, if the bar were not here. tended to point that out. I favour the abolition of the bar, but I desire to remove a slur upon the reputation of the House which is altogether undeserved. I was elected to tbe second Parliament, and, although I have been a member continuously ever since, I have never seen a case of intoxication within the precincts. Of course, while intoxicants are obtainable upon the premises, their presence affords temptation to indulgence, and it speaks well for honourable members that they have been able to withstand it. While six years ago the record of sales at the bar was creditable to the sobriety of the House, the record to-day is still more creditable and satisfactory from the temperance standpoint. It will be within recollection that on one occasion I wished to take action similar to that which has been taken by the honourable member for Brisbane, and, if my memory serves me aright, gave notice of my intention to amend in a Supply Bill an item dealing with the refreshment-room. Sir George Turner was then Treasurer, and Mr Speaker Holder, a total abstainer, explained to me that, because of the agreement with the Victorian Government under which we occupy these premises, it would be impossible to give effect to the motion if it were carried, unless the Victorian Parliament concurred. Therefore, he asked me to reflect whether it was worthwhile to occupy time 'in discussing the matter.

AlthoughI am an advocate of temperance, I cannot support this proposal. think that any one can accuse me of being a "" boozer."" As for a member having pointed to a portrait group of the first Parliament, and picked out this one and that ashaving died from drink, I wish to say that it is news to me that any member of that House died from that cause. I am one of the few Labour members who, with you, Mr Speaker, were returned to the first Parliament, and, so far as I am aware, no member of that Parliament died from drink, though some of them died from old age. It was sticking to their work here in Parliament that killed several of them, but whoever informed the honourable member that they died from the effects of drink was "" pulling his leg-."" I can safely say that during the whole time. I have been in this Parliament I have never seen any one the worse for drink in this House-no t intoxicated to such an extent that he had to be carried away. I have run a groggery, and know very well what it is to see a drunken man. I consider that as long as a man is able to walk away he is not drunk. Many years ago I heard Mr Lee, the then honourable member for Cowper, say that one Judge defined a drunken man If ' the honourable as one who went to the pump to light his pipe. I have never seen any honourable member of this House in that condition. On every occasion on which the question of closing the bar upstairs has been brought forward, the majority of honourable members have seemed inclined to close it, but members of the Government have said at different time. I do not know whether the members of this Government are going to If the bar were say the same-that we are under contract with the Government of Victoria to run the building all the time for State members in the same condition as when the State Parliament occupied it. I have never read the agreement with the Government of Victoria on the matter, and I had no say in it when it was made. I think they treated us very liberally in giving us a beautiful building like this to walk into, with everything in going order. I did not give a second thought to any agreement that there might be in connection with the groggery upstairs. I can tell the honourable member for Brisbane that no man need go into the bar upstairs unless he likes. bar. out in other bars for men to "" come and have a drink."" I venture to say that no member of this House has asked the honourable member for Brisbane to come upstairs and have a drink since he has been here. face would invite him, but the forbidding aspect of the honourable member for Brisbane with regard to grog would be quite enough to deter the boldest member from inviting him. During the ten years I have been here no member of this House has ever asked me to go upstairs and have a drink, although many have asked me up to afternoon tea, lunch, or dinner. If the bar is the worse evil in this building, shut it up by all means, and my vote will go towards shutting it up. but is it better for members to go up and have a drink at the bar when they like, or for them to bring drink into the rooms with them, have a bottle in the cupboard, and invite members to join them in a drink?",37,Intoxicating Liquors

There seems to be a consensus of opinion on the part of honourable members that, whilst disallowing on this -motion any debate on the general question, I should permit a discussion confined strictly to the question of the date on which the adjourned debate shall be Tesumed. ' [65] general practice, although such a debate I understand has, on one or two occasions, been allowed. In the circumstances I but it must be strictly confined to the question of the date on which the adjourned debate shall be resumed. I am anxious, for many reasons, that the debate should be resumed on the 8th September, and I wish to express the pleasure it gives me to find honourable members opposite so anxious to see the main question pushed through the House. The arrangement that I made for the adjournment of the debate was with the Prime Minister himself, and at his request. I look upon the honourable gentleman as being in charge of the business of the House. bers' business. follow the advice of my leader, believing that he ought to know the order in which business should be taken by the House. At his request, and on his advice, I agreed to an adjournment of the debate, and I think that the 8th September will eminently suit the convenience of all who are anxious to deal with the question.

When the mover suggests the 8th September as being suitable for himself and those who are supporting him, I shall not say that it is discourteous to seek to alter the date, but simply urge the honourable member who has submitted the amendment to withdraw it. An honourable member in charge of a certain business motion knows the interests of that business best, and it should be left in his hands. If , by an arrangement, or as a matter of courtesy to the Prime Minister, an adjournment has been agreed to, it is rather like taking the business out of the hands of the mover and of the Prime Minister, to attempt to fix another day.

243,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Langv,"I then expressed astonishment that no adequate reason had been given for postponing business of the highest importance, which the Government had declared to be urgent, for the purpose of pressing a proposal which has no pressing urgency, and is not of a public character, but merely one to give a subvention out of the public Treasury to a private enterprise which presumably finds itself in somefinancialdifficulty owing to calculations as to business being proved to be inaccurate. Where is this sort of thing going to stop ? It is no part of the business of this House to go out of its way without the faintest semblance of a public character, and from which the public can in no way expect to derive any material benefit. But we are asked to lay aside public business, which we were sent here to transact, for the purpose of introducing a motion of this kind. Honourable members opposite may choose to go out of the Chamber, because, no doubt, they have already made up their minds, and do not desire to hear arguments why this money should not be voted. I have always set my face against public money being voted into the pockets of private individuals when the community at large can reap no substantial benefit. the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] pose to refer to some of the evidence given before the Select Committee of the Senate, in order to show how little reason there is for a proposal of this kind. After all, I suppose! the Government justify their action on the ground that a certain recommendation was made by that Select Committee. I desire to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] The evidence I desire to quote explains one of the real reasons for this proposal. Mr Robert McMillan, who is the editor of the Stock and Station Journal of Sydney, in reply to question 1230, saidSo we organized the Australasian Provincial Press Association, which took us all in. Then we discovered that this monopoly of the Australian press prevented the starting of daily papers in any big towns where there existed a daily paper. . . . Whatever Senator Neild may say, there is an enormous monopoly of the' cable business, and for that reason we dropped it . We all know that a project is on foot in Sydney to establish a Labour daily newspaper, and Ave have it on the authority of the proposed subsidy is that, under present arrangements, it is not possible to successfully start an opposition paper in any of the large cities. Not one word is said about the country press, which is merely used as a stalking-horse for the purpose of concealing from honourable members on this side, and the outside public, the real character of the proposal. quorum present. [Quorum formed.] showing further the real object of this proposal, let me say that, while the Minister of External Affairs was speaking, the honto subsidize business concerns orable member for Calare interjectedYes; but the cable news has only been of one kind. That bears out what appeared in the paragraph to which I drew attention the other day, and supports the natural inference that the real object of the motion is not to assist the country press, but to enable certain private individuals to start a daily Labournewspaper in Sydney, and, possibly, in othermetropolitan centres. Again, the honourable member for Robertson complained that competition with the metropolitan dailies is at present impossible, saying no word about the need of assistance for the country press, which, ostensibly, is the cause of this action on the part of the Government'. All the statements made from the other side during the debate, taken in conjunction with what we know of the movement afoot to start a Labour metropolitan daily, show that the primary, if not the only, object of the motion is to provide a cheap-indee d a practically free-cabl e service for such a newspaper, at the general taxpayers' expense, and thus to give it an undue advantage over newspapers whose proprietors have to obtain cable news at their own cost, without any subvention from the Commonwealth. able to take advantage of the subsidized service as I followed the Minister's speech, he produced no reliable evidence of the existence of a monopoly in regard to news from other parts of the world, nor did he satisfactorily show, except by referring to conflicting opinions, that the country press is under a disability with regard to the obtaining of cable news. I do not find in the evidence of the Select Committee of the Senate any justification for the statement that the country press needs the assistance which it is proposed to",42,Cable News Subsidy

Is there any limit as to the price at which you shall sell to the newspapers?-No, that is a matter which has been left entirely to our company to fix. . . . 20. Under the agreement would you be at liberty to supply the press cables to another Association if formed?-There is no stipulation that we are not to supply whom we please. As I said before, it is a business consideration only.. In fact,""the interest taken by the country press in cable news, except on special occasions, is very small indeed. That will account for die extremely limited number of newspapers that we have on our roll. . You may be surprised to hear, and I wish that I had a different tale to tell, that out of 230 provincial newspapers in Victoria only 41 contribute to the press service. ' 160. Can a country newspaper get from you aselection of cables; for instance, in time of .war, can a newspaper say, "" We only want from you the cables referring to the war "" ?Certainly. In such a case we should make a selection to the best of our ability. That evidence shows that there is no great desire on the part of the proprietors of the country press, generally, to obtain average The Committee also examined Mr William cable news, and that the proprietors of counThomas Reay, the general manager of the try newspapers, if they accept a cable serHerald and Weekly Timesvice, are not obliged to take any news that may be sent to them, but may arrange to be politan newspapers of Australia which are not supplied only with news on such subjects members of the Association to form an Assoas may be considered of interest to their successfully ciation among themselves, so as to compete readers. Let me quote now from the evithey could. dence of Mr Lauchlan C. Mackinnon, the representative of the two managing newsticularly if there were a further reduction in papers of the Press Association404. You supply to an Association in Queensland?-We Telegraph and Daily Mail. 405. Would those papers be able to veto your supplying another paper if it were started in Brisbane ?-No. 406. They would have absolutely no say?They have none, as is shown by the fact that we recently supplied the Daily Mail. 407. Theni f another metropolitan paper were started there, it would be simply a question of the terms to be arranged ?-Exactly. Here we have it sworn that there is nothing to prevent die Association from supplying news to any newspaper that may ask for it. As to the connection between the Association and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, let me read this evidence418. If an independent paper started a cable service of its own, would it get from the Eastern Extension Company the same priority over their lines as your Association gets?-We get no priority. priority of our cable messages. If a message for another paper were handed in at 10 o'clock, and our message at one minute past 10, the former would go through to Australia first. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. 419. But might not priority be arranged?I have never tried it on. I know we have none now. 420. Perhaps there has been no necessity for it so far?-W' e could not get it. The regulations of the Cable Company would prevent it. Mr Edward Brooke, Superintendent in Victoria for the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, bears out the statement which I have just read. This is a portion of his evidence580. By Senator Pulsford -Has the Eastern Extension Company given a monopoly to the Press Association in any shape or form?-No. 581. You would be quite ready to take press telegrams from any other association or any number of associations?-If the Committee should introduce a new association, we would canvass them at once for business 584. By Senator Dobson -Has there been any increase in the volume of business since the reduction from is. to gd. per word?-The Press Association agreed to extend their service-to send a larger number of words. 585. By Senator Colonel Neild -They did? I understand so. I know that they have increased the number of words sent. I understand that the Pacific Cable Board made some kind of stipulation that there should be an increased service. 724. Would it be possible for the metrowith the existing one?-I think 725. And compete successfully?-Y'es ; partransmission rates. 726. You think, then, that the reduction of rates would assist in the formation of a new supply to the Brisbane Courier, Association?-I am quite sure on that score. A reduction would be beneficial to the whole public. It would give a great advantage to newspapers generally, and through them, to the public, because the greater the distribution of news the more the public is benefited. The necessary effect of high transmission rates must be to lead newspapers to form combinations. I should certainly say that lower rates would make for the forming of other associations. . . . 731. Your general impression is that reduced rates would lead to additional cable services being formed ?I am strongly of opinion that that would be the result. 732. Do you think that the public would benefit?-I do. The class of information now obtained might be supplemented very greatly to the advantage of the"" newspapers and of the public. That evidence contradicts the main arguments advanced in support of this motion, and still further tends to show that AH private messages take there is no monopoly existing at present, but rather ample opportunity for other people to come in. A reduction in the present rates would lead to the formation of other associations, which would then naturally come into competition with existing ones. But the real trouble appears to be, as the honourable member for Parramatta conclusively pointed out yesterday, not in the cable service, but in the charges made in Australia by the Postmaster-General's Department for the transmission of messages over the land wires. These charges place the country press at a serious disadvantage as compared with the city newspapers. Mr William Holmes Waddell, manager for the Country Press Co-operative -Company Limited, gave the following evidence881. Wfiat is your opinion?-Supposing another Association were started to send news enterprise which they say has become a from England to here, the news must come monopoly, and so cure the evil in the from the one source, and so far as I can see, way the cable news is very f u l l at the present time, the public platform and in the House, sir. cabled is of very little interest to the ordinary but to use public money in order to insure country newspaper man.

ThenI understand, from your point of body controlling public funds, and ask view, the country press is not very keenly inthat public money shall be put into their terested in the matter of cables, as first of all a great deal of the news cabled is not of private pockets in the way proposed in interest to their readers. 90b. Secondly, the cost of the cables -per se dence given before the Select Committee. is of less moment to the country press than This is not hearsay evidence from the man the cost of transmission of the news in question in the street, or statements collected hapover the land lines?-That is so. 901. Those are the two leading features that hazard from irresponsible persons, but affect the wish for or against cable news in the the deliberate sworn testimony of men country papers?-That is so. From his official position, Mr Waddell and all that relates to it. must necessarily have a very intimate for instance, the evidence of Mr Watkin knowledge of the requirements of the Wynne, general manager of the Sydney country press, of ""their grievances and Daily Telegraph, that there is no general general grounds for complaint, if any, and yet his evidence does not bear out in any particular the reasons which have been advanced for this proposal to subsidize, out of the public coffers, a private capitalistic, profit-making enterprise a procedure which is absolutely opposed to every principle advocated by the Labour party. The nationalization of monopolies is one of the leading planks of their platform, and yet a Labour Government, fresh from the elections, and having denounced capitalistic enterprises as injurious to the community, now come down to the House with a proposal, not to nationalize, in accordance with the principles of their platform, an which they have advocated on In fact, I know a good deal of the news any public purpose, but in the hope of makthat enterprise, and if a monopoly does But it is a very different tale when those people, having and finding that their calculations are not I have no realized, come to the Government of the day, and ask to be insured against loss. were quite prepared to take all the profits approach this Parliament or any other this motion.

The Chairman of the Select Committee put to him the questionAre you then in a position to say, from your -general knowledge, how the Cable Association work their service on the whole? He repliedSpeaking from hearsay, so far as I am aware, ihere is no substantial grievance at present by the country papers of this State. he expressed here and there, which are purely individual, that the service might be improved, Dr that the cost is too high for country papers.

Notwithstanding all the statements to the contrary that have been advanced by the Minister of External Affairs and others of the Ministerial party, this witness, with his wide knowledge, declared that the present -charges are not exorbitant. have another argument knocked from under the feet of the Minister. Let us now glance at the evidence of Mr Alexander James Eraser, the manager of the New Zealand Press Association. In answer to a question put to him, he said"" We supply cable news from abroad and Australia to the New Zealand press."" He was then asked-question s 1589 and 1596Do you buy from the service of the Australian Press Association ?-Yes. Have you had any complaint from your Association as to the quality of news supplied to them by the Press Association?-No. Wc should not continue with them if they were dissatisfied. In his representative capacity this witness must come into contact with a larger number of newspaper proprietors than any individual acting in a private capacity would do. try newspaper proprietors pass a resolution favoring a reduction of the cable charges, and did they not wait as a deputation upon the Government? say they would all be prepared to support a reduction of the cable charges. And that is just the point. If we moved in Opinions will that direction and the reduction of land line charges we should be on right lines. I favour a reduction, and think that the remedy lies in that direction, and not in this proposal. But that will not suit the Labour party's purpose. The Chairman of the Select Committee, addressing this witness, saidSpeaking as a public man and not as a Zealand agent, what is your opinion as you are served by the present cable Can you indicate any improvement in the could be made better. That is purely a matter of opinion. I hardly think I could offer a suggestion as to how to improve the service. Everything, no doubt, is subject to improvement; but, so far as we are concerned, we are perfectly satisfied with it. I cannot see that there is any great room for improvement on its present basis. These are most important statements, and they were made on oath by a man who knew that they were to be used by the Select Committee with a view to arriving at the facts, and coming to a determination Thus we upon those facts. His evidence, taken in conjunction with that of other reliable witnesses, disposes of the contention that there is, in iegard to the present cable service, the widespread dissatisfaction which honourable members opposite would have us believe exists throughout Australia. Mr Fraser also had something to say as to the question of duplication. It was pointed out that of the world's news collected from various sources only a more or less limited proportion is interesting to Australia, and that as the result of that limitation there was always a chance of duplication of news. Dealing with this question the witness saidI do not know how many papers there are in Australia, but I have seen it reported there are 238 in New South Wales. From that 1 would assume it to be safe in estimating the",46,Cable News Subsidy

Therefore, the consupporters.

I canabsolutely without any foundation in fact. not do better than quote one or two paraI now pass to another witness, Mr Andrew graphs from the minority reports, which James Cornford, manager of the Sunday throw a flood of light on the question from Times weekly newspaper, in Sydney, who a point of view which has not been put gave evidence as follows in answer to forward by the Minister, or by any honorquestion 1713Do you think the establishment of another service, while leading to competition, and may Tesult in duplication, would provide a larger assortment and better classification of news?It would give a larger assortment, but I do not see that there would be a better classification Mr W. Elliot Johnson. of news. I think Australia gets pretty welt If you read the London papers you will find very little has been missed of any importance. this evidence was absolutely kept in the other side to the question. I read this evidence so that the public may have an what was submitted to the Select Comtion for the motion. It must be remembered that these reports, appenout of every 1,000,00a citizens did not know of even the existence of the keeping the general public reasonably well long my speech. I think I have quoted that there is not the slightest foundation in any public necessity for interrupting the able members opposite. These reports are amply sustained by the evidence I have quoted, and by much more that I have refrained from quoting, and any one who reads them can come to no other conclusions than those arrived at by Senators Chataway and Pulsford. Senator Chataway, in his dissentient report, saysT dissent from the deductions in the report, generally on the grounds either that they are against the weight of evidence, or that the evidence is not sufficiently complete to justify them. The Committee was appointed to report upon "" the supply, conditions of sale, and distribution which controlled the Press Cable Service."" British and Foreign news reaches Australia through a Press Association which has an office in London, is able to peruse advance sheets of leading London daily papers, has access to the telegrams from Reuter's 261 agencies throughout the world, and also subscribes Lo United Kingdom Press Agencies and other sources of information. Consequently, I fail to see that the supply of cable news suitable for Australia could be increased, except at an additional cost. As.to the conditions of sale it was sworn, and not contradicted, that there are nearly one thousand provincial papers in Australia and New Zealand, that an expenditure of ^6,000 a year would provide a sufficient cable service, and that lack of organization has prevented the new service being established. In the face of the foregoing it seems obvious that the conditions of sale are not sufficiently onerous lo bring about the natural remedy, which is quite feasible, of an independent service. It was further sworn that the land charges imposed by the Commonwealth were a greater burden on the provincial press than the fees of the Press Association, which, more often than not, were not collected. It was conceded by witnesses that the present cable service is reasonable in price and sufficient in quantity. The Press Association decided last June that the clause in their nartnership agreement requiring the unanimous consent of the proprietors before cable news could be supplied to a new metropolitan .dailv should be abrogated, and the fact that the Association is waiting for the expirv of the agreement, before the new agreement legally expressing the above comes into force, does not, in my opinion, detract from the undertaking of last June. It will be seen that, whatever clause there may have been in the original agreement to prevent the proprietors of this cable service from supplying a new metropolitan newspaper, is going to be, if it has not already been, abrogated, so that that argument of the Minister is swept away. The"" clause did not apparently affect country newspapers. I do not see that either the Minister or the Government have a shred of excuse for using public money, or asking for authority to use public money, in the manner proposed. Senator Chataway's report proceeds to show what should be doneThe laying or acquiring of an Atlantic cable and the erection of a State-owned land line across Canada, is on several grounds desirable, though I do not admit that it will of necessity make the position of the provincial press in Australia more satisfactory. He concludes his report as follows-Before accepting the recommendation to subsidize a press cable service, I advise a reduction of the land line charges on press messages within the Commonwealth, bringing them down to the New Zealand rate, which is considerably below that of the Commonwealth. The conclusion arrived at by Senator Chataway is entirely in accordance with the weight of evidence, and he shows that the remedy is not to subsidize another private capitalistic profit-making institution at the expense of the public, but, to use his own words, to "" reduce the land line charge for press messages within the Commonwealth, bringing them down to the New Zealand land rates."" All the evidence I have quoted shows that the real trouble lies, not in the charges of the Associated Press, but in the land charges-that it is the latter which are responsible for any disability, if there is a disability, under which the country press at the present time suffers. I think there is a disability to the extent to which the country press has to pay in excess of what is paid by metropolitan newspapers for transmitting the news over the land wires. If this is a matter of facilitating public education, as claimed by honourable members opposite, and, I think, by the Minister, the Post and Telegraph Department will be able to come to the rescue in a much more effective way than that proposed in the motion. If that be the object in viewand we are all interested in education-it will be easy enough to reduce the present charges for overland wires, or even to make them absolutely free. If the argument on which honourable members opposite rely is that the public needs educating, they should support the free transmission of news to country newspapers by means of the telegraph. I would vote for that if it could be shown that all the news which' comes to this country by cable has an educational value. , But, as a matter of fact, we know that much of that news is detrimental to its readers, and benefits neither old nor young; but, on the contrary, is distinctly mischievous. I refer to messages such as were sent all over Australia, giving details of a brutal exhibition which recently occurred in America. I wish now to refer to two or three paragraphs in the minority report of Mr late Senator, Pulsford. He saidi dissent from the charu»<» r a n t ] conclusions of the report for reasons contains ; n t n e f j_. 0 lowing statement :I examine the evidence under the following divisions of the subject. Is the AustralianCable Service1. A monopoly? 2. Costly? 3. So far as the news supplied is concerned, is ""it garbled and inaccurate? 4. Has it greatly limited the number of newspapers ? 5. Is it supported by the Eastern Extension Cable Company? As to the allegation that there is a monopoly, he saysWitness after witness admitted that a new -service might be established. Colonel Reay, the managing director of the Melbourne Herald, -said :"" I have already expressed the opinion that it is practicable to' give effect lo the idea. I will now go further, and say that if we sent a cable message to our agent in London, and also a message to our bankers, we should be furnished with another service in 24 hours."" That disposes finally and absolutely of the -contention that there is a monopoly, and shows that there is no excuse for making a present of public money to a private syndi""Pulsford's reportMr Mackinnon, the manager of the Association, said the Association had no monopoly of London news, and no agreement binding any London news agency to give them exclusive service. The representatives of both the Victorian and New South Wales Country Press Associations, as well as Reuter's, all admitted there was no monopoly. "" A sagacious arrangement,"" it was called by Mr Shakespeare, of the New South Wales Association. Mr Pulsford points out thatIt was shown that the Australian press did not enjoy special concessions in regard to telegraph and postal rates, that in ail countries it is usual to carry papers and convey telegrams At low rates, because business at high rates is practically impossible. The Press Cable rates -Aie not so much below the ordinary as appears by merely comparing the rates, since coding is allowed in ordinary, and not in press messages. Finally, he saysThe most marked, and probably the most usef u l , point brought out by the innuiry is that the cost of telegrams over Australian wires is more burdensome to the country press, and probably to the metropolitan press as well, than the sum that would be charged for the supply of oversea cables messages. Evidence in this direction was given by representatives of both the Victoriara and New South Wales Associations. Reuter's manager, Mr Collins, said :"" It is the heavy wiring charges which prove crushing to a country newspaper."" He further said"" Only yesterday I was waited upon by a gentleman from the country who has a biweekly newspaper. He was anxious to publish cables, which, so far, he has not been able to do. I quoted him the ridiculous sum of £ 6 per year for the right of copying them, but he could not pay it on -^count of the wiring charges."" He ,a not P>"" it because of the cost a of 'telegraphing over our land lines. That is where the shoe pinches, so far as the country press is concerned. Mr Pulsford concluded his report with these wordsBecause of the reasons herein given, and having heard the whole of the evidence, I feel bound to dissent from the report. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. Every right-minded person who has read the recommendations of the Committee must be of opinion that they are due to bias, conscious or unconscious. Some men are so constituted that, although they may desire to approach a question in a judicial spirit, they cannot pay regard to evidence which does not bear out their particular views. The great bulk, and the most reliable portion, of the evidence tendered to the Committee, coming as it did from those who manage large concerns, and are most intimately associated with the country press, shows that there is no need for interfering with the present system. ber nearly finished? a duty to perform, and I propose to carry it out.

The whole of my speech has been directed against that as a general principle.

I have quoted all this evidence to show that there is not the slightest shadow of justification in this instance for the expenditure of public money in this way. the honourable member Treasurer. honourable member is not game to do so, because he knows that he would not get money for these purposes from me.

ELLIOT JOHNSON -Such an interjection is neither fair nor true. Whichever side of tlie HouseI have been on, I have always opposed using public funds for the benefit of private enterprises, unless in certain exceptional cases where the circumstances fully warranted it in the public interest. I do not admit, in the face of the evidence I have just read, that there is any monopoly, but if it does exist the Labour party should have recourse to the proposals embodied in their own platform for dealing with monopolies. If they say the existing press cable service is a monopoly, they declared to the electors that their policy in such cases was nationalization, and the proper remedy for them to propose is to nationalize the service. Instead of that they go back on their platform and throw their-principles to the winds by proposing to bring into existence another capitalistic concern to which in theory they are absolutely opposed. It is a most extraordinary and inconsistent position for them to take up, and in ordinary circumstances they would be utterly unable to justify it to their constituents.

The honourable member for Pararmatta rightly said, and he is borne out by the evidence and in the minority reports, that there is not a legitimate grievance in connection with the present cable service.

I had intended to conclude my speech with an amendment embodying those proposals, but I shall not take that step at present. honourable member will do so later. The reduction of the overland wire charges can be effected by the Postmaster-General, and if the Government are really serious in this matter, and believe that the country press need some consideration they have the means at hand to give relief without asking the public to dip their hands into their pockets to subsidize a private moneymaking concern. If they assisted the country newspapers by cutting down the admittedly heavy overland charges, I believe that no. one in this House would cavil at it. This matter was launched so suddenly by could have intended.

I listened to him with some pleasure, and derived from his speech a good deal of information. My only complaint is that the Government have made a mistake in bringing the question before the House in this way. They should have given us ample notice, and thus have afforded us an opportunity to study the Senate Select Committee's report, and make ourselves au fait with the facts. I wish to move an amendment that should commend itself to the good sense -of the House. In granting bounties or subsidies for the encouragement of industries, and for other purposes, we have always been careful to impose conditions as to rates of wages and hours of labour, and I hope that we shall not leave any loop-hole in this case for a departure from the high standard that we have set ourselves. The rule that we have laid down in regard to wages and labour conditions generally is a very wholesome one. and it should be nbserved in this instance.

How would he work them in ? with which the Minister himself must deal. He is in charge of this gun, and it is for him to sight it. It should be an easy matter for him to incorporate this proposal in a Bill, so that those who receive the subsidy will know beforehand that they are required to pay standard rates of wages, and observe Australian labour conditions. the poor monopolists here. do not seem to want the Worker to observe fair conditions. Mr .ATKINSON I have sat here for nearly two days waiting an opportunity to move my amendment, and I think that in it I have touched a very salient point. I also think that the House never dreamt of the Government proposing that an Association should obtain news from the High Commissioner's office free of charge, and at the same time receive a substantial subsidy. I submit this amendment, believing that it is necessary that the condition's laid down by the Federal Parliament in regard to the observance of standard labour conditions in industries encouraged under the bounty system should be observed by the Association which receives this subsidy. should not have spoken to the amendment but for the fact that honourable members opposite seem to treat with ridicule a proposal to pay fair wages and observe proper conditions in an industry proposed to be benefited by a resolution of the House. member take his tongue out of his cheek? proceeding owing to the extraordinary objection of honourable members opposite to treat a humanitarian proposal of this nature in a serious spirit. I cannot help feeling that we are not proposing to benefit the provincial press in Australia, or otherwise there might be serious objection to tliis amendment. It is well known that, in most cases, a newspaper in small country towns is run by a man wlio is a compositor, with the assistance, perhaps, of a couple of boys, and that the scissors figurelargely in the editorial work of the staff. If we were dealing purely with such papersthere might be some difficulty in regulating, conditions in the way sought by the honourable member for Wilmot, but to any person who cares to analyze the schedule if must be evident that the proposal of the Government is not really in the interests of country newspapers. If the newspapers, reaping the indirect benefit of the subsidy were to be assessed for the value of the services rendered upon the basis of the population of the towns and districts through, which their newspapers circulate, quite a different schedule would have to be drawnup. For instance, a paper in Sydney, say the Worker, will have to pay JQI per annum for every 592 of the population of the city, and in Melbourne the payment will bejQx for every 549, while in a country town: with a population of 2,000 ber has already discussed that matter. cuss it again, but merely to point out that,, the facts being as they are, it cannot be expected that country newspapers will take advantage of the proposal; and, consequently, the amendment now suggested' cannot apply to country newspapers, which might find it very difficult to comply with the terms. with wages?

351,Mr Palmer,"In my opinion, therefound voting with the Ministry. But the rates set out in Schedule A, to be charged by the subsidized Press Cable Service Association to its subscribers, show that the country press cannot benefit by the granting of the subsidy. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in minor cities and towns is fixed at £ 5 ° It must be remembered that if a country newspaper proprietor subscribes to the Association, the cable news which it wishes to take must, after being received _at the head office of the Association, be telegraphed to the town in which the newspaper is issued, and the £50 charged for the cable news will not cover the cost of telegraphing in Australia. As a matter of fact, the cost of the cable news would be a mere bagatelle in comparison with the cost of transmission by telegraph. a reasonable sum for which to supply a country newspaper with cable news. But that is not what is proposed. The charge is £ 5 0 , plus the expense of telegraphic transmission. Although Ministers declare themselves opposed to monopolies, they are doin^ their best to create one by this subsidy of £2,500 for the first year, £2,000 for the second year, and £1,500 for the third year, to ""one existing Australian Press Cable Association."" The subsidy is to be paid to an existing Association, to a combination already formed. We should be told who are the members of this Association; whom they represent. This ""existing Australian Press Cable Association"" must have a. name. I ask the Minister what its name is? mystery. We are entitled to know who form the Association. I again ask the Minister to whom is it proposed to grant the subsidy ? member that I do not know. mit me to read it again? ber will not be in order in indulging in tedious repetition. the proposal is to pay £2,500 in the first year, £2,000 in the second year, and £1,500 in the third year to an existing Press Cable Association, and I shall not [66] be satisfied unless I know what Association that is. Under the first conditionThe Association must supply to its subscribersa cable service in accordance with these conditions at rates not exceeding the maximum charges set out in Schedule A. The schedule referred to sets out the charges to be made to city and country papers. The city papers are wealthy concerns, and able to pay their own way, so that those charges are a very small and comparatively unimportant matter to them; but if the Minister is genuine in his desire to make the information to be cabled at the public expense available for the people and press of the' whole of Australia, his scale will have to be materially modified. It is also set out that the cable service isTo consist of items of news electrically transFifty pounds would be mitted from oversea to the Association in Australia, the minimum number of words to be so transmitted to be 6,000 words per week. If we are to go in for expenditure on a cable service, it would be much better to use the money in cabling information to the Old Country about our doings in Australia than in bringing out information with which we are already well supplied. I am not an expert on newspapers, but the conditions laid down specify a minimumservice of 6,000 words per week, or 1,000 words per' day, and I am informed by, gentlemen connected with the press that a-, thousand words of cabled matter, whenfully set up, will occupy about three columns of space in an ordinary newspaper. If that is the case, and I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of my information, we are asking for too much. We want quality, and not quantity. I am not entirely in agreement with the information which we receive at the present time, and it would be as well if a good deal of it did not appear. Much of the information cabled out about the Jeffries-Johnson fight it would have been very much better for the community if we had not received. If the motion is agreed to, in what way do the Government propose to safeguard the interests of the public, so far as concerns the character of the news to be received ? A big question is involved in that. Are we to set up a sort of Government censorship, and, if so, will the news, when censored, be likely or unlikely to be coloured by whatever party for the time being is in power? I am inclined to think that if the present Government commenced to censor the news sent out, it would be largely the kind of news which they desire to give, and not information embodying all",56,Cable News Subsidy

358,Mr Palmer,"Then I will say thatshades of opinion, which the public would have a right to expect. Who is to get the information when it is supplied, assuming that the subsidy is granted ? The honourable member for Wentworth, in a very clever speech, which I have not yet heard contradicted, led us to suppose that the subsidy was being proposed wholly and solely in the interests of one particular journal. I have no data to go upon, but it has been a matter of public comment for some time that it is intended by the party sitting behind the Government to bring out a -newspaper of their own. said so. .made that statement, then tliis is a most ninblushing proposal. If the Labour party contemplate action in that direction, they are well able to secure all the information they require at their own, and not at the public, expense. If it were proposed to take this step in the interests of the newspapers of 'Australia as a whole, there -would certainly be no proposition in the -motion likely to increase the cost to countr y journals beyond what they pay for news under existing conditions. I am credibly informed-apar t altogether from what appears in the columns of one of the Melbourne newspapers to-day-that any newspaper in Australia can receive the advantage of the news conveyed over the cables to the Press Cable Association today for £ 5 per annum. Yet the news which the Government say will be sunplied by their subsidizing scheme is to cost every country newspaper up to a maximum of £ 5 0 per annum. The cables which are now. sent will be supplied by the Press Cable Association to newspapers in country towns for £ 5 per annum. fin fact, they are very careful what they -do say. ;a newspaper, but repeating information -which I have received from a pressman inTlerested in country journals. -certain papers in certain country towns at £ 5 , or, I believe that, if averaged over the whole of the papers of Australia, the cost would not come to £ 5 each. morning's Age thatAs to the existence of a monopoly, in the we cannot ask, on behalf of the country ordinaiy sense of the word, there is not a trace papers, that anything better should be of the thing or the principle in the business offered to them. of years ago to prevent [he useless duplication of news and the consequent expense which militated against the public getting the most copious service. The London office in which the cable service is conducted is manned with men of special skill, who have their hands upon the keyboards of intelligence of all the London papers. And not that alone; added to these is the vast network of Reuter's agency, commanding some 200 foreign centres. The Association itself consists of only seven leading metropolitan papers, and these papers spend from £16,000 to £20,000 a year in the transmission of the cable intelligence from all parts of the world. So far, however, from this intelligence being used in a monopolistic manner, every one of the goo provincial journals in the Commonwealth can have the whole or any portion of the news it requires at a scale of charges proportionate to the power of the journal to pay. Daily papers like those of Ballarat, Geelong, Bendigo or Newcastle, pay up to £200 a year only for a service that sometimes costs £20,000. Smaller papers take what service they require down to a cost as low as £ 4 per annum. This aspect of the case is most important. If the existing Association, which undoubtedly receives valuable public information over the cables, is prepared to admit every journal published in Australia to a share of its news ten minutes honourable members on Both sides of the House have been continually interjecting, and it has become impossible for me to follow the honourable member. He has already read an extract which, if I had known it, I should not have allowed him to read, because it was a comment from a newspaper on a matter now before the House. I ask honourable members who have been interjecting, and particularly the Minister, to set a good example to other honourable members. ciation is prepared to give the news to every newspaper at so small a cost, die last argument in favour of the Government's scheme is shattered. The news is available, and if the existing Association has not been quite so pliant in the past as it might have been, this debate will certainly have the effect of making it more amenable to reason. We are justified in supporting the Ministry to the extent of saying that if that Association is allowed to continue as at present, it should give the full advantage of its news to any newspaper that wants it, at the lowest possible cost.

I should like to see these conditions embodied in the motion, in order that we may know exactly what the Government intend to do. The motion as submitted suggests that the Government contemplate imposing other conditions. The fact that in the motion itself reference is made to the conditions to be proposed by the Government, whilst, at the same time, a set of conditions is laid before the House, indicates, to my mind, the possibility that the Government have in contemplation the adoption of another set. We are entitled to know what they are to be. I am somewhat averse to trusting any Government too far after what has happened in respect of the vote for naval defence purposes, and the expenditure of money on purposes other that those for which it had been ear-marked. That being so, I should like this motion to cover all that the Government intend to do. It may be said that there is a better way of carrying out cur objects, and I think that there is. The Government should have embodied their proposal in aBill which could have been i lea It with in Committee, leaving everything plain and straightforward as to what is intended. I propose to move an amendment having reference to the utilization of the "" All-Red"" line. Part of the information conveyed to us in the report of the Select Committee appointed by the Senate is' that the construction of a line from Canada would involve an expenditure of about £500,000, and that there would be a further cost of about £500,000 in laying the Atlantic cable. In other words, in order to complete the ""All-Red"" route we should require to expend £1,000,000. The charge for receiving telegrams over the "" All-Red"" route is now sd. in respect of the Atlantic portion of the service, whilst there is a terminal charge of 5d. in Australia. In addition to the terminal charge of 5d. per word, there is, in respect of press messages, a charge of gd. per word, which is made up as follows-2d . per word is paid for the Pacific Cable service, 2d. per word for the land line charge, and 5d. per word for the Atlantic service. There is no gainsaying the fact that the terminal charge in proportion to the charges incidental to the cabling of messages to our coast is enormously high. If it be our desire to give Ithe public information at a cheap rate, then, recognising that the terminal charge is inordinately high, we [66]2 ought to bring it into consonance with the service rendered. I venture to say that the charge of $d. per word for the service rendered under this heading is unfair. to send a message from Southport to Sydney than it does to send it across the Pacific. not understand why, in a progressive country like Australia, such high charges should be imposed.

For every jQi that is spent in obtaining a cable service to-day, over jQio is expended in respect of telegraphic charges. charges are at the root of the difficulty in the way of obtaining a cheaper and better service. It is not the cable service itself so much as it is the brains at work at each end of it, that makes the work complete. I am considerably handicapped in addressing myself to this question by the fact that I must confine my remarks to the amendment, but I should like to point to the utter absurdity of some of the suggestions that have been made. If I were not so handicapped, I should be able to show that the men who are really behind this proposal have displayed an utter want of knowledge of the whole subject. As to the suggestion of censorship ber is not speaking to the amendment the telegraphic charges, and then we shall not have, in this matter, any preference to unionists.

It is an amendment worthy of the closest attention. It goes much further than the original proposition, since it aims at extending Imperial information to the people of Australia by securing cheap cable rates. An honourable member, such as myself, who disagrees with the too keen extension of Government activities might be a little frightened by the project Those of owning a cable across the Atlantic; but, after very careful consideration of the facts as submitted by the honourable member for Echuca, I have come to the conclusion that this country can adopt no alternative but that suggested by him. He has pointed out clearly that, while the cost of traversing the Pacific is only 2d. per word, the cost across the Atlantic is sd. per word. If we could regulate the companies doing business across the AtlanticI should be prepared to regulate them rather than to accept the responsibility of the ownership of a cable. But to regulate those companies is obviously outside our powers, and, consequently, I am forced to the conclusion that we should endeavour to cheapen the cost of transmitting cables across the Atlantic-the high charges being due, no doubt, to some particular combine -by owning the cable across the Pacific. If we could regulate the combine, I am satisfied that it would be cheaper and better in the public interests to do so, and so bring down the charges; but we cannot do that, and we are forced to take the choice of one of two alternativeseither to accept the ultimatum of the cable companies, or to ourselves run a service more cheaply, agreeing to suffer whatever loss results. I cannot see why there should be such a difference between the cost of transmitting a cable across the Atlantic and across the Pacific, seeing that the distances are greater on the Pacific, and the use of the cable is less. prise, and the other State-owned.",59,Cable News Subsidy

Private enterprise ought to be regulated ; and it is because this Government cannot regulate the Atlantic companies that I am prepared to accept the responsibility of adopting a project that aims at owning a cable from Canada to England in the interests of the people of_ Australia. I am sure my honourable friends opposite would be the last to represent charges are so palpable, so much strict the extension of Government powers, and this Government project will mean that the actual cost of cabling from London to Australia will be 6d. per word in place of od. Then we are faced with the problem of the land charges at this end. Why should it cost 5d. per word to send a press telegram from the terminal port in Queensland, when it costs only 2d. a word to send across Canada? In Australia we have Government enterprise, while in CanadaI am inclined to think we have leased a line in conjunction with other Governments. What this Government, in conjunction with other Governments, can do for 2d. over a distance of 3,000 miles, the Australian authority, presided over by the genius of the present Postmaster General, cannot do for less than 5d., over an infinitely shorter distance. We might well consider the question of granting cheap communication to the people of Australia. I am not at liberty, under your ruling, sir, to traverse the broad principles of the amendment before the .Chair, but I submit that it is infinitely preferable to institute a cable service which will give cheap cables to every would be user, than to merely pamper one section of the community to the detriment of others. I hope that the Government will accept the broad, statesmanlike proand the States, it appears to me posal of the honourable member for Echuca, which may induce the people'of this country, by the dissemination of more information at cheaper rates, to think Impractically impossible for us to deal with perially. Australian like myself on visiting Canada is that that country has far more European information than we have, though it may be of equal importance to Australia to know what the rest of the world is doing. Whatever means we may adopt, legitimately and fairly, for broadening Australian knowledge of European questions, the better it will be for Australia; and I implore the Minister to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca. particular amendment now before us is one of perhaps greater importance than any proposal we have had for some time, and I believe that the House is unanimously behind the sentiment therein expressed. The merits of the claim are so obvious, while the inequalities and injustice of the of the remedy being in our own hands, that I hope the Minister will be able to put an end to the debate by frankly accepting it. orable member known that? proposal put forward from time to time, and if it is necessary to call for the correspondence on the subject with the Government of Canada, the High Commissioner, and other authorities to whom we appealed, a very substantial pile will be found. With reference to the Australian charges to which particular _ attention has been directed, my impression is that we were not free to deal with them until we disposed of the bookkeeping system. I believe, however, that we are free now, and, therefore,' an opportunity has at length arisen by which we may deal.at once with the question at this end where we have control. that the honourable member has, does he assert that we are now free fo do so? but say that, with the close of the bookkeeping period, and the alteration made and making in the financial relations between the Commonwealth that this is a fitting opportunity to reconsider the question.

We have not been able to establish an "" All-Red"" cable service hitherto, because of the agreement to which 1 refer, the Commonwealth being tied up in a contract which, if not indissoluble, can be dissolved only at very great expense, though, ultimately, that expense will have to be met.

The existence of practically a monopoly makes it impossible to have an "" All-Red"" route, but in the meantime we should give relief to those who are labouring under disadvantages. As I cannot deal with the question generally, I may announce, for the information of the House, that the subject has been closely inquired into by the Royal Commission appointed to deal with it and other matters, and that the Commission's report will shortly be before Parliament. The Commission makes certain recommendations regarding the means best suited for the attainment of the object which the' Government has in view, and I think that when honourable members see the report and the evidence on which it is based they will not hesitate to adopt the Government's proposal for establishing a better; more independent, and cheaper cable service for the supply of news than we now have. Obviously, we must all be in favour of an "" All-Red"" cable service. That, with other important matters, is dealt with in the report of the Postal Commission, which will be available within a few weeks, and I hope that even the members of the Opposition will then be satisfied as to the wisdom of the action which I trust that the Government will take on that report.
