I have received an intimation from the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The Births and Deaths Ordinance, Northern Territorv, No. 13, of 1925."" Five Itimorahle members lieiuinr/ risen in their places, Question proposed. [3.5] Mr Speaker ber intimate to any one that he proposed to take this action ? department. motion for tiie adjournment of the House to-day is to bring under its notioe Ordinance No. 13 of 1925 of the Northern Territory, whioh is characteristic of the many ordinances affecting the Territory, inasmuch as -it deprives the people resident there of a righ t which is commonly enjoyed by citizens, elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth. The ordinance deals with the registration of births and deaths, and was passed for the purpose of amendi , CANBEBBA. ing, in its application to the Northern Territory, section 23 of the South Australian Act of 1874 dealing with the registration of births and deaths by the insertion after the word "" a n d , "" line 6, of the words "" if he satisfies the registrar that he requires the certified copy for a lawful purpose."" Section 23 of the South Australian act readsThe Registrar-General and every district registrar shall cause indexes of the register books in his office to be made and kept with the other records of his office, and every person shall be entitled at all reasonable hours to require search to be made in the said indexes, and to have a certified copy of any entry or entries in the said register books under the hand and seal of the Registrar-General, Deputy Registrar or district registrar on payment of ihe fees hereinafter mentioned. The ordinance to which I tako exception may appear to be a very mild enactment, but its effect is that, in the Northern Territory, any one who requires a certificate of birth has to prove to the Registrar that he requires the certified copy for a lawful purpose. That may seem a not unreasonable condition, but it is not i m posed in any other part of Australia-. Members of the legal profession, if they require a birth certificate, can obtain it by paying the prescribed fee, and without disclosing their reason for asking for it. imposed, I think, in New South Wales. Northern Territory is the only part of the Commonwealth where the registrar has to be' satisfied that the certificate is required for a lawful purpose. Moreover the registrars in New South Wales are exclusively engaged on duties relating 'to the registration of births, marriages, and deaths, and should be officers who could D i d the honourable memin ordinary circumstances be trusted with confidential information; but the registrar in the Northern Territory probably has a dozen different clerical jobs to perThe reason I move the form, and this particular work is tacked on to his duties as a side line. His position, therefore, cannot be regarded as identical w it h that of' the registrars in the various States. These certificates are public documents, and it is only right that members of the public should be allowed to obtain them with as little in convenience as possible.

It is another instance of th© tantalizing treatment inflicted on people who have not sufficient political influence to obtain treatment similar to that meted out to electors in other portions of Australia. 1. venture to suggest bhab no Minister would dare to impose this condition in Victoria, Western'Australia, or any other State, because the legal profession and other persons would object to having to disclose tlie purpose for which the certificates were required. illustration of what might happen under this unjust ordinauce. A man might be under the impression that he had certain money coming to him, as a legacy or in some other form, and .might wish to get the birth certificates of certain individuals who had already taken steps to annex 1 it . He might desire secrecy to be maintained in regard to his actions, but under this ordinance he would have to disclose the nature of his business to the registrar; in fact, he would be pub on trial with' regard to his honesty and morality before he could obtain the necessary certificates. Again, let us suppose that a man has reason to believe that he has been blackmailed for an alleged offence against a girl under the age of consent. If he desires to secure a copy of the birth certificate of tlie girl in order to defend himself, he must go before the registrar and disclose the nature of his business, although that officer is merely carrying out the work of a registrar in addition to many other duties. Such a position would not be tolerated in any other part of the Commonwealth. I bring this matter up for the purpose of showing that the ordinance is class legislation in so far as it has been applied only to one portion of Australia. I know that the Minister will state in reply that the object of the ordinance is to prevent Chinese from trading in birth certificates in the endeavour to get into the Commonwealth prohibited immigrants. But that seems to me to be a very weak excuse. It should be remembered that the Chinese population of the Northern Territory is only from 500 to 600. and this amendment will not be a panacea for the evil it is intended to remedy -a legal client, he would resent having to Besides, the alien population of the. Territory is 1,018, including Chinese, Japanese, Cingalese, Indian, Javanese, Manilamen, and others, and this population has decreased by 814 during the last few yearsa decrease that is certainly to our advantage from the point of view of the White Australia policy. The Northern Territory has an excess of European population overAsiatics of 1,231, whereas in New Guinea there are 1,816 Asiatics, and only 1,228 Europeans. Although the Asiatic population is in excess of the European population, no such ordinance as this is in operation in New Guinea, where certificates can be obtained by the payL e t «i© give an ment of the ordinary prescribed fee. I think that, all honourable members will agree that residents of the Northern Territory should be entitled to obtain uublic documents with as little possible trouble as the department finds it necessary to inflict. The object of the ordinance is to prevent the iniportation of "" cooked "" birth certificates with respect to Chinese. New South Wales has 7,282 Chinese, as against only from 500 to 600 in the Northern Territory, and honourable members are well aware that Queenslandis f u l l of Chinese. Therefore, if the objeet is to prevent trafficking in birth certificates, why has the ordinance not been made applicable to the whole Commonwealth 1 Thousands of Chinese are scattered throughout the Commonwealth, and the opportunities of securing faked birth certificates are greater in the various states than in the Northern Territory. Those engaged in the business of trafficking in these certificates could afford to drop Darwin out altogether. Yet the whole European population of the Northern Territory is being penalised as well as the Chinese. An Australian citizen should not be subjected to tlie humiliation of cross-questioning by a registrar, and able to get a certificate only if he approves. If the _ trafficking in birth certificates requires to he dealt with, it must be tackled generally; it is useless to apply a restriction to a -few people in the Northern Territory, and leave the great mass of Chinesei n other parts of the Commonwealth untrammelled.

' M i \ MAXWELT , I have at no time asked for n birth certificate. able member's clerk has obtained certificates for the honourable member and his clients. Throughout the British Empire, I believe, citizens are entitled to get a birth certificate ""without having to state why they want it. Many of the Chinese in the Northern Territory are native born; some of them are highly respected citizens, and merely because one or two have infringed the law the Government has unjustly introduced this drastic ordinance. prohibit the use of penknives because somebody had been stabbed with one. No ordinance that menaces the liberties of tlie people should be proclaimed without previous discussion by this Parliament. If the purpose of the Government in making this law is to prevent the influx of prohibited immigrants under cover of birth certificates unlawfully used, it should apply the restriction to the whole of the citizens of the Commonwealth, and not merely to one section. another instance of the iniquity of the system of governing by ordinance. have Known a person to be committed for trial, and before the trial could take place an ordinance to be brought into being in order to defeat the ends of justice. menace to liberty in the Northern Territory. I hope that the Minister will see fit to at least amend the ordinance so that it may not be offensive to all the residents in that part of Australia. If people in New South Wales, Queensland, and other states can obtain as many birth certificates as they pay for, trafficking in certificates will not be prevented by restrictions upon the issue of them to the few people living in the Northern Territory. This motion has been moved to-day, not? because of any personal feeling against the Minister, but because of the duty I owe to my constituents. People who are pioneering in the north should not be deprived of privileges that are enjoyed by other citizens of the Commonwealth.

So urgent does he regard it that he has allowed two weeks to elapse since it was laid on the table before calling attention to it, although there have been plenty of opportunities to discuss it. The Commonwealth Government has the responsi' bility of administering the laws that protect the White Australia policy. The Department has evidence of trafficking in birth and death certificates in the Northern Territory, and therefore it is This is necessary to take steps to prevent that. The charge of trafficking is made. I not against the white but against the Chinese population. Honourable members know that Chinese have done this sort of thing throughout Australia.

If any white resident of the Territory objected to the ordinance, he would surely voice his objection; but can the honourable member cite one white person who has done so? All honourable members have experienced difficulty in obtaining birth certificates, even for their relatives. The ordinance provides that if a person who desires a birth certificate pays a small fee, and states definitely why he requires the certificate, it shall be issued. No one can object to that. The ordinance can have no ill effect on the white residents of the Territory.

To provide a proper establishment afloat, carrying the requisite minimum of 300 boys, and with room for expansion, it would be necessary to purchase and refit another suitable hulk. At present there is none available. As a result of investigation abroad, it has been decided that a shore establishment facilities and better living conditions than a training ship. It has been ascertained that the cost per head of training on shore, as against afloat, is 92 per cent, in favour of a shore establishment. It is, therefore, proposed to provide a shore establishment on a site of approximately 40 acres, in the vicinity of the North Geelong railway station, Victoria, having frontages to Melbourne-road, Maguire-street, and Oorio Bay, and intersected by the main Melbourne-Geelong railway. This site is owned by the state of Victoria, and portion is under the control of the Geelong Harbour Trust. The portion containing "" Osborne House"" has been occupied by the Commonwealth for some years for naval purposes. Negotiations are now proceeding for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the whole property. The projected establishment entails the erection., in the first to continue their operations. So far as instance, of messing and sleeping accommodation for 300 boys; buildings for instructional purposes, such as gymnasium., school, seamanship block, gun drill, battery; hospital and isolation huts; messing and sleeping accommodation for the ship's company, together with stores building and so on. The existing buildings will be altered and converted for the use of the administration staff and as officers' quarters. simply designed, with a view to future expansion, and will be constructed of timber framing, covered with hardwood to dado height, fibro-cement panelling above, and roofed with iron. The total estimated cost of buildings, together with accessory civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering services, is £86,700. Government is now asking the House to This estimate covers the works comprised in the first stage, preceding occupation for the training of 300 boys. Question resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from 20th August (vide page 1640), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to create, in connection with the Commonwealth Bank, offers better training a separate department to deal with rural credits. With this purpose I am in agreement. When the Commonwealth Bank was established by the Labour party, ib was considered that ample provision for this purpose was made, but, unfortunately, the bank has not made the progress that we desired. On the contrary, it appears that no progress at all has been made recently, as so far from conferring any benefits on the primary producers or the general public, the bank is practically at a standstill. This is largely due to the legislation recently introduced by the Government. I realize how necessary it. is that primary producers should be enabled to finance themselves over seasonal periods in connection with production. They are frequently compelled to enter into arrangements with private individuals or banks to obtain siiffieient funds to enable them the object of this bill is to assist producers in obtaining advances it is a good measure, but I venture to say that there is absolutely no necessity for it if the Government will permit the Commonwealth Bank to function as it was intended to do. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act advances might be made to rural settlers if the bank were operated as it should be. It is rather strange that The buildings are we should be asked to pass legislation to make provision for a rural credit department of the Commonwealth Bank when there is power under existing legislation to have advances made by the bank directly to producers requiring money. A3 members of the Labour party, honourable members on this side have already tried to effect the purpose for which the pass this bill. It will be found on reference to Hansard for 1924, page 1976, that on the 9th July in that year, when a bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act"" was under consideration, the honourable",17,Establishment Geelong
31,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.49],"member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) moved the following motion : That the bill be referred to a select committee to consider the advisability of extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, to provide rural credits for the following purposes :1. To advance upon broad acres. 2. To assist co-operative finance in primary and secondary production. 3. To assist in land settlement and development, and 4. To establish a grain and fodder reserve against periods of drought. I motion, but, instead of permitting the f u l l discussion of a matter of so much importance to rural settlers, the Government promptly moved the closure. Notwithstanding this, honourable members of the Country party claim that legislation of this kind is necessary to assist rural producers. Dr. the Country party who has introduced this bill . gentleman has introduced this and other measures which w ill be discussed later on in their proper place. The only members of this House who voted *for the motion moved by the honourable member for Bourke were members of the Labour party. No honourable member on the Government side supported that motion. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) then had nothing to say. Now. he introduces the bill under discussion, probably because an election is approaching. That may have a lot to do with it .

The party controlling the affairs of this House at the present juncture is the Nationalist party. too. the opinion of the hsnorable member, but unfortunately for h i m the electors w ill shortly be called upon to decide whether it is a good party or not. I have stated that the Commonwealth Bank Act makes provision for the advancing of money to rural settlers. monwealth Bank Act of 1911 provides thatThe Bank shall in addition to any other powers conferred by this act have power(d) To make advances by way of loan overdraft, or otherwise; (e) to discount bills and drafts; (f) to issue 'bills and drafts, and grant letters of credit. (i) to do anything incidental to any of its powers. Section 53 of Part VI . of the act of 1911 seconded that very comprehensive providesThe bank may from time to time issue debentures to such amount as it thinks necessary, but so that the total amount thereof current at any one time shall not exceed One million pounds. I think there can be no doubt that, under those provisions, advances might be made to rural settlers. EAB LE PAGE It is a member of D r . EABLE PAGE -Then why d i d Mr. K in g O'Malley bring in a measure to provide for r u r a l credits? I am arguing that the act is sufficiently wide in its scope to permit of advances being made to rural settlers, and special legislation of this character for the purpose is not necessary. The trouble is that the operations of the Commonwealth Bank have been restricted from its inception. They have not been extended as they should have been, and since the death of the late Governor, Sir Denison Miller, the position in this respect is very much worse than it was previously. I ask the Treasurer to account for the fact Australia is showing progress and in The honourable creased profits, the Commonwealth Bank shows no improvement at all. It has remained stagnant since the Government passed its recent legislation dealing w it h it. W ill the Treasurer say why the national bank of Australia does not show the same progress as private banks ? The fact goes to support the claim that honourable members of this side made last year, No doubt it is in that, with the Commonwealth BankB ill then introduced, the Government were ham-stringing the Commonwealth Bank.

It is not doing the business it was intended to do, and for which it was established by the Labour party. It is proposed under this bill to permit of the issue of debentures in connection with rural credits to a much larger extent than is provided for in connection with the general banking business of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not know how this wil l work out. In connection with its general business, the bank has power under the existing act to issue debentures up to only £1,000,000. Under this bill, it will be able, through its rural credits department to lend up to £3,000,000Twenty-five per cent, of the net annual profits of the note issue department are to be paid into the rural credits department unti l the amount so paid reaches a total of £2,000,000. As this would not provide sufficient funds, the bank is being given power to issue debentures. amount of debentures issued and not repaid shall not at anv time exceed(«)_ the amount advanced on primary* produce by the rural credits department and still outstanding as at the date of the issue of the debentures.; or (b) four times .the amount of the aggregate of(i) the sums lent by the Treasurer to tbe rural credits department and not repaid; (ii) moneys paid to the rural credits department out of the net profits of the note issue department; and (iii) moneys at credit of the rural ' credits department reserve fund, whichever is the greater. I do not think that the Treasurer or any other man can estimate more than approximately the amount of debentures that can be issued through the rural credits department. It is certain, however, that the amount may be twelve times more than the bank can issue in connection with its general banking operations. There may be some reason for this, but Surely there is need for some it seems not to have been considered necessary to permit of the issue of debentures to such an amount in connection with the general banking business of the institution. Under the rural credits department debentures may be issued up io £12,000,000 , and I leave it to the Treasurer to say how much more. ThereI do not know may be good reasons for this, 'but we should know what they are. D r . EABLE PAGE -Nobody can say at this stage how much will be lent. A limi t is set down in the bill. £12,000,000, but debentures may be issued to a greater amount, and I should like to hear from the Treasurer what he thinks about it himself. It is one of the matters to which he omitted to refer in moving the second reading of the bill. He gave us a lot of information about other banking institutions throughoiit the world, but very little about the bill. A f t er all, what the House is interested in, is the effect of the provisions of the bill. That is the information by whiph we must be guided in dealing w i th it . I notice that under the bill, provision is made to advance money not only to rural producers, but also to other banks or financial companies. I should like to know how it is that in connection The with all this legislation affecting the Commonwealth Bank private banks are per< mitted to come in . If we desire that rural producers shall be able to get money as cheaply as possible for short r periods, they should be allowed to deal directly with the Commonwealth Bank.

The Government has done nothing during the last three years to assist people on the land through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank, but now, in the last session of this Parliament, when an appeal to the electors is imminent, the Treasurer and the party to which he belongs desire to be in a position to claim that they have done something for the primary producers. anyhow. whether it ihas been even half done.

For instance, the value of the Wheat Pool last year -was £50,000,000 or £60,000,000. A considerable portion of the wheat was handled by co-operative companies, and a large sum of money was required to finance the pool. l i m it to the issue of debentures against products properly stored. would be a margin of safety in the difference between the value of the produce and the amount advanced. In addition, there would be the whole capital of the Commonwealth Bank, and behind that the security of the Commonwealth itself. The security for the debentures cannot be over-estimated. In regard to proposed section 60ABG, the intention is to make tlie debentures selfliquidating; that is to say, the term for which they are current w ill correspond exactly to the term for which the produce is held. If wheat is being held for five months, debentures w ill be issued for that period. finance is to secure the lowest possible rate for the holding of jiroduce, so that the charges in connection with the marketing of it will be reduced to a minimum. It is hoped by this means to secure a new form of stock that will be highly sought after. money lying idle for two or three months will take up these debentures and get 4 per cent, or 4£ per cent, on them, and the rural credits department will be able to lend at a slightly higher rate of in terest. In that way the cost to the producer of holding his goods w ill be very small. Proposed section ABH may require a little explanation. First of all there will be available for the rural credits department the money obtained from the sale of debentures issued against primary produce. In addition to that the department will be able to obtain advances from the general bank if occasion requires. In other words, the department will be a customer of the general bank. That amount of capital The proposed new sub-section 60 ABI provides for advances by the rural credits department to the Commonwealth Bank or other banks. I am not satisfied that we should make advances to other banks. The Government should deal directly with the producer through the Commonwealth Bank. Those who require financial assistance should apply to the Commonwealth Bank, and receive assistance through the rural credits department of that bank. I move That the words "" or other banks,"" paragraph would be no (n), proposed new sub-section 60 ABI, be left out. I move that amendment because my mind is not clear about the purpose of this provision. To make the advances through the associated banks must increase ex penses, and, therefore, must tend to increase the rate of interest charged to the borrower. The cost should be reduced to the cost of the accommodation provided by the Commonwealth Bank. If the Treasurer can show that this provision is necessary, I may be disposed to withdraw the amendment. surer) [4.39] -The clause provides thatAdvances may be mads by the rural credits department, upon the security of primary produce placed under the legal control of the bank, toThe purpose of* that form of (a) the bank or other banks.

The provision will meet the needs of individuals who do not desire to put their produce into pools. Some producers do not desire to participate in pools, but prefer to handle their own produce. To require all the business to be transacted by the Commonwealth Bank would be an intolerable hardship to people in places where there is no branch of that bank. A producer may have an account in a local branch of an associated bank, and may wish to deal through that bank. That is why it is essential to retain the words ""or other banks."" ducer desires to utilize a co-operative pool The associated banks use the Commonhe will place his 10,000 bushels of wheat in it. The pool will take his scrip, and, by virtue of having the wheat stored, will be able to obtain an advance from the Rural Credits Department. In that way it will be possible for a pool to finance itself, instead of, as in the past, coming to the Government for guarantees. The provision makes it possible for a pool to say to the Commonwealth Bank, ""We have 2,000,000, 4,000,000, or 6,000,000 bushels of wheat, or bales of wool, in our legal control,"" and by virtue of that fact to obtain a certain and automatic advance. For these reasons I hope the Leader of the Opposition will not press his amendment. I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Treasurer. One would think that the Government, in bringing down a bill to provide for rural credits, would create machinery so that the primary producer The producer, if he is could get advances from the nation's bank. The Treasurer's explanation indicates that his scheme is intended to act only as a feeder and nursery to the private banks. Can he cite a private bank If he has 10,000 bushels of or a business firm that is doing business in the way proposed? If a producer has 100 bushels of wheat in a warehouse, and takes the receipt for it to an associated bank, the bank will give him the accommodation he requires, and the Commonwealth Bank and the nation will stand ( Mr Charlton) has placed his finger on one of the weaknesses of the bill. There is obviously "" a catch in it,"" just as there was in previous banking legislation brought down by this Government. Previous legislation made the Commonwealth Bank the banker of the associated banks, and this bill will make it, as I have said, the nursery and the feeder of those banks. The Government seems to be incapable of submitting banking legislation to the House except to provide assistance for the associated banks. The Treasurer has spoken of places where the Commonwealth Bank has no branches, but, judging by the policy of the past three years; the bank will not open any more branches while the present Government remains in office. This provision, which makes a joke of the bill, will reI f the prolieve the associated banks of all risks. wealth Bank as a central bank only when they wish to do so. This bill has been brought down by the Treasurer at this late hour of the session, although he promised to introduce it earlier. He pretends that its object is to assist the rural producer, whereas it is to assist the associated banks. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will persist in his amendment.

As an excuse for introducing this bill, the Treasurer has endeavoured to hoodwink honourable members by saying that the Commonwealth Bank, without legislation, could not have acted in the direction desired. If the Commonwealth Bank is a bank in the true sense of the word, it can do what is now contemplated by the establishment of a rural credits department. measure is merely an attempt to prove that the Country party has kept its pre-election promise. If the Treasurer really means business, he should accept my amendment. [4.59] I should like some information from the Treasurer regarding the sufficiency of the security offered. If an advance is made by the Commonwealth Bank to another bank upon the -security of primary produce placed under the legal control of the bank, and that advance is excessive, on whom does the liability rest ? Is the private bank which has borrowed the money to be responsible to the Commonwealth Bank? D r . EAKLE PAGE -The private bank is to be responsible. rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank have a right of action against the private bank in the first place, leaving that bank to deal with the primary producer: or w ill the r u r a l credits department against the producer who has deposited his produce? In the former case, it would mean that the private bank, while guaranteeing Bank that the advance was a proper one to make, was merely borrowing money from the rural credits department because it had insufficient money available for the advance. Angas( Mr Gabb) suggested that the private banks should be entirely disregarded, and that the Commonwealth Bank should operate everywhere; but any one who knows anything of the ramificationsof the various, banks must admit that at the present time that is impossible. These banks have branches in all parts of the country, and to replace them with' branches of .the Commonwealth Bank would be the work of years, and would necessitate the employment of a multitude of officials. Even under the bill as now framed, it will be necessary to employ additional officers to make such inspections as may be necessary. [5.3] -The honourable member for amending Riverina( Mr Killen) said that in one instance the Commonwealth Bank charged as interest 1 per cent, more than that at which the money could have been obtained from a private bank. That merely strengthens the argument of honThe introduction of this orable members on this side that the Commonwealth Banki n recent years has practically been made a branch of the private banks, and has not been administered on proper lines,although established to assist primary producers. Actions of that nature are not in the interests of the Commonwealth Bank or of the producers. Moreover, when we remember that the. Commonwealth Bank lends to the private banks money at 3 per cent., and that the private banks charge 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, for that money, it will be evident that the time is ripe for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the conduct of the bank. When men want money to assist them in developing the country, the Commonwealth Bank should not hinder them by raising the rate of interest. The amendment of the Leader of the OppoW ill the sition would protect the man who has produce to sell.

RILEY -Apparentl y it did not keep charges down in the case referred to by the honourable member. If members of the Country party are satisfied to allow private banks to deal with these advances upon produce, instead of the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank, they must take the responsibility. If the business is handled by two or three different persons the costs must be increased. I am satisfied that if the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to cut out the participation of private banks in the handling of rural credits were carried, the effect would be to restrict the usefulness of this particular measure. Honourable members opposite ignore the fact that there is often a close personal relationship established between clients and managers of banks. Some men with apparently very few assets seem to be able to inspire bank managers with confidence to such an extent that they are able to obtain far bigger overdrafts than can other men whose assets on paper are very much greater. It appears to me that if , in stead of being able to go to a banker who knows him and trusts him, the representative of an association or corporation must go to a bank to whose officials he is quite a stranger, he will be unable to get as good terms as he could otherwise get. of the case referred to by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen), but the man to whom he referred got' better terms from the bank with which he was accustomed to deal than were offered by the Commonwealth Bank was simply that in the one case he was dealing with a man who knew him, and in the other attempting to deal with banking officials who did not know him. I shall be in terested to hear the reply of the Treasurer ( D r . ' Earle Page) to the question asked by the honourable member for Boothby that private banks doing business with their clients under this measure must take any risks incidental thereto. If they receive advances from the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of providing rural credits they must take the risks of their It w ill have the opposite dealings w it h their clients. Mr .CHARLTON ( H u n t e r ) [5.10] The more the clause is discussed the more doubtful it becomes. If honourable members will take the trouble to read it , they will find that under it no individual can get an advance from the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. honourable member to show me where such a provision is. The clause readsAdvances may be made by the rural credits department upon the security of primary produce plaoed under the legal control of the bank, to(a) the bank or other banks. . . . deal with the Commonwealth Bank. Treasurer stated. It is obvious that all producers will not go into a pool or a co-operative concern, and there must be some provision made to enable them to approach the b,ank. The only way in which such individuals will be able to secure advances under this bill will be by applying to a private bank. The Treasurer and other honourable members admit this and say that because the Commonwealth Bank is not established in many centres in the Commonwealth, it is impossible for the business to be carried out through that bank. But is it not a fact that' to-day the rural credits departments of the States are directly advancing money to rural producers? The New South Wales inI do not know the facts stitution advances money in this way to individuals throughout New South Wales, and even in this State, when applications I suspect that the reason why are made to it for advances. Money is advanced to individuals for the purpose of carrying on their business as primary producers, and it is not necessary for them to do their work through a private bank. The institution is very successful and its operations enable primary producers to obtain advances more cheaply ""than they could from a private bank. Competent valuers are sent round the country, and when applications for advances are made they value the security offered, and if they are satisfied, issue a certificate on which the rura l credits",28,Ooabe 1 For The Purposes Of This Part

I am considering the interests of the individual producer. There are many who cannot -be induced to go into a pool or join a co-operative organization, and there is no provision in this 'bill to enable such men to obtain any advance , from the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. man is right there. should be such a provision, and money 'should be advanced by the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank to any individual who makes application for an .advance if he has the necessary security. That is the only way in which we can help the primary producers. It is idle to say that they must apply to a private bank in their vicinity, and get the accommodation they require through that bank. It will have to go to the rural -credits department of the Commonwealth Bank for the advance, and no one can contend that .this will not add to the .cost to the producer. The banks are financial institutions trading fair profit. They will not do this -work for primary producers for nothing. If the private banks in the first instance must go to the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank for .the money to be advanced, they will probably make a charge of an additional 1 per cent, to the producer dealing with .them, and 'to that extent the producer will be at a disadvantage as compared to the position whicfo. he would occupy if he could make his application directly to the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. If I can be shown that under -this 'bill' individuals may 'Obtain rural credits directly from the branch of the Commonwealth iBank proposed to be established for the purpose, I shall be satisfied. We are all, I .think, favorable ito the measure, but we should not allow it to pass in a form in which it would be detrimental to individual producers who are not members of some co-opera[73] tive organization or parties to a pool that could secure loans collectively. directly to the Oommonwealth Bank? definitely. I have raised, and I have learned from the Treasurer that the individual is to be placed in .the hands of .a private bank. He cannot go directly to the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank, and that is one of the objections I have to the measure. I am informed that he Miast go -to the nearest private bank if there is no Commonwealth Barak established in his vicinity, and if he does, he must pay for any assistance he receives through iJie private hank over and above what he might be cabled upon to pay if he could go directly to a branch of the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. Branches of this department could be established in different parts of the country. It should be the duty of those in charge to get into touch with producers requiring advances, and if they were satisfied with the security offeredj the advances required could be made directly through the local branch of the Commonwealth Bank, through a post office, or any agency of the bank, and in that way money would be cheapened to the rural producers. No one will contend that the private banks are not going 'to make some profit out of these transactions. I do not see why they should be allowed to make these profits if that oan -be avoided. There are .thousands of men, including, many returned soldiers, who have gone o& the land, and are nut making a success of their operations. The Commonwealth has written off a £1O,-OOO,OO0 advance to them, and the States will have to write off many millions more. These 'Settlers require all tihe assistance tihafc can be given to them, and they will not get the assistance they require if they are compelled to do their business through the private banks. What they need is to be able Ito make direct application to the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank, and so obtain the money they require as cheaply as possible.

I say that there is no provision in this bill to enable an individual to apply to the rural credits department cif the Commonwealth Bank. If he wants an advanoe he must apply through a private bank.

If the authorities of the bank are satisfied with the security, they may make the advance, and charge interest upon it.

The establishment of this department is on all-fours with the holdings and put forth their best efforts in guarantee given by the Government through the Commonwealth Bank in connection with voluntary wheat pools. It would not result in economy to eliminate the private banks and confine the operations under this measure to the Commonwealth Bank. The national bank would not be operating to the best advantage if it were established in every little settlement throughout the Commonwealth, and it would not be to the advantage of individual producers or of cooperative societies-for this measure proorders not to vides for either or both-if branches of the bank were scattered throughout the country. Such agencies cannot be established except at great expense, and the overhead charges would be increased enormously. possible' for the Commonwealth Bank to handle the business as effectively as it will be dealt with under the bill. The measure is intended to stimulate producers to greater efforts than they have put forward in the past, and this is to be accomplished not only through the medium of the rural credits department, but also through the agencies of the banks already established. It has been remarked that savings bank branches of the Commonwealth Bank have been placed throughout Australia, but it should be remembered that in nineteen out of twenty cases the officers who operate these branches are not bankers. They are postmasters or postal assistants, whose business is merely to receive deposits and transfer their balances to the head office. These officers could not be made responsible for the investigation of applications for advances by co-operative societies or individual producers. They could not be expected to make valuations in connection with every application.

It would have been unfortunate for the Commonwealth if in the appointment of the' first governor of that bank the government of the. day had made an unwise selection,, and every Australian patriot is. grateful that the bank succeeded as it did under the control of the lata Sir Dendson Miller. sounder arrangement to have an institution of that size controlled by five men of knowledge and experience than to have its destinies guided by one man, for whom a fit successor might not be found. This bill gives all the powers that are necessary to enable the bank to 1 assist, the primary producers'. I assume that at its. commencement the rural credits department will confine its operations to perishable products, but will later extend them to wheat,, if necessary. In fact, the activities of the department can develop indefinitely. Had such a system been in operation in the past, many men upon the land would be much more comfortable than they are to-day. It is well monwealth is experiencing depression, with a resultant scarcity of money for investment. The Treasurer is largely responsible for that,, because by borrowing from the pockets of the Australian people he has withdrawn capital from the ordinary channels of industry, and development is checked. It is high time that he discontinued' that policy and obtained his loan requirements from abroad. I know of one settlement-and it is typical of many-wher e the harvest has been reaped and sold, but the producers can get no money until their crop has been transferred to the other side of the world and payment for it has been sent to Australia. This bill will enable the producer to get money as soonas his asset is handed over, and it will be of immenseassistance to those men along the Murray River, who for years have struggled like heroes.

The environment of an inspector of an associated bank teaches him to squeeze the last fraction of interest and profit out of the bank's customers, and that statement is true of the employees of financial institutions the world over. the other hand the employee of a savings bank is taught that his first duty is to render service to the people, and that he must approach a proposition from the stand-point of national development. far apart as the poles. I hope that the amendment will be carried, and that it will be made clear that the associated banks are not "" in the picture."" The object of the bill is to provide for the granting of rural credits, backed by the financial resources of the nation. The Government should be prepared to establish branches of the Commonwealth Bank all over this country, and should manage them in the ' interests of the primary producer and bhe out-back pioneer. wealth Bank should not be managed in the interests of those institutions that have exploited the people and squeezed the last fraction of profit out of them. I oppose the amendment, which is silly and absurd. If branches of the Commonwealth Bank are established throughout the length and breadth of this country for the supposed welfare of the primary producers, an expenditure of several million pounds w ill be entailed. Before any branch of the bank could pay one man £400 a year and make a profit it. would require £20,000 in deposits, and would need to advance £201,000. Let honourable members put that in their pipes and smoke it ! It is of no use wasting time on this measure. Many of us, who are well versed in little things, are most ignorant of what we feel most assured of. It would be wise of members of the OpI f we want to make position not te have anything to do with this bill . Banking is a specialized business, the management of which requires The managers and officers skilled men, especially for advancing money on the security of perishable products. Cereals and similar products must be quickly consumed, w it h in twelve months of production, or they return production, than are the to the earth from which they sprang, because they rapidly decay or are spoiled The employees of the savings by various agencies. It is quite different with mineral products. I advise the board to conduct its operations carefully. When as much as 80 per cent, has been advanced on a perishable product, that product must be disposed of quickly, or the security w ill disappear. The advancing of money on such a security is a On hazardous procedure. While I congratulate the Treasurer on doing his best for the primary producers, I advise the board to tread softly. The. two points of view are as I support the amendment. An honourable member has mentioned a bank that advanced more than the equivalent of the tangible security offered to it , the margin being covered by the personal security of the borrower. As an old bank clerk. I can only say that if an inspector caught a manager doing that sort of business often, his chance of remaining in the service of the bank would be very small; he would be sent to the head office and severely reprimanded, if not suspended. The CommonI can imagine Mr Boully, one of the keenest bank inspectors Melbourne ever had, handling an employee of that sort. It would be a case of Lord help the unfortunate bank manager who did that! I have no special regard for banks, but I recognize that they are established to make money. If we were to judge banks by the experience of the land boom, there would be a sad story to tell, for they then displayed a degree of selfishness which I cannot imagine even a moneylender equalling. In those troubled times I went to the Bank of New South Wales, and had the utmost difficulty in obtaining an advance of £ 5 0 for an unfortunate man who had £3,000 on deposit with the bank. He was grateful to obtain even that, and, in order to get it , I actually had to threaten the manager that I would state the facts at a public meeting of the unemployed.

Banking at the present day is on a much higher plane, and Australian banks are now following the better examples of the Homeland. They are also, perhaps, meeting possible danger by consolidating and strengthening themselves. I want co see the Commonwealth Bank become a real bank, a people's bank, and not a bank for banks. Anything could happen in the Commonwealth Bank under the management of a certain gentleman whose nepotism has been exposed in this House, b u t the Treasurer can say whether it is true that £2,000,000 has been lent to a financial institution The Bamford) -The honourable member is not in order in discussing the actions of the late manager of the bank. directors of the Commonwealth Bank is also managing director of the financial in stitution referred to. If that £2.000,000 had been spent on advances to the primary producers, it would have done more good. I object to the people's money being paid in large sums to private financial institutions, especially as the primary argument advanced for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank was that it would be apeople's bank, an Australian bank for the Australian people. If we make it a central bank we rob the people of their rights. W h y , in the name of common sense, does the Commonwealth Savings Bank pay 4 per cent, less in terest than the other savings banks ? The State Skvings Bank of Victoria has a splendid building in Elizabeth-street, and another at the corner of Little Flindersstreet and Swanston-street"". There is no need for those buildings. Whilei t is said that convpetition is the life of trade, there is no true competition in the banking business. of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, stated some time ago that the reason for the difference between tlie rates of interest was that it was not desired that the savings bank of Victoria should compete with the ordinary banks. The ordinary banks advance money on the production of documents, and, in normal times, have treated their customers fairly well. small account away from the Commonwealth Bank, I did so as a protest against the action of the then who sweated his clerks and did not pay depositors a f a i r rate of interest. Whom do we want the national bank to help? A r e the people with small savings helped most at the present time? No. U p to a little while ago, the State Savings Bank of Victoria did a great deal of good by advancing money at a fair rate of interest, not only to townspeople, b u t also to any one who wished to build a home. I am sorry to say that much of that assistance is now withheld, and that loans now granted are limited to £800, by which the bank hopes to btiild more houses in Melbourne and suburbs. Nevertheless, I believe that the Minister tion of Parliament when the Commonwealth Bank Act was enacted. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition is supT h e chairman of porting the bill, although, with h i m, I consider that it would be better if the words "" or other banks "" were omitted. Nothing tends more to develop a country than that those in need, whether producers of wheat, f r u it , wool, or live-stock, should be able to obtain money at low rates of interest. No honourable member will deny that during the period of the war the Commonwealth Bank did magnificent service for Australia, and those who remember the crash which followed the land boom will not fail to give the bank credit for having kept the rate of interest as low as 6 per cent. That the Commonwealth Savings Bank is not giving a satisfactory return is no evidence of any lack of ability on the part of its officers; rather it shows that the depositors prefer to obtain 4 per cent, from the State savings banks than 3£ per cent, from the Commonwealth institution. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . Green) referred to the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia, and asked whether it would come within the scope of this Mr Prendergast. Leader bill. Perhaps the Treasurer can tell us in which States similar banks now operate. the establishment of a rural bank is contemplated both in Victoria, and in South Australia.

168,Mr Hunter (Maraaioa) [S..0].^The,"rural credits department of tbe Commonwealth Bank which it is the intention of the bill to establish. some misapprehension amongst honourable members as to its functions, but I think it .was made clear by the Treasurer that its purpose is to finance the primary producers, through their organized bodies, during the period between production and sale. Hitherto there has been no satisfactory scheme for the financing of producers during that period. that private banks could be appealed-to, but because of the inflation of values and other reasons a greater amount of currency has become necessary, and almost every industry, and particularly rural industries, require money at the present time. organized body has been formed to pool products until they could be sold, it has had to go cap in hand to one Government or another to guarantee its overdrafts with the banks. bill is to lift rural producers out of this difficulty, and place them on the same footing with respect to advances as the ordinary business man, who, possessing the necessary security, can secure an advance from a bank. enable primary producers to present their certificates of the value of their products and get the credit they require until those products are sold. section sets out that advances may be made to the Commonwealth Bank or other banks, co-operative associations, or corporations or unincorporate bodies. Cooperative marketing is more and more coming into favour, and it is only a matter of time when we shall find that very little of the produce of the 'farmer will be sold directly by himself. is true now of wheat, butter, and a number of other products. business of the rural credits department will be done with corporations, and not private individuals. own State of Queensland, which I knowbest, the bill will not benefit individuals to any great extent. No scheme of rural credits would do so, for the simple reason that the dairy farmer, for instance, who produces cream, gets his money from the butter factory which he supplies. the butter factory or the butter pool must be financed in order to be in a position to pay the individual producer. Mr Hunter. same way, pools formed for the storing of fodder to tide over dry periods can There seems to be be financed under this measure, whilst no individual could go to the rural credits department and ask that his stock of wheat or fodder should be covered by an advance. The rural credits department, dealing with one body, and not with individuals scattered throughout the country, will be more ready to make advances upon the total quantity of fodder It is true under its control than upon the small quantities which may be held by individuals up and down the country. Such a measure as this is scarcely necessary for the individual producer. There will, no doubt, be times when individual producers will need money, but they can Every time that an meet their financial difficulties under state acts. At the present time there is in Queensland an agricultural bank, which helps the individual from the time he goes on to his land. It helps him to The purpose of this develop it, and to stock his property. The only link missing is the financing of the finished product in the hands, not of the individual farmer, but of the organization marketing his produce for him. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr The idea is to Charlton) has moved the omission of the words ""or other banks."" I think the omission of those words would be a mistake. Much of the work of financThe proposed new ing industries is done by private banks. The Commonwealth Bank does only a comparatively small amount of the work, and it is desirable that the whole of the finances of the country should be available to the whole of the people, if necessary. ""With the co-operation in this matter of the private banks the producers will be able to command the assistance That of a greater volume of the money available for advances than would be open The main to them if they were confined to the Commonwealth Bank. It is possible that at times there might be a run on the money Speaking for my of the rural credits department, and the private banks might come to its assistance. With the rural credits department carrying out this class of business private banks will not be making these advances to the same extent as at present; and, having money to lend they can, under this But measure, come to the relief of the proposed rural credits department. It is said that it would be a good idea to allow inIn the dividuals to apply direct to the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank, but this would require the establishment throughout the Commonwealth of branches of the rural credits department, and in the majority of them very little business would be done, seeing that we are dealing with a marketing proposition. I cannot conceive of anyway in which the individual producer would need this help, but if he did need it he could go to the Commonwealth Bank or a private bank. The only individual producer who would be likely to want to apply to the rural credits department for advances is the wool-grower. But he would be a wool-grower on a large scale, and one who was in the habit of shipping his wool himself to London. I cannot see that this proposal will be of much benefit to the small individual producer. of fresh fruit. met by an organization or a pool. An advantage in connection with this collective bargaining is that the rural credits department in making these advances would not have to depend upon the security of a great number of individuals in different parts of the country,' but would take as collateral security only the security upon which the private bank has advanced. If there should be any loss it will be the bank making the advance to the individual who will be responsible for it. The rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank will make its advances to a private bank on the collateral security, and if that is not sufficient to make up any loss the private bank making the advance in the first instance will have to meet the loss. In making provision for the co-operation of the private banks the Treasurer is asking tham to help to extend the influence of the proposed rural credits department. This will not be doing a favour to the private banks, but it will be doing a favour to the rural credits department itself, and a great favour to the producer. If operations under the bill were restricted to the Commonwealth Bank any losses made would have to be met by the people of Australia, whereas if losses are made through the co-operation of private banks in this business the private banks will be the losers^ argument would apply with equal force to profits. very little profit from these transactions. The greatest! amount of btisiness will be done directly with the rural credits department. People are not fools. When they want money they look around to see from whom they can borrow it to the best advantage. If the private banks find that under the operation of this bill their business is getting away from them, and. they have surplus money to lend, it is a moral certainty that they will compete against the rural credits department of tbe Commonwealth Bank, and this competition will benefit the people who are in need of advances. Under the hill no one is forced to go to a private bank and no one will go to a private bank and pay a certain rateof interest for an advance if he can get the money from the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank at a lower rate of interest. The whole trend of these operations will be direct application to the rural credits department. It is only in .those cases in which, for one reason or another, they are in a position to offer greater inducement to borrowers that private bafttks will get the business. I congratulate the Treasurer upon the introduction of this bill. I have been pleased to notice the generally good reception it has met with from honourable members. I feel sure that it will fill a long-felt want. Not only will it help producers by making money more readily available to their organizations, but it will at the same time benefit the community as a whole. I support the amendment. WhilstI welcome any scheme for the financing of rural or pastoral industries during times of drought or flood, or in the case of damage the result of bush-fires, I am extremely doubtful whether this bill as introduced by the Treasurer will achieve that object. I remember that in 1918 I introduced a deputation to the then Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, Sir Joseph Cook.

Is this another way of the private banks obtaining something for nothing from the Commonwealth Government? The establishment of a rural credits bank has been upon the Labour party's platform for years, and the principle is one which we have always advocated. Whilst we are not satisfied with the machinery of the bill, we realize that it bears some slight resemblance to the scheme which we shall very soon have an opportunity to bring into operation. When that time arrives we shall establish the necessary branches of the Commonwealth ' Bank throughout the whole of Australia, which will eventually undertake the work now being performed by private banking institutions. The people will then be able to obtain cheaper money, and receive more than the private banks are now prepared to loan.

Prior to the introduction of this measure no Commonwealth statute has really covered what has been termed in the United States of America and Canada the barren area of credit-that is, the area of credit that it is necessary to cover to permit the producer to retain continuous control of his crop from the time it is harvested until it is actually sold. credit before ? Isi t because the advancing of money has been considered too risky ? there are some who, like the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), have thought that such financial assistance could be given under the principal act.

Dr. merely pointing out what actually occurred. A f t e r the Labour Government left office the prime mover in the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank( MrK in g O'Malley) introduced a measure for the establishment of a rural oredits department, proving conclusively that, in his opinion at least, this particular branch of banking was not provided for in the Commonwealth BankA c t . We are justified, therefore, in assuming that legislative machinery such as we now wish to provide does not now exist, and, admittedly, the bank has never functioned in the manner desired. On every occasion, when we have attempted to procure the ordinary marketing of produce by means of pools, or otherwise, it has been found necessary to go beyond the bank, and ment necessary Some honourable members have complained that the bill does not provide for such action as the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) mentioned, namely, the advancing of £200,000 to producers who had suffered severe losses. Other honourable members say that the measure does not provide for long-term loans for land settlement purposes. does not pretend to deal with any of those matters. It is a measure for the specific purpose.of assisting the marketing of produce by enabling the producer to retain au interest in his crop unti l it has beeu disposed of, although the marketing of it may be spread over a whole year. A f t e r ' a careful study of tbe legislation in other parts of the world I venture to say that the provision in the various Australian States settlers on the land is the most liberal in far soldier settlement up to 96 per cent, of the total value of the property may be advanced to bhe settlers, and the liberal provisions of the acts passed in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland indicate how f u l l y the field of government assistance has been covered. I find that in the United States of Americaonly 50' per cent, of the value of a property is advanced by the federal farm loan banks. The actual handling and the immediate disposal of the farmers' crops is dealt with also by means of other financial instituwhich, on the whole, have operated f a i r l y satisfactorily; I refer to the general banking department of the Commonwealth Bank and to our other financial institutions. If we are to secure the regular and orderly marketing of the producer's crop it w ill not be done by individual farmers handling wheat in lots of, say, 1,000 bags, on their own account. Marketing must be done in a collective way. That is the reason for the establishment of pools, and that is why the Government say in this b i ll that there will be advances made to co-operative associations formed under the law of the Commonwealth, a state, or a territory to enable small men to for m collective organizations which w ill be able to control a substantial percentage of the proio obtain from the Governduction of Australia. a guarantee to enable the that they do not control? deavour to handle their own crop independently they w ill not have the knowledge that would be possessed by large organizations having ramifications such as those of the voluntary pools and the big overseas buyers. It w ill lead to Itspeculating, and the defeat of the object we have in view, which is to secure something like a stable price throughout the year to the consumer, and to enable the producer to be paid promptly. There is no necessity, therefore, for direct advances, because, as the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has pointed out : the only men who would be able to deal independently would be the big pastoral for advances to men who would make private arrangements with their own institutions.

187,Dr. Earlepage,"If small men eni t would mean that the rura l credits department could not make advances either to a State bank or to any other bank. The Government is not proposing this department as a placard, but is trying to establish a sound and permanent institution. But it cannot become permanent unless it is established on the most strict and commercially sound lines. To make sure that it shall be founded on a proper basis, we propose to apply out of the profits of the note issue department a sum not exceeding £2,000,000, free of in terest, which will form a solid foundation upon which the department may be established. In North and South Dakota, during five years, attempts have been made to carry on not merely marketing operations such as those under this proposal, but various other activities such, as honourable members have indicated, with the result that the machinery established for the purpose has practically broken down, although it was supposed to have behind it the almost unlimited credit of those States. Under this bill an advance cannot be made for a period greater than one year-fro m one harvest to the next. intended to hold the products of the soil for years, but only during the period required for their distribution. year's operations, I presume? endeavour to introduce all sorts of other governmental activities we shall get into a perilous condition indeed. One reason for dissociating the rural credits department from the general bank is that the latter institution stands behind the currency of the whole country, and acts as a bank of reserve. It would be required to serve the nation in a sudden crisis, and therefore its assets must be liquid. It is provided that its securities must be Australian or British stock, or bills for terms of not more than 90 days. If the rural credits department were part and parcel of the general bank, it would have a lot of paper for terms of up to twelve months, which could not be liquified and brought into use in a sudden emergency. For that reason it is essential to have a separate department, which w ill conduct its operations entirely independently of the general operations of the bank, such as the granting of overdrafts and the ordinary daily transactions of banking. When the department begins to operate-and I hope that it w ill do so during the present yearI think it w ill be found necessary to have inspectors available to visit the various warehouses, storehouses, and cold storage places, to ensure that the goods against which advances are made are in a perfect condition and worth more than the money advanced upon them."" For that reason I appeal to ton) not to press his amendment, because it would defeat the very object of the bill, which is to t r y to secure the utmost soundness in the institution which is the last four or being created, and to use to the fullest extent the financial machinery and institutions that now exist in the Commonsuggested wealth. Every agency we have must function in the best and smoothest possible way if we are to handle our national problems satisfactorily. The question of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr. Duncan-Hughes), who asked whether the bank or the producer would be ultimately liable to the department for an advance, brings to light the essential soundness of the bill. It is the bank that presents the It is not warehouse certificate that is liable to the rural credits department for the advance. its services. desires to operate through a private bank If we it is his own concern.

Like'myself, the honorable member wishes to assist our dried-fruit growers. He knows as well' as I do that, at the present tSme, they may place their product, under the control of bhe Dried Fruits Export Cont r ol Board, and receive up to SO per cent, of its value, less marketing charges. If people engaged in that industry are to be assisted they must get more than this bill proposes to give them, because, unfortunately, many of them have given liens over their crops, and therefore will not; be able to take advantage of the provisions of this measure. That being so, I cannot see how they can regard the bill as a god-send. scheme had been in operation, they would have their money now. of dried fruits in South Australia could not have known of the possibility of an 8Q per cent, advance under existing legis1 lation, or more of them would have taken advantage of it . To-night we have the peculiar spectacle of honourable members 07i the other side endeawuring to force the primary producers into co-operative action, whilst I am standing for . the fundamental right of the individual to dispose of his product as he pleases. Notwithstanding that honourable members opposite pose as the advocatesof. in dividualism, they will oppose my amendment, apparently on the principle that no good thing, can come out o£ Nazareth. I cannot see that this bill is much of an advance on existing legislation, except that organizations of producers, instead of. having to ask the Government t a finance pools, may automatically get the assistance they require through the Commonwealth Bank.. If the Government will agree to extend that principle to individual growers, the measure will be much improved. credits department to be created under this bill is designed for wholesale rather than retail service.. Most States have agricultural banks, which understand the requirements of the producers much better than a Commonwealth institution can possibly do. If at theoutset the mirail credits department confines its operations to the financing of: co-operative bodies and pools, it w ill doa great service to the community, but it may ultimately, go fur ther, and help to finance the State' agricud'tural banks. I doubt the sincerity of the honourable member for Angas (' Mr Gabb) in proposing the amendment that is before the committee. The financing of individuals would entail thecreation of cumbersome and expensive machinery. Imagine a farmer approaching the bank for an advance on a couple of tons of fodder or 100' bags of wheat, and having to bear the cost of theinspection' and valuation of his security !' Surely such an advance' is more properly the function 1 of a State institution. The amendment, if carried, would probably destroy the r u r a l credits, department by overloading it w it h cumbersome routine and administrative expense.

Individualism is a splendid doctrine; how much more prosperous would Australia be if it were in operation at the present juncture, and there were not so much turmoil over the 1 righ t of the individual to think and act as he pleases! . The amendment which the honourable member for Angas has proposed would not improve the hill' in any way. It is impossible for a farmer <""o progress if his land is mortgaged, if he has given a bill of sale over his furniture, and if on top of those burdens he desires to mortgage his. crop.

213,Mr Anstey,"The two events werecountry'that there was no justification for the attitude that was then.taken up. The Prime Minister himself, in a speech at Lithgow, when asked for an expression of opinion, said, "" I cannot give any explanation of that particular position."" The Industrial Australian, a newspaper that is not in any way representative of the Labour party, discussing the matter, said that it was a most remarkable thing that no action for the protection of the primary, producers had been taken by Dr. Earle Page, although he was Treasurer of Australia, and was in control of the Commonwealth Bank. I intend to analyze that action, and to show in whose interest it was taken. That same newspaper said that, it would have been more decent for the Prime Minister to have explained to the farmers why he permitted them to be exploited to the extent of millions of pounds sterling as a result of the operations of the banking combine, backed up by the Commonwealth Bank. Every newspaper throughout Australia commented ' upon the -anomalous situation. The statement went from one end of Australia to the other that, because of the immense amount of funds overseas^ and the shortage in Australia, the banks here were unable to finance industry. It was said that the Commonwealth Bank had to go to their assistance. happened. lutely refused credit to many businesses. Factories had to close down because of that refusal. Then, as my friend the honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook) stated by way of interjection, the Treasurer came to their assistance. The associated banks said, ""Give us some reserves iu the shape of notes, and Ave will"" immediately ease the market, and reduce rates."" That was in September last. The Treasurer advanced Commonwealth notes to the extent of £5,000,000, giving the banks security which went to extend their reserves. they received that concession, they increased their charges upon the exportable products by 10s. per cent., which enabled them to rake off £750,000 a t one stroke. In Kalgoorlie, and told a public audience the following month, they demanded an additional wealth they got it , they could not give further credit. Let us not forget that, on the floor of this House, the Treasurer, in the early part of last year, absolutely refused to accede to the demands of the associated banks. He told us that to do so would be injurious to this country, as the building up of an immense credit would lead to enormously increased prices, that would be immensely detrimental to the working class community, andeven to the primary producers themselves. I draw attention to the fact that that was the attitude of the Treasurer of a Government which, as a result of the immense pressure of financial interests outside, eventually conceded what it formerly would not concede. It gave the first £5,000,000 in September, and as a result the banks raised their charges upon the products of this country. In October a newspaper, I think the Sun, said that some people were making immense fortunes, and the Herald said that industries were tied up and paralyzed for want of credit. The new Bank Board came into existence, a conference washeld, and then the Country party came forward and said, ""We relieved the situation. Our Government made advances to the banks."" Another £10,000,000 of Commonwealth notes was conceded. This Government, which had control over the Commonwealth Bank, saw that the exports of the country were tied up, and that exchange rates for 60 day bills were increasEverybody knows what ing from 40s. to 60s., 70s., and 92s..6d. The associated hanks absoper £100. It had £15,000,000 of credit that it could have conceded to the primary producers and export agencies. Instead of advancing the money to them, it linked itself with the private banks. It made no concessions whatever to the primary producers, although it is self-evident that it could just as well have advanced the money directly to the primary producers and exporting agencies. It gave this credit to the private banks, to enable them to issue further credits, and extort exorbitant rates of interest from the people of this country. If this Government, through the instruThe day after mentality of the Commonwealth Bank, could do that for the private banks, it could have done it for the primary producers. Then Senator Pearce went to that the banks of this country were short £10,000;000' of Commonof money, and could not make advances. notes, saying that unless He said in effect, "" We called the",48,Thibd Reading

What the Commonwealth Bank did for the private banks it could have done directly for the primary producers v and export agencies. In doing the business itself it could have relieved the situaare other organizations that handle onetion, .but it preferred, instead, to force the business into the hands of private corporations, and to finance thein in the doing of it . It entered into these agreements. Six per cent, interest had previously been charged, and one of the terms of the agreements was that notes were to be issued to the banks. The Treasurer had pointed out that the banks could issue a superstructure of credit upon the basis of the notes. banks, and for them they paid 4 per cent.., if they drew them. They could, however, pile up their credit's upon the right to draw, and for that right Jthey paid nothing. The Government, through the Commonwealth Bank, gave national credit, national notes, and national stability to the private banking corporations at 4 per oent., but it did not advance national credit, national notes, and national stability to the primary producers, who had good security. re-loaned it at from 6 to 7 per cent, to the export agencies, and reaped enormous profits out of the security .of the Commonwealth Government. A f t e r that the -Government has the impudence to say that it represents the interests of the primary producers of this country.. first thing the 'Government has done. It "" helped "" the primary producers of this country by aiding and abetting the banks in exploiting the producers on the products of the 1924-5 season. The producers had to pay £7,000,000 to the banks, as against £3,000,000 for the previous year. The Commonwealth Bank, which could be of national service, is being hamstrung and sabotaged. finances are restricted, and it is the onfly financial institution in this country whose and offered deposits are steadily diminishing. A financial institution in Newcastle which was doing £250,000 worth of business Although they were told through the Commonwealth Bank, wanted an overdraft, but the bank refused to grant it , although current -money was passing through. The institution went over to the Bank of Australasia, which did what the Commonwealth Bank had refused to do. In Western Australia there is a similar state of affairs. There are certain institutions there that deal with the primary producers' affairs. There is, 'first of all"", the farmers' co-operative organization, which deals with nine-tenths of the wheat grown. That is a voluntary pool. There tenth of the products. Last year the private banks of Western Australia furnished ample facilities and necessary credit to those firms and' -export agencies that handled one-tenth of the produce,, but to the co-operative society that represents the organized power of nine-tenths of the farmers, they refused to. give credit, although the products were being exported. The Commonwealth He issued notes to the Bank had formerly done the business, and preliminary to the private banks refusing to give credit, the Commonwealth Bank had also refused, assistance. It said, "" Our 'money is tied up overseas. We have nothing available locally. We are sorry, but we cannot give you anything."" In order to get out of the difficulty, the society made arrangements with private importers. It said to them, "" You have to import goods, and have to send money oversea. We have money The private banks oversea which we wish to get here, and you have money here which you wish to get oversea. We will give you our <s<versea money for your local money."" Then the Commonwealth B a n k ' came to the society's aid, and said, "" All right; we will do your business."" Arrangements That is the had previously been made with the Cooperative Wholesale Society of Gissat Britain to obtain credit. The Co-operative Wholesale Society paid the money into the Commonwealth Banki n London, and one would naturally assume that it would be transmitted through the Commonwealth Banki n Australia. Instead, the money was sent to each of the associated banks in Western Australia. The Its Commonwealth Bank said, in effect, to the farmers, "" We do not want your business, but if you are determined to do business with us, you must do it through can through the private banks, and, moreover, Ve will not put it in one bank, but in five banks, which is as many as there are in Western Australia. therefore, go to five banks to draw your money."" Producer, of Western lished last Friday, the chairman of directors of the Co-operative Society public attention to the facts. special emphasis upon the sabotage of the Commonwealth behalf of , and in the interests of , private financial institutions, points out how the private banks refused to advance money though they were advancing it to rival organizations. Bank has become the instrument private capitalistic export agencies, and has linked itself with the private in an attempt to break the co-operative organization farmers. were exported at a total cost of about Is. per bushel. Let us compare that with the bank charges for transmitting money. terest on advances, commission on London credits, and various other charges made by the banks, amounted to £60,000. pay Australian wages on the wharf, and in many cases on the ship, to pay the cost of loading and transport for a distance of 12,000 miles, and of unloading in Liverpool or elsewhere, cost the society. Is. a bushel, including a margin of profit for the transporters; transmitting money from London to Australia, charged practically 3Jd. a bushel. The Commonwealth Bank, therefore, did not in any shape or form come to the assistance Under tlie agency of the present Government, the bank is merely what the Government bankers. present directors, cotild advance and enlarge its functions, just as it could have done under its late manager. could be made into a great for aiding producers of all kinds. do the directors of the bank do that? They do not. The bill states that the bank may advance money to other banks. The private banks apparently are to be the middlemen, iir.

I do not wish only transmit money to you to discuss the convenience or inconvenience of that arrangement, and I can understand that ample facilities are now iu existence to meet the situation; but it You must, may be laid down as a sound principle that if a primary producer wants assistIn the issue of the Primary ance on broad acres for the development Australia, pubof his property, he ought to be able to go directly to the rural credits departdraws ment of the Commonwealth Bank. He lays If the security is good enough for private banking institutions to lend on, it should Government in acting on also be good enough for the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. and, secondly, he The Treasurer has said that even if producers cannot get an advance from the to the society, alrural credits department of the bank they can get it from the bank in the ordinary Thus the Commonwealth way; but he knows very well that the of the bank w ill not lend. The producers are asked to go to a closed door. The door banks is always closed to them. It is not to be of Western Australian expected that they w ill continually make Four million bushels of wheat requests when they know that they w ill be met w it h refusals. I protest against being asked to accept the scheme of this the bill, for it is fundamentally bad. The Exchange on remittances, inbill provides, in effect, that a farmer who owns f a r m implements and land, and who has expectation of a crop in due season, To but who wants a loan to tide h i m over unt i l he reaps the reward of his industry, must go to the private banks to get it , the private banks having previously got it from the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. It is quite clear that no individual w ill be able to but the banks, for get an advance from this rural credits department. If he wants an advance of, say, £500, £600, or £700, by way of mortgage, he is compelled under this scheme to lodge his security w it h a private bank, of the primary producers. and the private bank can take that security, which has been lodged by the borrower, to the rural credits department claims it to be-a bank for and obtain upon it what the actual owner The bank to-day, under its cannot himself obtain from the departmoney ment. That is the fundamental and in iquitous principle of this bill. It is outIt rageous, and cannot be justified in any instrument way whatever. Mr Alexander Monger But also made these, remarksThe banks were asked to deal with the pool in the same way as they do with their other clients, including foreign organizations, which, as each shipment is sent away, necessitates who will advance the the banks granting a temporary loan until the documents giving title to the wheat can 1>e presented in London, and the loan liquidated. The banks, however, would not accede to our request. The proposal of the b ill is most outrageous. I object altogether to the Government buttressing up middlemen and enabling them to traffic in the deeds, securities, and produce of the primary producers of this country. I move the following amendment:That all the words after the word "" T h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof fluential, and more beneficial to the comthe words "" the bill be referred back to the committee with instructions to include in tire bill provisions enabling the primary producers to borrow directly from tlie rural credits department without going through private banks acting as middlemen between the producers and tlie department, and without the intermediaries of institutions trafficking in the products of primary producers."" -As I read the honourable member's amendment, it is not in accordance with our Standing Orders or practice. standing order governing this matter states that no bill can be recommitted after the motion "" That the bill.be now read a third time "" has been made and put. his opportunity to move the amendment -powers that we conferred on the bank by the report stage ? after the. motion for the third reading of the bil l has been made. I am obliged, therefore, to rule the amendment out of order. surer) [9.51] Mr Speaker of honourable members, I may say that the Treasurer formally moved the motion for the third reading, but made no speech on it . According to former rulings, he is, . therefore, entitled at this stage to address the House, and his speech w ill not necessarily close the debate. that the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) has made the speech that we have just heard, for it gives me an opportunity to expose the fundamental fallacy of the whole of his arguments and also to "" scotch"" once and for all the slanders that have been continually uttered regarding the effect of the measure which we passed last year to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act. ' A great deal of water has run under the bridge since the honourable member made his impassioned speech on this very subject last year, and there w ill be far less credence given to his statements to-night than was given to those which he made on that occasion since, in its actual operation, the amending bill that we passed last year has achieved to a very large extent our anticipations and prognostications that it would make the Commonwealth Bank more important, more in munity at large. It is recognized, not only in Australia but all over the world, that, as the result of the action taken by the Government last year, the Connnonwealth Bank is now the dominating factor in the financial world of Australia. No one who has had the experience that I have had in the last twelve months could fail to realize that that is so. A couple of illustrations that I shall submit The presently will prove it . I should like, first of all, however, to deal with the opening assertion made by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) with regard to the powers of the bank under the original The honourable member has missed act. The honourable member said that the the amending measure passed last year were really included in the original Commonwealth Bank Act, and that there was no need for us to pass last year's b ill . . I ' need only say, in reply, that although the Labour party was in office for five years after the original act was passed, it did nothing whatever to put into operation these powers, which the honourable member for Bourke contends W ill this close the debate? were provided for in that act. The first governor of the bank, the late Sir Denison Miller, apparently possessed the complete confidence of the Labour party during that period, but, so far as I can learn, he made no effort whatever to give effect to these powers which we are told are latent in the principal act. D u r in g the last three or four months of his life I was in I am very glad very close association with h i m, and he did not indicate to me in any manner whatever that he believed these poweTS were contained in the act as originally passed. On the contrary, he recognized that there was necessity for the action we took last year. I also call attention to the fact that the Hon.

The facts are that for a time the lategovernor of the bank used the banka funds to a very great degree in London in oitfder to make profits. banks did the samething. turn came in the exchange rates, they were, all caught with . their money London, and need for it here. The high exchange rates prevailinghere were not due to any nefarious combine. wanted such a combine. to cause high rates of exchange. The Bank of ]STew Zealand was. able, by careful foresight, to put itself in a better position than the banks of Australia came. The Commonwealth Bank has not been in association with any banks for the purpose of keeping, up the exchange rates. That is proved conclusively by. its action as soon, as the gold basis was restored. Board had urged for several months that the gold basis should be restored as soon as possible. restoration? time when gold could be handled the exchange £3 10s. or £4 per £100 to 15s.' per £100. That indicates that the Bank management ever to keep up the rates, and this change was due to our action in inserting in the act a proviso which enabled the Cbnimonwealfch Bank to use its funds in such a way as to obviate the necessity fbr shifting gold. As I have said, within a week the exchange rate was reduced to 15s., and within a month it was brought down to os. 2d. or &£d. on, every bushel of wheat grown in Australia, Dr. Earle Vagc. disproves f d . on every pound, of butter produced. The exchange rateis now lower than it has been for many years: That is the direct result of the Commonresponsible of issue, discount, exchange, and reserve-. Everybody knows that since it has been such, it has operated much more benein the fighting platform of ficially and' widely than ever it d i d in the party, and the action old' days. It penetrates more than ever into the business of the country, and it is 1 that he realized quite well touching, industry to a very much greater extent.. The honourable member tot The .13'ourke referred to. certainadvances made by the Commonwealth Bank to the other banks, and' stated that huge profits were made, by the private banking companies in consequence of. theseadvances.. I do not know what profits the private banks made, but I do know that but f o i Guar action last year in. respect of the ComMaary other monwealth Bank, our wool sales would When, the not have been held, and the producers would have lost £20 ,000,000.

The operations of the bank in that respect have enhanced' the prosperity of our producers. I come now to' this other cock and bull story w.hen the. turn that is being, carried round! the, country to the effect that the privatebanks have been makiaag: wonderful profits, by reason of tlie advances of Commonwealth notes made to them by the Commonwealth Bank. What was The Commonwealth Bank done in that connection was that the Commonwealth Bank said to the other banks, "" We, as a bank, of issue, discount, What happened at its exchange, and. reserve, arewilling to Within a week from the make available to you. £15,000,000 in freely, notesoncertain defined securities.."" rate was reduced from They were to be charged a certain rate for the accommodation... Because the Commonwealth banks knew that thereafter they would be had no desire whatable to carry on, not only their wool business, but their ordinary business also-, confidence was restored:, and the general businessof the country went on.

That was worth something like and from id. to statements.",52,Thibd Reading
223,Mr Erjxey,"We w ill repeat the'but my statement w ill -enahle the conmmnnity to appreciate the exact position. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Monger and Mr Thompson, ' the Anstey) has frequently 'expressed lus idea .of the way i i i which the production of Australia should be financed. His idea for the proper financing of the .country, as his motion suggests, is that there should be a continuous issue of notes to the producers as they come along to the result in the currency being inflated, until we arrived at a position similar to that recently experienced by -Germany., or that of France at present. No one can charge the Oommonwealth Bank Board or the Government with having done anything to cause an inflation of the currency in Australia. Let us consider for a moment the terms upon which the advances of notes were mad© hy the board. .against definite security, and had ito be returned by a certain definite date. That absolutely prevented the edifice of credit being built upon, as the honourable member for Bourke has suggested. It is true, as I said last year, that if we issue to the public notes representing £5,000,000, or even £1©0,-000,<0.00, and have no means of bringing them back, they will he used as a basis of credit to five times the amount. On the other hand, if the people to whom they are issued are informed that they must be returned by a -definite date, they are unable to erect an edifice of credit upon them. Because these advances were seasonal, as are similar advances in Canada .and the United States of America, they did not bring about any inflation of the currency in Australia. cost of living which, after all, is the real test-as would have beenthe case had the honourable member's scheme been in operation. If the honor.ahle member for Bourke ever gets the opportunity to put his ideas into practice, we must expect destitution, unemployment, and conditions similar to those existing lately in Germany. I shall now deal with the other question raised by the honourable member, namely, the effect of this hill upon the farmers in ""Western Australia. In .this connection also, I am iglad to have the opportunity of placing the facts on record. in Niorvember njf last year, and again this year, shortly before he died, Mr Basil Murray, and this year Mr latter only a fortnight ago, thanked me. and expressed their gratitude to .the Commonwealth Bank for enabling them to carry .on with their pool last year. What was the* position regarding than pool ? The 'Coniimonwealth Governmani had told the States that it was prebank. That action would pared to stand behind a Commonwealthwide pool, with .one chartering agency, one shipping agency, .and one shipping agreement. The then Labour 'Government of Victoria refused to come in, and w.e were unable, therefore, to get an agreement. Those who were forming the pool in Western Australia then approached the Labour Government of that .State with a request that something be done. That Government agreed to give They were made a guarantee which would .enafcle^the project to go through, but wanted to impose certain conditions regarding the price at which their produce should be sold locally. Those conditions the organizers of the pool considered t© be intolerable, and therefore the guarantee was rejected. It was then decided to ascertain what financial arrangements could be made, and it was found that the Co-operative Wholesale Society of -Great Britain was willing, for the sake of co-operation, to make finance available. At that, time the wheat-buyers of Australia were paying up to £6 13s. per cent, for exchange. The authorities of the Commonwealth Bank said that there would be difficulty, hut after full discussion, and recognizing that these men were ready to help themselves, the Commonwealth Bank agreed to handle the transaction. Thisi t did, Nor did they increase the charging reasonable rates. The result was that the responsible officers of the pool expressed their thanks to me for what was done. They have also stated .publicly .that the bill now ""before the House is exactly the class of measure which will obviate the necessity of their having to go overseas for finance in the future. I have no hesitation in asking the House to pass this bill. It will prove a boon to the producers of Australia. It will stimulate the co-operative movement throughout the country, and give to the producers confidence and a greater pride in their own organization, <as well as a better knowledge of their marketing",53,Thibd Reading

Ultimately it w ill link producer and consumer, which is one of the ways to reduce the cost of living. enable the consumer to obtain his requirements at a reasonable price, while giving a f a i r return to the producer. attentively to t h e speech of the Treaf surer, and noted that he made no attempt to deal with the charge of the honourable member for Bourke, that the Commonwealth Bank has gradually withdrawn from business in Australia. D r . EABLE PAGE -That is not so. short time ago I gave a list of the new branches which had been opened. Treasurer to explain the following extract from the Adelaide Register of the 27th July last: The return of the Commonwealth Bank for South Australia was notable also for the shrinkage* in current accounts and the increase of balances at fixed deposits. Ordinary advances of that bank were reduced from £436,892 in June, 1924, to £296,881 ior the June quarter of this year. If , in face of those figures, the Treasurer still contends that there is no undue in fluence behind the Commonwealth Bank, he must be a political babei n the wood. the same in each of the States. my own State, but I should be safe in inferring that what has taken place in that State has occurred also in others. Some honourable members opposite may be inclined to say that the private banks also had a shrinkage. That is true, but in South Australia it was only about 3 per cent., whereas that of the Commonwealth Bank was 33 per cent. I cannot accept the statement that there is that much difference in the operations of and f a c i l i ties offered by the two classes of banks. There is only one reason for this shrinkage, and that is that the Government has placed the Commonwealth Bank under the control of a board of directors on which are some of the wealthiest men in the country No doubt some of them are shareholders in private banks. W it h such a board in control of it , it is only natural that instead of being a people's bank as it was in tended to be, entering into competition with private institutions, it is, in the Treasurer's words, simply a banker's bank. The Sowth ""Australian Register of the 1st June last, commenting on a speech delivered by Sir John Grioe, chairman of the board of directors of the NationalI t will Bank of Australasia, at the annual meeting of shareholders of the bank, saidFree admission was made by the chairman of tlie fact that when the Australian note issue was in the hands of the original smalt b.oard there was a great difference of opinion between it and the associated banks with regard to an increase of currency. He confirmed the impression prevalent in financial circles that a better 'understanding now exists between the trading banks and the notes board and between the tradingbanks and the Commonwealth Bank. state of affairs? In that case I ask the so. I hope to see the Commonwealth Bank a truly competitive bank without any of those honourable understandings so familiar in the wheat business. The Labour party did not establish the bank for that purpose, and when I find the chairman of a private bank pouring words of eulogy on the Commonwealth BankI am not at all satisfied. It is not our idea, as one honourable member has suggested, that the Commonwealth Bank should immediately supplant private banking agencies; I . hope, however, that it will go on slowly but surely competing with private banks, and giving betI am dealing only with ter facilities aud extending more sympathetic consideration to a man when things are going against him, u n t i l it gradually supplants the other banking institutions of the country, and becomes what we all hope it w ill become, the great national bank of Australia. I do not wish to h u rl a tirade of abuse at the private banks, but every one knows that they are run for the making of profits, and that if in the earning of dividends for shareholders they crush 1,000 or even 10,000 individuals it is no concern of the management of the banks. Our experience proves that. if they crush all their customers. do so. I am speaking of the banks as a whole, and of their policy of making dividends; and I say that the prospect that they may crush 10,000 people, the number I mentioned, w ill not deter them from grasping every opportunity to make big dividends for their shareholders.

He must borrow from a private bank or money-lender, and the money-lender can go to the rural credits department of the bank and obtain an advance on the same security. That is a serious charge against the bill, and the Treasurer did not answer it . objection fully in reply to the remarks of I was not. I was the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). further, that no credit can. be given to the Commonwealth Bank for restoring I shall say no more the gold currency. In my opinion, the credit is due to action taken by the people I do not wish to alarm, of South Africai n December last. SouthI wish to say that, so far as Africa produces about £8,000,000 of gold every month. From £36,000,000' to£40,000.,000 of gold was sent from that cimntiiy to England, ata cost for special packing, insurance, and freight. But the people of Sowth. Africa found that the bankers of the Homeland, charged them £3 15s. per' cent., on the credit sent; toSouth Africa for the gold that was sent to England. The exportation of that large amount of gold made the value of the exports of South Africa far greater than the value of its imports. When the exports of a country exceed in value its The Commonwealth Bank imports the exchange, as a rule,.is made by the hanks against that country. TheI f it gold' producers in South Africa, as a result of the exchange charged against them, became so incensed that last December they sent £500,000 worth of gold to be minted into sovereigns in Pretoria. That was the beginning of the return to gold currency. When the financial authorities in England found that it was the intention of. the South African people, to mint their gold in Pretoria, they saw the necessity for restoring the gold currency.

251,Dr. Maloney,"I wish only to say,Commonwealth BankB ill . I propose to quote from the December issue of The Round Table, a very conservative journal published, to conserve established interests. Dealing with the Oommonwealth BankB ill passed last year, and referring to the Treasurer, it saysIn his speech in the House of Representatives, when introchrcing the t ill , Dr. Page pointed out that the expectation in which the bank was founded had not been realized inasmuch as "" When the bank began to function it became perfect!.? clear that a national bank had not been established."" He emphasized the need for a central bank as ""the pivot of Australian bankinga bank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange, and reserve."" A little later in the same article the statement is madeThe changes effected by tbe new act do not appear fundamentally to"" alter the character of the bank, or to constitute it "" a national hank "" or the "" pivot of Australian banking "" any more than rt has ever been. It still remains a trading bank. It is not a central reserve bank. True, it mast publish the rates at which it. will discount bills of exchange, but the volume of that class of business is not likely to be large for many years to come, Question resolved in the affirmative.
