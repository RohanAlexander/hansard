I do not, however, wish their remarks to be interspersed throughout my speech with the risk that they may be mistaken for my own. industry can be established in Australia ""it will be a valuable thing for the Commonwealth. Any differences of opiniion that may arise do not relate to the object to be achieved, but to the method by which' it is to be attained. other countries, and realize that only in those in which the iron industry has been satisfactorily established and continued has the development of manufactures been considerable, we must all agree that, in' this continent of ours, where we have such ample resources in the way of ore, coal, and flux, we should do our utmost to secure the establishment and development of that great industry. Consequently, I have no hesitation in. saying that if we can bring about that result at a cost of ,£300,000, the money will have been very well spent. There are various' ways in which it could be clone. One method was suggested some vears ago, namely, that some State-o r the Commonwealth itself, if it had the power --shoul d undertake the responsibility. That was a method with which I did not agree then, and I do not agree with it now. The industry might also possibly be established by the imposition of a protective duty, to which, however, at the present time there are obvious objections, even from the protectionist point of viewand that is the only point of view from which I regard this matter. Consequently we have left open to us only a third method, namely, that of offering a bonus, in the safest way in which it. can be offered, viz., payment by results. The question as to the exact rate of bonus There is to be paid is one that may be discussed in Committee. If I recollect aright, the scale of payment now proposed is different from that suggested in the first B ill . I am endeavouring to work out figures which will enable me to arrive at a should be; but I have not yet had time to complete my calculations. I do not wish to deal with that aspect of the matter at present. Of course there is always the risk in this, as in every.other matter, that the experiment may not be a success. We cannot expect to have a guarantee of success in connection with am enterprise of this kind, but in view of fhe immense advantage that would be conferred upon the Commonwealth by the successful establishment of the industry, we are not only justified in making the experiment, but we are bound by our duty to Australia to do so. We are all agreed that if the iron Therefore I have no hesitation in supporting the principle contained in the measure. Some honourable members have objected to the Bill on the ground that, according to the evidence given before the Bonus Commission, it would appear that no bonus is When we look at necessary, that the industry could be established without the assistance of a bonus, and that if the figures given by various witnesses are correct, ithe manufacturers ought to be able to make a large profit without any assistance from the State. That is a theory based upon a series of inferences drawn from alleged statements, viewed from what I am afraid is not a totally unbiased stand-point. The point, after all, is that the industry has not been established without a bonus, and that so far as one can judge, there is little likelihood of its being entered upon here without State aid. the scheme say that they will not establish the indbstry without a duty. as that. learned member should look at question 2320. single question is not conclusive upon a question of this kind.

46,Mr Mccay,"A single answer to athat the whole of the questions and answers shall be regarded. I heard a great deal of the evidence, and read the rest of it while my memory was fresh, and I say, unhesitatingly, that the weight of the evidence goes to show that, rightly or wrongly, there is no reasonable likelihood of the industry being established without assistance of some kind. member call it an industry if it did not pay ? do not always pay, and those who enter upon them are not always sufficiently remunerated. The industry of the honourable and learned member, for instance, is, in his opinion, not sufficiently remunerated. But it is industry all the same. I have commenced three times to say that it appears to me that, rightly or wrongly, there is no reasonable likelihood of the industry being established unless some assistance be given. The reason is obvious. It requires the outlay of a large amount of capital, and those concerned in the matter expect a reasonable assurance that they will get some return for their capital. Let us remember the facts of the case with regard to the production and consumption of iron. In England and in the United States the iron industry has been established and developed to a very large degree. We know that so great are the resources of the manufacturers in the United' States that it is quite possible for, tbe output to be increased at any particular time to such an extent as to enable the manufacturers to more than swamp such a market as ours. quently, if an attempt were made to establish the industry here without assistance from the State, the result would inevitably be-and it would be a perfectly legitimate market operation'-that whatever the price the Australian manufacturer asked for his material, allowing for the cost of production, and leaving a margin for profit, he would inevitably be undersold by his giant competitors. That is a fact which must always influence those who regard the question from the protectionist point of view. There is another important fact in connection with the industry, namely, that various works turn out special brands of iron, and find it to their interest to keep up a certain qualitv. There will consequently not be what is called "" tlie usual prejudice "" against Australian goods, but there will be very great difficulty, at the initiation of this enterprise. in getting the consumers to purchase the Australian article, because they know that if they buy the imported article of a given brand they will be getting a given quality. There is more difficulty in securing a market for Australian iron than there is in the case of any other local manufacture. This is due not so much to prejudice as to a just apprehension that in purchasing the the honourable local article the consumers may"" not.be getting exactly the quality that they want. Therefore, it seems to me that in the case of a great industry of this character-grea t in its potentialities, and in its benefits to the community-specia l difficulties exist both in regard to the possibility of the products of any such enterprise independently started > being undersold an'd in getting the consumers to use those .products, and for these reasons we are justified in proceeding in the way that is proposed. I quite agree with the statement, which I signed in the majority report, which sets outYour Commissioners, however, do not recommend the immediate imposition of a Customs duty, as, pending a local supply sufficient for Australian requirements, the result might be to temporarily raise the price to the consumer, which should be avoided. Of course, there is always that difficulty in connection with protection. One man's raw material may be another man's finished product. It is that fact which requires a very careful adjustment of the relative rates of duty. In this case, undoubtedly, if the industry were established in such a way as to seriously interfere with the users of its Conseproducts, it might possibly do more temporary harm than immediate good. But by following the bounty method, and ascertaining whether the industry can be thoroughly established, and a satisfactory article produced, we shall afford those who wish to engage in the enterprise an opportunity of so doing, without in any way interfering with the well-being of the consumers. It is alleged by those who are opposed to the Bill that the evidence taken before the Royal Commission shows that the industry can be established without any state aid whatever. I have ventured to give one or two general reasons which are, to my mind, a sufficient.answer to that contention. Then it is suggested that those who may embark upon this enterprise may possibly make a large profit out of it. I do not suppose-to use an American phrase-that they will enter the business "" for the benefit of their health."" They expect to make",16,Manufactures Encouragement Bill No 2 Second Reading

I say that the greatest enemy which the iron industry in Australia has had up to the present time has been the Federal Labour Party. It may be a fact of which 1 they are proud, but it is nevertheless the truth. When we endeavoured to pass this measure in 1902, it was the bulk of the members of the Labour Party, headed by the honourable member for Bland, who insisted upon declaring that the industry should be nationalized, or that there should be no industry at all. some of the free-traders. point out that the free-traders were justified in opposing the Bill in any shape or form. It is the action of those who call themselves protectionists that I am challenging in this connection. I think that the honourable member for Southern Melbourne was one of those who was true to his protectionist principles, and who endeavoured to get the Bill passed. But the honourable member for Bland, a protectionist member of the Labour Party, and other members of that party, acted as they have always done when protection has come into conflict with their Labour platform. their -protectionist doctrines upon one side, and stuck to their pet theories, which they now tell us are theories applicable to the distant future. alone whom Australia has to thank for the fact that we are still discussing this B ill , instead of watching with anxious interest the development of the iron industry in Australia. tified their existence by that action.

I have only one other observation to make. A good deal of stress has been laid upon ford to a question put to him before the Commission in regard to the cost of the production of iron at Lithgow, which he set down at 35s. per ton. I thought then, as I do now, that his estimate-despit e the fact that he is a gentleman who should know what he is talking about-wa s extremely low. A t any rate, it was unsupported by the testimony of any other witnesses. All the rest of the evidence given before the Commission goes to show that the cost of production is very much higher than he stated it to be. Even at Pittsburg it is 32s. 5 j d . per ton; at Middlesborough it is 52s. 2 d . ; and Mr Jaquet estimated that the cost at Lithgow was 47s. 7d. per ton.

A good deal of stress has been laid upon Mr Sandford's statement. I have a distinct recollection of the occasion upon which he gave that answer. The Commission were sitting in the room which is now occupied by the Labour Party, and I remember that Mr Sandford was asked what was his cost of production. At first he seemed disinclined to answer. He became very excited, and the honourable member for Parramatta suggested that he should retire for a few minutes, and consider the matter.. Mr Sandford appeared to be a gentleman of an excitable disposition, and undoubtedly no member of the Commission treated him with greater courtesy and consideration than did the honourable member for Parramatta, although he is strongly opposed to him on this particular question. Mr Sandford went out of the room, but returning far. sooner than we had anticipated,, he rushed to his chair, and commenced to speak. I do not believe that from that time until the close of his examination he mastered and marshalled his facts as an ordinarily careful witness would have done. It was because I observed that he was highly excited that I asked him again and again whether the quotation he had given included all costs of production. Although apparently he adhered to the statement that it did, the fact remains that there are a number of charges which bring up the total cost to far more than 35s -to 50s. or 55s. per ton. gested charges could not be fairly included in the cost of production; but, at all events, whether the cost to Mr Sandford is 35s. or 65s. per ton. I assert most emphatically that he would have to maintain _ a most strenuous fight for a long time against the steel trusts and other great corporations concerned in this industry. Whilst on the one hand we should not make the bounty so high and give it under such conditions as would render it possible for those engaged in the industrv to simply earn it , and then go out of the business, making a profit, it is equally important on the other hand, that it should not be so low as to render it impossible for them to withstand the market comT h a t is the evidence petition, which will be fiercely forced upon them for some years by the American s*eel trust and other corporations. We are on the horns of a dilemma. We maymake the bounty so high that the industry will not be established, or on the other hand we mav make it so low that it will be impossible to develop it. It is necessary for us to arrive at a happy vid media, which will enable us to guard against injustice to the Commonwealth and at the same time to secure the development of the industry. I hope there will be no unreasonable delay in passing this measure. It will evidently require to be discussed from the protectionist stand-point, as well as from the free-trade point of view, but for the most part that discussion may well take place in Committee. I have merely risen to express my continued adhesion to the principle of the B ill , although, as I have already said, I am not prepared under any circumstances to nationalize the industry. A$ a protectionist, I trust that we shall have an opportunity, by means of this B ill , to establish what is perhaps the basic industry of all our great enterprises, and one which certainly, cannot be described, even by the most pronounced free-trader, as other than a primary industry. It is as much a primary industry as is the growing of grain, or the raising of wool. not stand alone be a primary one? of fact, no industry stands alone. The existence of financial institutions, which collect money from those who have 'saved it, and lend it to those who wish, to employ it, shows that no industry can stand solely ton. on the capital of those who are actually engaged in it-the entrepreneurs. They cannot find all the necessary capital. The only question in this case is whether the necessary assistance is to come, as some of my honourable friends desire, only from private individuals. There are few individuals, however, who could find the hundreds of thousands of pounds required to establish the iron industry. It is, after all, only a question of the, source of the assistance to be given.

To begin with, the men employed in the works must be drawn from other avenues of. employment within the Commonwealth, because under Federal legislation which my honourable friends in the corner initiated it is impossible for any man to come to Australia under contract. under contract only for the performance of a class of work for which competent men are not obtainable in Australia. thus be impossible to obtain iron workers unless we take them from other occupations. 9, these men are invited, when they become accustomed to their new avocation, to make such claims as regards wages as w ill, if the measure is administered as my friends in the corner would like to see it administered, prevent the carrying on of the industry with profit by private enterprise. that happens, the works will have to be resumed by the State, because the only choice of the State will be either to have a number of unemployed on its hands, or to make the best of a bad bargain, and to run the industry itself. clauses 8, 9, and 10 practically make provision for compelling the State to nationalize the industry. tention, what is the need for these clauses ? Every State of the Union has power of its own sovereign will to nationalize any industry within, its own borders, and it is an insult for this Parliament to state what a State can or cannot do. Furthermore, the effect of the granting of the bounty will be, by restricting the area of competition, to create a monopoly, and is it not declared by my friends in the .corner that all monopolies should be nationalized ? creation of a monopoly, in order that, later on, it shall be nationalized. orable members imagine that any company will undertake this enterprise under the threat that if it makes a success of its undertaking, all chances of profiting by its enterprise will be taken from it? which would prevent balf-a-dozen companies from embarking in the industry ? one blast furnace is very large. The Duquesne Works,, at Pittsburg, which employ only 492 men, turn out 600,000 tons of raw iron per annum. Now,-inasmuch as the private requirements of the Commonwealth amount to only 150,000 tons per annum, and the various Governments take at the most 300,000 tons per annum, the . aggregate weight of iron required by Australia annually will be, at the very most, 450,000 tons per annum. 470,000 tons were used. speaking entirely from memory; but I think that 450,000 tons is a fair stateI t will ment of our annual requirements. On the Pittsburg figures less than'400 men would be needed to produce that iron. men engaged in one foundry in Melbourne. They would be affected indirectly. of the production of raw iron for the encouragement of which £250,000 , or five-sixths of the whole bounty, is proposed. When One company would certainly manufacture all the iron needed in Australia. here for export? as a labour free-trader, knows that if it , In this way, I say that is impossible to produce iron locally without a bounty,, it cannot be produced with one for export. The object of the If that is not the inmeasure is to so restrict the area of competition as to create a monopoly. My honourable friends in the corner will 'then insist on the nationalization of that monopoly, and the Government who are their humble servants in all matters political, will, when the time comes, be prepared to act accordingly. As the honourable and learned member for Corinella has declared himself to be opposed to the nationalization of this industry, I hope that he will vote for the amission of the clauses They are now proposing the to which I have referred, and if other protectionists who object to State SoBut do honcialism do the same, we shall get a true declaration of the policy of the Labour Partyi n regard to this matter from my honourable friends in the corner.

115,Mr Kelly,"My honourable friend,been before the Chamber. very little difference between the first Bill introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide and the second Bill introduced by the honourable member for Hume, the chief difference being that, while the first Bill provided for the grantties on the production or export of goods, ing of bonuses, the second provided for the granting of bounties. This third Bill, however, departs altogether from the plan of the other two, and contains a number of alien principles, with one or two of which I should like to deal. One of the most peculiar provisions in the Bill is that which fore this Parliament would be put in the says that the Minister may at any time, but not oftener than once in six months, refer to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration and Conciliation the question of fair wages to be paid. decide all questions of rates of pay and wages in the Australian iron industry. He will have the power to definitely fix the wages to be paid, or to decide that the wages shall be upon the same scale as the highest obtaining in any Statej but at the same time, under the Bill he will have no authority to regulate the conditions of labour. We know that high wages with bad conditions are almost as undesirable as low wages with good conditions. Let us suppose, for instance, that the conditions of should be the highest wages paid in New employment in the iron industry became so obnoxious as to cause the men to appeal to the State Arbitration Court. If that Court decreed that the conditions must be ameliormanian rates were lower than those preated, we may fairly assume that the cost of production would be increased, and that the syndicate would find that it could not afford in and insist upon the wages being brought to pay the highest wages current in any State and also to make the conditions of labour such as the State authority insisted } upon. either to reduce the wages of their emploves or to forfeit their security bond. follow that the cost of production would be increased. must admit that that probably would be the result. The manufacturers would then either have to sacrifice their security bond, or defy the State authorities, and run the risk of having their works closed down. The State authorities would then be called upon to nationalize the industry, or take the responsibility of opening up relief works to absorb the men who had been dragged from their natural avenues of employment There is into the iron industry. We know that the rate of wages varies very considerably throughout Australia, and we also know that under section 5-1 of the Constitution it is provided that the Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect to bounbut so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. It is obvious that if the wages fixed by any tribunal of the Commonwealth were calculated on a different basis in different States, the bonus would operate unequally. Thereposition of paying a bounty contrary to the terms of the Constitution. It is very clear that one of two States will probably be selected for the establishment of this industry in the first instance. The choice That gentleman is to will probably lie between New South Wales and Tasmania. Let us suppose that the industry is started in the latter State. The President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would probably decide that the wages to be paid in the industry should be the highest wages paid for kindred work in Tasmania. Suppose, then, that a new company afterwards started operations in New South Wales. The President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would then decide either that the wages paid South Wales or the highest paid in Tasmania. If the Commonwealth authority decided upon the latter course, and the Tasvailing in New South Wales, the New South Wales Arbitration Court could step up to the State standard. If , on the other hand, the Tasmanian wages were higher than those prevailing in New South Wales, They would then be compelled and the Commonwealth Court decided that those rates should prevail in the iron industry in New South Wales, the enterprise subsidized by the Commonwealth would, owing to the increased rates of pay provided for, unduly draw men from other industries in the State. If , on the other hand, the wages paid in the subsidized iron industry in New South Wales were lower than those prevailing in kindred industries there, the name of the Commonwealth enterprise would become a by-word for all that was undesirable in connection with the conditions of employment. These are the difficulties with which' we are beset in connection with the regulation of the industry. It is clear that if the Justice",23,Manufactures Encouragement Bill No 2 Second Reading
116,Mr Bamford,It does not necessarily,24,Manufactures Encouragement Bill No 2 Second Reading
117,Mr Kelly,"The honourable memberintrusted with this most important duty is, by fixing wages on the scale obtaining in each State, to carry it out in such a way thai, the bounty-fed iron industry will not become a subject for either contempt or envy among neighbouring industries, he will have to so regulate matters that the bounty will become unconstitutional, and, therefore, subject to immediate revocation. I desire now to refer to the power with which it is proposed to invest the President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to assess the compensation to be paid by a State, in the event of its resumption of the works. I take it that this is a deliberate interference with the self-governing rights of sovereign States. The provision relating to the fixing of wages is a deliberate interference with the right of the States to manage their own industrial affairs, and the provisions, to which I am now referring, are a further trespass upon the sovereign right of a State to decide what compensation it shall pay in respect to any property it may acquire. Suppose, for instance, the industry were started in Western Australia, and the State Government were to decide that it would be profitable to take over the works, should it be bound by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as to the amount to be paid to the company ? Surely Ministers are sufficiently cognizant of the powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution to know that it could not act in the manner provided for in the B ill . Are these clauses inserted in order to guard those who invest their capital against being robbed by the States, or are they intended merely as a sop to the feelings of the protectionists? It is a pity that so few honourable members should be present when matters of this kind are being discussed. Honourable members have not given this matter the close attention they should have done, but they have left it to members of the Opposition to think for them, and to point out the unworkable character of many of the provisions of the B ill . The duty will afterwards devolve upon those honourable members to explain to their constituents why they advocated a Bill in the nature of a bridge over which the avowed champions of protection might march into the camp of Socialism. member like a quorum to be present? [Quorum formed.'] I was endeavouring to show that the provisions in this B ill regarding the compensation to be paid by a State in the event of the resumption of the industry must have been inserted for the express purpose of hoodwinking the people of Aus. tralia. I now propose to discuss the basis upon which these bonuses are to be computed. I find that upon a certain class of article a definite price is to be paid. A bonus of 12s. per ton is to be paid upon the production of pig iron, puddled bar iron, and of steel made .from Australian pig iron. A clause in the B ill providesNo bounty shall be authorized to be paid unless the manufacturer of the goods furnishes proof to the satisfaction of the Minister that the goods are of a good and merchantable quality,, and that the requirements of this Act and the regulations have been complied with. It is clear, therefore, that after the iron has been produced the Minister is to be vested with the power of determining whether it is up to standard. That consideration recalls, to my mind, the excessive powers with which it is proposed to invest the Minister under the provisions of measures which have recently been placed before this Chamber. In the two previous Bills dealing with this bounty which have been discussed by the House, provision was made that ""satisfactory proof "" of the quality of the iron produced should be forthcoming. That meant, I presume, proof which would be satisfactory to an expert. Now, however, "" the Minister"" is to be satisfied as to the quality of the product. How can the Minister possibly know what is the quality of the iron produced? His statistics have been proved to be so absolutely fallacious that I do not think we are justified in intrusting to him the power of declaring what is the value of the article in question. We know how easily he allowed his imagination to run away with his discretion upon the question of the f.o.b. value of harvesters imported into Australia. If his imagination can be stretched so far upon such a simple matter of fact, it might be strained very much further in determining the quality of any article produced by the iron industry. In the case of galvanized iron, wire netFing, iron and steel tubes or pipes-excep t riveted or cast-bein g not more than six inches internal diameter-it not the honourable is proposed that a bounty of 10 per cent, on their value shall be allowed. How is the Minister to assess the value of those articles ? If it be difficult for him to appraise the value of the crude product, how much",24,Manufactures Encouragement Bill No 2 Second Reading

The position is that the employers in this industry will not be able to increase the price of their goods in order to compensate them for the cost of any improved conditions which may be granted to their employees. industrv will be compelled to depreciate the quality of the article supplied. The Minister will then be placed in this position : If he. draws attention to the fact that the quality of the articles supplied is not up to standard he will probablv cause a number of men who are engaged in the industry to be thrown out of employment by reason of the cessation of operations. I can well understand the political pressure which, under such circumstances, will be applied to him. We nil know the influence which members of Parliament, and the prpss. can exert. will be brought to. bear with a view to inducing the Minister to declare that the quality of the product' has not depreciated. I come now to the consideration of another point. Can one establishment for the production of iron supply the needs of Australia in competition with No bounty is to be the outside producers ? Let us suppose, for example, that the industry was started in Tasmania. We know that the question of freights must be considered in a matter of this kind. How are those freights governed ? They are governed more by volume of trade Let us assume that the than by distance. We know perfectly well that the freight from Tasmania to Western Australia is considerably higher than that from England to Western Australia. Therefore, even if this bounty were effective in allowing the Tasmanian manufacturer to supply the needs of that State, it is apparent that he could not supply the wants of They are forbidden to Western Australia and possibly some other States in competition with the English article. That is absolutely clean It is extremely improbable that more than one iron works will be started in Australia as the result of the payment of this bounty. Consequently, it is obvious that the bounty will be of advantage only to the State in which the industry happens to be started. Let us assume that one State, alone is to have control of this industry. Why should another State be taxed for its advantage? If , as the result of this Bill, the industry If the honourable member is started in New South Wales, why should Victoria be taxed for the advantage of that State? Or, if the industry is to be established in Tasmania, why should New South Wales be taxed in respect of it? large deposits in every State that 492 men in Pittsburg can turn out Consequently, the more crude iron than the whole of Australia could consume. What is the use of talking about vast deposits of iron existing in all the States in view of our limited consumption? We might turn out immense quantities of iron ; but if that which we could not consume had to be thrown into the sea, what useful purpose would be served? No one is more anxious than I am to see our iron deposits worked if that can. be done profitably. member propose to develop them? All these influences of Australia been started under protection ?

128,Mr Austin Chapman,"Yes.bers aware that in New South Wales we built up a boot industry under free trade, which was healthier even than the boot industry of Victoria? It does not require a bounty to build up an industry. If assistance be given to an enterprise, that enterprise claims a vested right to the continuance of the assistance. I do not wish to be led into reading the evidence taken by the Commission, but we know from the report that the consensus of opinion on the evidence submitted in favour of the Bill is that the iron bonus will not be effective unless it be followed by a duty. use of talking, about the iron bounty as one that is going to establish the industry ? For nearly forty years industries have been fostered in Victoria under the belief that they can be placed on their feet in this way. They have been a very long time, however, in getting on their feetalmost as long, so to speak, as some of my honourable friends opposite have beenin rising to defend this measure. portunity. friends in the Ministerial corner anxious to discuss the Bill? will know when he resumes his seat. question of where the capital to be invested in this industry will come from. If the necessary capital is to be raised in Australia, what advantage will the Commonwealth derive ? people to be benefited by shifting money from one . field of enterprise in Australia to other avenues of investment? It does not matter to Australia as a whole where she invests her money, provided that the investment is equally productive. Surely those of the people of Australia with money to invest are the best judges of what field offers the most productive opportunity for investment. If , on the other .hand, the capital to be put into this industry is to be introduced from abroad, it is obvious that interest will have to be sent my natural objections to this measure from out of Australia in return. The return from the money introduced to start the industry will have to leave the Commonwealth. We all know that money makes money. Bringing money into a country makes money in that country; hut that is not the only point in this case. We are told by those who are asking for this assistance that capital A r e not honourable memwill not be invested in the industry unless we grant £300,000 to make up the interest on that capital investment. That£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be the first of the money that must leave Australia as the result of granting these bounties. This £300,000 is to be the first return on which the investor can reckon, and that return will go where the capital came from. Consequently, as the result of the passing of this Bill the people of Australia will be ,£300,000 poorer than they otherwise would have been. Having received the assurance of my honourable friends in the Ministerial corner that they What is the are anxious to explain what these proposals really mean, I do not intend to take up very much more of the time of the House in dealing with them. As a free trader, I naturally object to the Government seeking to make the Treasury a source of profit to any syndicate. I naturally object to tax the whole people to benefit a chosen few. I object also tp wasting the national energies on industries that cannot stand alone, and cannot therefore at the present time, at any rate, be natural. As a free-trader, I notice with considerable Are my honourable alarm that the bulk of the evidence shows that the bounty cannot continue without * a duty to back it up, ancl that duty must inevitably increase the difficulties in the The honourable member way of our natural productions.

137,Mr Kelly,"The honourable gentlemanventure, but is prepared, under this verymeasure, to rob of the results of their enterprise and pluck those who may be so foolish as to enter upon the industry^ if that enterprise and pluck in seeking to establish the industry are crowned with success. If the venture is a failure-unles s good money is to be thrown after bad to keep it on its feet-the Bill means that £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 is to be thrown up the spout. Eveni f the venture is successful this Bill will be only a. means of finding administrative billets for my socialistic friends in the Ministerial corner, and for all these reasons I shall resist it to the utmost of my power. propose to vote against this measure, first of all because I am a free-trader, and secondly because I believe that it is simply designed to promote speculation. I should like to say at the outset that a free-trader is not opposed to the establishment of such an industry as that which this Bill is designed to assist. On the contrary, he would hail its establishment with great satisfaction, and many persons would not oppose the payment of the bounty, holding that it constitutes the least objectionable form of assisting the industry. But what I fear is that even after its establishment the industry will be granted protection that it really does not require. Minister of Home Affairs, and learn that it is the intention of the Government to move in both Houses that the industry shall be brought under the operation of the Customs Act when payment of the bounty ceases. that I would be in favour of the establishment of the iron industry by means of a bounty if it could not be established in any other way, as in my opinion that is the least objectionable form of assistance that could be given, and one would know what it would cost. we shall at once give Our assent to the imposition of a protective duty of 10 per cent, on iron production scheduled herein. On the face of it the B ill suggests that the least objectionable form of protection is to be extended to the enterprise, because it does not show that after the bounty ceases direct protection will be granted to it . In my opinion, however, the iron bounty will simply offer a premium to the speculator; who at present has this matter in hand. We know very well that it is suggested that something like £1,000,000 will be expended in the establishment of the industry if this Bill be passed. The iron-masters of England assert, however, that a plant costing less than £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be almost sufficient to turn out enough iron to meet the consumption of steel rails, not of Australia alone, but of England itself. The special pleading in support of the measure on the part of those personally interested in the project is really beside the mark. We have had a statement by the promoter that the establishment of the industry would find employment for 3,000 men, while the very next interested party that we meet tells us that it would £,ive employment to 13,000 men. This seems to show that the persons most concerned with the venture are anxious to throw dust in the eyes of the people. I have had a very great deal to do with a project of this kind in the past, and I was in the very thick of the movement in connection with which a proposal. was made to the Government of New South Wales, to establish the iron industry there on a free trade basis. Mr Joseph Mitchell then had the matter in hand. honourable member advocate then? the establishment of the industry on a free trade basis.

146,Mr Henrywillis,"I do not wishwouldi have floated the company in England, and the necessary properties and coal mines would have been transferred to those who invested money in them. I personally own those properties to-day. I am the owner to-d'ay of all the properties that were necessary for the conduct of that enterprise. Tlie necessary funds could be obtained, and the industry started now but for the fact that the Government are dangling before English capitalists this offer of £250,000. I went pretty exhaustively into the whole question some years ago, when the first Bill was introduced, and proved my bona fides by documentary evidence. When a similar Bill was being discussed some years back, I was in communication with London capitalists, whom I represented in Australia, and they told me that money would be forthcoming for the establishment of this industry, but they said, "" You must not expect the capitalists of England to refuse £250,000 if they see any chance of getting it . "" While this offer is before the English public they will not invest in a scheme for the establishment of the industry on a free-trade basis. was not done before this offer was dangled before English capitalists. was not put up for the establishment of the industry on a free-trade basis, because it was stipulated that a sufficiently large sum should be invested in plant whose capacity for output would largely exceed the requirements of New South Wales. Those who were interested in the concern felt that it would be useless to establish works if a market could not be found for their output, and they therefore asked for a guarantee that the other Colonies-thi s was prior to Federation-as well as New South Wales, would agree to take steel rails from them. If the State of Victoria had agreed to take its supply of steel rails from the New South Wales works, that would have been sufficient. Mr ,WILKS -Would member like to have a quorum to hear these statements ? [Quorum formed.] particularly anxious to have a large House to hear my speech on this occasion, because I was fortunate in having an excellent attendance when I delivered an exhaustive speech on a similar measure some years ago; but I feel that I must not allow the Bill to pass without saying something upon its prfnciples. The giving of a bounty for the establishment of this industry would not be such a very extravagant thing to do if all that has been claimed for the scheme were realized. But we know that that will not happen. The Minister of Trade and Customs told us, when making his second-reading speech, that Australia imports 7,000,000 tons of iron material annually, and that our requirements could be satisfied by a local industry. It does not follow, however, that anything like that output, including various kinds of manufactured ironmongery, would be the result of the establishment of local ironworks, nor is it necessary that they should have such a large output. Thousands of industries mus.t be established in Australia before we can hope for a local output of 7,000,000 tons of iron manufactures. The honourable gentleman also said that the establishment of the industry would give employment to 13,000 men, though at the most only 300 men would be employed, and it is questionable whether Australia could use all the iron which they could produce. I do not think that it is stipulated in the Bill that a larger sum than is necessary shall be invested in plant, but a great deal will be required for the purchase of properties necessary for the proper conduct of this business. While it is contended that all the ore required may be obtained from Tasmania, I am of opinion, from the reports of experts who visited Australia to inquire into this matter some years ago, that several States. will be drawn on for different kinds of ore. The establishment of the iron industry here would be an excellent thing tfor Australia, but it is not necessary to give a bounty of £250,000 to bring it about. £500,000 has been mentioned as the sum necessary to establish the industry, and the Minister said that £1,000,000 would be put into it. I quite believe that £1,000,000, if not more, will be put into it ; but for what purpose? To pay out the promoters pf the scheme. There is a huge fortune awaiting them. Al l the honourable those who hold properties necessary for the carrying on of this industry will be able to get fabulous sums for them. Parliament, however, should not unnecessarily vote £250.000 for the establishment of an industry which might be established on free-trade lines, if we said that Australia would not grant this bounty.

I cannot reconcile with my views the idea, that the Commonwealth shall, by legislation, deliberately take from the pockets of the people the sum of £304,000 and place it practically to the credit of a syndicate which, upon its own showing, is to receive 500,000 shares of £ r each out of a company with a capital of £1,000,000. by other companies. put forward by Mr Keats, Mr Darby, Mr shares, to which I have referred, contributSandford, and Mr Jamieson, are all based upon the assumption that the companies in which they are interested enjoy an absolute monopoly, so far as the production of iron in Australia is concerned. I challenge any honourable member to produce one tittle of evidence to the contrary. As a matter of fact, I find that, in reply to question 2341-whic h will be found upon page 115 of the official report of the evidence taken before the CommissionMr Keats, the gentleman who has had the sole control of the operations of the syndicate in London, and who visited the old country for the express purpose of floating a company upon the terms outlined in this Bill, was asked by the honourable member for Melbourne PortsDo you think there is room for more than one iron works in Australia? His reply wasYes, if Ave had our works established they would be practically steel works, because our iron that tendered by Mr Jamieson. I beis suitable for the manufacture of steel; but there could be no other works to produce foundry iron. I want honourable members to reflect seriously upon these proposals. Only last night a motion was submitted in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee, with the avowed intention of breaking down what its author thought-and what I think -is becoming a very dangerous monopoly in AustraliaI refer to tbe steam-ship owners' "" ring."" There is nobody in this House who entertains a stronger feeling against monopolies and trusts than I do. In this Bill we are asked to deliberately subsidize a huge monopoly by means of the payment of £304,000 of the taxpayers' money. The whole of the evidence taken before the Commission is to the effect that one companya company which will employ only a very small amount of labour-ca n produce the whole of the iron that is used throughout Australia. That is the testimony of the expert who was called, not to give evidence against the Bill then before the House, but upon behalf of those who advocate the payment of the bonus. I repeat that every estimate placed before the Commission was based upon the assumption that a single company enjoyed a complete monopoly of the iron trade of Australia. It was further stated that this was a preliminary company, and that a second company would require to be floated in order to provide the necessary capital. Are the 500,000 ing shares, or paid-up shares? But, altogether apart from that consideration, Mr Keats admits that after the stock of the company has been watered the flotation will be worth £200,000 to the owners of the mine. They are to receive £200,000, in addition to half the bonus. In other words, we are asked to hand over £350,000, including half the proposed bonus, to a syndicate which is to control the whole of the iron industry in Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports put the question to several witnesses, ""What will be the effect upon the iron workers of Australia^ if a duty be imposed at the terson admitted that the probability was that it would increase the cost of the raw material to the iron workers of the Commonwealth. I wish to say that I have never read any evidence given before any Commission which impressed me as being more truthful upon its face than does lieve that he divulged the whole of his mind to the Royal Commission, and I base my' case absolutely upon His testimony. We all recognise that the moment we begin to tinker with the Tariff, we affect industries which are interdependent, and to son, a member of the firm of Thompson and Co., ironmasters, of Castlemaine, statedEvery new impost on raw material is an additional cost to the manufacturer of machinery in the iron works of Australia.

Mr Thompson continuedWe do not think that the classes of iron which would be outlined here are.sufficient for the trade. when this Bill, in its original form, was It is well known that no industry requires at times a greater "" fluxing""-if I may use that term-in its different grades than does the iron industry. One ironmaster has informed me that he is often obliged to import three or four grades of pig-iron in order to carry on operations. It will be impossible, I claim, to smelt the different grades of iron in the furnaces which it is proposed toerect in accordance with the scheme outlined before the Commission. Are we to impose a handicap of 12^ per cent, upon the users of iron throughout Australia, in order that we may protect another grade of iron, when the works are not able to produce the very grade upon, which we levy the duty? In Victoria the iron trade is in the most depressed condition. I make that statement as the result of personal inquiries. Shall we improve the condition of the iron workers of the Commonwealth by imposing a duty of 12J per cent, upon their raw material? effects of such a proceeding have been evidenced in Tasmania in connection with the jam trade. The duty which is levied upon sugar under our Tariff is equal to 40 per cent, upon the raw material of the jammakers, and it is working disaster to the fruit-growers in that State. of one part of the Commonwealth may not be the raw material of another part. Sugar is a natural product in Australia. Just as it is wrong to impose a duty upon one industry at the expense of another, so it is wrong to levy an impost upon iron which is used in every iron manufactory throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I have no desire to labour this matter. There are one or two points with which I propose to deal when the measure reaches Committee. The report, which was signed by the honourable member for Bland, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, the honourable and learned member for Illawarra; Mr Kirwan; Mr Winter Cooke, and the honourable member for Parramatta, statesWe, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through Parliament of the B ill for the payment of bonuses' by the Federal Government ipr the establishment of the iron industry within the Commonwealth. That was the opinion of the honourable member for Bland and of a great majority of the Labour members who sat behind him under discussion. Where are those honourable members now? They have sat like mummies and allowed the whole of the opposition to this measure to fall to others. I can just imagine the fiery orations of the honourable member for Darwini f the late Government had proposed to grant a bonus equal to £300,000 to any company. ""Boodler"" is the mildest term which he would have employed.

MrM c WILLIAMS I do not think that is a fair statement, so far as I am concerned. I have endeavoured to deal seriously with the Bill, and have offered The baneful no factious opposition to it. I hold, howeve^ that, as a representative of the people, it is my duty to carefully examine it, and that honourable members opposite, even if they are prepared to allow the measure to pass without discussion, have no right to stigmatize fair criticism as mere denunciation. I shall vote against the second_ reading of the B ill ; but if it be taken into Committee, it will be my duty to attempt to remove what I consider are some of its anomalies. I warn the House that if this Bill be passed, it will simply hand over £304,000 to a syndicate, which will receive practically £750,000 as the result of their venture, and that we shall thus create one of the most serious monopolies that has ever' existed in Australia. I am not one of those who believe that the State should interfere with private enterprise more than is absolutely necessary; but, rather than that the Bill should pass in its present form-especiall y if the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are to be swindled, and their money taken from them in this wayI should prefer to vote for the bounty going into the coffers of the State.

If one visits BrokenH ill or Mount Lyell to-day, he will see only two or three men at work in attendance on each furnace.

Honourable members will, therefore, see that any statement made by Mr Jamieson is the statement of an honest man, who is not likely to say what will not be borne out by facts.

No doubt one of the large Pittsburg furnaces produces a very great quantity of iron; but if we establish the iron industry in Australia, it will require several furnaces to produce tlie various grades of iron that we need. Large sums have already been spent in Australia in exploiting iron.

The second encouragement offered is that the investoris to be required to pay the wages which may be fixed. If the State were undertaking to pay a considerable sum to the industry, it might be quite reasonablfe that it should exercise some control over the wages payable. is another difficultya discouragement rather than an encouragement-and for that reason any investor would be acting infinitely more wisely if he entered upon this undertaking with his hands free, and without the aid of any Government bounty. The next encouragement offered is the fixing of selling prices. That is a most extraordinary provision. It is well known to gentlemen who have had anything to do with manufacturing, or mercantile pursuits, that under ordinary circumstances a firm cannot fix its own selling prices. Whatever control it may have over its individual industry, it is occasionally compelled by circumstances altogether outside itself, to accept prices which do not pay, and to take advantage of the market at other times to get larger profits than usual, to make up for the losses which have been incurred during the period that it was selling below cost. How, then, can the President of the Arbitration Court say what are reasonable prices ? He cannot follow the various fluctuations of the business. Probably he will not concern himI do not self with the past to the extent of recognising the loss which was made when -prices were below cost, and the necessity for fixing a correspondingly high price when that is obtainable. All that he will look at is the relation which the profit bears to the cost of any article. If I am he thinks that that profit is excessive he will cut it down without any reference to the losses which have been previously made. I am perfectly certain there is not a member of this House who would invest his capital in any industry if he knew that that principle was to be applied to it . Then we have another so-called encouragement, in that the works are to be transferable to a State upon the demand of that State, if they prove successful. If they are unsuccessful, we m*ay be sure that the States will leave the industry in the hands of its owners. If , however, through their enterprise and energy-throug h the possibility of getting cheap ore and converting it cheaply into metala profit can be obtained, then, after all the work has been undertaken by the company carrying on the business a State may step in and say, "" We will annex that business, make it our own property, and secure the profits which your skill and enterprise have rendered probable."" Now, I ask, is that an encourageThat ment? Yet the Bill is called a "" Billf o r the Encouragement of Manufactures."" l t must be remembered, too, that while all the States are to contribute to this bonus, and possibly to a renewal of it, one State can annex the whole industry, should it prove successful. The Commonwealth cannot take it over. It cannot do so under its Constitution. But after all the States may have contributed-ove r perhaps many years-to the support of the industry, one State can step in and secure all the advantages for itself.

To the men who do not care whether the industry is successful or otherwise so long as they get a good price for the shares which they receive for the flotation of the company, these restrictions do not matter at all. So far as I can see, that is the only respect in which the Bill would encourage investment. We have further to consider that we are lightly asked to commit ourselves to an expenditure of £304,000 in the shape of bounties when, as the Treasurer has pointed out, we are about to feel the pressure of the Braddon clause. Our margin of Customs revenue is being rapidly reduced, and we have other liabiliout any assistance shall receive a large ties in front of us, because the Departments still rerhaining to be taken over are for the most part spending rather than incomeearning branches of the Public Service.

Yet, despite all these facts we are proposing lightly to incur an expenditure of £304,000. events, the proposition has been submitted without much consideration. The financial aspect of the question has not been dealt with by the Minister in charge of the Bill. The honourable gentleman has not shown the House how the necessary funds for the purposes of the Bill are toi be prowords, "" except rivetted or cast,"" it seems vided, having regard to the increasing liability falling upon our restricted share of the Customs revenue. Another provision to which I am strongly opnosed is that jn which it is actually proposed to make a gift of money to certain individuals. For instance, provision is made in the schedule for bounties amounting to £50,000 for the manufacture of galvanized iron, wire-netting, and iron and steel tubes or pipes. As a matter of fact, these goods are already being produced in large quantities in the Commonwealth. I am informed that the wire-netting industrv in New South Wales is so busy. that orders cannot be booked, except for at least six months ahead, and that those engaged in it are actually receiving A x i .a ton, or nearly twice as much as they at one time accepted for their output.

Those engaged in the industry in New South Wales are working night and day, and, as I have said, cannot book orders, except for six months ahead. Yet it is deliberately proposed that those who have actually established this industry withproportion of the sum of £50,000 to be given away in the shape of bounties. Iron and steel pipes are also being made in considerable quantities in Australia, and yet those engaged in that industry are to have a share of this £50,000. Mr G.' B.

I can positively say, however, that although the wire-netting industry was not' very prosperous during the drought it is nowworking a full board, and at high rates.

I hope that the Minister will avail himself of an opportunity to decide what is really meant, arid to inform the House accordingly. I cannot conceive that the Bill will encourage legitimate investment in the iron industry. In other words, I do not think it will encourage investment in the enterprise with a desire to carry it through, it may be, years of struggling, to a successful issue. I can only conceive that it will be used, if I think it is made used at all, as a means of company flotation and over-capitalization on the London market. It will be said, "" Here we have £250,000, which will pay 5 per cent, for ten years on £500,000, and investors are therefore safe.""

246,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I had octo develop the iron industry by the granting of a bonus, in preference to the imposition of protective duties on the production of iron. I have to acknowledge a certain amount of reluctance in making this announcement, because I cannot help feeling that the B ill , as put before the House, is designed to do something more than promote the establishment of the iron industry. I believe that if the B ill had never been introduced the industry would have been established before now. It appears to me that I am placed on the horns of a dilemma. second reading, and the Bil l is rejected, the effect will be to hang up the operations of speculators who are now nibbling at the venture, and they will still hold off, in the hope that some future Parliament will pass a BonusB ill and assist them to embark upon the enterprise. I think, on the whole, that it would be better for us to agree to the second reading, and deal with the details of the Bil l in Committee, rather than to throw it out altogether, and so defer the establishment of the iron industry, probably for some years. I agree with a great deal that the Minister said in introducing the Bill as to the importance of the industry. The Minister hardly made out as strong a case as he might have done, for iron, as Mr Cobden has said, is the "" daily bread"" of all other industries. One can hardly conceive of an industry to which that remark will not apply. to be as free as possible Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes ; but there may be circumstances under which free traders like myself and 'the honourable and learned member would vote for the granting of a bonus rather than have heavy protective duties imposed. I gather from the reports of experts which have been placed before us that there are, in various parts of Australia, large deposits of iron ore which would pay commercially for working. When the States had each its own Tariff, it was impossible for any State to develop these natural resources; but the position is altered now that the whole market of Australia is open to the iron produced. I was hopeful that under these circumtances something would be done towards the establishment of a local iron industry, and the only reason I can think of for the delay which has taken place in the exploitation of our iron deposits is that the various syndicates, proprietaries, and persons interested in them are staying their hands in the sure and certain hope that something will be done by the Federal Government to assist them. I have said that I am prepared to encourage the starting of the iron industry by granting a bonus for the production of iron, but I am not prepared to give double assistance by voting also for fiscal protection, because that might have the effect of increasing the price of iron to the consuming industries of Australia to an extent greater than they might be able to bear. Whilst, therefore, I am disposed If I refuse to vote for the to support the second reading of the B ill , I intend, in Committee, to co-operate with others in making certain amendments in it , and, without entering into minute details, I will shortly give my reasons for taking that course. But, before doing so, I wish to address myself briefly to the general character of the measure. Although we have had to commend the drafting of most of the measures which have been submitted to us, I do not think that even those who are most favourably disposed to the present Government can commend the draftsmanship of this measure, because it is probably the most slipshod that was ever placed before any Parliament. The honourable member for North Sydney has already referred to two or three matters which have struck me in connection with the looseness of the provision under which a bond is to be exacted from the claimants of the bounty. As he has pointed out, clause 9 does not say how long that bond shall operate, or when it shall expire; and when the Minister was asked the question he was unable to answer it. Clause9 also provides that the person claiming any bounty shall pay to his workmen the highest wages paid for similar work, though no similar work is being done in Australia. If it were Otherwise, we should not be asked to pass this measure. The clause also provides for the charging of fair prices for the iron that is sold. That is a ridiculous provision if it is not intended to propose high protective duties which would give local manufacturers of iron the opportunity to fix their own prices. If the local manufacturers are subjected to the open competition of the world, that competition will fix fair prices; but if it is the intention of the Government. fo encourage the iron industry, not only by the granting of a bonus, but also by the imposition of a protective duty, there may be some reason for enacting by legislation the price at which locally-produced iron is to be",41,Chapman I T Is To Be
247,Mr Conroy,"Consequentl y iron oughtsold. Such a provision is, however, a most extraordinary one. The Minister of Trade and Customs is apparently so ill-informed as to the intentions of the Bill that he is not able to answer the simple question asked by the honourable member for North Sydney. week's notice of it. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes, , and the honourable gentleman's speech was an important business criticism of the Bill. Yet the Minister is not ready with an answer. bers will let me reply, I will tell them all that they wish to know. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The Minister should d'o what he can to assist the passing of the Bill, and I would remind him that I am a supporter of the measure. He could give us this information in two or three words. E-ither the bond is to last for an indefinite period, or-and this is the more natural conclusion-it is to terminate when the bounty ceases. But, apart from that, the draftsmanship of the Bill is shaky and prolix. Sir member should tell that to the Attorney General. I never attempt to draft measures. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I tell the honourable gentleman, as he is in charge of the Bill. Clause6 says that no bounty shall be paid on certain kinds of iron after certain dates, and the schedule contains a similar provision, set forth in different language. When the Caliph Omar was asked what was to be done with the library at Alexandria, he said that if it contained anything which was not in the Koran it was dangerous, and should be destroyed, and that if it contained anything which was in the Koran it was useless, and should be destroyed. SoI say, with regard to clause 6, that if it contains provisions differing in their language from those in the schedule they should be struck out, because otherwise difficulties of interpretation will arise. For instance, clause 6 says thatNo bounty shall be authorized to Be paid on(a) Fig iron, puddled bar iron, or steel made evil way of stimulating manufacture than after the first day of January, One tEousand nine hundred and eleven. While the schedule saysFig iron made from Australian ore ist January, 1911. Unde r clause 6 the bounty may be paid on p i g iron made from imported or from scrap iron. There are other small differences between clause 6 and the schedule, which may give rise to difficulties of interpretation. If in clause 6 the draftsman had adopted language similar to that of clause 5 these difficulties would have been avoided. Clause5 provides thatThe total amount of the bounties authorized to be paid in respect of any particular class of goods shall not exceed the amount set out in the third column of the schedule' opposite the description of that class of goods. Those words are very precise, definite, and business like, and their meaning cannot be misunderstood. Clause6 would have been much clearer, and more succinct, if it had provided thatNo bounties shall be authorized to be paid in respect to any particular class of goods made after the date set out in the fourth column of the schedule opposite the description of that class of goods. Such a provision would have given those who may wish to claim bounties, those who will be called upon to administer the measure, and those who may be called upon to interpret it, a clear, definite, and precise instruction as to the intention of the Legistotal amount of bounty which may be authorized for goods of class 2 is £50,000, and that class is made up of galvanized iron, wire netting, and iron and steel tubes or pipes not more than six inches in internal diameter. The rate of bounty on such goods is 10 per cent, on their value. It might happen, however, that A. might claim the £50,000 on galvanized iron, B. on wire netting, and C. on iron and steel tubes. There is nothing in the Bill to say how in such a case the bounties should be apportioned. Of course, it is apparent that the difficulty can be got over by the introduction of a clause providing that if the claims to the bounty are greater than the total amount provided for the class of goods for which a certain sum is voted, the distribution shall be pro rata. Then, again, it is provided that £ 8 each shall be given for the first 500 reapers and binders manufactured. Free-trader as I am, I look upon the giving of this bounty as, at any rate, a less is the imposition of protective duties. I should be prepared to support that, and also, as a common-sense business man, to . . . . give some little further extension of the period. This Bill cannot become law until about the end d|f the current year, and those who desired to secure the bonus",42,Chapman I T Is To Be

249,Sir William Lyne,"If honourable memwould have only six months within which to do so. Unless those who support the Bill have some firm "" up their sleeves'' openmouthed and ready to secure the bonus, it must be admitted that this is a ridiculous provision. Six months would be too short a period within which to expect persons with the necessary capital, brains and knowledge to start the manufacture of reapers and binders, and earn the £4,000 which is offered by way of bonus. To this extent, I think the Bill is badly drawn, and that some provision better calculated to stimulate the industry should be inserted Lithgow. in the Bill. So far as galvanized iron is concerned, the manufacturers already enjoy the benefit of fair protection, and the galvanized wire-netting business has been established under conditions of perfect freedom, so far as the Tariff is concerned, and is now being carried on with the greatest success. The company which is operating in Sydney is so inundated with orders that one cannot very well conceive of a more successful enterprise. Therefore, it appears to me to be absurd to propose to make them an absolute gift of a large sum of money. Therefore, when the schedule is under consideration, I shall be glad to co-operate with those who desire to excise that provision. I do not think the honbe made here at 35s. a ton. In giving that figure orable member for North Sydney was entirely correct when he spoke upon the subject of the iron pipes provided for in class 2 of the schedule. Although we are making cast and riveted pipes on a very large scale, and the industry is carried on under conditions which' are highly creditable to the manufacturers, I take it that the Bill is intended to encourage the production of a Class of pipes which is not at present manufactured here. I refer to the smaller kinds of pipes for water, steam, Australia at a very low cost indeed. Apand gas purposes, under six inches in diameter, or what are known as drawn pipes. The Bill is badly drafted, because the de1 finitions are not sufficiently clear; and I think that the intention should be clearly expressed. Turning again to the production of crude iron-puddle and bar iron -I should like to again point to the report of the Bonus Commission, which contains some very valuable information. I think honourable members should carefully study that. report before they proceed to vote the large amounts proposed in aid of the iron industry. Mr Sandford, who has probably the widest experience of any man in our community upon this subject, stated Mr G. P. Edwards. most distinctly, not once but twice, and in reply to very definite and specific questionsthat he could produce pig iron at Lithgow jfor 35s. per ton. His statement was most definite, because the honourable and learned 1 member for Corinella questioned him as. follows:I am not quite sure that I understand what youmean when you say that pig iron could be produced at Lithgow at 35sper ton-is that taking, everything into account? Mr Sandford's reply wasI give that as an estimate of the net cost at That is very definite, and it seems to methat here we have an absolute stumblingblock in the way of any proposal to grant a bonus for the production of iron. If we can produce pig iron in Australia at 35s. per ton, what reason can be advanced for granting a bonus such as that now proposed? I am prepared to admit that I think Mr Sandford made a mistake. He has corrected that mistake in a certain way,, and has communicated his ideas to a reporter of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. whose report is published in the Age of Monday last. Mr Sandford saidA good deal had been made of his statement before the Bonus Commission that pig iron could he had only the net cost in view. He did not reckon interest on capital, about 5s. a ton; depreciation and redemption, equal to about another 5s. a ton; freight to Sydney, which was our local 1 market and the market for the shipping trade, 8s. 6d. a ton, besides other incidentals, which would bring the cost to 61s. a ton. At the time Mr Sandford gave evidencebefore the Commission, he Was also communicating his ideas to persons outside, and' it seemed to be his idea,, in furthering the objects of those interested in the iron trade, to prove that iron could be produced in parently, he afterwards came to the conclusion that he had overleaped himself, and fallen on the other side, and that it was required of him that he should show that others matters had to be taken into consideration before the real cost of iron production could be arrived at. Under Mr Sandford's new estimate he claims 5s. per ton for interest. I think it is a well-knownaxiom in political economy that interest in such a case as this would mean profit, because either one of two things must happenEither the company must go into the business with subscribed capital of the amount necessary upon which no interest would have to be paid, or it must borrow money, upon which it would have to pay interest. The allowance made for interest must therefore be regarded as profit, or partly profit. Coming back to the report of the Commission, Mr Sandford stated that he could erect a blast-furnace in New South Wales for £100,000, and that he could produce up to 1,200 tons per week of crude iron. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, .that he could produce 1,000 tons per week. An allowance of 5s. per ton for interest would yield £.13,000 per annum, and that amount would represent a return of 13 per cent, upon the. capital outlay of £100,000. That would' be independent of any bonus. that if those who are engaged iri many other industries in Australia could feel assured that they would obtain such a return as 13 per cent.., they would be induced to launch out much more extensively than they -do at present. makes a most extraordinary claim. wants to make an allowance of another 5s. per ton for depreciation or redemption. Speaking as one who has had a good deal to do with laying out plants and building -factories, I must say that. I never heard the word "" redemption'"""" used before in this connection. One can easily see that something more than depreciation is provided for when it is remembered that £13,000 per annum is to be devoted to redemption -and depreciation. If Mr Sandford could legitimately claim these two allowances, each amounting to £13,000 per annum, the company engaged in the work would not only be able to make a very satisfactory profit, but would within a very short space of time entirely redeem the whole of its capital. This would be entirely exclusive of any bonus. that it costs 8s. 6d. per ton to convey pig iron from Lithgow to Sydney, and I will assume that the average cost of conveying the iron from Lithgow to the various central ports of Australia would average, say, 15s. per ton. It must be admitted that, 'in dealing with large quantities of material, such as would be handled in this case, low rates of freight could be secured. Adding. 15s. per ton to the ios. per Bon which Mr Sandford claims for interest, -depreciation, and redemption, we arrive at a total of 25s., in addition to the 35s. per -ton which represents the cost of production at Lithgow, or an aggregate of £ 3 per ton. Mr Sandford says that iron is being landed in Sydney at present at £ 3 is. per ion; other persons quote the average price as more closely approaching £ 4 per ton. I think, therefore, honourable members will see that Mr Sandford's ownfiguresshow that we should be very careful before we consent to Vote the large sums of money which jt is proposed to expend under this Bill by way of bounties. Nobody is more desirous than I am of seeing Australia make use of her vast deposits of iron ore. But we should be careful that we do not pay too much for our whistle. The Government have made no financial provision whatever for the payment of these large bounties. They are plunging into the experiment almost blindfold, I can only say and consequently it behoves us to be extremely cautious when we come to deal with the details of the measure in Committee. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, reserving to myself the right, in Committee, to reduce some of the proposed bounties, to eliminate others, and Mr Sandford then generally to hedge round its provisions in He such a way as tp afford less chance than now exists for litigation, and to minimize the evils of a measure which has been badly drawn and badly devised. journed.
