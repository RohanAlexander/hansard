Thursday, 2 December 2004 ----Jagajaga Electorate: Schools Competition Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.40 a.m.)-RecentlyI held a competition in my electorate inviting grade 3 and 4 students to illustrate through a variety of methods-including stories, poems, drawings-the best things about their school. It was the most fantastic thing. I was flooded with entries from children right around the electorate who were just bursting to say what was special about their school. We had the office windows in Burgundy Street plastered with all these colourful drawings, and it became a great drawcard in the main street of Heidelberg, with everybody coming and reading the wonderful things that local children had to say about their school. One of the lovely ones was a recipe for the best school that one of the children made up, including fruit salad and friendship for dessert. We had pictures of friends holding hands and playing games, maps of their schools, cartoon storyboards-they were pretty impressivehistories of their schools and some lovely inventive poems. The children had fantastic things to say about their teachers, ‘Our teachers are the best,’ and their school grounds-‘I love all the playgrounds,’ you can just hear the kids saying, ‘They are cool.’ They also had fantastic things to say about their lessons, excursions and camp trips and, probably most significantly of all, about the importance of their school friends to them. One of the great things about this competition was how it showed the wonderful strength of all the schools in the electorate. I want to thank and congratulate all the children and, of course, their teachers and parents for encouraging them to participate in the competition. I want to congratulate the following students for their winning entries: Kardelen Kara, Eltham College; Perri Chequer, Eltham North Primary; Claire Pitts, Greensborough Primary; Vanessa Towler, Nikita Hall, Madison Sheils, Laura Farmer, Damian D’Angelo, Isaac Hill, Ryan Tagliabue and Charlotte Dawson, Heidelberg Primary; Eleanor Lamb, Ivanohoe Primary; Daniela Avramovic, Macleod College; the Olympic Village Primary School-this primary school is located right at the site of the 1956 Olympic Village; Kathy Nguyen, St PiusX Primary; Jessica Capotosto, St Martin of Tours Primary; Lily Crimmins, Streeton Primary; and Meghna Kadalbajoo, Viewbank Primary. I also had the great fortune of going to two outstanding concert performances by two high schools last week, St Helena and Eltham High. What an enormous pleasure it was to hear the great musical talents of those students, and I want to congratulate them as well. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Environment electorate of La Trobe. Weeds have infiltrated the Dandenong Ranges and, in particular, Sherbrooke Forest. In Sherbrooke Forest there are 803 hectares of forest. Of most concern throughout the forest are English holly, which has taken over large areas; cestrum; English ivy, which chokes our tree ferns and even the mighty mountain ash; and wandering jew, which clogs our creeks and reduces habitat for the local platypus.

193,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (9.43 A.m.),"I would like to discuss weeds today, especially in myHow did the weeds get here in the first place? I just have to go back to my time at Ferny Creek Primary School, when a local nursery came around and gave us a great little plant which they said would be a fine creeper for local gardens. I went home and, like many students at the school, gave it to my parents. Thirty years on, wandering jew is one of the main causes of problems in our local creeks. Similarly, if we look at some of our local nurseries we see that they sell English ivy and wandering jew in hanging baskets and English holly and cestrum. For the last 12 months I have worked with Friends of Clematis Creek. I must acknowledge the efforts of Priscilla Wall and Rosemary, who have dedicated all their efforts to cleaning up Clematis Creek. I would also like to thank other people such as Rod Evans, Trevor Tatham, Heidi and Lauren Gallagher and even a Democrat candidate for the federal election, Tony Holland, for helping to clean up the area. On 24 NovemberI arranged a meeting with Vivian Freshwater and Bill Incoll from Friends of the Sherbrooke Forest. This group has been doing fantastic work for the last 28 years. Also present was Karen Alexander from the Johns Hills Landcare Group and Barbara Setchell from the Weeds Working Party with the local shire. All these individuals and their organisations have been doing a fantastic job for a number of years and without their efforts the weed problem in the Dandenong Ranges would be a lot worse. Locally, we have decided to work together to address the problem. One of the initiatives we plan is that later this year I will put out a calendar which will list six weeds that are causing problems in the local area. I will be asking residents of La Trobe to consider removing these weeds from their gardens, as once they purchase a plant and it moves on into the forest it causes a lot of harm and takes a lot of time to remove. As I said before, it will be a great local initiative with me and all the environmental groups, the community and the council working together. Aviation: Ansett Australia tion that still exists in relation to entitlements for Ansett workers. With Adelaide airport smack-bang in the middle of the electorate of Hindmarsh, it is not surprising that there were a great many Ansett workers living in the area when Ansett went broke in 2001. Although that was more than three years ago, the issue is still very much alive for those who lost their jobs and entitlements back then. During the campaign and since I was elected, I have been approached by several workers who are still distressed that their entitlements have not been paid. There were 16,000 workers in Australia who were directly affected by the collapse of Ansett and another 45,000 who were in associated supply and service industries. There were around 3,000 Ansett employees in South Australia and many of them came to see me in 2001 when it became obvious that employees would not be receiving their entitlements. Their stories were heart-wrenching and the circumstances in which they found themselves were just plain unfair. Many of these people still contact me to this day. These were Ansett workers who had spent decades with the company and then found themselves left high and dry. These were people who had worked hard, who paid their contributions towards their superannuation. They did the right thing: they planned for their retirement so they would not be a burden on future governments. They made plans for holidays after they retired and for improvements to their homes. I know of one couple approaching retirement who had just taken out a mortgage for their home renovations and had planned to pay it off when they reMAIN COMMITTEE",117,Statements By Members
194,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.46 A.m.),"I rise to speak today on the appalling situatired. They suddenly found they had no way of paying it off. Many workers are now in lower paid jobs or working casually or they have retired on incomes far less than they had worked towards. After intense lobbying in 2001 by the opposition, the federal government imposed the $10 ticket tax to help recoup workers’ entitlements. But workers have still not seen their full entitlements. The tax raised almost $300 million but workers are still owed about $210 million and the government has chosen to use close to $100 million of the money raised through the ticket tax on airport security rather than on paying Ansett workers’ entitlements. The public did not pay their $10 levy for airport security. They expected the government to deal with that anyway. It was never called an ‘airport security levy’ and there would have been an outcry if it had been back then. It was always known as the Ansett ticket tax. The people who have been hardest hit by the Ansett collapse are those who were approaching retirement. As I mentioned earlier, many still have not found jobs. They have retired on lower incomes. They have not gone on the holidays they planned. They have not paid off their mortgages and they have not done the home renovations they had planned earlier. The federal government argues that an eight-week payout is somehow a good deal, but workers make the point that, for those who had been with the company for decades, an eight-week redundancy payout simply is not good enough. Ryan Electorate: Vandalism of War Memorial uniquely and ideally set in the peaceful surrounds of Brisbane city. It is very centrally located. ANZAC Square is dedicated to Australia’s military heritage and the shrine of remembrance, with the eternal flame, is its focus point. The shrine was erected as an enduring memorial to Queenslanders who died in World War I. The flame has burned since 1930, and ANZAC Square has played a feature role in very special ceremonies, including of course ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day. I want to speak in the parliament today about an incident that took place last week which I think was absolutely disgraceful. It concerned two visitors to this country, two young men from Europe, who were involved in shocking acts of vandalism. They desecrated this wonderful memorial that we have in Brisbane city. I want to take this opportunity in the parliament today to thank all the residents of Ryan who have contacted me to encourage me to speak out very strongly against these two young men. I also want to thank in particular one of my constituents, Mr Colin Wright, from Kenmore, who was moved to recount to me that both his brothers had died in World War II and that he was particularly devastated by this act of vandalism by the young man from Poland and his colleague from Germany. I want to place on the parliamentary record my outrage that two visitors to this country would take it upon themselves to engage in conduct that really smacks of ignorance and causes great offence to Australians generally and in particular to the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the values that this country cherishes. The two men-the German chap, Andreas Benjamin Porzelt, and the chap from Poland, Robert Weimann-Wojcik-were arrested at 4 a.m. last Friday, 26 November, after taking photographs of themselves burning books on the flame while also dancing semi-naked in army fatigues. Their actions ended up causing the eternal flame to be extinguished. Despite this horrendous, offensive act, these two tourists were fined only $700 each. I want to express MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Statements By Members
195,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (9.49 A.m.),"The ANZAC Square war memorial in Brisbane is very strongly my absolute horror at this very trivial punishment of a fine of $700 each. They also burnt a wreath that had been laid earlier on to commemorate the Australians who were killed when HMAS Sydney was sunk by a German ship in 1941. The wreath was laid to honour the memory of 645 Australians who were killed. I want to express to the parliament my horror at that penalty. (Time expired) Petrol Prices Household Debt sues which are of great importance for many residents in the electorate of Oxley, and they are petrol prices and household debt. Presently, Australian oil companies are paying less for crude oil, yet savings are not being passed on to consumers at the petrol bowser. The Australian market price per barrel of crude oil has decreased by 17 per cent since 1 November, yet petrol prices at the bowser have dropped by less than 3.6 per cent in the same period of time. The price of crude oil accounts for around 90 per cent of the product cost of petrol and is the primary factor in refined petrol price fluctuations. The drop in crude oil prices, combined with the Australian dollar being at an eight-year high in US terms-another factor in price fluctuations-should put downward pressure on the price for consumers at the bowser. Despite these factors, though, the price to consumers has remained relatively static since prices of crude oil started dropping early last month. Oil companies are continually blaming rising petrol prices on the rising cost of crude oil. They are quick to react to an increase, yet when costs come down it seems that it is the consumer who continues to bear that cost. Consumers have been paying well over $1 a litre for several months now. It is about time that savings from cheaper oil prices were passed on to consumers. My question is: what is the Howard government doing about all this? The answer is simply: nothing at all. The price of petrol, which is clearly not reflective of the current cost of crude oil, should be investigated, including the practices of the major oil companies in controlling the price and the market. The second issue that I want to raise is one that I think is close to many people’s hearts and is becoming the talk around kitchen tables, and that is household debt under the rule of the Howard government. The dream of home ownership remains further out of reach for many Australian families, with new data showing that average monthly repayments have skyrocketed during the past three years in particular. Home loan repayments have gone up by a massive 46 per cent over the past three years. Repayment increases have far outstripped earning increases of just 15 per cent during the same period of time. This fall in housing affordability during the Howard government reign has placed financial pressure on Australian families, including many in the electorate of Oxley. Many families have suffered a dramatic increase in the proportion of family income devoted to just meeting that one particular cost, their home loan repayments. In addition, Australia now has higher interest rates than any other OECD country except New Zealand. Incredibly in this time of so called low interest rates, we have the highest interest rates of any OECD country except New Zealand. The Howard government’s budgetary and fiscal policy has failed to put downward pressure on interest rates and the Reserve Bank is talking about the next move on interest rates being up, not down.

(Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Townsville City Council and Thuringowa City Council lia’s largest tropical city. That city is Townsville. But Townsville is actually two cities: there is the city of Townsville and the city of Thuringowa, which most people do not know about. There are two local authorities, Townsville City Council and Thuringowa City Council. The relationship of each of the two city councils with the federal government is quite different. It is chalk and cheese; it is very stark. The Thuringowa City Council, through the leadership of its mayor, Les Tyrell, has an extraordinarily close relationship with the federal government. Les is available any time, night or day. If Les has a problem he will ring me and if I have a problem I will ring Les. I can always talk to the Thuringowa City Council. Not so, bizarrely, with the Townsville City Council, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, to talk to Mayor Tony Mooney. The council does not talk to me and I am unable to easily communicate with the Townsville City Council. That makes it difficult for the residents of Townsville City and it makes it difficult for me as the federal member. The latest incident that has occurred has been a problem that Townsville City Council apparently has with federal black spot funding. Instead of picking up the phone and talking to me and asking why this has occurred, the council chooses to talk to me through the pages of the local newspaper. My message to Townsville City Council is that I do not accept that. I am not going to talk to the Townsville City Council through the pages of the local newspaper. It is very important that there be a good relationship between the councils and the federal government because it is the federal government that can deliver many benefits to Townsville. Currently I think we are heading in the direction of Townsville missing out and Thuringowa getting a much better deal. In the Townsville City Council area the reason it is important that they liaise with the federal member is that there are some pretty big issues the city is facing, issues like the orderly development of the city, the city gateway project, very significant issues on Magnetic Island, the establishment of an Australian technical college and the direction of James Cook University and how that will develop in Townsville City. These are major issues, and I ask the Townsville City Council to understand that they should be working with their federal member. I am very happy to work with them in the interests of the city. When I am elected I do not wear a Liberal badge-I am the member for everybody-and I expect the Townsville City Council to liaise with me and for us to work together productively in the interests of Townsville City. der 193, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

198,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing or“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its failure to take the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for both our farmers and our rivers seriously; (2) its failure to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency allowing the COAG water reform process of 1994 to stall, and failing to provide any environmental flows for the Murray in over 8 years; (3) its failure to adopt Labor’s National Water Policy Framework, and ensure that Commonwealth funds are directed towards securing environmental flows; and (4) its plan to fund the Australian Water Fund by taking money which the States have earmarked for essential services such as schools and hospitals”. find over $100 million for useless advertising in the lead-up to this election but cannot cap the bores in the Great Artesian Basin. This Prime Minister can find $1 billion for a destructive war in Iraq yet raids competitive payments to the states-money already earmarked for hospitals and schools-to establish the Australian water fund. This pedestrian, visionless government has squandered years and billions of dollars in misplaced priorities while this important issue remains largely unaddressed. For many years now, in my shadow ministerial capacity, I have been alerting the rural sector to the need to come to terms, sooner rather than later, with the climate change issue. Shortly after becoming shadow minister for agriculture in 1998, I made reference to the matter in a speech in the House on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998. I made further reference to the issue in a speech on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1999 and in speeches to the National Farmers Federation AGM, the Seed Industry Association and the Marcus Oldham College in 2001. My most recent warning to the sector on climate change was to the rice growers conference this year, at which I listed four areas of challenge that I felt would take up a great deal of my time should I become the minister for agriculture. I referred to the need for the rural sector to consider how it should respond to the challenges posed by climate change. I acknowledged the statement made in a keynote speech to the National Press Club this year by NFF president, Peter Corish, on the need for the rural sector to respond positively to the issue of climate change. So the issue of climate change is very much on the table for detailed consideration and response by the farm sector. In my public statements to and private discussions with the rural sector on the impacts of climate change on farmers and their communities over a long period of time, I have consistently stressed that alongside the threats to farming there are also extraordinary opportunities. According to available evidence, the sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Regrettably, however, there is a paucity of concrete research on the net contribution made by the sector. The opportunities to which I referred are quite substantial and range across the production of alternative fuels, wind power and farm forestry, just to identify a few potential areas for the sector. Very important things have to happen to enable the sector to effectively position itself to exploit these new opportunities. Firstly, there has to be a commitment to further research in this area and better coordination of the resources that are currently being employed by public agencies such as CSIRO, state government agencies and educational institutions such as our universities. Secondly, there must be a commitment by government and its bureaucracies to MAIN COMMITTEE",121,National Water Commission Bill 2004
199,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (9.59 A.m.),"It is a sad fact that the Prime Minister canmore effectively support the process of innovation, both on farm and in the production of new products and the development of new processes, to ensure that Australia is able to exploit the value adding opportunities that spin off the commercialisation process and to ensure that in the long term the farm sector is able to effectively counter the inevitable criticism, informed or not, that will come of the sector’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Of course, the consequences of not addressing the issue now for farm production systems have already been well documented. The increased severity and occurrence of drought is but one direct consequence of our neglect, and it is in this context that the water debate takes on an even greater urgency. What we have to do in the water area is no great rocket science, as we have been aware of it for years. The problem has been getting the Commonwealth to recognise it and getting all the levels of government working to meet obvious objectives. For instance, we have a huge task in repairing and enhancing our water delivery infrastructure to rural communities and to farms. Once again it was a Labor government in Victoria and a Labor opposition in Canberra that recognised the urgent need to build the Wimmera Mallee pipeline. As a community we need to conserve the water already available to both urban and rural communities. That will involve a massive effort in the infrastructure area and changing urban attitudes to recycling and reusing water. Our harvesting practices need to be improved and their impact clearly evaluated and our irrigation practices need to be drastically improved. It is here that we need to accommodate a little bit of left-field thinking and innovation to reap the full benefits from the innovative effort. A lot of good research and new ideas are coming from the private sector on the water issue. I commend the Farmhand Foundation and its private and public sector partners for their excellent publication Talking Water: An Australian Guidebook for the 21st Century. It is a practical, easy-to-ready publication that not only clearly identifies the problem but offers practical solutions to it. I also commend the Pratt Foundation for its involvement in detailed research on solutions to the crisis. I also commend an excellent and quite different contribution from Colin Austin in his book Water, Wit and Wisdom. It may not be everyone’s cup of tea as far as a good read goes, but Austin highlights the need for some real innovation and left-field thinking in confronting the crisis and developing solutions. Austin argues passionately and with some humour-although his message is a serious one-for Australia to develop a system of sustainable irrigated agriculture and to exploit the technology spin-offs to create wealth in rural communities in particular. In the public sector, CSIRO has engaged one of its national research flagship programs, Water for a Healthy Country, an important cross-disciplinary program, into the use of water and its distribution. It is clear that we must now employ the smartest science and the best innovation capacity to get on top of the issue in the national interest. (Time expired) ment of a National Water Commission, I would like to relate to the House my direct experience with the water supply in the Shoalhaven, in my electorate of Gilmore. I find it appropriate to take this course because it demonstrates why I feel strongly about this issue and, besides, previous members have already alluded to the scarcity of water on this continent and why it should be husbanded. I do not intend to go over old ground by saying that water in the near future could become more precious than gold. My statement will describe the impacts on MAIN COMMITTEE",122,National Water Commission Bill 2004
200,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (10.05 A.m.),"By way of reinforcing my support for the establishthe Shoalhaven community as result of the recommendations from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River Management Forum. It is a package that subordinates the needs of the Shoalhaven to those of the Sydney area and ignores the facts to ensure the recommendations are adopted to the detriment of the Shoalhaven. But first some background. Shoalhaven City Council is responsible for the provision of reticulating drinking water to 45 towns and villages throughout the city. The area has historically experienced high growth rates above the state average. The majority of water is harvested from the Shoalhaven River and council has undertaken a range of initiatives to ensure the impact on the river is minimised with a balanced growth rate. Prior to the construction of Tallowa Dam in the 1970s at the junction of Kangaroo and Shoalhaven rivers, Shoalhaven City Council was given assurances by the state government that the construction of the dam would not impact on the community’s access to water from the Shoalhaven River. In 1993 Shoalhaven City Council, in conjunction with the Department of Land and Water Conservation, undertook a long-term water supply strategy to investigate the needs of the city for the next 30 to 50 years. As a result of the strategy report, a number of initiatives were undertaken to ensure the security of long-term water supply and the minimisation of the environmental impact on the Shoalhaven River. Some of the initiatives were: (1) a demand management strategy which saw the reduction from 300 kilolitres per tenement per annum to 250 kilolitres per tenement per annum over the next 10 years; (2) a significant reuse of sewage effluent; and, (3) the introduction of an environmental flow-one of the first in Australia-for the Shoalhaven River, based on extensive environmental studies and a full environmental impact statement, including community consultation. The demand management strategy has been extremely successful and has seen the reduction of water consumption per tenement well below the targets due to a range of demand management initiatives. The reuse scheme has seen 80 per cent of the reclaimed water from the northern treatment plants being recycled during the first few years. An extensive program of consultation was undertaken and every conceivable aspect was explored before the reuse scheme was finally implemented in stages. Residents were even prepared to pay, and are today paying, an extra levy to see the project through rather than see the water wasted into the ocean. Sixteen large farming properties were used to pump effluent over grazing land, thereby reducing ocean outfall to the barest minimum. The scheme is so successful that it is being considered by the neighbouring Kiama Council. The council areas of Wingecarribee and Shoalhaven have been receiving exceptional circumstances funding for the last two years. Had it not been for the vision and foresight of the Shoalhaven City Council and its reuse of effluent we would have been in an even worse situation in this drought. So water and the Prime Minister’s $2 billion Australian water fund will be closely monitored to see how, where and when we can gain benefit from it. In comparison, the state government has decided that growth in industry and business in Sydney is okay but neglects to mention the Shoalhaven’s two per cent-plus growth rate, and there is no mention of the number of existing businesses and industries that rely on a reliable supply of water now, not to mention the need for future growth and development. In fact, the plans of many businesses intending to move to the Shoalhaven have been frustrated because they cannot get permission to use water for their industries. MAIN COMMITTEE We will not and cannot be dictated to by a state government that has no real plan to harness its own water consumption or change its practices to encourage conservation. What the Shoalhaven City Council has done with the environmental flow has ensured a minimised impact on the Shoalhaven River during extremely long periods of drought. In August 2001, the Department of Land and Water Conservation formulated town water entitlements for local government water authorities throughout New South Wales. This advice will limit water extraction from the Shoalhaven to exclude growth for commerce and industry-meaning, of course, jobs. It is noted that the extraction from the Shoalhaven River to Sydney and the Illawarra will now increase significantly to allow growth of industry and commerce, creating future jobs for the greater Sydney area-never mind about the Shoalhaven and our growth. There are no plans for the state government to reduce water consumption for Sydney. It hardly seems fair. There appears to be enormous inequity, particularly in light of the initiatives undertaken by Shoalhaven City Council to ensure long-term planning and environmental management. These include a full environmental impact statement, community consultation and a development approval. In March 2004, the final report of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River Management Forum was released. It indicates that, although community consultation with stakeholders and extensive environmental studies were undertaken in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, no work was undertaken with the Shoalhaven community or on the Shoalhaven River. Despite this fact, the report indicates that the environmental flow at Warragamba Dam should be in the 95th percentile, which is 40 megalitres per day-similar to the existing environmental findings on the Shoalhaven. The report, surprisingly, recommends that the environmental flow for the Shoalhaven River should be increased to the 80th percentile-that is, 372 megalitres per day below which the Shoalhaven will be prohibited from extracting. This recommendation will have a devastating effect on the Shoalhaven community, and it would have seen the Shoalhaven unable to extract from the river for nearly 300 days during 2002. Quite clearly, the city would have run out of water. We would have run out of water because we are not allowed to build any more dams that impinge on national parks and cannot store water beyond the existing storages-just two dams, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. Let me explain. The report concludes that the improved transfers from Shoalhaven for Sydney and the Illawarra may require the Shoalhaven community to build another off-stream storage dam even for the current population. This is now impractical due to the number of national parks created in the Shoalhaven in recent times, eliminating most off-stream storage sites. It should be noted that the Shoalhaven community currently has the ability to pump 90 megalitres per day-the daily demand is 60 megalitres per day. However, the Sydney Catchment Authority has the ability to pump 2,000 megalitres per day. The Shoalhaven community, although a minor extractor of water from the Shoalhaven compared to the Sydney Catchment Authority, developed a strategy in conjunction with the state government based on its reliance on the Shoalhaven River. The Shoalhaven City Council has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that water resource security has been planned for the next 50 years with minimal impact on the environment. Despite the long-term planning and environmental management, the Shoalhaven community appears to be extremely impacted by the recommendations from the HawkesburyNepean River Management Forum-without community consultation, without recognising MAIN COMMITTEE any environmental work undertaken by the council and without undertaking any environmental work by the expert panel. Council seeks to ensure that the current environmental flow regime is maintained for the Shoalhaven community extraction; that the state government maintains its commitment to the water entitlement to the Shoalhaven community when the Tallowa Dam was constructed; that the environmental health of the river will not be impacted by increased extraction to Sydney; and that full community consultation is undertaken with the Shoalhaven community. That is why we need a national water management strategy and why a National Water Commission would fill that role-so we will no longer be robbed with impunity by a very parochial state Labor government. I am grateful to the Shoalhaven City Council for providing me with this information and congratulate them on their vision and professionalism in securing our water supplies as best they can. They are conserving, planning, managing and delivering in a way that the New South Wales state government would do well to emulate, instead of exploiting someone else’s hard work. The Gilmore electorate will certainly become involved in the Water Wise Communities program. Our area is well-known for its tourism and recreational facilities, providing many millions of dollars towards the local economy. We are already heading the way of proposals outlined in the National Water Commission Bill 2004. Already much is being done in the area of acid soil salinity and this government has assisted in each of our programs. Therefore, I applaud the fact that this area will also be addressed by the commission-not to mention our many rivers and estuaries. The opposition in this House can only whinge about what should be done with the National Water Commission Bill. Why aren’t they hands on? If they came and had a look at what is happening in country areas and saw the grief that is going on then they might understand. This is a significant piece of legislation which I can wholeheartedly endorse. There is no doubt that a coordinated approach is necessary. We have had far too many instances of duplication of standards and, as a result, inefficiencies and arguments-remember the rail gauges and the problems they brought to interstate freight and transport. Without this level of intervention we could well still be fighting over water resources as they dry up. There are many great ideas out there and it is only right that they are given a chance, not by some sort of hotchpotch approach on a state-by-state basis but overall, in a coordinated fashion, so that efficiencies are optimised. We do not want to replicate the rail gauge approach. What we want to do is approach this in a professional and business like manner. It is the role of government to provide the leadership. The National Water Commission is the instrument by which this can be achieved. Yes, there will be detractors and doubting Thomases. Already we are seeing this on the other side. But I feel positive. I have seen what the Carr Labor government has to offer and it is just not enough. This is not an insignificant investment but it is a wise one. This week the unseasonable heatwave heralded a warning that we should be preparing. As our population grows, even with a stable weather pattern our consumption will continue to rise. We need to change our thinking about the way we do business with water, how we use it, how we waste it and how we can reuse it. An attitudinal change is needed. I believe that creating a central coordinating agency is just the first step in modifying our wasteful behaviour. MAIN COMMITTEE Isn’t it ironic that this government, which has been condemned by the environmentalists for not being green enough, is introducing a significant and innovative initiative to tackle one of the big environmental issues confronting this country! What have we heard from the opposition? Have they come out and applauded the government on this initiative? Let them be judged on their silence. Worse still was the tirade of hot air from the member for Corio last night. There was nothing positive, just 15 minutes of harping and carping. In fact, I was amazed at how little he had to say. I certainly expected more from him. The member for Batman, with his angry gestures and mad-like expression, called the government corrupt. What has the opposition done to achieve any positive approach? The public does not appreciate this type of behaviour. If we are truly confronting water conservation in this country then we are confronting global warming and preparing for it. The bill is a wise policy and a wise response. I commend the bill to the House. Commission Bill 2004. I will start off by saying that South Australians are generally more acutely aware of the need to protect our water supplies and they have been aware for longer than many people in the eastern states. Being at the bottom of the river means that we have been able to see just how serious things can get. In South Australia the condition of the Murray River is already deadly serious. Half of the Murray’s native fish species have been lost; 90 per cent of the Coorong’s migratory bird species are gone; Murray crayfish, which many people would remember, have gone entirely from South Australia; and the Murray wetlands are dying. Our river red gums have been killed by salinity and urgent action is being taken to reverse that trend through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission’s Living Murray program. In the last year, the rate of death of our river red gums has increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Action is needed, and it is needed immediately. This is not an issue which can wait for slow political processes. It is not an issue to play games with. The implementation of the National Water Initiative, which I think is a positive initiative, is tied to the states resigning the agreement, even though the payments for the initiative are to be funded through competition payments that would have previously been allocated to the states for things like schools and hospitals. The Murray-Darling is in urgent need of attention and I see the National Water Commission as a part of many important steps that are now being taken to protect the river. However, I would like clarification from the government on how it sees the relationship between the new National Water Commission and the long standing Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission needs to be able to carry out its work on the Living Murray program and the Living Murray program needs funding provided through the National Water Initiative-funding which is not forthcoming because of the disagreement with the states over how the initiative should be funded. What is already happening to the river down south will also happen upstream, and it will happen fast. And although we are beginning to take some action now, it will take years to repair-if we act immediately. Given that the salinity loads from past mistakes can take 30 years to hit the river, attempts to reduce salinity are up against a backlog of irrigation development. Low water flows downstream have long been a serious concern. South Australia is still chasing agreement for further flow increases, despite an agreement with the CommonMAIN COMMITTEE",123,National Water Commission Bill 2004
201,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10.17 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the National Waterwealth earlier this year and a $65 million contribution to release an extra 500 gigalitres. Victoria and New South Wales have just agreed to recover 240 gigalitres for the river. Labor’s plan was for 1,500 gigalitres, and water experts still agree that is what is required. But there is more to repairing the river than just increasing flows; we also need to change our ways. We have to take a long hard look at our irrigation practices. It is all well and good to save water in our households by taking shorter showers or reusing grey water and all the other conservation measures we put in place, but the vast majority of water taken from the Murray is taken by irrigators. We have to get smart about the way we farm-that is the secret to a healthy river. I hope that the $1.6 billion set aside for innovation and uptake of water smart technology through the Australian water fund will deliver very rapid change in farming practices. I do not wish to suggest that farmers themselves are responsible. I am relieved to see governments around the country at last facing up to the fact that agricultural practices need reform, and farmers need our support and government support to implement that. There is also $200 million set aside for community based water-saving initiatives around the country, which is not a great deal when you think of what has to be done and of how thinly those dollars will need to be spread, but perhaps the national commission will take a look at that. Without the Murray, South Australia has no future, so the work of the commission is essential. The rights of the commission to act independently and report publicly will be key to its effectiveness. To that end, I am extremely concerned about clause 44 in the bill, which prevents the commission from publicly releasing any information about the state of our water supplies or the progress being made on water initiatives without ministerial approval. For a matter which must be separate from politics, this clause is outrageous. There is no justification for withholding information which is so obviously in the public interest. I would also like to point out that the review of the National Water Initiative planned for 2011 may well be redundant, because it will be perfectly clear to South Australians within the next couple of years whether the National Water Initiative is working. I would prefer, and I know South Australians would prefer, a more a regular review process, reporting back to the public on at least an annual basis. It is important that the commission will have to produce an annual review which must be tabled in parliament, but we all know there may be important information that it is in the public interest to release sooner or with more detail than is possible through the annual reporting process. It concerns me too that the states may not get their choice of commissioner onto the commission. South Australians understand that the success of the national commission in protecting and restoring the River Murray is nothing to be toyed with. There will not be a nomination made by the states that is not decided on the basis of ability and expertise. Therefore I see no reason for the Commonwealth to object to the states’ nominations. There can be no imaginable justifiable basis for refusing the states’ nominations for commissioners on the National Water Commission. Clause8 and the secrecy clause, clause 44, flag the Commonwealth government’s fear about committing to what they know must be done to save Australia’s water resources. They are extremely worried about the mounting pressure from the states and from the public in relation to this issue. This bill contains clauses which try to minimise that pressure. MAIN COMMITTEE But there is already too much evidence that supports the position for a new approach to managing our water resources and in particular the River Murray. A report released last week by the CSIRO states that the total water requirement of irrigated agricultural land uses in the Murray-Darling Basin increased by nearly 29 per cent to 12,050 gigalitres between 1996-97 and 2000-01; the total area of irrigated agriculture increased by 22 per cent in the same period from 1.5 million hectares to 1.8 million hectares; the irrigated agricultural land use of largest areal extent is dairy, followed by cotton, cereals and rice; the largest users of water for irrigation are also dairy, followed by cotton, rice, cereals and grapes; areas of irrigated dairy pasture expanded by some 217,000 hectares-that is 71 per cent; total water requirements of dairy increased by 1,730 gigalitres to a total of 4,194 gigalitres in 2000-01; areas of irrigated cotton expanded by 108,000 hectares-that is 36 per cent; and the total water requirements of cotton increased by 729 gigalitres to a total of 2,856 gigalitres in 2000-01. Despite this growth in production, total profit decreased. In 1996-97 it was $3.856 billion, which decreased slightly to $3.732 billion in 2000-01. At a recent Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting a contract for up to $7.5 million in sand-pumping works to keep the mouth of the Murray open was approved. That is essential work, but I look forward to the day when the river is so healthy that the mouth never closes. This bill is a move in the right direction, and I hope that the commissioners will report back to the public on the National Water Initiative strategies and that that work to save the river is successful. this debate on what is such a very important issue for this parliament and for our country. In the past five years or so the issue of water has been something that has really got a great deal of attention at a community level. I welcome the previous speaker’s support for the direction of this commission and the fact that the government and the Deputy Prime Minister have moved on this subject over the last few years. The Natural Heritage Trust was probably the first major policy initiative where we recognised as a nation that our major environmental challenges, which have been with us since Australia’s founding and will be with us for all time, are only going to be overcome with big initiatives which have cooperation from all levels of government, be they state, federal or local, and from local communities. As we move forward, it is that community involvement that is going to be the key. The Deputy Prime Minister, in his introductory remarks to the National Water Commission Bill 2004 and in the debate over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months, has made that point. If we put aside the inevitable political differences that we have in this chamber-which we rightly have, because we represent different points of view-we can have a united view on the fact that the process forward has to be one that keeps all communities together if we are really to have a comprehensive outcome. The previous speaker obviously speaks from a South Australian perspective. There are particular problems with the Murray-Darling Basin there. As a Victorian, I am very familiar with them. We follow that debate very closely. We do not have the problems in Melbourne that Adelaide is experiencing. But making that case right across Australia is critical, because in many respects the situation in Adelaide is just a forerunner to what we can expect if we do not tackle this problem into the future. MAIN COMMITTEE",127,National Water Commission Bill 2004
202,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (10.26 A.m.),"I want to briefly take the time to add toWater is also a big issue in my electorate of Casey. There have been changes at the state level but, as the Deputy Prime Minister has rightly pointed out, what is necessary is that the action is taken at a cooperative, community level so that people are involved and want to be involved in making that happen. To that end, I want to pay tribute to some of the business groups, particularly Mr Pratt and his water group, which have done so much to drive the public debate. We might not always agree with the solutions they propose, but driving that debate has been quite critical. One thing we have seen over the last few years is recognition at the community level of the importance of water-of its value and its scarcity and, more importantly, of the fact that it is vital for Australia’s future. That has been the result not only of governments and state governments taking decisions but also of the sort of community cooperation we have had from business groups who have also led the way. In my own electorate of Casey, you get a good picture of urban and rural Australia. There are the outer urban suburbs that have that suburban attitude to water, I suppose, where you have new housing estates, and the pressure for water usage is there; and you have the rural areas-and one does not really blend into the other. There is a hard line difference because of the planning laws. As you move into that rural area those difficulties, which have been exacerbated by recent droughts, have been very apparent. It is a microcosm of what is going on, be it in South Australia, Flinders or elsewhere, where 50 or 100 years ago the water suppliesthe creeks and the dams-were not under pressure. A drought would come along every so often and there would be difficulty. But, of course, as development has encroached and as industries have become more intensive, the need is for science and common sense usage to make up that difference. We have seen the Yarra Valley change from a farming district. It is well known now as one of the world’s greatest wine districts. I know the member for Flinders disagrees with me on almost nothing except for the fact that the Yarra Valley is the greatest wine district certainly in Melbourne. I will not bait the South Australians, who cling to their wine districts as they clung to the Adelaide Grand Prix! But of course our areas-and I make a serious point on this-have become much more than that. I know that the members from South Australia know that. They are becoming integrated. The agribusinesses that 20 or 30 years ago were really old-style industries are becoming very modern. They are becoming export businesses. They are becoming the new opportunities and the new growth sectors. As they integrate with tourism they become the new drivers of these areas. But of course the use and availability of water is really what is going to determine their future. If we ignore what is required, we will do so at our peril. As the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, if we do not take the community with us we will do it at our peril. Governments and bureaucracies need to recognise that. That is not just important from a policy delivery point of view; it is critical, because a lot of the local knowledge is always in those local communities. It is on the farms; it is in the businesses. It is in those family businesses that have existed, often in the same place, be it in Silvan in Casey or down on the Mornington Peninsula in Flinders, where those people have the knowledge of the water systems, of how they could do things better and of how governments could do things better. That is the point I make in this debate: this will be a big issue for the next 50 years. Governments have a role in leading; they have a role certainly in changing policy and they have a role in changing things so that there is a sustainable future for Australia. But at the same time MAIN COMMITTEE we have to listen to the people on the ground. That is very much what the commission is going to be about. The commission is designed to be a two-way process. It will fund important national projects and grassroots projects as well through the water wise program. SoI think it is good that there is a bipartisan spirit to this debate. It is good that we can start this new parliament with a bill like this that will make a major contribution in the years ahead, right across Australia, to our local communities, to our nation and to our businesses. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (10.35 a.m.)-I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the National Water Commission Bill 2004, which is about such an important issue. Water and our use, or misuse, of it is one of the most important issues currently facing this nation and our current practices are just not sustainable. I recently came across something that further backs this up, which I will share. It is an article entitled ‘Solving our water headache’. It says: The Water Services Association of Australia predicts that Australia’s major urban areas will have a water shortage of over 800 gigalitres a year by 2030 even if we have recycling in one-quarter of new developments and all consumers reduce their water use by 10 per cent. That’s a shortage greater than Sydney’s current use. The shortage is due to a combination of city growth-three million more people by 2030, climate change and the need to provide more water to our rivers and estuaries. I think this shows that this is clearly a situation which requires urgent consideration. In particular, I would like to speak on the Murray River and the urgent challenge that we face in order to save it. As I mentioned throughout the recent campaign and in my first speech, I feel particularly passionate about this crucial issue. This is something that I share with many within my electorate and, indeed, within South Australia. I note the contributions made by both the member for Grey and the member for Hindmarsh but I also state that this is not just a South Australian issue; this is a national issue that we need to put a focus on to address. WhilstI have some concerns within this bill that I will detail in a moment, I must say that I am delighted that it has made it here. I, like no doubt many other South Australians, was somewhat confused about the Liberal Party’s position with regard to saving the Murray, with all the flip-flopping that was going on in South Australia earlier in the year. I am speaking, of course, about some of the member for Barker’s comments and his support of the push by coalition backbenchers to postpone fresh water flows. The member for Barker stated: My mind hasn’t changed-every scientist we spoke to said we need a lot more work done before we make a decision on the 500 gl. Whilst it is alarming that when everyone else can recognise the urgency of the plight of the Murray the member for Barker instead wanted us to sit back and remain inactive, I am pleased that we are here now discussing this and I hope that we can get on with the job. I must say that I am also surprised and disappointed that we are only now debating this legislation. It should be noted that this government has failed to address issues of water reform with the appropriate sense of urgency and it is shameful that the reform process, formalised by COAG back in 1994, has not been progressed by the federal government. I think Australians can legitimately ask where the government has been on this issue for the last eight years. MAIN COMMITTEE As the member for Hindmarsh outlined so articulately earlier, South Australians are particularly well aware of the significance of the current plight of the Murray. This is for a number of reasons. Obviously, the geographic location of the river and the first-hand implications of its demise are major factors, but I think it is important to also acknowledge the strong leadership role that the Rann government has played in championing the Murray’s cause and fighting for its ongoing survival. Equally, this is an issue which many have got involved in at a community level. I was pleasantly surprised at the huge number of people within the electorate who have spoken to me about their deep concerns for the river’s health. The South Australian branch of the Australian Conservation Foundation have done a fantastic job of increasing community awareness and co-ordinating community campaigns on this issue. I think they-in particular, Arlene Buchan-should be commended for this work. It is some indication of how strongly South Australians feel on this issue that over 4,500 South Australians have signed the ACF’s postcards urging for action on the Murray. ACF know, as do the Labor Party, that leading scientists have reported that 1,500 gigalitres are required to save the Murray. I intend to constantly remind the government of this until we see the action required. These additional flows are critical to the Murray, but there is more that must also be done. We need to change the way we use our water, as well as the amount. I would like to now share some of the major new initiatives which are currently being progressed in my state of South Australia. These include the Waterproofing Adelaide initiative. This is a project that seeks to establish a blueprint for the management, conservation and development of Adelaide’s precious water resources to 2025. A draft strategy has been released, following the release of a discussion paper. The strategy proposes a vision for reducing the city’s water consumption, better managing our water systems and developing new sources of water. Another new initiative is the prescription of the Eastern and Western Mount Lofty Ranges. As part of its duty of care to the community and the environment, our state government is taking action to hold water use at current levels while it undertakes a detailed assessment to accurately determine water resource use and future trends. Yet another new initiative in South Australia is the Urban Stormwater Initiative, in which our state government and the Local Government Association are working together to develop a new catchment based management approach to progress stormwater re-use and flood mitigation. We must change our attitudes on the river and actually start coming up with some innovative new approaches to water reform. I support measures to establish a National Water Commission, but there are some concerns. One of the most alarming elements of the current proposal is the suggestion that the money would come from the states’ national competition payments. These payments are paid to the states and territories for continuing reform in competition practices in trade, retail, business and government-such as Sunday trading, for instance. These reforms continue to provide an indefinite tax revenue benefit to the Commonwealth. In effect, it means that the money set aside for South Australia or for other states in the form of these payments will be diverted to pay for the federal government’s water policy. I think it is a disgrace that, whilst the government is willing to go on a multibillion-dollar spending spree during the election and whilst it is happy to throw money around at a variety of other ventures, this government will not put up new funds to address this urgent issue of water in the nation. This concern has been shared by many. I would like to take the opportuMAIN COMMITTEE nity to share some of the words which were included in a letter to the Prime Minister regarding this issue, which was signed by all the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories. In it they stated: Your decision to fund the water policy by cutting at least $1.6 billion in competition payments to the States and Territories means you are effectively robbing our governments to pay for your policy. In addition to this you seek additional payments from the States and Territories to fund the key projects promised in your policy. This will put intolerable pressure on the delivery of key services by the States and Territories. It will inevitably have an impact on hospitals and schools. This is an unnecessary assault on State and Territory Budgets, given the Commonwealth Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook ... released on 10 September 2004 showed a cumulative underlying surplus of over $25 billion over the forward estimates period. The government must be serious about addressing these critical issues and it must demonstrate this commitment by putting up new funds. I would like to address a further concern, which lies in clause 44 of the bill. This clause prevents the commission from publicly releasing any information about the progress being made or the state of our water supplies without first getting ministerial approval. This clause is a disgrace. It is clearly in the public interest for the community to know whether the commission is satisfied that enough is being done. The commission will be able to make recommendations-for example, it may well recommend that water flows be increased to 1,500 gigalitres, as committed to by Labor-but under the secrecy clause the public will not know that unless the minister decides to admit that the coalition is not doing enough. I do not wish to pre-empt the minister’s actions, but I think we all know that it is unlikely that the public would ever hear about this. This is not open and accountable government. On an issue that is so important and that the community feels so strongly about, we must put politics aside and let the facts be known. A further concern was outlined yesterday by the member for Wills in his second reading amendment, and that was with regard to clause 8. I support the member for Wills and his very valid point that the states must get a fair say in the appointment of commissioners. We must view water, our use and re-use of it, as a national priority. We must commit appropriate resources to delivering effective water reform and we must act swiftly and boldly to save our River Murray. I urge the government to treat this pressing issue with the priority that it requires. Heritage) (10.44 a.m.)-I am delighted to speak on the National Water Commission Bill 2004. The problem we face today in Australia is perhaps encapsulated by a problem we see within my own electorate of Flinders. At the southern end of the Mornington Peninsula the Gunnamatta outfall discharges 150 billion litres of secondary treated sewage as ocean outfall every year. This 150 billion litres, or 150 gigalitres, of sewage comes out less than 30 metres from the coast. That sewage has three great impacts. Firstly, it has environmental impacts. It causes the destruction of the kelp beds and it has an impact on the general nutrient level and therefore on the higher biological levels. Secondly, it has a health effect. This is one of Australia’s great surf beaches. Thirdly, it is a criminal waste of a natural resource which is in short supply. This problem is replicated throughout Australia. We see 1,500 gigalitres, or 1,500 bilMAIN COMMITTEE",129,National Water Commission Bill 2004
203,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andlion litres, of waste water and sewage water cast out to sea by state water authorities throughout Australia. That problem is an exemplar of the challenges and opportunities facing Australia in relation to water conservation for the future which generations to come must face in addressing Australia’s water needs. The problem is there, the solution is understood and the responsibility is with this generation to protect future generations from water shortage. In this speech I want to address three things: firstly, the problem; secondly, the systemic solution in terms of the National Water Initiative and the National Water Commission; and, thirdly, the particular programs which we undertake. Looking at the general problem, what we find is that naturally, with a combination of increased water usage per head, an increase in population and a decrease in sustainable yield through a combination of environmental factors, we are running short of resources and we will continue to see a decrease in the available water resources for Australia’s rural and urban populations. That problem means that we cannot allow the waste of water at the level of 1,500 gigalitres, or 1,500 billion litres, per year to continue. The city has been stealing from the country, not returning it and not playing its part in ensuring that water is available for country users. We must take action now. In my very first speech in parliament three years ago and in my next speech following that I set out the need, desire and plan for a proposal which would see the ending of ocean outfalls by the year 2025 and the recycling of all of that water for industrial and agricultural uses. Against that background I am delighted that the government has progressed with the National Water Initiative and the creation of a National Water Commission. What is particularly notable is that the Prime Minister has himself assumed responsibility for dealing with water as one of Australia’s core pressing priorities. The National Water Commission will reside within the Prime Minister’s department. That is a tremendous sign of prime ministerial interest and commitment to helping to address this problem for future generations. In particular, the National Water Initiative-which was signed on 25 June this year-sets out, through the Council of Australian Governments, a process by which we will have ongoing water reform for the Murray River through the Living Murray initiative, for our rural rivers and for our urban systems. It is that integrated approach which is absolutely critical in dealing with the responsibilities, needs and challenges of future generations. Against that background the core vehicle for the operation of the National Water Initiative is the National Water Commission. It sets up seven commissioners, four chosen by the Commonwealth and three chosen by the states. These commissioners will identify Australia’s priorities. I am delighted that, in setting out the policy for the national water fund during the course of the election, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell, identified the solution of the Gunnamatta outfall issue as one of the two top national priorities for grey water and black water reuse. I believe that is an absolutely critical step forward. This is a model project for reuse of water throughout Australia. What does this mean in practice? What are the programs which come out from the National Water Initiative and the National Water Commission? There are three core programs which form the Australian water fund. This is a body of $2 billion which was set out by the Prime Minister; the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, who has played a very important role in this process; and by the minister, Ian Campbell, who has a real passion, commitment and understanding about the need for water reuse and the need for water management. MAIN COMMITTEE The first of those three programs is the major infrastructure program of $1.6 billion, which is known as Water Smart Australia. What Water Smart Australia does is lay down a capital base for funding, to be matched by the states and private sector, in dealing with major infrastructure projects for the wise use of water, for the repair of damaged areas and, in particular, for the reuse programs, which are critical if we are going to conserve water. That is in rural areas and urban areas. It is tremendously important to see, for the first time, a Commonwealth government taking major strides in the last 30 years in terms of national water infrastructure. That $1.6 billion is contingent on funds from the states. It should never be used as a replacement for what should be the ordinary course of expenditure for state governments. What it does is provide an incentive and an additional supplement for private, state and local funding and it says that the Commonwealth recognises that, even though this is not a constitutional responsibility, it is a national leadership responsibility. We do not shirk that and we have put our money up, because it is a critical form of national leadership and an intergenerational challenge that we face. The second program which comes under the National Water Initiative and the Australian water fund is the $200 million Raising National Water Standards program. This is a $200 million program over five years which is all about investing in Australia’s capacity to measure, monitor and manage its water resources. It is about taking programs such as the Queensland rivers, estuaries and coastal regions water monitoring program, which does a tremendous job, and applying those nation wide. I think the Queensland example is a great example which the Victorian government and the New South Wales government could do worse than replicate. I think it is a tremendous project, and this funding allows ideas such as that to be replicated by community groups, local governments and state governments around Australia for understanding and monitoring water quality challenges. The third element of the Australian water fund is the $200 million water wise community program. This will be administered by the Department of the Environment and Heritage in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. What it does is provide money in grants of up to $50,000 for community groups to focus on water reuse, community education and repair of riparian systems-repair of local river systems-helping to overcome problems with the quality and treatment of water, and educating local users. So those three elements together make up the Australian water fund. Water is one of Australia’s great challenges. It is a challenge for the rural areas and it is a challenge, in particular, for the urban areas, which have until now been tremendously wasteful. Present in the chamber is the member for Riverina, Kay Hull, who is one of the very passionate advocates for water use and water rights for rural users. I say that, as city dwellers, we have a responsibility to her constituents to do our part. our part and it is now, for the first time, being recognised that what we do in the cities impacts on the availability of water for country users. There is a national responsibility to implement the major water recycling program in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, which has made more progress than anywhere else in Australia. We have that responsibility. This bill lays down the framework and the funding for those activities and it is backed by the commitment and energy of a Prime Minister who said that he wants 20 projects up and running durMAIN COMMITTEE",133,National Water Commission Bill 2004

205,Mr Hunt,"Of course, I include the member for Mallee. We have a responsibility to doing 2005. We have prime ministerial focus, we have deputy prime ministerial focus and we have an environment minister who is passionate about this, so we have the force of the government aimed at making water reuse, water management and water demand control national priorities. I urge the states to participate in the National Water Initiative, to return to the table and not to play games. Finally, I say congratulations to all of those involved in the preparation of the bill and the Australian water fund in particular: the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Ian Campbell. It is now our-this generation’s-responsibility to take the steps in our national usage and in our personal usage to allow genuine health for the next generation. I commend the bill to the House. Committee this morning to discuss something of great interest to me and my electorate. My electorate includes a significant irrigation area, and that area certainly contributes significantly to exports and to the domestic wealth of Australia as a nation. Also, I am part of the Pratt Water working group. In the past I formed an alliance with Richard Pratt because of his very keen interest to ensure that water was looked at with great respect into the future. We formed the Pratt working group in order to look at how we might resolve some of the issues that would confront Australia. Pratt Water has investigated the business case for investing in water efficiency within the Murrumbidgee Valley. This work has yielded valuable lessons for government and investors in advancing significant water-saving infrastructure to implementation. In particular, Pratt Water has identified a need and a mechanism for implementing water efficiency projects that can yield major savings but which do not fall within a conventional or well-defined ownership or management context. These include projects that lie outside the existing corporatised irrigation districts and which involve a mix of land holdings, water user interests and titles, and land management objectives. In many of these cases there is a need to consolidate and converge the variety of interests and expectations-a challenge that has proven difficult to overcome to date. Pratt Water has analysed the key issues that need to be managed and resolved in securing appropriate investment and operational certainty for such projects and is now looking for a way of implementing these findings in ‘real life’ projects that are likely to receive the support of both public and community stakeholders, together with potential financiers. There is a range of regional water-saving projects that have been on the books for many years but which have yet to be implemented. This is partly due to funding and financing uncertainty. Many parties are also looking for a signal from the appropriate levels of government that particular projects will receive government support, encouragement or assistance with facilitation. Support may not necessarily mean financial support but, rather, facilitation or assistance to draw together the various approval parties to clarify the application of regulations to new structures. We are focusing on a number of high-priority projects and we promote the most promising ones towards financing and implementation. That brings me to the dovetailing of Pratt Water into the National Water Initiative. We have a significant opportunity now in this House and in all of the state parliaments to be able to advance with historic decisions that will ensure the future for all Australians for many years to come. A popular children’s novel, The Girl from Tomorrow, and its sequel, which were proMAIN COMMITTEE",135,National Water Commission Bill 2004
206,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (10.56 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to stand in the Mainduced as a children’s television series, focused on the future-the year 2500. This is a children’s novel but it talks about water being more valuable than gold. While it certainly seems far-fetched to us, it is something to consider. Written in the 1980s, this novel sent a powerful warning, even then, that our valuable resource could not last forever. We already live in a world where clean drinking water is not a reality for all. By protecting our valuable resource we can ensure that everybody has access to water, whether it be for agricultural uses or for drinking and everyday use. Since this government was elected, it has been committed to implementing a plan to protect our water resources for the future and to ensure that we use this resource more wisely. Well before I came into this House, I would go around to schools with these policy issues to see how schoolchildren could become water wise and perhaps go home and teach their parents what was needed to ensure a consistent water supply for the future. Now that I am in the HouseI am able to participate more and be more involved to ensure these future issues are addressed. I am very pleased to have been part of the National Party working team which looked at various ways to conserve water into the future. The National Water Initiative was a historic agreement that was a result of the commitment by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, the Hon. John Anderson, to see that this idea become a reality. No person has been more influential in the water debate than the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister. It was through his great work that the majority of the states were brought together to see the sense of the National Water Initiative. He also brought to the table users and entitlement holders. They were very concerned for the state of their future until the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, brought together a realistic National Water Initiative. It was really pleasing to see the state and territory leaders come on board with the initiative. But then, disappointingly but probably predictably, we saw them walk away from the agreement during the election campaign. That leads me to contributions made yesterday in this place. It was appalling and shocking to see the Labor speakers, fresh from their latest internal leadership and turf war battles, troop into this House yesterday, one after the other, to disown Labor’s policy, to rewrite history to favour their party, to substitute intelligent policy debate with untruths and to put on the table their real lack of understanding as to how water effectively helps to utilise the productivity of this nation. Firstly, there was the disowning of ALP policy and the issue of competition payments to fund the Australian water fund. Let us make no mistake about it. During the election campaign, the state premiers walked away from the initiative that everyone had worked so hard to bring to the table. They disowned it because of some furphy that they were being robbed of their national competition payments. In his speech on this issue, the member for Wills said in relation to point 4 of his amendment that competition payments should continue to be paid to the states and territories for essential services such as schools and hospitals. But what was said during the election? Something very different, of course. It is a case of saying one thing during the election and another thing here in parliament. I recall that during the election campaign one of the opposition members came to my electorate and said, ‘Kay Hull says one thing in her electorate and quite a different thing when she comes into the House.’ Let me say that these people opposite have come into this House and have said something totally different from their actual policy. MAIN COMMITTEE This is what the Labor Party said on competition payments in its plan for the environment and heritage released during the election: ‘The assessments of state performance payments have gone into state coffers rather than improved water management, and progress in some states has been slow.’ That is very different. What has changed since the member for Wills owned those words? An election, of course. Why did the member for Wills not read that part of the policy during his speech? He read large slabs of the rest of the rejected and failed policy into Hansard. I ask the question again: why did the member for Wills not read that part of the policy during his speech in this House? The policy can no longer be found on the ALP’s web site. I think the Labor Party’s airbrushing of policies from their web sites has been mentioned before-you will certainly see that this one has been airbrushed out. But these are the little treasures that one keeps: ‘The assessments of state performance payments have gone into state coffers rather than improved water management, and progress in some states has been slow.’ These were things that the Labor Party said. Just as amnesia on the substance of their plan for environment and heritage has gripped the collective minds of the Labor speakers on this bill, they seem to have forgotten that the Leader of the Opposition grabbed $800 million in those same competition payments that they objected to going into the National Water Initiative. The Leader of the Opposition grabbed $800 million in those competition payments to fund his failed hospital policy, but that was okay-that was fine. The pontificating on competition policy is nothing but hot air from most of the speakers. The Australian Labor Party know-or they should know if members are actually doing their jobs-that the national competition policy agreement was only ever going to run to 2005-06. Claims by Labor states and territories and subsequently by federal Labor that they have somehow been dudded are categorically wrong. The Commonwealth included funds for a continuation of national competition policy beyond that year-in case COAG decided to continue NCP-in much the same format of sharing the economic benefits. The hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party was absolutely breathtaking in the debate on the bill in this Main Committee chamber yesterday. As I said, I sat in my office and was appalled. The states in their submissions on the future of national competition payments to the Productivity Commission, which is currently undertaking a review, suggested that they do not want to engage in more reform beyond 2005-06, but they still want their money. The rice industry is a classic example, whereby the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, says: ‘We want to save the rice industry, but we don’t want to take it off the table. I don’t want to go back to COAG with all of my Labor premiers and ministers and get agreement to take rice off the table. I do not want to deregulate. I want to keep my rice industry with vesting powers and a single desk-I am absolutely desperate to fight for that.’ I would like to see Bob Carr come to the table with his Labor ministers and decide that they are going to take rice off the table. But at the same time, he cannot get the payments that he so dearly wants. On the one hand, he says: ‘We need to save the rice industry. We do not want to deregulate it. We want to keep it with vesting powers.’ On the other hand, he says, ‘I want all the money that I can get for not deregulating.’ Premier Bob Carr wants to have his cake and eat it too-very typical. Labor now complain when the Commonwealth does something constructive with national competition payment-such as put it into a National Water Initiative that secures the future of all Australians rather than prop up a failed system run by premiers in every state in this country. MAIN COMMITTEE Labor members who have engaged in debate on this bill have engaged in deliberate untruths. They really should come in here and apologise. As I said, Labor’s contribution to the debate yesterday was absolutely appalling. Labor seeks to amend the government’s motion before the House based on competition payments. It will fail. It is based on flawed thinking and flawed policy underpinnings. It is a sham. The member for Wills should be absolutely ashamed of his performance in the Main Committee yesterday. The Labor Party should be condemned for putting before the House a very flawed motion. Labor’s policy on environmental flow for the Murray is another mystery. There is no consistent policy. In this place yesterday, the member for Blaxland made a very interesting contribution. He said that the Labor policy was to release 1,500 gigalitres down the Murray. On the other hand, the member for Wills said it was 450 gigalitres. So who is right? Who is telling the truth? If they cannot even get that right when they come into the chamber, how do we expect the people of Australia, who are dependent upon the success of this National Water Initiative, to be able to understand where they are going to be able to go with Labor policy? It is one thing today to suit one constituency and another tomorrow to suit another constituency. Labor is rewriting history in order to own water reform. The policy performance of the Australian Labor Party has looked at rewriting history. The 1994 contribution on water reform of the Council of Australian Governments was the collective contribution of states and territories and the Commonwealth. Present at the 1994 COAG meeting were the then Liberal Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett; the then Liberal Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey; the then Labor Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss; the then Liberal Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown; the then Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court; the then Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom; the then Liberal Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Kate Carnell; and the then Country Liberal Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron. The policy drive for water reform was a collective thrust of the governments of the day: seven Liberal premiers and chief ministers, one Labor premier and one Labor prime minister. COAG operates on consensus, and the COAG policy is not owned by the Australian Labor Party, as was espoused here yesterday in the Main Committee by the member for Wills. He said, ‘We started this; it us ours.’ Do not let anyone be deluded-the member for Wills was yesterday trying to claim ownership of the National Water Initiative. That is another myth that we have dispelled. You should not try to rewrite history for self-gain unless you have gone and done your homework. Under the Constitution, the Australian government can only work with the states and territories on water. Up until 25 June 2004 water policy was travelling well. Then, eight Labor premiers thought they should help out their federal counterparts on water policy during the election. I am sure that has to be something that they now regret, because the Labor premiers and their leaders earned the wrath of stakeholders and communities for reneging on the National Water Initiative agreement that they had signed on 25 June 2004. Perhaps it was done in order to help their federal Labor leader, but they have not been rewarded for doing this, because their federal Labor leader has at times rewarded them with public humiliation. Basically, we need to look at how we can get back on track. We cannot get back on track with help from a dysfunctional Australian Labor Party. It is an Australian Labor Party that is so dysfunctional that its members came into the Main Committee yesterday and provided conflicting views. The issues that we are confronting here need to be addressed by this governMAIN COMMITTEE ment and can only be addressed by this government. We can refer to a couple of the other issues, such as decoupling the National Water Initiative and the Living Murray initiative, which has caused great concern through my electorate of Riverina. In fact, the National Water Initiative is underpinned by the Living Murray initiative. Signed on 25 June, the intergovernmental agreement on the Living Murray initiative says at clause 6: Implementation of this Agreement will be dependent upon agreement by the Parties to the National Water Initiative Intergovernmental Agreement. If it was good enough for the premiers to sign off on this on 25 June, it is good enough for them to now come back to the table and continue to sign off on it. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has indicated that this is the position-and that is exactly what the position is. This government’s ministers do not say one thing and mean another. Labor members were particularly hysterical about the Australian water fund during the election. The projects announced for Victoria during the election campaign were those that the Victorian government had requested joint funding for under the National Water Initiative. Are these same Labor members suggesting that the Victorian government has not undertaken a rigorous financial assessment of these projects? Are these same Labor members suggesting that the Victorian government has not undertaken the necessary studies? I have to defend the Victorian government. It is a crazy position for me, to have to stand in the Main Committee and defend the Victorian government against its own party. Costings and rigorous assessments have been done, and the Victorian government recognised that. It takes a National Party coalition member to come into this House and defend the Victorian government. My goodness! I may be of a different political persuasion, but in their contributions deliberate untruths were told by Labor speakers about the Victorian government in the vain hope of scoring a political hit. Let me say that it did not work. In most of the content of the speeches of these Labor members, particularly the member for Batman and the member for Grayndler, truth was a victim. Labor have made no contribution to the water debate, other than low-level muckraking. Rather than rising to the challenge to debate the substance of the bill, they got in the gutter with their performance and they stayed there. Do us a favour state Labor premiers: get back to the table and let us start looking at a future for the people of the Riverina that I represent, because their livelihoods are dependent upon this National Water Initiative delivering the objectives that it was designed to do by the National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. cause I am next to my National Party colleague Mrs Hull, the member for Riverina. I am also grateful for the acknowledgement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the member for Flinders, and for the role that we have both played in getting to the position now where we can come in here and support historic legislation. I would like to say three things in my contribution to this debate on the National Water Commission Bill 2004. I would like to talk about the value of this particular policy and why I am so supportive of it. I would like to speak specifically about a very important and significant project that is already included in what this legislation will roll out, involving an expenditure of initially $2 billion. And, also, along with the member for Riverina, I would like to MAIN COMMITTEE",136,National Water Commission Bill 2004
207,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (11.16 A.m.),"I am delighted to stand here today, particularly beexpress absolute disappointment in the contribution we have heard from opposition members with respect to this bill. I come from a background of 23 years as a practising civil engineer. In fact, I often claim great credit: I am the only civil engineer in the federal parliament. In the latter part of my career, I was pursuing a consulting engineering degree and was engaged in consulting projects right across the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, which the member for Riverina represents, along the Murray Valley from Albury-Wodonga all the way to Mildura, Lake Cullulleraine and further south of that. As someone who operated in three of the nation’s states, I saw the difficulties we have in terms of developing massive investment in irrigation developments which are so vital to the producers of food and fibre out there in Central Australia, north-west Victoria and southern New South Wales, and the most important issue I saw was the disparity in water policy across those three states. Again, we are always reminded of the differences. We often hear quoted the difference between rail gauges in the states ‘holding the nation back’ in terms of development. In addition to that, problems have been created because of inappropriate use of water, salinity, land degradation and environmental damage, and a whole host of capital demands have arisen while solving those problems. So now we have something that I have fought for in my 11 years in this place-a national approach to how we use water in one of the driest and most arid continents in the world. We are, unfortunately, prolific users of water per capita. Of all the developed nations in the world, for us, being in such an arid continent, this is anathema. What this water policy does is focus on a whole range of things from better use to a greater consciousness of the way we use water right through the continent itself, as the member for Flinders said, uniting city with country because we are all in this. It is a little unfortunate, but probably the final driver for the establishment of this policy occurred in the latter three or four years: the worse drought we have had in 100 years, right across continent, and certainly south of the Tropic of Capricorn at least. We have got ourselves to the stage now where there is hardly a water storage south of the Tropic of Capricorn that is more than half full. Some of those storages got as low as three or four per cent-the average was about 20 per cent-through the worse part of the drought. We are grateful for some winter run-off, but the problem is not going to go away. Corporately, the nation needs to drive on, joining city and country together, and this legislation provides a basis on which to do it. For a long time now, section 100 of the Constitution has been a constraint in taking a national approach to the resolution of this issue. Under these arrangements, with formal agreements with the states through COAG agreements, we can tackle the issue. Over the years, particularly the last 25 years, we have seen great developments under models like this, particularly with regard to the Murray-Darling Basin. When I started my consulting engineering career, the operation was supervised by a toothless tiger in the form of the Murray-Darling commission at that stage. But major steps were taken towards progress in solving these problems when we formed a commission driven by a COAG-style agreement, where the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia agreed to meet in a ministerial council to resolve those difficulties, eventually getting to the stage where there was confidence for South Australian taxpayers’ funding to be spent in Victoria and New South Wales, MAIN COMMITTEE and the other way around. That has produced tremendous results in attacking salinity. Now we have the basis to do that with the use of water. SoI feel immensely proud. There has been much discussion in joining city with country. I remember one day the member for Casey stood and supported me in the argument to achieve a direction which we are discussing today, and I am really grateful for that. I am grateful to the member for Flinders as well. I am so excited about this bill and where it will go from here because there is a very specific project included in the initial $2 billion allocation, which embraces my entire electorate. It is the water supply system for stock, domestic and township purposes referred to as the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic pipeline. It is now a project that has iconic national status. I am grateful for that. I am very proud of the fact that over the last eight or nine years we have been progressively piping that very inefficient channel system, to the extent that I can stand here today and say that one-third of this scheme is now piped. The scheme was an engineering achievement of its time. It is well over 100 years old now. It took 60-odd years to construct. It is a credit to the engineering initiative in those days, back towards the end of the previous century and the early part of the last one. It is recognised as an iconic engineering project, the largest open channel system in the world, but it has served its time. This is a scheme that supplies water from the mountains of the Grampians in the south all the way north as far as Ouyen, which is nearly 300 kilometres, through a channel system consisting of 17,000 to 80,000 kilometres of open earth channel through some of the most porous country you could ever come across. It was very inefficient. Of all the water that left the Grampians-which was of the order of 200,000 or 250,000 megalitres-only 7,000 megalitres was ever used, consumed by humans or by the stock on the various farming properties through the region. And that has been going on for 100 years. I can remember my late grandfather talking about the need to pipe the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic system. He said this debate was going on 60 or 80 years ago, way back then. I can remember as a young man-I must have been about six or seven-my father asked me: ‘What do you want to do with your future, son? You’re quite bright.’ I said, ‘I just want to be a civil engineer, Dad, and I want to get the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic system piped.’ That is just me, but that commitment has been there through generations. We are one-third of the way there, and now we can give a commitment that we will complete the whole scheme. I am quite excited about that. This program will operate over five years, and it is a great credit to all those involved that we have got to the point where we can debate such important legislation as this and have that system piped. I will just give a context to the water that has been wasted every year in the system. People have trouble imagining what 200,000 megalitres looks like. It is enough water to fill Olympic swimming pools end-to-end from Melbourne to Darwin every year. So my community is quite excited about the commitment that has been given by the Commonwealth government. We are waiting for the state of Victoria to come on board and match the funding that we have allocated. There has been a whole lot of humbug associated with that over the last month or so, but I am sure that Victoria and the Premier himself will come on board because that project is just so vital to the whole of the north-west of Victoria, an area covering 75,000 square kilometres. MAIN COMMITTEE This brings me to my disappointment about the contribution that is being made by the opposition on this discussion and its very unfair attacks on the National Party and the role that it has played in establishing this water policy. I am very proud that the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Transport and Regional Services and now Acting Prime Minister has joined us in the chamber. This is one man who recognises the arguments that I have been putting for over a decade in this place and the absolute significance and importance of efficient water use. The constituencies that he, the member for Riverina and I represent are the food bowl of the nation. They are where the nation’s precious horticultural products are produced. Important food products are produced in a clean, lean and green way. Fibre is also produced. It has been the backbone of the nation. I represent a district associated with Sunraysia, which is responsible for producing 68 per cent of the nation’s export oranges. That is a proud record. I am very proud to be the representative of a determined industry sector that has had to compete against all odds to achieve that. It is absolutely committed to continuing the work to create export opportunities to sell that precious product for the nation’s benefit. I had a group of citrus growers here yesterday who actually had that discussion with the Minister for Trade. The National Party stands very proud of its contribution to this discussion and refutes categorically the contributions from the opposition. They have been disgraceful contributions, in fact. They are attempting to rewrite history. The member for Riverina’s contribution argued the case that they got their policy position wrong. The reality is that the coalition parties put very good and responsible policy to the Australian people as part of the election campaign. Earlier than that, when we first announced the National Water Initiative and at that stage secured the support of the states, we said that this was the nation’s foremost resource issue. There are something like 13 million to 16 million people in Australia estimated to be currently on some level of water restriction. Sadly, the people in my constituency, especially those associated with the provincial city of Horsham, are in the worse situation. There is no green lawn in the city of Horsham. Water restrictions are still at stage 4. It is putting the community at severe disadvantage. We announced policy to address this. We also said that, with regard to the big issues and particularly the river, we are as concerned as those communities who live on the river are. We are very concerned. They say they have already forsaken, made a great sacrifice and contributed in the last 20 years to the river’s ongoing health. They deserve to be recognised for that. At the same time, it is recognised that the challenges of the next 20 to 30 years are going to require even more sacrifice from them. We said that we would address these two important issues, but we would not sacrifice the interests of those people who are the wealth creators. The reason that such strong provincial centres like Swan Hill, Kerang, Cohuna and Mildura are there, contributing billions of dollars to the nation’s GDP so far out in remote Australia, is that they use water efficiently and properly. We said we will not sacrifice their ongoing potential for wealth creation and we want to encourage them to continue the investments they are making in the efficient use of water. That is what we said. That is certainly what I said during my election campaign. The opposition proposed a policy that had no rigour to it and which nobody believed, particularly those 16 million people in water restriction areas. They saw the coalition policy, jointly announced and supported by the Liberal Party and the National Party, as a responsible approach to the nation’s single most important resource issue. Because the opposition did not MAIN COMMITTEE win-the Australian people chose us-that is the end of the matter. The responsibility of the opposition, I would think, is to go to their state Labor colleagues and convince them that this is the greatest opportunity the nation has ever had and to get on board. There has been bleating in the debate about the use of competition policy funding. I had to put up with the Minister for Water in Victoria, John Thwaites, saying that, as a result of this announcement of $167 million to pipe the Wimmera Mallee stock and domestic system, we will have to close hospitals and police stations in Horsham. That is a ridiculous assertion. Yes, the Commonwealth wants to see competition payments-the $800 million it cost the nationspent in a proper way and in the way they were intended, which was to encourage competition. The only way I have seen the $200 million that Victoria receives being spent is in an annual allocation it makes to local government. That has been wisely spent. I think from memory it is around $16 million per year. That encourages all of the local government entities across Victoria to market test the services they provide, to engage in competitive tendering so that ratepayers can be assured that services being provided are at a market tested rate. That is a good thing to do and that is what competition policy is all about. End users can have confidence that the services they are paying for are at the proper rate. For the rest of it in Victoria, especially in regard to water reform, I believe it is an absolute basket case. I support the contention that the Commonwealth has the right to say how its federally taxpayer funded commitments should be spent, especially when they are under the heading of competition payments. The rest is bleating. I said so at the time and I am really disappointed to hear contributions from members of the opposition prolonging that discussion. The Commonwealth is determined to make sure that proper projects are funded. I am delighted to have the member for Gwydir here and to acknowledge his presence in my constituency way back then, at the end of September, and to acknowledge the support that the constituency enjoyed. The Commonwealth has been committed to piping the Wimmera Mallee and now they are giving us a future plan and, further than that, insisting that the funding be provided over the next five years. That is very positive and very affirmative and it has given the whole of the north-west of Victoria an enormous fillip, to the extent that they have sent me back to this chamber with historically the highest vote the region has ever provided. Water was very much the centre of the election campaign for both contenders, and there was a four per cent swing against the Labor Party’s policy. There was a very strong vote along the river that said: ‘We reject the opposition’s approach to solving the problems embraced under the concept of a Living Murray. We reject their approach and we certainly reject their stumbling refusal to add their commitment to the piping of the Wimmera Mallee.’ During the campaign, the Leader of the Opposition brought the current member for Kingsford Smith to the junction of the Murray and Darling basins to announce their policy. Other members have made contributions about that policy because it was an absurd approach. When asked the very question that everybody out there wanted to hear-about their commitment to the most important project which the region thinks ought to be addressed in any discussion about water-both stumbled. The current member for Kingsford Smith said he did not know much about these matters and the Leader of the Opposition was no better. The Australian people have made their judgment. They have decided that it is the coalition and conservative parties that have more responsible policy. My suggestion to all those speakMAIN COMMITTEE ers who have made such disparaging and despicable remarks under the protection of parliamentary privilege is that they get the message and do their job to encourage their Labor state colleagues in all of the states which they come from, particularly Victoria and New South Wales, to get on board. I am delighted to support this legislation. I am proud of it and I am proud of the contribution I have made to it over a decade. I feel I am enjoying quite a historic occasion here, as the only civil engineer. I particularly thank John Anderson, the member for Gwydir and Acting Prime Minister, for the support that he has provided to good policy. I commend the bill to every member of the chamber. present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the National Water Commission Bill 2004. I think it has been circulated. I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate on water. I think it hardly needs to be said that we are at a point in our history where the Australian people recognise the importance of getting water usage in Australia right, that it needs to be ecologically sustainable. We are very, very heavy users of water by OECD averages-we are about 30 per cent above average usage, in one of the driest continents on earth with perhaps the most unpredictable rainfall. The reality is that we need, we have a responsibility, to do a lot more in terms of water efficiency and the management of our national water. We have progressed through the National Water Initiative arguments and debates. I think that, broadly speaking, in pursuit of good public policy, as many senior commentators have noted around the country, we have had a reasonable degree of goodwill. In fact, we have had probably more goodwill from the state premiers in many ways, I have to say, than has been reflected in some of the contributions from the other side in this place during the debate on the National Water Commission. I think that says something quite profound in itself. We are now at the point where we need to move ahead and we need to move ahead quickly. I think the community expects that, I really do. Right across Australia, urban, coastal and inland Australians want us to move and to move comprehensively. So, in the setting up of the National Water Commission, we of course see a major step forward, a very proud one, and that is what this is all about. There are a few comments I would like to make on the debate that has happened in this place. Let me say at the outset that one of the issues that has been raised by the ALP relates to competition payments. The member for Wills, I note, said in his speech and in section four of his amendment that competition payments should continue to be paid to the states and territories for essential services such as schools and hospitals. He actually recognised something very different during the campaign. It has probably been airbrushed out now. But while the member for Wills was busily writing into Hansard large slabs of Labor’s failed policy from the election, it is worthy of note, I think, that he left out a very significant, very telling part of their own environment policy. That was: The assessment of State ... performance paymentsthat is, competition paymentshave gone into states coffers rather than improved water management, and progress in some [sates] has been slow. [sic] That is very different. What has changed since the member for Wills owned those words during the election? He saw then the nub of this problem-that is, that the states have not been prepared to take forward water reform post the 1994 COAG agreement properly. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,National Water Commission Bill 2004
208,Mr Anderson (Gwydir,"Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (11.36 a.m.)-IThere have essentially been two failures, and they are related. One has been in the proper defining of property rights as required by the 1994 COAG agreement and the other, which is related, has been the lack of progress towards a proper market and, where necessary, to proper adjustment assistance to the people who have to cope with change. One of the interesting things about this debate is that, the further you live away from river and water dependent farm communities, the more you think you know about it but the less you really know about it. That is the reality. David Suzuki, the famed environmentalist, made some very interesting and telling remarks. I have to say that I do not always agree with his outlooks. He made a point a little while ago that study after study, incident after incident, event after event around the world have demonstrated quite conclusively that, if you want to cut to the chase with an environmental problem and find the solution and implement it in the most efficient, effective and timely way, you will begin with consultation and quality interaction with the people who live at the coalface with the environmental problem and who have no intention of leaving. So when you start to talk about bringing water back into equilibrium where it has been over-allocated, where you talk about the need to move to greater water efficiency, where you talk about the need to balance ecological and economic outcomes, if you really want to make progress, you sit down in good faith and negotiate with water users. I make those remarks in the context of recognising that probably over 70 per cent of consumed water in Australia is used by farmers. They are not the end users of the water. It is very important to understand that. People who eat and people who wear clothes are the end users of that water-here and overseas. There is a moral component to this as well. Australia is a very significant global exporter of food and fibre to a world that needs those products. We provide very high-quality products at very low prices. We really need to keep that production up. We need to remember that people have to eat, people have to be clothed. They need those natural resources that are so dependent upon water for their production. The point that I want to draw out of all that is to say that to try and pretend that you can resolve these issues from the isolation of the ivory towers of Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Adelaide for that matter is a nonsense. You really have to get out there and talk to the people who are using the water. You also need to be able to agree with them that you will make decisions based on science and sound knowledge, not on emotion, ideology or the pursuit of green votes in the great urban areas based on mythology rather than on sound information. If we go back to Labor’s failings here, the reality is quite simple: they failed to properly progress the issues of investment security and property rights in the states and they failed to communicate effectively with those communities who are going to wear all the adjustment issues. That is why reform has been so delayed. It is certainly not the case that the federal government have dropped the ball on water reform. To claim that is to overlook the reality that the states have the legislative responsibility, and the necessity for them to get on with the job of delivering on it was acknowledged in the COAG agreement of 1994. They did not. We have needed a dramatic overhauling of the whole thing. It has to be said as well that, to be frank about it, the National Competition Council arrangements did not work particularly well and we need the National Water Commission to oversight water in a way that reflects a better understanding of the whole water debate in its length and its breadth. MAIN COMMITTEE It seems to be forgotten as well that the Leader of the Opposition grabbed $800 million in competition payments-if that is the way you want to look at it, in the language that they use-to fund his failed hospital policy. Of course health is important; of course our hospitals are important. But I make this point: that is for the states to look after and to meet their responsibilities on. At the time of the COAG competition payment agreements they had no knowledge at all that they were going to end up with a GST windfall. In Queensland alone, this year it is probably five times the value of the competition payments. Secondly, I make the point that they were to be discontinued after the middle of 2006. The states knew that. They were all busily writing their submissions to the government asking for it to continue. Why would they ask for it to continue? Because they knew that there was no reason for them to believe that it would automatically continue. Interestingly, they were saying there should not be any more reform. ‘We have done it all,’ they said, ‘we just want the money anyway.’ It does not wash. The Labor Party acknowledged during the campaign that the states had been slow. It acknowledged that not enough money had been going to water. Its arguments on competition payments as a justification for the states walking away are as shallow as the premiers’ arguments were when they did it. Let me come to another issue. There has been this extraordinary attempt to say, ‘Of course, water policy going back to 1994 was the Labor Party’s.’ It was a COAG agreement in 1994, and I would remind those opposite who was in government in those days. The people sitting around the COAG table at that time included the Liberal Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett; the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey; the Labor Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss; the Liberal Premier of South Australia, Dean BrownMs Burke-Where are they now? credit for it because it was a Labor agreement in 1994. I am responding to the points that you made. They always talk when they are uncomfortable. They always interrupt and interject when they are uncomfortable. They always know when their hypocrisy is highlightedRichard Court; the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom; the Liberal Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Kate Carnell; and the Country Liberal Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron. There were seven Liberal premiers and chief ministers, one Labor Premier and one Labor Prime Minister. This is just the Labor Party trying to rewrite history again. The caning that the federal Labor Party handed out to the premiers for the loss of the election shows that they do not return support with support. It is time the Labor states got on board with the NWI. We do not expect any help from the currently dysfunctional rabble that the federal Labor Party have regrettably become. I come to a couple of other issues. This idea of decoupling the National Water Initiative from the Living Murray goes right back to the heart of the issue I raised earlier. We will not progress the water issue in this country until we deal fairly and squarely with the people who have to make the adjustments. The National Water Initiative sets out the need to base decisions on science and on consultation. That is what the National Water Initiative is about. On that basis you then go on to establish property rights certainty, which is critical. Without that you will not get these communities cooperating on this great national task. It will not happen.

211,Mr Anderson,"Isn’t it wonderful? There was the Liberal Premier of Western Australia,That is the point I make. The further you live away from these rivers and the further you live away from the water users and the people who produce our food and our fibre, the less understanding you have of it and the more you have this idea that you can have this command and control approach: ‘Thou shalt give up 1,500 gigalitres.’ By the way, what is it that the Labor Party is asking for? spokesmen and 500 from others. The point is that, as was recognised by COAG, the Living Murray process is dependent upon agreement to the NWI. The principles underpinning the NWI have brought the goodwill and the cooperation of those people who are going to have to make the adjustments in our major river systems, our major water systems. Pull out the NWI and go ahead without it and you will see all of the flaring of the resistance, all of the up-inarms attitude that I do not blame country communities for showing that has stalled water reform to this point in time. I am vehemently opposed to the separation of the two. If the Living Murray process is to work, the NWI must be acknowledged and it must be, if you like, ignited and put back in place. There are a heap more things that could be said on this but I suspect time is going to run against me. The other aspect of the National Water Initiative that needs to be recognised is that it is about more than just the Murray River. During the campaign, I was intrigued while travelling through Queensland by the number of times that people said, ‘The National Water Initiative is terrific and so too is your policy of the $2 billion for water projects across the nation.’ What a stark contrast that was with the Premier of Queensland who said, ‘We signed up to the NWI but there is not much in it for Queensland.’ If he gets out there and talks to Queenslanders who are using water to create jobs, wealth, food, fibre and exports, they would tell him that the NWI is very important. That is the same right across the nation-it really is. In urban, rural, regional, coastal and remote Australia the NWI is the way forward and I do believe the state governments should sign up on it quickly. Finally, I notice some attacks on the decisions we made during the campaign have a certain flavour of deja vu about them-they were not properly costed, they were not this, they were not that. I will just say that perhaps you would like to go and suggest in relation to the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline, for example, to the Victorian government that they have not done their work properly. Perhaps the unsuccessful federal Labor Party could go to the, regrettably from my point of view, very successful Victorian Labor Party and say: ‘Listen, we know a lot about how to run a country and you obviously do not know how to run a state. We’ve been able to convince the Australian people that we don’t know how to run a place; you’ve been able to convince people that you know how to run a state. Let us tell you how to do things.’ That is a bit rough on the Victorian government, I would have thought. I will defend the Victorian government against attacks, particularly by Labor speakers from Victoria in this placeextraordinary-particularly by the member for Batman and the member for Grayndler, who have demonstrated some pretty wild, loose and woolly treatment of the truth in this place. I have got some modest amendments here which I think reflect our willingness to deal in good faith and goodwill with the states. They underscore the cooperative approach which we expect the commission to bring to its function in relation to the National Water Initiative.

213,Mr Anderson,"They don’t know yet. We have got 1,500 gigalitres from some Labortheir contribution to the debate. As I have said, we are now setting in place the elements required to continue the imperative of water reform in Australia. We secured that agreement of the National Water Initiative in June. We announced during the campaign a major investment through the Australian water fund in practical, on-the-ground water measures. We are now establishing a National Water Commission, which will help drive that national water reform process through its dual roles in the National Water Initiative on the one hand and the Australian water fund on the other. By moving the government amendments today, we are indicating the Commonwealth’s desire to work with the states to improve long-term economic, environmental and social water outcomes. We need now to move forward with this important reform agenda to improve Australia’s water management, and so I do urge state and territory governments to recommit to the initiative as quickly as possible. I believe that the parliament should now pass the bill to enable the National Water Commission to undertake its important functions to the fullest possible capacity and extent. Question agreed to.

215,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.54 A.m.),"The first observation I make about theWe will be moving an amendment seeking to delete reference to some words in subclause (4) in relation to paragraph (2)(c). We are doing this because the way in which paragraph (2)(c) is omitted has the effect of exempting the Commonwealth from conditions to be applied to the states concerning the need for the plans of parties to the National Water Initiative to be consistent with that initiative. We believe that if this is good enough for the states it ought to be good enough for the Commonwealth as well. One of the amendments which I will move seeks to ensure that we do not have that double standard. I want it to be understood by the House that in not objecting to subclause (4)-and we are quite happy to see the reference to subsection (4A) inserted-we are not acquiescing to the inclusion of paragraph (2)(c), which I intend to refer to shortly. Question agreed to. ments (1) to (6): (1) Clause 7, page 7 (lines 8-9) omit “(other than in paragraph (2)(c)”. (2) Clause 8, page 8 (line 11-14), omit subclause (2), substitute (2) Commissioners are to be appointed by the Minister, by instrument in writing, on the nomination of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework (3) Clause 8, page 8 (lines 15-17), omit subclause (3) substitute (3) A nomination of a person for appointment as a Commissioner must be made by resolution of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework (4) Clause 24, page 15 (line 14), omit “and”, substitute “or”. (5) Clause 24, page 15 (after line 14) insert “(iii) any COAG agreed programs.” (6) Clause 44, page 23 (lines 20-25), omit the clause. There are three issues that I want to make reference to in speaking in favour of these amendments. The first concerns the issue of clause 44, which is referred to in amendment (6). We propose to omit this clause because we want to see transparency in the assessments being carried out by the National Water Commission. Clause 44 says that the National Water Commission can make its assessments available to the public under a range of provisions only with the agreement of the minister. It further says that the National Water Commission must not make any other advice or recommendation available to the public. From our point of view, that is not good enough. We have to have transparency in these matters. As I indicated yesterday in my speech in the second reading debate, we have seen way too much abuse by the National Party of programs like the Natural Heritage Trust, the Envirofund, the Roads of National Importance and the Regional Partnerships program. We do not want to see the Australian water fund go the same way and be used by members opposite for pork-barrelling purposes. One of the safeguards we have for that is for this advice and these recommendations to be made public rather than kept under wraps and kept behind closed doors. So we are moving that clause 44 be deleted in the interests of transparency and in the interests of accountability. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,National Water Commission Bill 2004
216,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.57 A.m.),"by leave-I move opposition amendAsI foreshadowed, the first amendment that I moved in relation to clause 7 proposes that the words ‘other than in paragraph (2)(c)’ be omitted. Our intention in doing that is to ensure that the Commonwealth is subject to the same standards as the states in ensuring that its plans are consistent with the National Water Initiative. Paragraph (2)(c) says that we need to have plans which are consistent with the objectives, outcomes, actions and time lines stated in the National Water Initiative and to accredit those plans in accordance with the National Water Initiative. In clause 7 that does not include the Commonwealth-it is exempted from that requirement. It seems to us that the Commonwealth ought to be subject to the same provisions and obligations as the states, and therefore we are moving amendment (1), which would omit those words ‘other than in paragraph (2)(c)’. The third issue that I want to refer to is the way in which commissioners are to be appointed. As things stand, the government has the capacity to appoint the chair and three of six commissioners, which is clearly a majority. We believe that there needs to be a more cooperative arrangement. Indeed, the member for Riverina and the minister in summing up referred to the COAG process as being a cooperative arrangement. We think that ought to be reflected in the appointment of commissioners, so we are proposing changes in the wording which would ensure that commissioners are appointed by the minister on the nomination of the parties to the COAG water reform framework and that a nomination of a person for appointment as a commissioner must be made by the resolution of the parties to the COAG water reform framework. We do not want to see a situation where the Commonwealth simply says, ‘We’ve got the power to appoint a majority here and we will dominate that National Water Commission,’ and therefore prejudice and jeopardise the cooperative framework. It is important if we are to make steps forward in this area that we continue to have a cooperative framework in place rather than one of dominance of the Commonwealth, with the Commonwealth telling the states what will happen and when it will happen. That is exactly the problem that the minister was referring to in his closing remarks when he talked about the Commonwealth suddenly announcing that the way in which the National Water Initiative was to be funded would be from the competition policy payments from the states. (Extension of time granted) There had been no consultation or discussion with the states. This issue had not been flagged at the COAG meeting in June this year. No indication was given to the states that the Commonwealth intended to fund the National Water Initiative in that way. That was not a cooperative process and it was not a consultative process; that was simply the Commonwealth telling the states how things would happen. We do not want to see a continuation of that, with the Commonwealth dominating the National Water Commission appointment process in the way clause 8 proposes. I have therefore moved these amendments to clause 8. While I am on the subject of cooperative processes between the Commonwealth and the states, I note that the member for Riverina contested my analysis in the second reading debate-that is, that Labor got water reform going and the government subsequently dropped the ball. She made reference to the involvement of state Liberal governments back in 1994 when the COAG water reform agreement was hammered out. That is quite true-there were state Liberal governments involved at that time-but the issue here was national leadership, and I was calling for national leadership. That was forthcoming back in 1994 but it disappeared with the change of government in 1996. Everything I said about the absence of naMAIN COMMITTEE tional leadership on these issues by this government and its desire to abdicate responsibility to the states stands. Everything about that is correct. Frankly, the member for Riverina is one of those members who have been in denial and she is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The member for Mallee said that the National Party stands proud and that these are arguments that he has been putting for a decade. I say to the member for Mallee: why have you had to put these arguments for a decade? The reason you have had to put these arguments for a decade is that your government has abdicated national responsibility and dropped the ball. Mr Forrest interjectingstewardship of these things the health of our rivers has been going backwards, and your constituents will suffer from this neglect. he just did with his interjection then and as he did in his summing up, is still trying to blame the states and say that it is their fault. Most of his remarks he obviously plagiarised from the member for Riverina and I do not need to respond to them further. But he did refer to the decoupling of the National Water Initiative and the Living Murray initiative. The truth is that they are two different processes. What he engages in here is an excuse for inaction. Why does the minister think that Western Australia and Tasmania are not on board for the National Water Initiative? Quite clearly, it is because of this attempt on the part of the government to insist that those things be linked. In conclusion, I urge the House to support these amendments. They are amendments which are based on the important principles of transparency, accountability and cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. They are all-important elements of an appropriate and sustainable national water policy framework for this country. Question negatived. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. Debate resumed from 1 December. Second ReadingI move: That the bill be now read a second time. I think it is recognised that it is an unavoidable reality that national security remains a very high priority for the country and it certainly does for the government. It is a reflection on our times that it is essential for us to continue to protect our transport system and its passengers against very real threats. It is in this context that I present this bill for the parliament’s consideration. Aviation security is kept under constant review to ensure that measures remain appropriate to current intelligence on threats to Australian aviation.

As a result of this aviation security review, the government announced a major expansion of the nation’s aviation security regime on 4 December 2003. As a part of the expansion, background checking has been extended to a larger part of the aviation industry in recognition of the nature and level of the threat. The threat assessment has highlighted pilot identification as an important issue that must be addressed as part of aviation security requirements in Australia. Ensuring that pilots and trainee pilots are subject to security checking will reduce the likelihood of persons who might pose a threat to aviation gaining access to aircraft through legitimate means. I acknowledge that some might see the need for such scrutiny of all of our pilots as an unwelcome imposition on an innocent group within our community. On the other hand, we must move with our changing times, in which an aircraft in the wrong hands has become a lethal weapon. This bill has two parts. The first part deals with the issue of background checking of flight crew, while the second part deals with minor amendments mainly of a transitional nature. I will not dwell on the minor amendments, which deal primarily with transitional arrangements for programs approved under the Air Navigation Act after the commencement of the Aviation Transport Security Act. I will, though, focus on the changes to the background checking provisions. Currently there are legislative impediments to the most efficient implementation of the government’s decision in relation to the background checking of flight crew and trainee flight crew. The most efficient process is to fully integrate background checking into the licensing process so that we can all be assured that all holders of a pilot’s license have withstood rigorous, if confidential, scrutiny of their background. The legislative impediments are broadly the absence of a head of power in the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 which enables the background checking of pilots, and subsection 9(5) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, which prevents CASA from having responsibility for aviation security. This bill will remove those legislative impediments and provide a background checking process that is both effective and efficient. The bill inserts division 9 ‘Security Status Checking’ into the Aviation Transport Security Act. New section 74F will allow the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services to determine that a person has an adverse security status based on the results of background checks. The effects of such a declaration will be that the person is precluded from holding a security designated authorisation. A security designated authorisation will be defined in the regulations and will include, but not be limited to, all flight crew and trainee flight crew licences. This is intended to provide a mechanism preventing would be pilots assessed as having an unacceptable security history from obtaining or retaining a pilot’s licence. The procedure by which the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services will come to such a decision, and the kinds of factors which will have to be considered by the secretary in making such a decision, will be set out in the regulations. These provisions MAIN COMMITTEE have been included in acknowledgement that denying a licence is a most significant decision that has to be seen to be based on valid security concerns rather than any form of arbitrary decision making. It is envisaged that these procedures will include considering the results of a check of the person’s criminal history, their immigration status, and the results of a security assessment conducted by ASIO in relation to the person. This is the same as the checks undertaken on other aviation industry employees with access to aircraft and the secure areas of airports when they apply for an aviation security identification card (ASIC). In addition, the bill will remove the impediments to CASA having responsibility for aviation security. This is not intended to make CASA a security agency, but rather to ensure that CASA is not unnecessarily precluded from contributing to the government’s desired security outcomes through the exercise of its functions. This is a further sign of our troubled times and the extent to which ‘security is everybody’s business’: all government agencies, whether they are used to seeing themselves in such terms or not, have a contribution to make to our national security. The government is doing everything it can to ensure that all of our agencies work together in our quest for our national security. The changes contained in this bill are part of a broader government strategy of ensuring that sensitive transport infrastructure and the public at large are protected from acts of unlawful interference with transportation. They will complement the ASIC regime which applies at airports and the maritime security identification card system which will apply at ports. I present an explanatory memorandum to this bill. Bill 2004. There is no doubt that aviation security and safety is of paramount importance to all Australians. It really is a massive issue and one that needs to have the very close attention of government to ensure that its workings are robust and adequate for our environment, as people keep referring to. Aviation and security have always been a significant management and policy matter for the Australian government and, for that matter, the aviation industry. The Australian public has always had justifiably high expectations that the government will provide a stringent aviation safety and security regime. Obviously since the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, it is even more essential that governments and aviation organisations throughout the world take greater steps to guarantee the safety and security of air travellers. This bill is the latest addition and it will provide a comprehensive legislative framework for the implementation of a rigorous and robust national aviation security program. From the outset, it should be perfectly understood that Labor support the passage of this very important legislation through the parliament. But, at the same time, nobody should get carried away with congratulating the government for having done a marvellous job, something out of the ordinary or extra; nor should they think that somehow, because this bill is going through the parliament and we support it, the government has done something out of the box, as it were, to ensure a safer and more secure environment. It has done nothing more than its duty and responsibility-and, might I add, in a very lengthy manner. As I said, rather than congratulating the government, I think its approach has been extremely sloppy and tardy, particularly in its response to the nation’s need for an updated, modernised aviation security regime. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004
221,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.12 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Aviation Security AmendmentThe Howard government has been aware of the need to upgrade our security regime for quite a number of years. Back in 1998 the Australian National Audit Office released a report entitled Aviation security in Australia. This report concluded that while Australia complies with international standards, as embodied in annex 17 of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, the so-called Chicago convention, there are areas where Australia’s aviation security regime could be strengthened even further. Way back in 1998, three years before the September 11 attacks, the issue was flagged. The government knew the issue was there and the government took a very long time to react. Following those tragic attacks on the United States in September 2001, there was a renewed urgency for updating our aviation security system. It became of absolute, paramount importance. Those events fundamentally changed the way the world thinks about aviation security. We have just heard from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in this place and he made reference to changing needs and how much more needs to be done by government. Those events in the world in September 2001 highlighted how an aircraft can become a very symbolic and deadly weapon. They also highlighted that there is never room for complacency and that aviation safety and security can always be improved. I believe that, even after this bill passes through the House, there is room for improvement and there are other ways that the government can look more broadly at the transport industry, not just at aviation. It has taken the Howard government an unbelievable 2½ years-or nearly three years, in fact-after these attacks to fix our security legislation. It was not until 30 months after those events that the aviation security legislation was finally passed. The government floundered for an unacceptable period while it sought to come to grips with and understand the demands of modernising the country’s security policy framework. Despite this long delay the Howard government still did not get it right; hence the need for this legislation today. This bill, as I have just said, can be improved on. It is certainly a work in progress. It is just another in a long series of bills being presented in an almost ad hoc fashion by the government over an unnecessarily extended period of time. In fact, this bill is simply a bandaid to existing legislation which has all of the hallmarks of having been drafted on the run. It is quite amazing, given the number of years that have elapsed, that that can be the case. In public interest terms, my view is that it is completely unacceptable. This bill is a collection of legalese and bureaucratic speak which assumes that everybody fully understands the entire continuum of the legislation. It is simply a work in progress supported by benign statements of good intent and cliches about the importance of air safety and security. We have heard those again quite clearly from the minister. We got the same old words thrown out to us about how important it is and how the government is somehow better at this than anybody else. We hear the talk, but when it comes to the walk-when we actually look at the bill, how long it has taken and what is inside it-we start scratching our heads and saying, ‘Where is the rest of it and why did it take you so long?’ While the government should be harshly criticised for their ad hoc approach to this important legislative area, the real criticism should focus on the fact that the government have been so slow in responding to these very important matters of public air security. My question to the minister, although he is no longer here to hear it, is: why did it take so long to get this bill into the House? It certainly was not held up by the Labor Party-or anyone else, for that matMAIN COMMITTEE ter. At every given opportunity the government like to remind Australians that they take the issue of national security very seriously. So do we. In fact, we take it so seriously that we think the time this has taken is not acceptable. It has been nearly six years since the government first received advice from the Australian National Audit Office that Australia needed a stronger legislative and regulatory framework. Six years! It is a disgrace. I do not want to overemphasise it, but six years, when you really consider the changing environment and the rhetoric that we get from the government on this issue, is just simply not acceptable. Thank God we are actually here today with a bill that will improve the security regime. I read the comments of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, in the Senate with regard to this issue. I want to put on the record, at least in the House of Representatives, some of his comments and challenge them. The minister tried to somehow say that it was in Labor’s political interest to paint the government’s security measures over the months and years since the attacks in this way and that it was some sort of jibe to get political points. I do not think you could accept that and any reasonable person looking at it would think that. Given that it is three years since September 11 and six years since this was first flagged, and given the sort of rhetoric and need to change, I do not think it is reasonable to say that we have done this for political points. I think it would be more reasonable to say that the reason the government has introduced this bill and the reason I am in here speaking about it being so important is that we actually need air security. We actually need this legislation. But it has taken this government way too long to get it here. The minister referred to the leadership of the government, the National Security Committee, the very skilled and dedicated people doing the work in this area and how comprehensive this is. Let me just say that that might be the view of the minister but it is certainly not my view. I believe that when people see these measures, while they are very necessary, it certainly would not be their view either. The minister again talked about the government’s high-level strategy in terms of decisions it made about regional airports. In the last few minutes I have, I want to specifically outline a case in which I can demonstrate the government’s haphazard approach and lack of security. I am not just talking about regional airports; I am talking about major airports where the system, the regime, has failed. There is nothing in this bill that will address those issues. I am not talking about something that might happen; I am talking about something that has already happened. I read carefully the comments of Senator Ian Campbell, and his view about the security regime concerns me. He talked more about great democracies, presidencies of the United States and ASIO-it almost read like a grade 12 speech that somebody made on an issue that they did not quite understand-than about the actual matters of security in the legislation itself. The bill is supported by the Labor Party and does some very important things. I want to put on the record the two significant parts of the bill. The first schedule amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and also the Civil Aviation Act 1988. It allows for background checking of persons who have access to secured areas, restricted areas, within airports, and that would also extend of course to regional airports. These are the people who are required to hold an ASIC, an aviation security identification card. The cards cannot be issued to persons who, amongst other things, have a criminal record, are considered by the secretary to constitute a threat to aviation security, are unlawful noncitizens and so forth. An important part of MAIN COMMITTEE the security regime is that, in trying to make sure those secured areas within airports are safe, we as passengers-the travelling public-the government, the authorities, CASA and everyone else who is involved in this feel some level of confidence that, by this regime coming in, the people who are contained in those designated areas have had security and background checks. The legislation also goes further to allow CASA, as a delegated authority, to do the background checking of pilots and prospective pilots and also, very importantly-and maybe even more importantly-of aircrew and people who work in air services around aircraft. We have seen a number of minor incidents to date where that issue is obviously of great importance. It means that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority will for the first time play a role in aviation security, not just safety. I think this is a positive move. It is something that we on this side support, and it probably should have been done some time ago. The mere fact that CASA will take on this new security role highlights the approach taken by not just Australia but all countries in terms of our new security regime. I would like to discuss a number of other issues, but I am conscious of the time. With the House adjourning soon, I would like to put on the record now that I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks later. While I have time now, I want to raise a very specific issue about this bill which I think should be of grave concern to the government and which the government should take note of. I want to relate the details of an incident that happened on Friday, 23 July 2004, on flight EK421 at 10.30 p.m., involving a passenger who was a Kenyan resident. This passenger was, by mistake-and I know government members are dealing with some things at the moment, but they should pay very close attention to this-boarded on the flight without going through the correct procedures; that is, the passenger was not checked for a passport, was not checked through immigration control and was given no security checks whatsoever. It is beyond belief that in mid-2004 it would be possible for any passenger on an international flight at a major airport-in this case, Perth airport-to pass through the system and board an aircraft without having a passport check, an immigration control security check or, for that matter, any other check. Apparently that specific passenger had a broken leg or something of that description and was late for the plane and they rushed the person through. The person had checked in late but, before the aircraft had taken off, the agent, the security person responsible for taking care of this vital security program at the airport, notified their supervisor of the error of allowing this person, a Kenyan resident, to board an international flight at Perth airport, a major airport in Australia. That supervisor made the decision not to inform the airline and allowed the plane to leave. That is a shocking revelation and has some frightening connotations attached to it. That supervisor then reported this to their manager, who later instructed the supervisor to suspend the agent, the security contractor who had allowed that to happen. The following day, that agent was interviewed by a manager and their employment was terminated. That discussion might be for another place, but I want to specifically raise my concerns about the security matter itself. What concerns me is what unfolded through that episode: the manager of that airport security warned all the staff not to speak about this incident as it would be likely that people would be sacked-they would lose their jobs or their public security contracts-if it were found that they allowed a breach of security to happen. Mr Brendan O’Connor-It’s ironic. MAIN COMMITTEE we have security people contracted to ensure our safety. We can have all the legislation in the world but it will do absolutely nothing if it fails at the delivery end when a person makes a mistake, reports it to a supervisor, and the supervisor and managers make a decision to allow that flight to continue. That is of grave concern to me. While there have been a number of government members coming in and out of here, I am a little bit concerned that they seem to be almost unconcerned about this issue. They seem not to think that this may be important, and that is even more frightening for me. It came out later through some questioning in the Industrial Relations Commission that the manager from the organisation that allowed this aircraft to leave stated that the reason he allowed it to leave was that it would have cost them $300,000 to dump the fuel and return the aircraft to the home base. An economic decision overrode what I believe was a much more important security decision. We are in this House talking about very important security improvements at regional airports and background checking of prospective pilots, aircrew and so forth. That is all fine and well and we support it, but the system falls down at the coalface when a passenger, a Kenyan resident, is allowed to board an international flight without any checks whatsoever. When that happens, there is a grave problem with the security regime in Australia, and this government does not seem either to be aware of it or to be doing anything about it. It gets worse though, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick; you would think that was bad enough. After the person involved admitted they had made a mistake, reported it and was sacked, they took their case to the Industrial Relations Commission. The case was bound by secrecy. They chose not to follow through with the case so that they were able to speak out on this matterthey thought it was so serious. I commend that person for doing this. But it raises a number of very serious issues that the government should take specific note of. Firstly, there is the issue of having a security regime in this country where security contractors at airports allow this sort of thing to happen after a mistake has been made. There is an environment of fear and intimidation when a person who makes a mistake and reports it, as they should, gets sacked for it-word gets around pretty quickly-and then the manager instructs people not to tell anyone about their mistakes. The environment is going to fall to bits and the legislation we have here will be worth absolutely nothing if this is allowed to happen, because people will not report their mistakes. They will do their job but if a mistake is made they will bury it under the carpet and hide it. This is not an acceptable situation. My questions to the minister are simple. Is the minister aware of this and, if the minister is aware of this, what is the minister doing about it? If the minister is not aware of this, why not? It raises a whole range of issues when the intimidatory practices that might be enforced by these security firms on their own employees therefore reduce the level of security. If somebody does make a mistake, reports it, and a plane is allowed to take off, what is the point of having a security check in the first place? And we are actually talking about a person who is known. The more startling fact about all of this is that there was actually a warrant out for the arrest of this person. This person was a person of concern and yet they were allowed to board this plane with no security checks. In the few seconds I have left, I want to say that we do support this bill but we plead with the government to do something serious rather than just MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004

Avalon Airport have consistently argued for, lobbied for and promoted the development of Avalon airport in my electorate as a vehicle for job creation and future economic growth in the Geelong region. For the benefit of the House, let me briefly outline the potential of this extraordinary infrastructure asset. Avalon airport was formerly owned by the Commonwealth. It was sold in the early years of the Howard government to trucking magnate Lindsay Fox. Its economic potential base lies in three areas: a training facility for airlines, an international and domestic passenger and freight centre, and a manufacturing precinct for avionics and aircraft refurbishment activities. My particular interest in the airport has concerned its development as a passenger and, in particular, freight facility, as well as its potential as a manufacturing precinct. Early in my time as member for Corio, I promoted Avalon as an air freight centre as it lies at the juxtaposition of other major transport assets-namely, the Princes Highway, the national standard gauge rail line and the port of Geelong, with ample surrounding land for future development. My interest was primarily in agricultural freight, drawing produce from a four-state hinterland, including productive Victoria, South Australia, the Riverina in New South Wales, and Tasmania. It was a dream shared by the great Ross Mellor of the Habitat Trust. My reason for supporting its development lay in using this infrastructure asset to reshape Geelong’s economic base-diversify it and expand it-and provide an alternative option to the region in the face of structural changes to Geelong’s manufacturing base, particularly in motor vehicle manufacturing and in textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing. Given that central to the Avalon vision was the export of agricultural products, an important part of the Avalon puzzle was the movement of the fruit and vegetable market from Footscray to the Werribee corridor, to give further critical mass to the Avalon operation. I understand the matter is under active consideration by the Bracks government, and I would urge that it give serious consideration to the proposal in view of the substantial infrastructure and other developments that have taken place in recent years-namely, the third lane on the Princes Highway and the commencement of Jetstar’s operation at Avalon-and future ones, such as the Geelong bypass, that have already been committed to by both sides of the House in the Commonwealth parliament and by state parliaments. I understand the relocation will stimulate an initial investment of $300 million, with $1 billion additional investment over 20 years from the private sector. It is my view that the latter figure is understated, should the facility be located in the Melbourne-Geelong corridor close to the Avalon precinct. It would provide a huge stimulus not only to fruit and vegetable production and export in this state but also to the production of flowers and value-added seafood MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004

224,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (12.30 P.m.),"Since entering this parliament in 1993, Iproducts, particularly in the south-west and north of the state and in the local Werribee area. I have written to the Premier of Victoria and his ministers on the matter and genuinely hope that, when the decision is made, it takes full advantage of the extraordinary infrastructure assets of the airport at Avalon and the ample land around it, the port and the well-developed road and rail network. Australia’s export performance has deteriorated markedly over the wasted years of the Howard government. Given that we are now at the beginning of a new federal political cycle, and acknowledging the government’s fetish for bilateral free trade agreements, it is likely that over the next 10 years there will be considerable pressure on Geelong’s manufacturing firms. The recent signing of the FTAs with the USA and Thailand and the discussions under way with China and ASEAN nations will put further pressure on our automotive and TCF industries. I am not convinced that the Geelong community is aware of and focused enough on the impact these changes might have on our manufacturing base, and I will be taking steps in 2005 to stimulate community debate and discussion on these matters and to plan strategies to prepare for these substantial changes. It is imperative that Geelong diversifies its manufacturing and service base and pursues new avenues of regional job creation and growth. The location of the fruit, vegetable and flower markets in the Melbourne-Geelong corridor, preferably near to Avalon, will provide additional stimulus to the further development of Avalon, most certainly stimulate further agricultural production in the immediate hinterland, provide a huge boost to regional job creation and growth, and go a long way to achieving a broad diversification of Geelong’s economic base. It is my view that it makes good economic sense to provide new job opportunities in this area of the state given the huge challenges the community will face and the changes that will take place to its economic base in coming years. Zimbabwe in relation to the terrible situation in Zimbabwe, where the dictator Robert Mugabe is guilty of a whole range of offences. It is a situation where you have home invasions and people have their farms seized from them. The rule of law has been torn up and torture is the order of the day. Today in the parliament I have been asked by the Zimbabwean community on the Sunshine Coast to raise the plight of Roy Bennett, a member of the Zimbabwean parliament, an opposition member who won an almost totally black seat. In doing so, because he is a white man, he offended the ruling regime. In particular, I have been asked to raise the plight of this gentleman’s wife, Heather Bennett. I want to quote from a letter that I have received. The letter says: I met a very brave woman this week. Heather is 42 and married with two teenage children. Her 18 year old son has recently left home and her daughter is at boarding school and about to write public exams. These are about the only normal things left in Heather’s life after almost five years of hell. As we sat and talked Heather’s phone rang almost incessantly, but we had time to have a cup of coffee together. It was a very special coffee, home grown on their farm in Chimanimani. Heather is the wife of an opposition Member of Parliament and she and her husband have lost everything in their determination to bring democratic governance to Zimbabwe. Being married to an MP hasn’t meant chauffeur driven limousines, exotic weekend retreats and lavish dinner parties for Heather. It has meant rape, torture, murder, arson, looting and theft. All of these horrors have become personal experiences as they had happened directly to Heather and Roy Bennett and their friends and employees MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
225,Mr Slipper (Fisher (12.35 P.m.),"I have spoken out in the parliament and more widelyin the past five years. None of the crimes committed against the Bennetts and their employees have been resolved. None of the perpetrators have been sentenced or imprisoned and none of the court rulings issued in favour of the Bennetts have been upheld or obeyed by Zimbabwe’s police. Being married to an MDC MP has meant fear, anguish and enormous personal sacrifice for Heather but amazingly, even now with her husband in prison, she is not angry and bitter or baying for blood and revenge. It is unlikely, but not yet clear, if Roy Bennett will be allowed to stand for Parliament again now that he has been convicted for pushing an MP to the floor and sentenced to a year in prison for the offence. Heather told me that even if Roy could never represent the people of Chimanimani in Parliament again, the five years have not been wasted. The Bennetts have stood up for what is right, spoken for those who cannot and helped build the New Zimbabwe we are all fighting for. Heather says at the moment she feels like she’s flailing in a raging waterfall with demands tugging at her from all directions. But her focus is entirely on her husband, his safety and his health in prison. Heather can only visit Roy once every two weeks for ten minutes. All she can take him is a 50ml tube of toothpaste, a bar of carbolic soap, a small jar of vaseline and 6 individual pieces of fruit. This ten minutes every fourteen days has become the focus of Heather’s life and she said it takes every ounce of her self control to get through those ten minutes without crying. For pushing an MP who was shouting abuse at him in Parliament, Roy Bennett is sharing a four man cell with 17 other people. He is dressed in rags and working all day in the fields at Harare Central Prison. When I left HeatherI drove past the Harare central prison this week so that I could describe the view. In temperatures of over 30 degrees C, men wearing ragged white shorts and short sleeved tops, trudge barefoot, without hats, in the burning sun carrying buckets. They walk to the river, bend, fill their buckets and carry the water back to pour on the vegetables. Others carry hoes and they bend and weed between lines of straggling greenery, watched by a bored prison official. For almost five years I have been writing this letter to the world about events in Zimbabwe. It is men and women like Roy and Heather Bennett whose unceasing bravery and determination have given me the courage to keep going. When I left Heather this week I was ashamed that all I could offer as thanks for their example and inspiration was my words. Roy Bennett did not steal or loot, burn, torture, rape or murder, he pushed a man to the floor ... Roy Bennett ... was sentenced by a partisan committee dominated by ZANU (PF) of the Parliament of Zimbabwe to an effective one-year in prison ... This sentence is unprecedented throughout the world. His ‘crime’ was to push over in Parliament the Minister of Justice ... who during debate had insulted and provoked Bennett beyond reason, calling his late father and grandfather ‘thieves and murderers’. This ‘offence’ would have attracted a small fine had it been tried in a Zimbabwean court. This is an outrageous situation and the world needs to be alerted to the appalling activities in Zimbabwe.

Some argue that the path to economic credibility for Labor lies in parting company with the industrial wing of the Labor movement. Some contend that Labor’s industrial relations policy should be reshaped to meet the concerns of business organisations like the BCA and the ACCI. Others see electoral salvation in embracing the growing number of workers who are contractors, not employees. I regard these views as misconceived.

226,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.52 P.m.),"Once again, a federal Labor election defeat haspost-election experience of 2002 when the vital process of party reform was diverted into a self-lacerating and largely pointless debate about whether unions should have 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the votes in Labor forums. Distancing Labor from its trade union connections is not going to deliver economic credibility for Labor. Adopting the big business lobby’s industrial relations policies will not deliver better economic outcomes for working people. It has become fashionable to give credit for Australia’s current economic prosperity to the Hawke and Keating governments. This is a good thing; that credit is well deserved. What is now largely forgotten, however, is that Hawke and Keating had a partner-the trade union movement. When credit for our prosperity is being handed around, a significant share belongs to the ACTU and to people like Bill Kelty, Laurie Carmichael, Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson. Trade union cooperation with difficult economic reforms provided the foundation for the success of the Hawke and Keating governments. That era is now over and there is no suggestion that the accord should be revived. The Australian economy, workplace and work force are now very different from 15 or 20 years ago. Yet the lesson of this era for Labor remains a powerful one. We need to engage with the trade union movement, with the common aim of building a stronger, more competitive Australian economy. Rather than distancing ourselves from trade unions, we should be challenging the union movement to contribute more strongly to the renewal of Labor’s agenda to build a better Australia. Such greater engagement will inevitably involve pain and controversy. The union movement has often been in a defensive, sometimes reactive, position during the Howard years-and understandably so. Breaking that pattern will not be easy. There is a need for reform of our industrial relations system-but not the kind of reform that John Howard has in mind. Instead of exposing vulnerable low-paid workers to exploitation through individual contracts, we should be establishing new mechanisms to enable workers to upgrade their skills-the true source of job security. Instead of abolishing the right of workers to obtain redress for unfair dismissal, we should make the system simpler and cheaper by restricting the involvement of lawyers. Instead of further restricting the ability of workers and unions to collectively bargain, we should be developing the next wave of improvements to our superannuation system. At a time when industrial disputes are at a record low level, it is ridiculous to claim that trade unions are a threat to Australia’s future prosperity. The challenge for Labor is not to walk away from the union movement but to engage constructively with unions and with other groups to address the many difficult economic and social issues facing our nation. Renewing our national infrastructure, upgrading our skills and reviving our non-commodity exports will require big thinking and hard work. As representatives of two million working Australians, the trade union movement have a major role to play in this process. As the party of working men and women, Labor has a responsibility to these people to improve their living standards and life opportunities, along with those of the millions of other Australians who work for their living. Hastings: HMAS Otama Heritage) (12.56 p.m.)-Earlier this week I addressed the House on a plan for the development and improvement of Hastings and Somerville. I outlined four elements. I wish to give MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
227,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andthis speech today to focus on a twin to the plan-the progress and development of the Hastings submarine project. The background is that, under the Federation Fund, the Commonwealth allocated to the Western Port Oberon Association HMAS Otama, which is an Oberon class submarine which has now been retired. As part of the grant under the Federation Fund, the Oberon association was given the submarine and $500,000, with a fee of $50,000 deducted for the price of the submarine. The submarine is currently moored off Crib Point and is awaiting a series of development approvals before it can be placed adjacent to the foreshore at Hastings for the benefit of the townspeople of Hastings, the Mornington Peninsula and tourism throughout Victoria. I want to commend the HMAS Otama project and all those involved. I believe that the very recent appointment of a specialist chair to the Western Port Oberon Association, Mr Kevin Shea, is a defining point in the progress of this submarine and the entire submarine project. It someone who has experience as a former managing director of the Port of Melbourne Authority, who has very good links with the state government and who has admirable corporate as well as maritime experience-is a great step forward. As part of that, I want to congratulate the president of the Oberon association, Mr Max Bryant, and the executive and all the members of the Oberon association for their unstinting commitment to the Hastings submarine project. This project is critical for Hastings. The independent assessment prepared for the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council by MacroPlan estimated a gross annual benefit to the town of Hastings of approximately $4 million through the placement and development of the submarine project. It is in fact an ideal modern tourism project. It has no impact on the environment, it is a great educational project and it provides icon status to the town of Hastings, which has been through hard times but which is making tremendous strides forward. It is twinned with proposals for marine education, the Coleman statue and a plan to use the waterfront at Hastings in a way which benefits the people of this beautiful area. The submarine, I think, would be an iconic form of identity for the town of Hastings. It would complement the existing steps forward being taken. In addition to that, it would provide an area of pride and excitement for the primary school kids and people throughout the region. Already, primary school children are very excited about the project. Against that background, I understand that there is a small minority of people who consistently oppose this project. That is disappointing because it is both economically and environmentally sustainable, it grows from the community and it has overwhelming community support. I would respectfully ask those people to enter into dialogue, look at the benefits which it would bring to the community and not place their views in front of the overwhelming support of the community. The next steps are as follows. Firstly, under the chairmanship of Mr Shea we need to bring together the state, the council, the marina, the yacht club, the fishing club and any other interested parties to work on a common understanding and plan for the foreshore area in Hastings and the way in which the submarine can be involved. Secondly, we must bring together funding. There has already been $500,000 in Commonwealth funding. We look to the state for planning approval but also funding approval. In addition to that, we look for any private contribution on a philanthropic basis. Thirdly, under Kevin Shea, if we can pull together all of the people who have been involved then this project can come to fruition. I commend to the MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Adjournment

(Time expired) Medicare: Bulk-Billing Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (1.02 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I would like to congratulate you on your reappointment to the position of Deputy Speaker and thank you for allowing us to continue the debate today. The health of our nation is vitally important. An editorial in the Financial Review prior to the election I think sums it up very well. It says: Australia’s health-care system does a good job for most of us, and our health outcomes are generally among the best in the world. But they should be, since we have a younger population than most rich countries and a climate that encourages healthy lifestyles. And health is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status, with Aborigines and other disadvantaged groups falling further behind, suggesting there is too little preventive and co-ordinated care. The biggest obstacle to better health care is the fragmented structure of the system. The commonwealth directly funds out-of-hospital care through Medicare Benefits and pharmaceuticals, and jointly funds public hospitals with the states, which manage them. It also encourages people to take out private health insurance through lifetime cover and $2.3 billion of subsidies ... As a result no one actually takes responsibility for ensuring the entire $67 billion is being spent as well as it can be. The election gave all sides of politics a great opportunity to actually sit down and say: ‘This is broken; we need to fix it. Let us go back to basics and see where the health system needs to be mended.’ But, no, the Howard government had no intention of doing that. Its intention was to come up with quick political fixes that will continue to need bandaid resolutions. The Financial Review article also says: Like a harried emergency ward doctor, Health Minister Tony Abbott rushes around patching up the health-care system with an injection of funding here, a prescription of cash there and a constant patter of analgesic words. The latest additions to the Fairer Medicare package-extra bulk billing incentives in marginal seats and more generous private health insurance rebates for seniors-will lift its cost over three to four years to about $3.3 billion. They describe the Minister for Health and Ageing as rushing here and there patching things up but not coming up with good outcomes. We saw the introduction of what is known as MedicarePlus. That was when the government realised that people were concerned about falling bulk-billing rates. The Labor Party had run a very successful campaign emphasising that bulk-billing was in serious decline. So GPs who bulk-billed Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 would receive an extra $5 or $7.50, depending on their location, for each person they bulk-billed. We remember that one. All of Tassie got the $7.50, regardless of whether or not they were regional or remote. That was to assuage Senator Harradine. I found that quite amazing, because at the time the bulk-billing rate in the seat of Denison down in Tassie was higher than the bulk-billing rate in the seat of Deakin, adjacent to my electorate in metropolitan Melbourne, where they were getting only $5. As the Financial Review editorial points out, they worked out that outer metropolitan seats across the country need some extra money, so they all got $7.50. But this is not working. A recent email from a doctor in my electorate says: I am writing to you as my local member. For the past two weeks the Health Insurance Commission has crosslinked data to Centrelink to determine whether patients are eligible for Medicare Plus copayment items. This data link appears to be deMAIN COMMITTEE fective and Medicare claims for numbers of patients are being rejected by the HIC. These are patients for whom my practice holds ostensibly accurate current Centrelink details, including documentation sighted at the time of consultation. This is occurring in general practices all over the country. When Medicare is contacted, they require that written details be separately submitted for each rejected claim and have withheld payment until each has been resolved. This affects the most at-risk impecunious patients who would be least able to afford to be seen were doctors to cease bulk-billing them until the problem is resolved. An urgent policy solution is needed, namely that the claims be paid as previously and that the onus for ensuring that Centrelink documentation is both intrinsically correct and correctly linked to Medicare data be taken back to the relevant Government instrumentalities. Fraudulent claims by patients or doctors would be dealt with in the normal manner. This is an urgent matter, as the current policy will soon spill into public notice and could easily result in the suspension of GP bulk-billing. I look forward to some quick action. This is not an isolated instance; it is happening all over the place. Doctors who were reliant on that $5 are no longer getting it and they are spending an inordinate amount of time and resources demonstrating to the HIC that these patients deserve the $5. This is meant to be a quick fix but it is becoming a nightmare, and it needs to be resolved now. It is fairly simple: Centrelink has the data and HIC has the data. It should not be up to local GPs, who are already stretched to the hilt, to resolve a government problem. Main Committee adjourned at 1.07 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Adjournment
