In to-day's Argusi t is stated that some eleven Chinamen have just come here on permits which were issued by the States Governments some time ago.

What is the result""! The balance of the Commonwealth's share of Customs revenue has gone into the coffers of the States, and has been expended by them.. That fact not only prevents us from making use of it in order to avoid the necessity for borrowing, but it has also exercised a bad effect in that the States now regard the sum provided by the Treasurer as likely to be forthcoming for their future wants. Consequently venue, we shall to that extent leave them in the lurch. If we do leave them in the. lurch, will not their deficiencies-for all of them have deficiencies-be and shall we not avert borrowing ourselves merely by compelling them to borrow ? That is one aspect of the'question. be said that, whilst our initial opportunity has been lost, we have still before us the coming year, and that profiting .by our experience we may appropriate the balance of our share of Customs revenue for the purposes for which it is now proposed to borrow. Can this be done 1 I entertain very grave doubts upon the question. place, we do not yet know in what form the Tariff will be finally passed, and, therefore, we cannot estimate with any probability of accuracy the revenue which it will yield. We have further to recognise that in two of the States, at any rate, very serious conditions exist-conditions tainly affect their revenue during the coming year, and perhaps, also, during the subsequent year. The drought in New South Wales and Queensland has not yet seriously decreased the volume of their but nothing is more certain than that if their exports are considerably reduced, their imports will shrink. contingency will not arise must be based upon the hope that there will be a sufficient rise in wool values in the markets of the world-especially -to counterbalance the deficiency in the quantity exported. in wool values occurred it might create a large fall in revenue, but we cannot prognosticate the future of the wool market Mr Thomson. with any certainty. Then we have to consider that the .Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall take over certain month by month amongst the departments which have not yet been transferred. For instance, it must assume conBill, trol of lighthouses, quarantine, &c, which are spending departments, and not to However, we did not do so. any extent revenue-producing. Another important question which has yet to be settled is the method by which payment is to be made for the buildings already taken over by the Commonwealth in connection with the transferred depart ments. The States appear to be very strong in their desire to be relieved of a portion of their debts equivalent to the value of their buildings, and if they succeed in obtaining their desire-o r even if if we withdraw that rethe adjustment proposed by the Ministry takes place the Commonwealth will have to provide for the payment of almost a considerable sum in interest The increased, question therefore arises "" Can we meet all these necessities out of our one-fourth share of the Customs revenue, whilst the But it may Braddon clause""-whic h contains some good, but also some ill-""continue s to hamper our operations ?"" I do not think so. By so doing we should inevitably paralyze the departments, and desirous as I am that we should avoid borrowing I could not contemplate the possibility of the Commonwealth taking over great commercial departments like the In the first Pos'toffice, and not only failing to administer them as effectively as they were conducted by the States, but actually running them to a stand-still. These are questions upon which I wish to to satisfied, and at a later period-possibly when the committee stage is reachedI should like the Treasurer to which must cergive us certain information. I should like him to tell us what has been the monthly net revenue and expenditure of the Commonwealth since its establishment, in order that we may see what balance' of our oneimportations, fourth of the Customs revenue is available. Our only hope that this would not be of much use, because all the heavy payments have to be made this month. in the price of merino wool for the whole period, and an estimate for this month, they would certainly be someIf such an increase thing in the nature of a guide. They would also enable us to see the effect upon the revenue of certain duties which were remitted by this House. Honourable members would then be in a position to judge",17,Torneh
20,Sir George Turner,That information,18,Torneh
21,Mr Thomson,"If we had the figureswhether we are able to do without borrowing for the purposes specified in this Bill, or whether the £50,000 or £100,000 a month -a t which rate, I presume, this expenditure will take place-ca n be provided for some months out of revenue. It is my intention to vote for the second reading of the Bill so that this information can be supplied in committee. If the Treasurer can show that he will not have a sufficiency of revenue to provide for these necessities after deducting the expenditure of the Commonwealth from the one-fourth of the Customs revenue, there will be no reason for us to authorize borrowing. If we could settle this question once and for all at the present time-n o matter what the temporary inconvenience might beI should now refuse my assent to the Government proposal. But I recognise that if the matters to which I have alluded are in the near future to absorb the whole of our fourth share of the Customs revenue, any postponement of borrowing will not overcome the difficulty. We should have to face it at a comparatively early stage, when the absorption of ' all our share of the revenue took place. Consequently, as I say, this is not a temporary question. If it were merely a temporary difficulty we ought to face it now. Buti f we have to meet the same difficulty some little time hence, when the whole of our revenue is absorbed, and there is no provision for items such as these, then we face the whole situation now. That is all I have to say on the question of borrowing, and any further remarks will be devoted to the question of the sinking fund. The Treasurer seems to have greater faith in the efficiency of sinking funds than have many honourable members. ber will perceive that he is going beyond any such public works, buildings, or underthe matters provided for in the Bill, and is takings, or matters connected therewith. now discussing a question which will arise I have always found great unwillingness in connection with Order of the Day No. 3. on the part of Treasurers to meet out of made may be a little outside the Bill, buildings or works ; but here we go a step although I think I can put it in order by further, and having actually spent some pointing out what effect a sinking fund money out of revenue, we provide, in fear will have in connection with the loan. The that we shall be virtuous even to that small Treasurer, in introducing the Bill, said troducing another measui^e, which I cannot allow to be discussed now. gress any of the rules. in committee with any one Bill until we have passed the second reading of the three. time that I referred to the cognate subject of a sinking fund. However, I can leave my remarks on that subject to a later stage. A t any rate, the question we have to face is borrowing or no borrowing. If I could see my way perfectly clear to refuse to borrow under any circumstances, I should vote against the second reading of the Bill, being fully impressed with the desirability of the Commonwealth not adding to the borrowings of the Statesi f that step can be avoided. But I desire further and fuller information from the Treasurer before deciding whether to accept, reject, or t r y to modify the Loan Bill, and in the meantime shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, awaiting the committee stage as the most convenient for obtaini ng that information. I did hope that at the start of the Commonwealth we should have begun to act on something like sound financial principlesthat we should not have fallen into the same haphazard, hand-to-mouth methods which have hitherto been adopted in all the States. We have before us in the near future great undertakings, and yet here we have before us a little b it of a Bill-that is, little in comparison with what we must expect in the future-providin g for the borrowing of £1,000,000 in order to make additions and improvements to post-offices and telephone switchboards.

Of course, it is said that we are a new and progressive country, and that it is, therefore, impossible for us to avoid borrowing. ^ But I suppose it will be admitted that for the last 30 or 40 years Japan has been a progressive country, which, in addition, has had to meet the expenditure of a big war. Japan has had to build a large navy, and in modern times there is nothing so expensive. But how does Japan stand ? In that country there are 44,000,000 people, and their existing debt, including that of the war, is £50,000,000. During the last 32 years Japan has repaid £11,000,000 of the principal of their debt, and of the remaining debt some £20,000,000 is represented by remunerative works. We, apparently, never think nowadays of paying back any principal. In Japan the people are lightly taxed; there are small taxes on wine, spirits, and tobacco, but none on tea, silk or beer. Mr L. E. G ROOM -Where"" does Japan get her revenue 1 without that kind of taxation. The claim that a young country must borrow is not justified by facts or experience. Canada is quite as progressive a country as is Australia, and the public debt of the Dominion is hardly equal to that of Victoria alone, namely, about £50,000,000. must be deducted from the public debt of Victoria. matters to be considered. Canada, as mentioned by the honourable and of public buildings ought to be made a learned member, include the States' debts 1 burden on posterity ? .Federal debt. with the debt of Canada as a whole; but they mean, are really maintenance proposals. honourable members will find that the States' No doubt they are proposals for the improvedebts in the Dominion are far less in proment of buildings, but, at the same time, portion than those of the Australian States. we can improve a building in a way which I have looked into this matter somewhat really saves us the cost of repairing it, and closely, and I find that all financial writers enables to throw on loan moneys burdens agree that there is no country in the world which ought to be borne by revenue. Good with such a heavy debt in proportion to population as has Australia. Even after allowing for all the public works, it is found that A.ustraJia is the most heavily burdened country in the world in proportion to population.. Of course we have to take facts as they are; but I did hope that when we started federation we should refuse to pursue the same old thriftless, shiftless course which the States have followed. No one will deny that there have been good works carried out by the States. Government of Canada to hand back three-fourths of the revenue to the States? to follow my own track of argument, whether it be right or wrong. I have not had time to get all the figures here necessary to answer every question, but if we take the public debts of Canada, both Dominion and State, we shall find that her liabilities per head are nothing compared with those of the Australian States. exclude the cost of the railways ? The question now before us seems to me of infinitely more importance to our future than that of the Tariff. The Tariff is very important to individual industries, and to the flow of trade; but this Bill, which we are apparently asked to pass without much debate, involves a question which transcends in importance, all other questions, including that of the Tariff. The theory is that this borrowing is for the relief of the taxpayerthat the present taxpayer ought not to be compelled to bear the whole burden of that which is of permanent use to the country. learned member mean that the maintenance It is the whole of the posterity ought to pay for the maintenance of public buildings, and the honourable member has hit one of the main flaws in the Bill.

As I was saying, the whole theory is that this borrowing is a relief to the taxpayer. But even supposing that all the works which have been done out of loan money had been done out of revenue, the taxpayer would not have paid one penny more, and we should not have had an)' debc. I had the advantage a few years ago, through the kindness of >the present Treasurer, of having a statement laid before the Victorian Parliament showing the interest and expenses in connection with our Victorian debt up to the end of June, 1898. A t that time the Victorian debt amounted -to about £48,000,000, and about£40,000,000 had been paid in interest upon it, while the expenses of flotation, including brokerage and discount, had amounted to over £500,000 Now, however, the amount of the Victorian debt is actually less than the amount of interest which has been paid upon it, so that the poor taxpayers, whom it was proposed to relieve, have had actually to pay more interest than the principal which has been borrowed, and, to put an extreme case, if we had paid for all our works and built our railways . with revenue, we should have had no more to pay, and we should not be owing the amount which we are now owing. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN works have earned the interest upon the debt. orthodox parties in this House do not seem to realize our financial position. Though we all deprecate borrowing, and are very sorry that loans have to be raised, we still give our consent to them. It is now proposed to borrow £1,000,000. Having regard to the present state of the London money market, it is probable that, while we -give bonds for £1,000,000, we shall receive only £940,000 in cash, and we shall have to pay 3 per cent., or £30,000 a year as interest in perpetuity. There are 'a host of requirements for which, as a civilized community, we should provide, but we are -unable to do so because so much of our revenue goes to pay interest. I do. not know how it is in other States, but I -know that in Victoria there is a strone; not taken from the sinking fund. It was movement in favour of better technical and other education. Still, as we have not sufficient revenue, we must cut down our expenditure in those directions. We should also do something in the matter of prison reform, but we have not the money. No matter how useful a thing may be, we are told that there is no money for it, and the re-venue is more and more reduced by the piling up of interest as new loans are floated. The argument that has been advanced is that it is not just and fair for the present generation to bear the cost of permanent public works. But that argument was used twenty or thirty years ago, with the result that they spent the money that we are earning now, and we are proposing to forestall and to spend what will be earned by people living twenty or thirty years hence. I feel that the argument has been pushed too far, and I want the House to recognise that many of the works for which we are borrowing are not permanent, though they may be quasi-permanent, in the sense that there will always be something of the kind in existence. The course ""of modern improvement is so rapid now-a-days that that which is useful to-day has become antiquated to-morrow. If we spend money on switchboards to-day, boards of an improved character, or, perhaps, an entirely different device, will be necessary a few years hence. admits that one of these boards, which has been in use for only four years, is already But the public old. of borrowing tends to prevent us from I am sorry that the adopting new improvements. When we have spent loan money upon a particular asset, we do not feel justified in wiping out that asset to adopt an improvement, whereas if we had spent only revenue upon it , we should not have that scruple. Thus the borrowing system is a drag upon our progress, and prevents the adoption of improvements. The Treasurer, to make this pill as sweet as he can, has told us that he intends to establish a sinking fund. I like the idea of sinking funds, if they are likely to remain sinking funds ; but the Treasurer knows that £50,000 was, by the Ministry which succeeded his, taken out of the sinking fund which he established in Victoria three or four years ago.",20,Torneh

It would be quite sufficient if the Treasurer were to come down with proposals for borrowing in connection with large operations of that kind, and not for finicing works such as those which it is now intended to provide for. The fact is that we appear to be like a number of men who have borrowed as much as they can as individuals, and who have formed a limited company so that they may issue more debentures and go on borrowing. By our federation we have created a new borrowing machine over our heads.

I read recently a prophecy which was made by Sir Francis Bell before the Royal Colonial Institute, in London, in 1882. That prophecy has not been fulfilled. Sir Francis Bell thought that within twenty years from that d a t e by about this time we should have had a loan indebtedness amounting to £200,000,000. So we have. He also thought that we should have about six times the population that we have.

78,Mr Higgins,"The sooner we stophonorable and learned member who has just sat down has very justly pointed out some of the evils of borrowing. The honourable member for North Sydney pointed out that, on the Treasurer's showing, there was a surplus of £500,000 over and above the amount of money which had to be given back to the States. It is quite true that the Treasurer says-and I think he is to a certain extent justified in so saying-that there will be a less volume of imports next year, or as soon as the effects of the drought and general depression are felt to the fullest extent, and that, therefore, the surplus will diminish. It is only fair, however, to point out that hitherto the volume of imports in times of drought has been greater, or at least , equal to, that of ordinary times, this being clue, of course, to the importation of borrowed money or its equivalent in goods. Therefore, it is fair to assume that the States will have recourse to fresh loans to cover their present distress and discomfiture, and that in the ensuing years there will not be an appreciable falling off in the volume of imports. There is no necessity to review the financial position of the Commonwealth at present. The Treasurer has fairly and ably done that, and it is clear that the financial system under which we work as provided for in the Constitution is at the root of a good deal of 'the trouble. It is one thing to admit that the financial system, is bad, and quite a different tiling to realize that bad as it is it is not incapable of amendment. ' It seenis to have been assumed that being there it must remain. The Treasurer says that' a very clear line must be drawn between the old and the new works, but I am bound to say that I do not see in the list of works anything that could be described as reproductive. tween non productive and reproductive works. According to that authority, a nonproductive work may consist of a bridge, a road, or a post-office; whereas a reproductive work-suc h as a railway-is something upon which a toll may be levied-somethin g which yields a direct return that can be devoted to paying off the outlay which it involved. Viewed from that stand-point, none of the works mentioned in the schedule can be described as reproductive. Telephones are reproductive in one sense, but if the additional instruments which the Government propose to purchase do not yield more revenue to the Commonwealth than telephones have returned under State management, it is evident that they will not provide the cost of maintenance, and interest upon the expenditure involved. The arguments which have been used against taking the money necessary to carry out these works out of the revenue are, of course, very cogent ones-the most cogent being the difficulty of raising a sufficient amount. A t the same time it does appear to me that there is another way of dealing with this matter. Some of the works are very much more important than others, and upon the Treasurer's own showing it is possible to construct a portion of them out of revenue. In this connection the right honourable gentleman proposes to expend £440,000 out of revenue, and £600,000 out of loan. Sir"" GEORGE TURNER -The £440,000 in cludes £180,000 for buildings. mentioned in the schedule which urgently call for the borrowing of money.

I believe that the addition which is contemplated at Newcastle is the erection of a clock tower.' is to provide for the erection of a colonnade, tunnels, &c. being put upon the business paper in reference to this particular post-office tower.

It is quite true that a. number of the States have deficits, and that these deficits are likely to increase. B ut they will increase under any circumstances, and no effort has been made by the Governments to prevent them increasing. The Treasurer has declared that Victoria will have a deficit this year of £400,000. Next; year that amount will be increased.

84,Mr Hughes,"I do not consider anytaxation and adds to their loan expenditure, thus causing thern to pay additional interest, because each State has to pay interest upon works which are carried out in that State. For example, I notice that £20,000 is provided for constructing conduits in Victoria and £24,000 for telephone lines, (fee. All these tilings will have to be paid for by the Victorians themselves, with interest. If there is going to be a deficit, what provision is made for this increased expenditure ? Obviously none. The Treasurer's idea is that we should borrow £500,000 annually for some years to come. For how many years does he suggest we should borrow, and what guarantee have we that the limit will not be overstepped ? Certainly we have none if we are to profit by past experience. Year by year the borrowing of these States has increased, and the figures showing the extent of our indebtedness are indeed extraordinary. Indeed, every financier of repute has pointed out that Australia is the giant debtor country of the world. In the In vestors' Review recently I read an article by a partial and hostile critic, who warns the English money lenders that the labour party here were likely to lead a cry for repudiation. I have been associated with that party for a good many years, and I have never heard even a suggestion in regard to repudiation. But the words which are finding an echo in the breasts, not only of labour representatives, but of all sensible men throughout the' Commonwealth, are "" bankruptcy and ruin."" Our intentions and desire to meet our liabilities are as they ever were, but our capabilities sooner or later will be exhausted. Within the past five years I find that the revenue of Australia has increased by £4,364,000, whilst the expenditure hasincreased by£3,100,000, thus giving an excess of revenue over expenditure of £1,264,000. But during that period the interest paid and payable by the .States has increased toa much greater extent. The interest upon our public debt in 1900 .amounted to £7,500,000, which is equivalent to 27 per cent, of our total expenditure. It represents 34 per cent, of our net revenue, because in many of the States money is received from land sales which is credited to revenue. In VictoriaI believe that a -certain portion is put aside as a sinking fund which is used for the purpose of iconstructing railways', ike, but in the majority of the States, this nione)'-whic h -in 1900 amounted to nearly £2,000,000is treated purely as revenue. Perhaps the most extraordinary figures in connection with this matter are that our public indebtedness aggregates £227,000,000, whilst our private indebtedness totals £143,000,000, making a total of £370,000,000. Deducting £60,000,000 of this amount on behalf of New Zealand, it will be seen that our total indebtedness stands at £310,000,000. But since the year 1900 further borrowing has taken place. For instance, only last year, I believe New South Wales raised loans amounting to£7,000,000. She floated a loan of £4,000,000 in connection with the Darling Harbor resumptions, and another of £3,000,000 has recently been raised. Since 1900 the various States have incurred an additional liability of £10,000,000 1 or £15,000,000. Theinterest upon our total indebtedness is a b o u t £ l 2,000,000. During the past 29 years we have increased our indebtedness, public and private, to the extent of £297,000,000, but only £8,669,000 of that amount has found its way into Australia. These figures are so startling that they cannot be at once grasped. I repeat that, although we have increased our indebtedness during the period indicated by £297,000,000, the interest which we have had to pay upon that amount and upon our accumulated debts has approached within £8,000,000 of that colossal amount. The public debt has been increased during the past 29 years to the extent of £192,000,000, but during that period we have received only £28,000,000, so that it has cost Australia in interest upon that amount and upon what she previously owed £164,000,000. This is an astonishing condition of affairs. Although none of the nations of the world have ever plunged themr selves into debt to anything like this extent, yet it is considered to be the normal condition in Australia, and people evince no sort of interest in it . They have been brought up in an atmosphere of borrowing, and do not bother about the matter. But during the next 25 years there must come a time when the interest payable will be such as cannot be covered even by the ex r traordinary-whic h with us is the normal-increas e of borrowing which has taken place during the past 30 years. We shall then have to continue that policy merely for the purpose of paying the charges' upon our national indebtedness. Within the next five years we have to meet loans which fall due I find that Victoriai n that period boraggregating £21,000,000. There has never rowed £41,600,000 and paid in interest been any attempt made by the States-if £39,634,000, so that the State received we except New Zealand-to consolidate or benefit only to the extent of £1,983,000. convertthese loans. During thenext 25 years loans totalling £134,000,000-will mature. That means that within the next 25 years we must borrow £134,000,000 in order to assets we ever had, but we have not pay off that indebtedness.

I have had some little they are willing to sell their difficulty in making up my mind as to how the to vote upon this measure. It is only after to that of some a careful examination in detail of the proposals of the Treasurer, that I have arrived at a conclusion as to what I should do. In my first speech in this Parliament I exI should be very sorry if pressed the hope that there would be a public works policy for the Commonwealth, and that it would be found possible to carry it' out without the aid of borrowed money. Of course, there are certain .works which it would be impossible for Parliament to pay for purely out of revenue, but for the most part we should be able to pay for our public works in that way. The Treasurer, however, appears to take a different view. He told us that we are to borrow £1,000,000 at the If it were proposed to present time, and that for a number of years to come we are to borrow £500,000, or perhaps' more, per annum for the construction of public works which are to be built in the future. He did not say for how many years this policy of borrowing is to continue, but if we go on borrowing at the rate of £1,000,000 a year for the next They are all works the carryten years, we shall at the end of that time have to meet as an interest charge the sum of £300,000 per annum, which, added to the amount which he proposes to take out of revenue-som e £400,000-make s a total of £700,000, or rather more than the expenditure provided for in the schedule of the Bill.

That being so, I have to ask myself whether the proposed expenditure is justifiable, or whether, if the money -cannot be found out of revenue, the works cannot be kept back for a time, or set aside altogether. that he would rather not borrow, but that if he paid for these works out of revenue he would add to the burdens of the States. He mentioned, however, two other expedientsthe Canadian expedient, about which he has doubts, and which he thinks in any case might be more properly left over until the building of the federal capital is being considered ; and a more restricted public works policy. Having viewed the circumstances very carefully, I think we shall have to adopt the latter expedient. But there is a third expedient, bo which he did not refer, and that is the expedient 'of imposing special taxation for the construction of publicVorks of a reproductive character. I am inclined to doubt if the public would at the present juncture agree to that. Personally, and bitterly as 1 am opposed to such a tax, I should have preferred to see a duty imposed upon tea, to give the Commonwealth a little more revenue, but I know the difficulty of raising money for public works through the Customs. A special tax, outside the Customs, would meet the case : but it is doubtful if the public would allow such a tax. Now the Treasurer has told us that we must not increase the burden of the States, and that is a veiy proper justification for borrowing, so far as it goes. He also said that these works were necessary; but the information with which he supplies us is not sufficient to show their absolute urgency, or the probability of their returning interest on the money spent in construction. quite agree that the cost of carrying out some of our public works of a reproductive character is properly chargeable to capital; but we have not been strictly adhering to that principle. As was shown by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the Victorian Government have borrowed upon as many as four occasions for the purpose of replacing engines upon the railways, and after the four borrowings they have had one set of engines to represent the four which had been j>urcfwsed out of loan moneys. I can understand borrowing in the first place for the purpose of building railways or erecting works of a reproductive character : but I 39 D 2 cannot support the expenditure of loan money for the renewal of obsolete or wornout materials or plant. Works in order to be' truly reproductive should not only return"" a sufficient amount of revenue to cover all The Treasurer told us working expenses, but should also pay the interest on the money spent in construction, and-, if possible, leave a credit balance. Business people expect when they borrow money not only to realize the amount of the interest they are obliged to pay, but a profit besides, and the State ought not to incur any greater risks in the management of its business than would a private individual, except in certain instances such as Defence. The Treasurer has told us that it has been the practice of the States to borrow money in the way now proposed, and that he is following upon a well-beaten track. But we are following the States' practice only in part. I understand that in South Australia they have adopted a very wholesome policy in connection with loan expenditure, but, unfortunately, the example of that State has not been generally followed. Take a case in point. It is now proposed by the Government to spend £73,000 in the erection of switchboards in connection with telephone exchanges in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. The existing switchboards in these States would probably have cost something like £50,000, and if we followed the South Australian practice we should borrow, not £73,000, but £23,000, and rely upon the revenue for the balance of £50,000. By adopting this plan we should not borrow twice over in connection with the one asset. On the contrary; if any additional money were spent upon a given asset, then only to the extent I of the value added would the expenditure of loan money be permissible. Under this system it would not, however, be justifiable to spend £73,000 upon these switchboards, and to charge nothing to revenue, in view of the fact that monev was borrowed by the States for fitting up the switchboards in the first instance. I therefore think ohe present proposals are to be condemned on the ground that a certain proportion of the money is to be devoted to purposes for which loan funds should not be appropriated. Then, again, it seems to me that unnecessary haste is being shown in the construction of public buildings, and in the carrying out of some of the works proposed in connection with the telephone and telegraph systems. The very timidity of the present proposal also condemns it . The sum proposed to be borrowed is paltry, compared with the total debts of the States. The works proposed will not be reproductive, and I think that a good deal more information should have been furnished with regard to them. I find that £71,000 is to be provided for the construction of new buildings; but, so far'as I am able to gather, these works are not by any means so urgent as one would be led to believe. the Sydney and Newcastle post-offices were being made at the time of the transfer to the Commonwealth, and this money is required to finish the works. provided for carrying out contracts which had been entered ""into prior to the time of the transfer of the departments. money is for. question as to whether it should not be provided out of the revenue. Where new works are proposed, I do not think that any undue haste should be shown, and that we should wait a little longer before we saddle ourselves with a permanent liability of £30,000 per annum. We have no information as to the way in which the £S0,000 proposed to be appropriated for telegraph and telephone, lines is to be spent. All we are told is that it is proposed to expend the money in the construction and extension of telephone and telegraph lines, and in purchasing cables and material. We do not know whether the works referred to are likely to be reproductive or otherwise. is in the report of the experts which was laid on the table. the report; but in any case we should have had more information from the Treasurer regarding these matters. Then we are told that some portion of the loan money is to be spent in substituting underground cables for the present overhead wires, and in providing for metallic circuits to replace the present System. These are not legitimate charges against capital, and loan moneys should not be expended over and above the amount previously devoted to the construction of the existing systems. which is to be replaced will be used for other purposes for which we should otherwise have to borrow money. tion which was not previously vouchsafed to us. It is absurd to talk about replacing telegraph wires, or telegraph pole?, out of loan money, and it is equally absurd to ask for a loan vote in order to provide new common battery telephone switchboards to replace those which are now obsolete. Unfortunately, the subject of high finance has not engaged the attention of our public men in Australia to the extent that it should, have done, and the result is that we have suddenly to pull up. We have a loan indebtedness amounting to £200,000,000, upon which there is an annual interest charge amounting to £8,000,000, and we have really exhausted our borrowing possibilities for some time to come. There must be some limit, and I the believe that, like the South American and North American states, we have reached the limit of our borrowing powers, and the sooner we realize our position the better it will be for us. We ought to derive a lesson from our experiences during the boom period. By a system of excessive borrowing, we induced people to suppose that they would become rich, not by production, but by a system of exchange. That was wrong, for we have been told on the best authority that quite one-third of our population were living upon the result of public borrowing. We can only be truly solvent when our population lives on the results of their own efforts in production, and when we cease to borrow year after year in order to pay the interest upon our loans, and in some cases even the principal, and for the purpose All that information of carrying out works which are wrongly called reproductive. I had hoped that in connection with the financial policy of the Commonwealth more attention would have been devoted to the consolidation and conversion of the State debts. I believe you, Mr Speaker, estimated that ultimately £1,500,000 per annum could be saved by the consolidation and conversion of the public debts of the States; and, if a scheme of that kind could be carried out, a large amount of money might be available for the purpose of carrying out a public works policy. I have very little to add. I have already indicated my attitude upon this Bill, and the vote which I intend to give. But I say",28,Torneh

101,Mr Hume Cook,"That is informaas a last word that though I do not desire, any more than does the Treasurer, to impose disabilities upon the States, neither do I wish to inaugurate a policy which is to spring out of an urgent necessity. We should not confound a high principle, such as is involved in the initiation of a borrowing policy for the Commonwealth, with the necessity to build a post-office in Brisless degree in the other States. Something bane, or a telegraph line in South Australia. We ought, if possible, to do our busiSouth Wales telephone system upon a more ness in such a way as to educate the public mind to an appreciation of its responsibilities, and the necessity for a sounder system of finance. If the policy which has been adopted by the States is to be continued, if we are to borrow in a haphazard fashion, iind to pay interest upon our public indebtedness by means of raising new loans, the same bankruptcy which faced the South American States, and at one time threatened the North American States, is likely to confront the united States of Australia. To avoid such a result I feel that upon this occasion I cannot follow the lead of the Treasurer, and must vote against the second reading of the Bill. Unlike the last speaker, I do not think that the Commonwealth is approaching bankruptcy, or that the Australasian States are likely to imitate those of the Argentine. I deprecate as much as possible any remarks of that kind. Surely we may discuss what the honourable member for Bourke has been pleased to term ""high finance,"" without lugubrious references to bankrupt countries, whose productions failed, and whose people generally are in a bad way. I speak the more strongly upon this matter, because, like the honourable member, I have come to the conclusion that at this stage of our national career, we ought to draw a very tight rein as regards borrowing. Buti t does not assist discussion to predict that red ruin stares us in the faee unless we peremptorily discontinue the flotation of loans. On the other hand, I think it is quite time that we decided what course the Commonwealth shall adopt in regard to the future incurrence of debt for enterprises such as the Treasurer has outlined upon the present occasion. Personally, I have had some difficulty in making up my mind upon this question, because, unlike the last speaker, I do not think that the construction of some of the works enumerated in the schedule can be deferred. I have no fault to find with that schedule. The works are most pressing and important. Of my own knowledge, the telephone system of the continent urgently needs revolutionizing. Since the adoption of the electric tramway system in Sydney the telephone service of New South Wales has become completely disorganized-. I am aware that the samecondition exists in a must be done immediately to put the New satisfactory footing. A few years ago it was admitted by all our experts to be the best in Australia, but since the introduction of electric tramways it has got into a completely disorganized mess. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that relief should be afforded as speedily as possible. I do not quarrel with the schedule of this Bill. The misgiving which I entertain is in regard to the means to be employed for raising this loan. The question which presents itself to me is whether we ought, at the beginning of our federal career, to lay down ""the principle that we will for all time raise money for constructing perishable works by means of borrowed ""money. That these works are shortlived will be readily admitted. We have been told that electricity is assuming new forms. Science is absolutely revolutionizing the old systems, and we must resolve to adopt new systems so far as the applicationof that subtle force is concerned. The question that suggests itself to me is whether, in making readjustments in our electrical systems, we ought to go to the loan markets of the world for the wherewithal, and particularly whether we ought to do so at the present time. The honourable member for Bourke said that, to some extent, the old, wild, boom borrowing in Australia had been stopped. I wish I could believe that. said that if we were to continue our present policv, boom-borrowing would be stopped. that we are not borrowing wildly. RecentlyI read an article in the Age-which , by the way, has occasional lucid intervals-pointin g out that during the past two and a-half years Australia has borrowed £27,500,000.

I have no doubt that all the States are borrowing pretty freely. They are getting just as much money as the London market will permit them to obtain at a reasonable rate of interest and upon favorable terms. It is not at all a popular policy-as the Treasurer has discovered before to-day-to discontinue borrowing and endeavour to bring our expenditure within reasonable dimensions. The old couplet applies to nations equally with individualsThe devil was sick, the devil a monk would be ; The devil grew well, the devil a monk was he. We do not think of the consequences of borrowing. The moment our circumstances, are bad we rush round in an hysterical manner to ascertain if we cannot discontinue that policy which in former times we have been prone to adopt. Ought we to pursue a policy which can certainly yield no enduring results in regard to our future relations with the States? I should not have so much hesitation in voting for the Government proposals if I could see the slightest intention to economize on the part of the States. But New South Wales continues to borrow at an alarming rate. The simple question which I put to myself is"" OughtI to pile up the Commonwealth indebtedness, concurrently with the piling up of State obligations 1"" I have come to the conclusion that I ought not to do so, particularly in regard to the State which I represent, where there is a huge surplus of revenue which ought to be drawn upon for the construction of necessary public works. I realize the difficulty which has been pointed out by the Treasurer. I know that some of the States could not possibly stand the strain of constructing these works out of their ordinary revenues. They affirm that their revenues are depleted by our federal finances; but, upon the other hand, ought we to impose obligations upon the whole of the States because a couple of the small ones find themselves in temporary financial difficulties 1 It appears to me that that is the question which we ought very seriously to face. In New South Wales we have already submitted to having a revenue foisted upon us which we did not require, and to which we strongly objected, because the small States needed it for their own nearly solvency. Are we to perpetuate the same system in regard to the loan expenditure of the Commonwealth 1 In New South Wales the revenue, if carefully husbanded, would easily enable us to construct these works without piling up more indebtedness. If the small States cannot pay for works which may be undertaken within their own borders out of revenue, can they not replenish their revenues out of State loans ? Works representing an expenditure of £600,000 are included in the schedule to this Bill. Of that amount, £400,000 relates to works which it is proposed to undertake in the two large States. possibly construct out of revenue the works proposed to be undertaken in this State unless additional taxation were imposed. lutely insuperable objection 1 Are there no resources in Victoria which can be drawn upon for this particular purpose ? I cannot believe that this State is at the end of her financial tether, and cannot bear an additional expenditure of £120,000 for the purpose of constructing necessary public works. posed represent a good deal more than that. distinction between perishable works and those of a more enduring character. For example, there is a sum of £71,000 included in the schedule which comes within the purview of the Minister for Home Affairs. That amount is for buildings, tunnels, &c. These works are of an enduring character, and I see no objection, to paying for them out of loan moneys. But the other items, aggregating £112,000 in the case of Victoria, and £221,000 in the case of New South Wales, ought to be paid for out of revenue. If the word "" renewal"" had been used, it would have more clearly indicated the nature of the works. The old idea when these works were first constructed out of a loan was that all replacements would be paid for out of revenue ; but here in the schedule of a LoanB ill we see £30,000 for a new switch-board in Sydney, and a large amount for a similar work in Melbourne. Because science has rendered the old switchboards obsolete, it is proposed that we shall go again to the London money",31,Torneh

114,Mr Joseph Cook,"But I draw alender in order to pay for what are really renewals. The Sydney switch-board is by no means an old one. It has not been installed more than three years, although it is six or seven years since it was first ordered, the balance of the time having been occupied in constructing it, owing to the initial difficulties which are met with in all large undertakings. The switch-board, when first ordered, was not expected to last more than ten years; and honoi-able members must not run away with the idea that frequent renewals and replacements mean inherent structural defects. Sydney, the board is f u l l of subscribers, and only the other day I saw the Post office officials enlarging it . So rapid has been the growth of the telephone system that it has overtaken the capacity of the switch-board, the original cost of which was £15,000. This plan of paying for renewals out of loans has been followed in all the States, and no provision is ever made for repayment to the loan funds. The bulk of the money in the schedule is for short-lived works of the kind I have indicated. The construction of telephone and telegraph lines or poles means, in many cases, merely replacing the old, worn-out works, and, as I said before, it would be better if the word "" renewal"" had been used. is not intended for mere renewals. but in most instances they mean the rethe whole total that probably is so, but weplacing of old lines with new ones. have to be paid for out of revenue. are very short-lived. When we ai-e told that the works ought to be constructed out ought we to go in the direction of helping of borrowed money because they are for the smaller States in their temporary diffifuture generations, the answer is that the culties 1 works will probably cease to be of use long before the present generation has passed were divided on a population basis there away. Sir WILLIAMLYNU Wales, when the honourable member was in sound Commonwealth financial scheme there office, £100,000 u year was voted for the would be no trouble. For my part, I think extension of telephones. was for the construction of new lines and their own State loans, rather than that the tunnels, and I am not now arguing that larger States should be compelled to pile up permanent works and buildings ought to be their debt. I see no insuperable difficulty in paid for out of revenue. The £70,000 the course I suggest, and it ought to be which appears in the schedule against works adopted in common fairness to the States in the department of Home Affairs may which have abundance of means and desire very properly be paid for out of loan. My present arguments are against loan expenditure on short-lived, perishable works, which . in a few years leave no asset against the money borrowed. These remarks apply to nearly £500,000 of the proposed expenditure. money is for the Post-office. The life of a telephone is a very few years at most: and if we accept the theory that these instruments should be replaced out of revenue, To-day, in why should the first cost not come from the same source, seeing that it takes precisely the same amount to renew as to purchase at the outset ? We ought not to begin in the Commonwealth the policy of constructing such works and renewing them again and again out of loan money. The switchboards afford us a concrete instance of the undesirability of such expenditure. We are told that the Commonwealth finances will not stand this expenditure out ©f ordinary revenue; and as to that the Treasurer might have tabled an estimate of the excess revenue which he has paid to the States over and above the Braddon requirements. I believe that the amount so paid, but which he need not pay, is about as much as the total estimated expenditure on the workshas not used up one-fourth of the total reI f we deal with have to deal with individual States.

This matter is so important as affecting my own State that I do not think I ought to vote for the second reading of this Bill, take it that the members of this Parliament in view of the State borrowing which is going on, and of the overflowing revenue. I say again I have no quarrel with the schedule. These works are absolutely necessary; and something must be done to place the telephone services on a firm and lasting basis. The metallic circuit is another instance of using loan moneys to replace works. That circuit is intended to supersede the old earth circuit, the latter of which I suppose will become utterly useless. It has been said that one reason why we cannot undertake these liabilities outof revenue is that there are some functions which have not yet been taken over by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for North Sydney pointed out, as an instance, that we have not yet paid for certain buildings which we have acquired, and that we have not as yet assumed control of the light-houses or of quarantine. All that is very true but we ought to look forward in the near future to a break up of the drought, and a more hopeful financial condition throughout Australia. Those altered circumstances may be regarded as a set-off against the obligations to be assumed when we take over all the federal functions. The Treasurer has told us that he has a surplus of £500,000 or £600,000, on which he can operate next year, amounting in the aggregate to the total involved in this Bill. I think that there is the fund to which we should look for the financing of these works, instead of continuing to pile up the indebtedness of the country. Under these circumstances I feel compelled, as a protest against a system which has operated in the States for many years, and in connection with which I am afraid we are all somewhat to blame, to vote against the Bill. I think that under our new conditions we might verj well make a new departure, even if it should involve a little trouble at the outset. The honourable member for Bourke has complained of 'the apparent want of interest shown by honourable members in this Bill, although, after a session has lasted for thirteen months, it is only natural that there should be a want of inteiest in any measure brought forward. I am very glad, however, that all who have spoken up to the present time have opposed the Bill. I hold that to be a good augury for the future treatment of financial questions by this Parliament. I do not intend to pass loan Bills without the closest scrutiny, and that some attempt will be made, if not to stop borrowing altogether, to at any rata very much curtail the rate of borrowing. No doubt the States have borrowed to a much larger extent than othe.r nations have done in proportion to population. But the fact that in Australia, to a much greater extent than elsewhere, the Governments are realty huge industrial concerns is very often overlooked. . The objects for which money has been borrowed by the States are very different from those for which most other national debts have been floated. We have borrowed practically nothing to buy powder and shot, and, indeed, we have a splendid asset to show for nearly the whole of the £400,000,000 which we owe. Of course, in some cases we have borrowed at higher rates of interest than we should pay now, and we have no doubt borrowed more than we required, and have lived at too great a rate ; but most of the works upon which the borrowed money has been spent are earning interest. The indebtedness of South Australia is £32,000,000-a n enormous debt per head of population-bu t 2|per cent, is being earned by the works upon which more than £26,000,000 of the amount borrowed was spent. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN And the South Australian railways supply the needs of a population larger than that of the State. for a very much larger population than that of the State. The construction of the BrokenH ill railway at one time seemed a speculation which was hardly justified, but it has turned out to be one of the best revenue producing works which we could have r undertaken, and is earning 6 or 7 per cent, upon the original cost of construction. being earned upon a large part of the amount borrowed, the rate of interest paid is something like 3 f per cent. the works to which I refer are reproductive to the extent of paying the full amount of the interest charged upon the loans with which they were constructed, but, to the extent to which they pay interest, they decrease the burden of the taxpayers.

The people of South Australia could not have constructed the overland telegraph line, which has shortened our communication with Europe to a few hours when it previously took months, out of revenue, and I doubt if even the whole of Australia could have done so at the time when it was constructed. tions apart, is there not a limit to the extent to which borrowing should place 1 speaking against the wholesale condemnation of the public works policy of the States. AVe could have constructed very few railways in the first instance if we had not borrowed money to do so. But before money is borrowed, care should be taken to see that the works upon which it-is to be expended will be reproductive. Where they will not be reproductive, they should be paid for out of revenue. The honourable member for West Sydney said that no State, except New Zealand, had yet made any serious attempt to convert its loans. As a matter of fact, however, South Australia, since the passing of her Loan Conversion Act in 1896, has converted £2,000,000, and saves 1 per cent, upon that amount of her debt. verted £4,500,000 within the last three years. only as. loans fall due. cannot induce people to abandon privileges which you have given to them.

Every one admits that works of that kind should be carried out. The practice of charging the loan funds over and over again for new work to take the place of old work and not providing for the original cost out of revenue, is one which must be condemned, and I hope that honorThese able members will set their faces against it . There is not a single instance of a replaceof the old work has not been charged to revenue, and only the balance provided for out of loans. Some of the proposed works should be provided for wholly out of revenue. The Treasurer has omitted from the proposed loan appropriations the cost of the post-offices to be erected at Woodville, Walkerville, and Gawler. paratively small' works, which I thought we could afford to pav for out of revenue. have to bear that expenditure. have to be' paid for by the Commonwealth, and the cost will be distributed amongst the States on a population basis. there is any distinction between such works as I have mentioned, and others which it is proposed to provide for out of loan funds.

The proposed new telegraph line' to Tarcoola, which will cost £14,000, could not very well have been constructed out of revenue and charged to the South Australian Government. constructed out of revenue they will have to be paid for by the whole of the States on a population basis, so that South Australia will have to pay a considerable portion of the cost of whatever works are done, wherever they may be. Exactly. You perfectly justifiable to spend loan moneys in constructing a telegraph line to a place such as Tarcoola, where a large amount of business will be done. That will be a reproductive work, and there are probably other woi'ks of a similar character.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN honourable member wish to tie our hands in that way ? place some limit upon loan expenditure. I do not desire to see a £1,000,000 loan raised this year, a £2,000,000 loan next year, and a £3,000,000 or £5,000,000 loan in subsequent years. If we had some special tax which wouldyieldabout£500,000 per annum, which the Treasurer says will be required for carrying out urgent public works, we should be able to dispense with any heavy borrowing. Sir WILLIAM natural connection between the amount that a tax will yield, and the necessity for public works. be a strong disinclination on the part of the people to pay directly for those things which they fancy they require. ber debit the capital cost of erecting post-ofHces to the revenue of one year ? surer says that £500,000 per annum will be required for urgent public works for the next few years, and I do not see that any objection could very well be raised to our ear-marking the tea duty, for instance, for the purpose of carrying out public works. I do not think we can absolutely stop borrowing just now. We have been accustomed to carry out a great number of works by means of loan moneys, and if we were to suddenly stop now we should be applying too drastic a remedy. It would be better to gradually curtail our loan expenditure until we can provide some other system. against the second reading of the Bill. Our experience in connection with loans in New South Wales, at all events, has been that whilst honourable members have on every occasion deprecated loans in theory, and expressed bushels of good resolutions, they have never gone any further. I have voted for loans, and I am prepared in some circumstances to vote for further loans, but I refuse to believe that the Commonwealth is in such a position that we must go to the money lender for £500,000. I could quite conceive of circumstances in which it would be impossible to do without a loan for the purpose of carrying out public works. Proposals have been made for the construction of two transcontinental W h y does the railways which inquiry may prove to be justified, and we also have schemes suggested for the locking and weiring of two or three of our principal rivers. So far as my inquiries have gone, I believe that one of the latter proposals is abundantly justified. To carry out any one of the works referred to such a large sum would be required that we could not expect it to be provided out of the revenue of any one year. I do not therefore suggest that some circumstances may not occur in which I Would' be quite prepared to vote for a loan Bill. Even in connection with works such as that mentioned by the honourable member for South Australia, where there is a reasonable prospect of interest being earned, it must be recollected that the interest payments to people outside the Commonwealth constitute iin annual drain upon the resources of those engaged in production within the Commonwealth, and that, when taken in conjunction with the already heavy obligations of the States, they have a serious effect so far as the annual return from labour is concerned. The fact that even a few millions of money had been spent in South Australia without yielding any return from which the interest upon loan money might be provided is significant when one considers the small population of that State. Eveni n Victoria there has been a great waste of loan money so far as non-interest returning expenditure is concerned. Will that pay interest upon the outlay directly 1 believe that indirectly the return will justify the expenditure. number of these proposed works t I merely assert that there has been a wastef u l extravagance in connection with loan expenditure, which would never have occurred had the people been compelled to dip their hands into their pockets to find the necessary money.

Year by year, however, theburden which they are called upon to bear increases and its evil effects are multiplied. The Treasurer proposes that this year we shall borrow £600,000. Yet. in October last he anticipated that there would be a surplus revenue on account of the Commonwealth of £534,000. Since then-in March last-h e stated that he had to add to his estimated revenue £575,000. Our one-fourth share of that amount represents £140,000. In addition to that, owing to the reduction of the Defence Estimates, we have effected a saving of at least £130,000. A number of other economies have also been made. For example, there is the non-establishment for the time being of the High Court and Inter-State Commission. These savings will give the Commonwealth a surplus of between £800,000 and £900,000. that. allowed for the loss involved in the remission of the duties upon tea and kerosene. member is leaving out of consideration the additional expenditure. the Commonwealth account has been kept well within limits. member has not seen the figures which were circulated on the 25th April.

Had the Commonwealth retained its one-fourth share of the Customs revenue, the Treasurer would have a sufficient sum of money in hand to carry out the works proposed in this Bil l without having recourse to the money-lender. allowed for the increased expenditure in the Postal department 1 that he has allowed for that. According to the right honourable gentleman the ComThe people are careless of the monwealth should have' a balance of £600,000 on the present financial year. I admit that that money is not in hand, because he has handed over to the various States whatever balances seemed to be available. In defence of that practice, he has cited the financial condition of some of the smaller States, and declared that each State practically has a deficit. But I hold that so long as we provide the States with the money they will continue to have deficits. So long as the Commonwealth furnishes the revenue, the States Governments will take every care that it is spent, and possibly mortgaged a little in advance to deter us from economizing so far as our taxation is concerned. Therefore we cannot too soon show the States Governments that we intend to use everj penny that we deem r necessary of our share of Customs revenue to efficiently cany on the services of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that money derived from taxation can be applied to no better purpose than the creation of public as works, because they relieve the taxpayer from the very moment of their completion. If they are reproductive, they at once begin to return revenue, either directly or indirectly, and consequently relieve the taxpayer to that extent. I trust that the The honourable result of this debate will be to convince the Treasurer that these works should be constructed out of revenue, so . that the taxpayers may be eased of some of their burdens immediately. That is a ""consummation devoutly to be wished."" In New Zealand, for years past, the practice has been adopted of transferring from the general revenue account to the public works account nearly £500,000 annually. The that after making an result is that a good many of the public works of that colony are now producing an amount which goes a long way towards relieving the general taxation of the country. the same thing; I am taking a large sum out of revenue. gratulate theTreasurerupon havingdeparted from the evil course followed by the States Governments.

163,Mr Avatson,"To that extent I conare some items included in this Bill which, on account of the returns which may reasonably be expected from them, are not only justifiable, but are practically urgent. If this measure be rejected, I trust that the House will see the wisdom of insisting that a large number of these works are undertaken out of revenue. States of revenue? where is the difference between the States being compelled to borrow and the Commonwealth being obliged to adopt the same course ? The honourable member seems to lie happ) in the idea that the States will be 7 relieved from the necessity of borrowing, -whilst the Federal Parliament will be compelled to engage in it . He knows that the only alternative to constructing these works from revenue is that we must borrow. He proposes that we should hand the revenue over to the States, and subsequently float loans. that new works should be constructed out of loan money. I do not see that it much matters whether the Commonwealth or the States do the borrowing. The States have the ordering of their own affairs. "" ducks and drakes "" with their finances. on the other hand, they can play "" clucks and drakes "" with every cent we hand over to them, and what voice have we in its expenditure? I say it is a wrong principle that we should be expected to find money for other persons to spend. If we have to acitem of the switch-boards,' on which it is cept the responsibility of raising taxation from the people, at least we ought to have control of that expenditure, so that we may account to them for our charge. The States ought to be encouraged to rely upon the taxation resources which still remain to them. It is theii business to make ends meet without depending upon the parentalism of the Federal Government. Regarding the general principle involved in the Bill, the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable and learned member for Parkes, by way of interjection, pointed out that a sufficient sign that the States were progressing was supplied by the fact that recently the New South Wales Government had been able to borrow money €it a very cheap rate, and that the loan asked for was subscribed several fold. I do not know that that has any bearing upon the question of whether it is wise that we should borrow. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I think that interjection was made in connection with something that was said, but not as the honourable member puts it . that every young spendthrift who is cast upon the world finds usurers who are ready to advance him any amount of money up to the extreme limit of his assets. I do not think the financial position of Australia is such as to justify any adverse criticism regarding our ability to pay our debts. We are absolutely solvent. The people of Australia can meet their engagements, and have a handsome margin to spare. Many of the works enumerated in the schedule are directly or indirectly reproductive, and the money-lender need entertain no apprehension so far as the return of his principal or interest is concerned. Stilli t is questionable whether it is wise of the Commonwealth to assume liabilities because it may be offered cheap money, when by compelling the Government to expend revenue we should insure due criticism on the part of honourable members, the press, and the public generally, which would probably result in economy where otherwise extravagance would continue. The Treasurer should insist on carrying a number of the items, whether the Loan Bill pass or not, seeing that they are essentially reproductive, either directly or indirectly. But there are other items, totalling a fairly round sum, which it would be wiser to allow to wait. I refer particularly to the proposed to expend a total sum of £75,000 in four capitals of the Commonwealth. It is.specially indefensible to provide a switchboard in Sydney from loan expenditure, even if it be thought advisable to have a new one. It is only about three years ago, I think, since the present switch-board was ordered, and it has not been in active work more than two years. years ago. out of revenue, the other States will have to contribute their proportion, and New South Wales will pay only a third of the total.

Buti t must be borne in mind that from the revenue must be deducted the sum of £3,426,000, which was bhe proceeds of the sale of land. land revenue, so far as New South Wales, at any rate, is concerned, is derived from the rents paid by squatters, and from other forms of occupation. have allowed for that, but, at any rate, a very large amount which was treated as ordinary revenue was really money derived from the sale of capital. Would any private individual, or any corporation other than a Stats, be allowed to treat the proceeds of the sale of capital as ordinary revenue ? If he sold or mortgaged his land, he must regard the amount so used in his expenditure, and it must be included in his losses. It has been said that if we put a sudden stop to our loan expenditure there would be disaster. . But we shall have to put a stop to it some day. The time will come when the foreign creditor will treat us as Egypt and Greece were treated when they overborrowed. manded, with the guns of warships ranged upon the city o£ Athens, the assignment of a certain proportion of the excise revenue from currants and from other articles; while, in the case of Egypt, the Khedive was deposed, the war of 1884 was undertaken, and the administration of the finances of the country was forced upon England. Sir honourable member regard those as parallel cases ? cases, but as our security is eaten up by loans our credit will fall, and every time we have to borrow we must pay a higher rate of interest. Some people think that loans are a good thing, because they bring capital into the country, but the money has eventually to be paid back, and what we are doing now is like trying to ""keep a dog alive by feeding him on his own tail. I have some figures in regard to the propo ed sinking fund, which I should like to put before the House, but I understand s that Mr Speaker has ruled that the sinking fund cannot be referred to during this discussion.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I have given very careful and anxious consideration to the loan proposals of the Government, and have considered the possible effects of rejecting them, and although I desire as far as possible to support the Treasurer in his financial proposals, I feel that I cannot vote for the second reading of the Bill. No doubt the Treasurer, 'in introducing the measure, has been acting under pressure from the department principally interested. I do not suppose that his' own views, so much as what are regarded as the departmental necessities of thesituation, are expressed in the measure. It may be also that the officers of the Post and Telegraph department have been guided by custom and tradition. It is well-known that in years gone by, in all the States, whenever occasion has arisen for an exThe creditors of Greece detension of post and telegraph' works and revenue has not been available, the officials have considered that all they had to do was to run to the Treasurer and induce him to provide loan funds for the purpose.

There is one big post-office work in Queensland for which £150,000 is required. vidious for us to discuss the items, and it would be very difficult to discriminate between those which should be provided for out of loan and those for which revenue should be appropriated. It would be far better to postpone the whole scheme for the present session, and refer it back to the department principally interested, and call upon the officers to cut down the proposed expenditure to such a point that it can be provided for out of ordinary savings. one-half already. Sir JOHN QUICK that the Government have done their best to apply the pruning-knife, but they have been acting under the pressure of their departmental officers, who should receive a salutary check, and be warned that they cannot expect to come to Parliament every time they want to raise money for the purpose of extending the postal or telegraph system. A t the present juncture in the history of Australia, we ought to be very careful about floating loans for purposes such as those contemplated. It is not proposed to borrow money to provide for grest national necessities or save us from a great national disaster. If that were the case we should all concur in the proposal. The expenditure is of an ordinary character, and none of the works are urgent. None of them are so important as to justify us in floating a loan during the first session of our Parliament and pledging the credit of the Commonwealth for that It is time that this Parliament set an example to the Parliaments of the States in the matter of economy and financial discrimination. There was never a more unfortunate time than the present for floating a loan of this trifling and unimportant character. unfortunate time to curtail expenditure on necessary works. Sir JOHN QUICK unfortunate that we should have to suggest anything like curtailed expenditure ; but we ought to provide as far as possible for the whole of these works out of ordinary revenue. .Most of the works that are urgently needed ought to be provided for 39 E mu. 13773 out of revenue, and the construction of the others should be postponed until some future time when we are considering a great loan scheme, such as will probably have to be dealt with at a later stage in connection with the federal capital, or other great national works. Public opinion iu Australia has been developed up to a point at which there is a very strong feeling against the perpetuation of the borrowing system for the purpose of carrying out such works as are held in view. We are asked where we are to obtain the money ; but in reply to that question I ask, ""Where is the borrowing for such purposes as are now indicated to cease"" ? Isi t to go on indefinitely, until, we receive some tremendous rebuff in the money markets of I have no doubt the world 1 I do not wish to suggest that our credit is in any clanger so long as we exercise our powers with judgment and discrimination, but it is necessary that we should specially consider a Loan Bill of this character. Let us look round and see how Australia stands in reference to its loan indebtedness. I have received a paper issued by the Taxpayers' Union of Sydney showing the amount of money per adult that has been borrowed by the various States of Australia. I do not know whether the figures are exactly correct, but I presume that a document of this kind would not have been issued by a public body unless the calculations were approximately correct. According to this statement ""Victoria comes out on top as the least indebted of all the States. on the population basis : but look at her purpose. small territory. to look at her population-he r reservoir of taxing power. Victoria is indebted to the extent of £ 9 6 per adult of her population ; Tasmania, £ 9 8 ; New South Wales, £ 1 0 0 ; Western Australia, £ 1 1 5 ; Queensland, £ 1 4 1 ; and South Australia, £142. and private indebtedness combined. Sir JOHN QUICK In any case, the I know that it is figures show that there is already a very big loan bill against Australia, and it ought to make us pause before we launch merrily into any further borrowing. If works of the character indicated in the papers before us could be constructed out of revenue or out of savings, or by means of levying a little",42,William Mcmillan Doe S The I T Is A Great P I T Y I Was Almost Going To

217,Mr Mccay,"That represents the publicextra taxation, the people of Australia would gladly acquiesce. I am firmly, convinced that we ought to show the officials of the Post and Telegraph department that we are determined that .as many as possible of these works shall be carried out without resorting to the expenditure of loan funds. I am not voicing what might be regarded as a mere popular cry in Australia, because in the issue of the newspaper called United Australia, of March 20th, 1902, the following passage occurs:The Financial Times, London, of January2 it h contains u strong leader on a series of articles which have appeared in its own columns on ""Australia's debts and assets."" Speaking of the writer of these contributions, it says"" While carefully it. But I should further like to ask guarding against playing the role of an alarmist, he states plainly that the financial position of Australia is by no means satisfactory, and utters a warning that unless a check be imposed, on borrowing, and a halt called to extravagant expenditure, that position may become dangerous."" This warning from the other side of the globe, uttered by a high -financial authority, combined with the warnings which are uttered by those amongst us, and the drift of public opinion, it ought to restrain us from rushing thoughtlessly into the floating of any loans. It is not proposed to borrow money for the purpose of developing our production or our resources, but merely to facilitate inter-communication amongst our people. One could understand a loan being proposed for the purpose of constructing a transcontinental railway, or a system of canals intended to facilitate Inter-State trade, and which might incidentally also be used for water supply and irrigation purposes, because such works would be of a national character, and might assist in the development of our resources. But though these undertakings may be very nice, useful, and agreeable, they do not go to the root of national wealth, but are merely for the purpose of facilitating Inter-State communication. Let me remind the Treasurer that some of the works which it is proposed to construct will enter into competition with existing federal services -For instance, the proposed telephone between Melbourne and Sydney, which is to be constructed at a cost of £70,000 or £80,000, will compete with the existing telegraph line between those two capitals. phone. we construct that line out of loan money ? If these departments were overflowing with revenue, and could afford to do so, I should say, by all means, let them undertake these works. But when we are asked to float a beggarly loan of £600,000 to enable them to be carried out, it is time we plainly declared that Tarliament will not entertain a scheme of this kind, and that, to justify a loan, any work must not only be necessary, but urgent, for the purposes of the Commonwealth. Should any well-considered proposal be submitted to Parliament, for a loan either to construct railways or to provide a water supply, I am quite sure that honourable members would cheerfully acquiesce in whether the Government are satisfied that the proposed works will be approximately of a reproductive character ? I should like to know Avhether they will pay a fraction of the working expenses. I do not think we have very much information on the subject. I suggest this inquiry, because I have noticed that where an application is made for an extension of telephonic communication in a country district, the department sends out an officer to ascertain what will be the probable revenue from the-work. That is a business-like inquiry. Quite recently I presented a petition from some of my constituents at Fosterville, a few miles from Bendigo, in favour of telephonic extension. The department, however, found that the revenue which would be derived from this work was not sufficient to justify the expenditure, and accordingly refused to carry it out unless a cash guarantee were' given for the payment of interest. I should like to know whether the same principleto which I do not object has been observed in connection with the works initiated in this schedule? T do not think we have any guarantee that these works will pay the expenses proposed to be incurred in the undertaking. We ought to know a little more about the internal organization and the results of the working of these departments before launching into a scheme of this kind. Doubtless the Government are doing what they think is the best thing under the circumstances. They do not wish unmecessarily to cut down, public works. They feel the pressure of the various departments, and in submitting these proposals to Parliament they may have done their duty. Probably many of their critics would have acted precisely as they",43,William Mcmillan Doe S The I T Is A Great P I T Y I Was Almost Going To

219,Sir John Quick,"Then why should have clone. But the responsibility rests upon Parliament. It is for the House to determine whether it will sanction what the Government suggests. After most anxious consideration, I am reluctantly bound to confess that I cannot supportthe second reading of the Bill. worth) I cordially agree with honourable members who have stated that this is one of the most important measures that has yet been brought under the notice of Parliament. It would be a strange thing indeed if a Bill of this kind were not fully and drastically discussed, and, if necessary, criticised most completely. I purposely abstained from speaking earlier in the debate because I was anxious to hear the views of honourable members, as one or two of them seemed to entertain very extreme opinions upon this question. But, in listening to the discussion, I did not find that any speaker went so -far as to argue that under no possible circumstances should the Commonwealth raise a loan. That brings me to the fact that this series of Bills has been put before us in rather a disconnected way. not now discussing this Billi n conjunction with the schedule of works. I suggest to the Treasurer that, before making his speech in reply, the debate should be adjourned and that we should proceed with the discussion upon the Bill covering the appropriation. Then, if honourable members will allow the second reading of the Loan Appropriation Bill to be passed, 30 that we can getinto committee, the Treasurer will have an opportunity of explaining, item by item, his reasons for including them in the Bill, and the principle underlying them. If the whole schedule be vetoed, of course the measure winch we are now discussing will fall to the ground. Similarly, if two-thirds of the items are vetoed, the Treasurer may conclude that in order to provide such a small amount as £100,000 or £200,000 it will not be necessary to go upon the money market. consent to have his Bill emasculated in that way ? that the method which has been adopted is scarcely fair either to the House or to the Treasurer. Many honourable members disagree with certain items which are embodied in the loan proposals, but there may be 39 E 2 works, which, after further explanation from the Treasurer, may fairly and reasonably be constructed out of loan account. Having made this suggestion, I should like to offer a few remarks in connection with the B ill itself. Honourable members naturally feel that as this is the'first LoanB ill which has been presented to them, the whole principle of borrowing ought to be thoroughly criticised. But I think some imagine that we are absolutely untrammelled in dealing with loan expenditure. Really, we are not. This, is not a Government which is starting with an absolutely clean sheet, free from all responsibilities. The CommonAvealth Government has had to assume control of certain .transferred services, and whether we pay for the public buildings connected with those services-whic h represent a value of £10,000,000 or £12,000,000-by accepting, an equivalent portion of the States debts,, or merely by discharging the interest upon them, Ave are practically initiating a loan policy. The interest upon that debt Avill constitute a very large amount, because in many of the States interest was not charged upon the expenditure involved hi these I think it is unfortunate that we are buildings. Therefore, when we take them OA'er, either upon a valuation or under whatever terms may be agreed upon, the CommonAvealth Avill have to pay the f u l l interest owing upon them. Consequently Ave start, to a large extent, with a policy which has been handed to us. I Avas really surprised at the peculiar intellectual finessing of the honorable and learned member for Northern< Melbourne, Avhen he declared that in theaggregate we had paid in interest an amount equal to the Avhole of our loans, a fact which evidenced that if we had repaid the loans year by year, Ave should haA'e been in a much better position. No doubt we should but Ave could not do it . The Commonwealth Government, therefore, does exactly Avhat the States Governments are doing. They take over a certain amount of business and certain responsibilities connected Avith the carrying on of that business. If the business of the post and telegraph office and'the raihvays had not been projected years ago, we should have had noincome and no sendees. It is absolutely absurd to talk about a policy under Avhich Ave never should have borrowed. We had not the necessary money, because large amounts derived from the sale of land in the different States were used for developing the country and rendering it possible of habitation.",44,William Mcmillan Doe S The I T Is A Great P I T Y I Was Almost Going To

222,"Sir William Mcmillan ,","I thinkDoes not the very prosperity of Australia at the present time give the lie to the pessimistic views which are entertained by many people ? We talk about a loan fund. 1900 the various States had incurred a loan expenditure aggregating £180,000,000. that amount, however, £140,000,000 was absolutely reproductive. It had been spent upon railways, telegraphs, and in connection with water, sewerage, and other services, leaving only £40,000,000 to be accountedfor. one considers that a large amount of that £40,000,000 erection of post-offices, by which the States now save the rent of those premises, and in -other works which are either directly or indirectly reproductive, I think it will be seen that we can fairly face the world. I -doubt very much whether we could not get rid of the whole of the railways of Australia at the present time for the amount which stands against them. members talk about the per capita of debt, but forget the enormous services which those debts have promoted. -about our indebtedness we should remember that the trade and business of Australia are -something phenomenal in the history of the world. At the present time the trade of the Commonwealth represents £161,000,000 annually. -amounting to £80,000,000 annually. one recollects that we are merely a handful of 4,000,000 of people, these ""figures altogether put out of consideration ' any ordinary comparisons. At the same time, I think that we should be careful in considering our loan policy. There were two weaknesses in the finances of the States. One of these has been prevented in our finances by the admirable Audit Actwhich we passed. That was the danger of putting the expenditure of a year into the year afterwards, and thus creating fictitious surpluses. There was also the question of the loan -account. Honourable members who have been in the State Parliaments recollect that the loan account was almost the last measure of the session, and that it was rushed through when members wanted to get home. The only cure for the evil we are facing to-night is conscientious and careful consideration of every item the Treasurer puts before us in the loan account. It is no use laying down a broad rule to never borrow. It is of no use earmarking or taking steps. We have to recognise the fact Sir William McMillan that, in certain large services taken over as a matter of public necessity and convenience, there are works In of ""an absolutely reproductive and interestbearing character, which are permanent, at Of any rate, to the extent of 30 years, and with which it would not be fair to burden the current revenue. On the other hand, as we make the period of our loans 30 years, any work that will stand only ten When years ought not to be included in the loan account; above all, what we call renewals has been expended in the ought not to be paid for out of loans. We ought to err on the side of revenue, and not on the side of loan expenditure. If we make any mistake, it ought to be in defraying out of revenue, works which might possibly be defrayed out of loan, and not in defraying out of loan those which might be defrayed out of revenue. These are the only principles I Honourable know of to guide us. The danger of our action to-night lies in the fact that we have before us a Loan Bill, by which the GovernWhen we talk ment propose an expenditure of £1,000,000, which is authorized in detail in another Bill. Should we veto thesecond reading of the Loan Bill without considering in detail the items of works in another Bill? We must not forget that the States are watching our financial We have an external trade operations. Several of the States know that When they are on the verge of very large deficiencies, and if it goes before the world that we will have nothing to do with loan accounts-as might be deduced from many of the speeches to-night-ther e may be even more discontent with the Commonwealth than there is at present. It would be better for us to show the country, not that we do not believe there are items to which the loan account could be properly applied, but that we believe that the items making up the £600,000 are not such as ought to be paid out of loan account. Or on the other hand, we could show that we believe there is a. sufficient surplus arising out of our present Customs revenue to justify our postponing the consideration of a loan to a more necessitous time. I do not want the public to be deceived as to the attitude of the House. It is very reasonable to say that a large number of these items, such as renewals, ought to be paid out of revenue. It is reasonable to say that with our large Customs revenue we have an ample margin to enable us to meet the exany such artificial and absurd penditure out of revenue, or, at any rate, that we intend to do so this year. Buti t is not reasonable to say that under no conditions are we going to excercise the right we have of raising loans. We are in a much better position to safeguard loans than are members of the State Parliaments. The loans we raise will be practically under the advice of the Executive of the Commonwealth, and they will be chiefly in connection with the Post and Telegraph service. That service will, I believe, not be interfered with except to a small, extent by honourable members. We have to deal with quarantine, lighthouses, and defence, and there is scarcely one of the items which will bring in the machinations of what we used to call "" the roads and bridge? member."" Very little personal influence or kudos will be obtained by members through the raising of any loans by the Commonwealth. We need not be fearful about the future if we carefully and calmly, without any party spirit, consider every item the Executive lay before us. There is not the same reactionary feeling there might be in a State Pai'liament. We are simply keeping up certain services which are absolutely necessary. In the great department of defence, it would be the wildest folly to cany on any "" cheap-jack "" policy. I am speaking of loans applied to fortifications and works of that kind, which must be dealt with absolutely by themselves. We do not know to what extent we may have to renew these works. We may at any time have to make a large expenditure for the public safety ; and that alone shows how difficult it is even in the matter of renewals to lay down any rigid rule. There is one matter on which I should like to say a word to the Treasurer. I cannot see what necessity there was for the Treasurer, without, at any rate, some consultation with this House, to pay over his surplus revenue. Section 87 of the Constitution is as follows :During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament' otherwise provides, of say. Our main object is to deal with thethe net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. member must not forget section 89, which ties my hand absolutely. appropriated the money. it, of course. S9 providesThe Commonwealth shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance (if any) in favour of the State. every shilling. think that was intended. I do not know what is the absolute law, but if there was this danger, and the Treasurer thought, as he must have thought, that there would be some difficulty over the question of loans, it would have been better to bring the matter up earlier. The Treasurer knew that there were certain services connected with the post-office which have been carried on under the loan account in the States; and he must have known that these liabilities would have to be met. the exception of Queensland, have met these liabilities. Bills ought to have been brought up earlier, what would have been left to bring up later ? are certain financial matters which, to my mind, take precedence of all else. The Treasurer must have known that in the first year there would be a large number of liabilities. I take it that the States paid up only to the 31st December previous to the foundation of the Commonwealth. to last December. I made arrangements with the States that until a loan could' be raised, they should pay for works out of loan funds, and that these moneys should betaken into consideration when fixing thevalue of the buildings transferred. to much the same thing, but that is. a matter about which I have not much to principle of loans. While I think the sinking fund is a very good proposal if kept under proper check, and it is clear that we shall not have deficiencies side by side with it , there ought to be some principles laid down with regard to loans in the future. It is difficult to fix a line ; it is difficult to say what works should be put in the loan account, or to decide whether a I could have spent work will be sufficiently permanent to last 30 years. It is sometimes difficult' to say",45,William Mcmillan Doe S The I T Is A Great P I T Y I Was Almost Going To

233,Sir William Mcmillan,"It comeswhether a work is really productive, but we must have some understanding on our own part, as a sort of traditional guide to the Treasurer. ""We might lay it down as a rule that, as our loans are' floated for 30 years, anything not sufficiently permanent to last that period must be paid for out of revenue. ""We could certainly lay down an absolute rule that,all renewals should.be paid out ofrevenue.

These are simple principles which anybody can understand. already been done in several States. Sir WILLIAM ' McMILLAN -Nobody can tell, from a superficial reading of the schedule, whether certain matters are or are not renewals. -suspicion 1 -only that suspicion which is very health) in members of Parliament who desire to -understand everything brought before them. If I understand the Treasurer aright, he has paid out of revenue for similar services -about £180,000. revenue this year is £120,000, and next year it will be £1S0,000. question is whether the Treasurer has carried out the principle as far as possible. I certainly agree that if we are not going to allow, at any rate one-half of the Treasurer's proposals, it will be scarcely worthwhile going to the money market. The Treasurer is not now in the position to which he has referred. If we liked to operate at once with the whole of this amount as ordinary revenue, the Treasurer would not have to return it to the States. I take it that this amount could be distributed. In other words, the Treasurer need not take the money out of the States all at once. He could take the money as required. But,, having taken over the services, we are certainly not justified in refusing to keep them in a proper state, and to develop them, whether out of revenue or lean account. I hope that the Treasurer will'not neglect to get this money which is absolutely necessary. The telephone system apparently is going to be an enormously expensive one; but I hold that it is better, perhaps, that it should be dealt with-as part of the Postal and Telegraph department than by the States. Of course, we must be careful in dealing with a service like that from a loan standpoint. We might have a number of small items in. a large service which in two or three years would aggregate a very big amount. But, on the other hand, very small items may properly be charged to capital expenditure, and, therefore, it is not As has reasonable alwaysto consider that, because an item is comparatively small, it ought not to be debited; to capital account. But it makes it all the more necessary that in any loan schedule which we may have behas fore us, we should have as f u l l details as possible, and the fullest explanation from the Treasurer I should like again to suggest to rny right honourable friend that it would be well to postpone this debate, and allow the House to deal with the Loan this, Appropriation Bill. I would strongly recommend honourable members, whether they We have intend to oppose these items or not, to deal 7 fairly and generously with the Treasurer, as we generally do, and to allow him to go into the schedule of that Bill, so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the items. After that explanation, if we are still of -opinion that it is unreasonable to place these items in the loan account, we can negative the schedule. In that event, of course, both the Loan Appropriation Bill and this-Bill would: fall to the ground. honourable members, I feel very strongly the responsibility that rests upon uSji n initiating Loan Bills, to see that they are placed on a firm and solid foundation. The experience of honourable members who have sat in the States Houses has been of a character that should make us extremely careful to know, now that we are in the higher atmosphere of the Commonwealth, what we are going to borrow money.for, and how we propose to apply",47,William Mcmillan Doe S The I T Is A Great P I T Y I Was Almost Going To

While the Government may naturally feel slightly disappointed at the tone of the debate, on the other hand they ought to be gratified that the measure, which is a small one, has been subjected to such drastic criticism, in order that we may lay down a policy for our guidance in regard to the way in which we shall borrow and spend money in the future. It is difficult to vote against this Bill, because I take it that, if it is rejected, the whole of present, and the few which cannot possibly the Bills depndent upon it , together with their schedules, will fall to the ground. We know that a large number of these works are absolutely required. We know also that there is a great dearth of employment, not only in this but in other States, and that the carrying on of a number of works in the schedule will provide employment, without any extravagance, for a great number of people. We are indebted to the acting leader of the Opposition for his proposition that this debate should be adjourned, and that we should proceed to deal with another measure in order to see what items the House will be inclined to pass. If we do that we shall know positively whether or not it will be necessary to raise a loan. My own belief is that we shall not require to do so. I am strongly of opinion that wo ought not to raise a loan for small works. In the case of large undertakings, if it is unavoidable, perhaps, we should do so, but otherwisewe should try to live within our means. We ought to regard the provision under which we must pay the States 75 per cent, of the Customs revenue as an absolutely business one, and keep within our own power the spending of the remaining 25 per cent., which isjustly due to the Commonwealth. No doubt there are difficulties in some of the States, but if we are going to study the States whenever they get into some difficulty, we shall never be done. Hard cases make bad laws. If we study every hard case; our legislation will not be what it ought to be. I do not propose to take up any further time, because themeasure has been threshed out at very great length to-day, and very little remains to be said after the speech which we have just heard. Sooner than borrow money for most of the purposes named in the schedule, I should be prepared to revert to the two-penny postage, and to increase the charges for telegrams. W i th some regret I feel that I cannot vote for the second reading of the Bill, and I hope the debate will be adjourned for the present, in accordance with the suggestion of the acting leader of the Opposition. Mr A. M c LEAN (Gippsland) I hope that the Treasurer will not proceed with this Bill. I think it is too early in our political history to enter on the down grade by borrowing for unproductive works, or works that will be, at best, only reproductive to a very limited extent. A great many of them can stand over for the stand over should be constructed out of ' revenue. After a year or two we shall know our position better. member would not stop the expansion of thetelephone service. MrA . M c LEAN I do not see anything desperately pressing about that matter. We have not yet passed the Tariff. We do not know what our revenue is to be; we are groping in the dark, and will be doing so for some time to come. By allowing these works to stand over for a time-and there is nothing so desperately pressing about them that they cannot stand over for a limited time-w e shall know our position better. I sympathise with the Treasurer in his desire to carry out works for which the different States are clamouring, but we know that it is not always wise to do so.. It .appears to me to be too early to commence the system of borrowing for unproductive works.

245,Mr Macdonald,"PATERSON (Brisshorn the States of their power to borrow for these works, and, forsooth, sonie honourable members would now absorb the right which the States possessed, before they joined the Commonwealth, of maintaining the services within their own territory. In connection with this Bill, I find that the parochial and provincial spirit is stronger than it was even when we were dealing with the Tariff. A paltry £1,000,000 is proposed tobedivided amongst six States, and I find the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, a notable barristerin-equity, disclosing his utter ignorance of the effects of wholesome utilitarian expenditure--at all events, in connection with telegraphs and telephones, and the mairitenance of the public buildings of the Postal department-upo n the welfare of the people, and the development of trade and commerce. No State is in debt when it has the wherewithal to pay in the shape of railway works and works of public utility. I heard with sorrow to-night the statement made by an honourable member that a certain writer in an European or American journal had made the statement that one-third of the whole of the revenue of Australia was devoted to the payment of interest upon the public debt. There never was a more barefaced falsehood floated on the atmosphere of this continent. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN member said that the writer made the statement' that that was the expenditure in respect of the payment of interest on the unproductive debts of Australia. That was not true. That is so. That writer did not know of the vast estate which we have been developing, and the indirect revenue that we receive, and have received, in all the States, by reason of our expenditure for the settlement of population, the encouragement of immigration to this country, the establishment of telegraphy, the construction of railways, roads, and bridges, and the giving of bonuses for the dis-covery of goldfields, as well as to various industries. Those works came out of the profits of the general revenue, and the general revenue was augmented by the higher prices of lands sold as freeholds, and the higher rents' obtained from Crown lands, as the result of the construction of railways and good roads. revenue has been augmented alike from gold-fields and coal-fields, timber licences, railways, telephones, good roads, and settlements. That was brought about by the population becoming prosperous, and giving traffic alike to road, river, and rail, whilfi consuming articles on which the Customs levied duties. We Ought to have had 2,000,000 more people in this country, but the fact that our population has not increased by such leaps and bounds as was predicted, is due to the effects of floods and droughts and diseases amongst our flocks and herds, and to various other causes. The gentlemen who uttered the prophecy was speaking without due regard to the teachings of history. We do not know what Australia will pass through during the next 50 years ; but we know what has happened during the past 50 years. We have passed through a period of great borrowing, and what would Australia have been to-day without this borrowing? Isi t not a fact that the railways of Australia are worth more than the whole of our national debt? Isi t not true that some years ago, whilst the late Mi-. Speight was Chief Railway Commissioner in Victoria, an offer was made by capitalists in Europe to take over the whole of the debts of Australia in consideration of the railways being given to them. should have no national debt if we sold our railways. When the various States entered into the federation, the belief was entertained that the transferred departments would be conducted on lines similar to those which had previously been followed. But now we find that a strong objection is being raised to any further borrowing for the purpose of carrying out public works, such as have hitherto been constructed out of loan funds. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has told us that if a big loan were proposed he would raise no objection. He objects toa sprat, and he would not even have a mackerel, but he wants a whale loan. I cannot agree with his view. If the Commonwealth had not been established, the majority of the works now proposed to be provided for would have been constructed by the States out of loan funds.

248,Mr Macdonald,"PATERSO Nthe purpose of lightening the demand upon the revenues of the States. I think that the Treasurer has not gone far enough, because not one sixpence should have been taken out of the revenues of the States for the purpose of carrying out these works. We are face to face with the most disastrous condition of affairs that has ever been experienced in Australia. The whole of our yield of wool has gone, and we find that two of the largest meat works in Queensland are being closed down, and that there is no likelihood of their being reopened for five years to come. The gold industry is not prospering or advancing, and our industries generally are in a very depressed condition. I am speaking on behalf of the whole of the citizens of Australia, when I contend that every 6d. that may be deducted from the State revenues for the purpose of carrying out works such as those referred to will increase the burden of the disaster which is riow overshadowing us, and which will in the end prove much worse than that of 1893, when our banks and companies failed on every hand. Would the people of Queensland have voted for federation if they had understood that no new telegraph lines would be provided for them except out of their revenue? sented to any arrangement under which necessary post-office buildings-the erection of which had, in some cases, been postponed for man}years past-woul d have to be constructed out of revenue ? They would never have joined the federation under those circumstances. The same statement would apply to the people of Western Australia. I do not wish to refer to those questions which have previously been decided by this Parliament in a manner outrageously against the interests of Queensland; but I contend that honourable members who propose to discharge this B ill from the notice-paper, and who 1 declare that there should be no more borrowing for the purpose of carrying on public works in Queensland and other States, have no proper conception of the present situation. I promise honourable members that if that attitude is taken we shall attempt to break away from the federal union, and to return to the wholesome conditions which prevailed before we federated. Then there was prosperity, and peace, and financial soundness, and everything that appertained to a State which was developing its industries under the laws of its own Parliament, and the administration of its own Government, with the help of its banking institutions. But what do we find now ? They are all gone, and we are down in the depths of the miserable disasters which have been, brought about by federation. This is the "" last straw "" which will "" break the camel's back."" Every one knows that Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia are suffering, 'and will continue to suffer from the operation of the Tariff. learned member is not discussing the measure before the Chair. question is, shall we initiate a borrowing policy for a miserable £.1,000,000? I say unhesitatingly that I should be utterly ashamed of this House if it had not the courage to borrow £1,000,000 within its own country at 3 per cent., and distribute it as is proposed amongst the several States. God forbid that I should think this House will reject the measure ! If I had £1,000,000 sterling myself I would lend it for nothing. We want the States to be honestly dealt with. AVe do not desire their financial conditions to be disturbed or their local indebtedness prejudiced by the fact that they Would they have conare unable to repair a telegraph office, renew a telegraph wire, or aid in the development of the Postal or Customs departments. We wish all the services which are referred to in this Bill to be maintained, if not developed, in the interests of the Commonwealth. ceedingly sorry that the discussion of a Loan Bill for what the honourable and learned member for Brisbane has so frequently referred to as "" a paltry million "" should have been productive of the violent outburst which honourable members have heard against federation. A good many honourable members on both sides of the Chamber fought very hard for union, and I am sure they all agree with me that, because an honourable member of this House cannot have his own way regarding a Loan Bill, it is rather an extreme course for him to adopt to condemn federation. None of us can secure -ill that we should like in the way of legislation, but surely those who differ from us can adopt another course than that followed by the honourable and learned member.

His stand upon this Bill is in perfect accordance with his actions in the past. I congratulate him upon 'his consistency, but I regret that some honourable members upon the Government side of the House who oppose this Bill. I refer particularly to the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Bourke, who. are present, and to others who are not present. Those honourable members have condemned this Bill, and argued that money necessary for the carrying out of public works should be derived from revenue.

Honourable members ought to pause until we know what is the financial position of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, the particular works which it is proposed to construct may very well wait. I do not agree with those who declare that the Commonwealth is upon the verge of bankruptcy, but its indebtedness is such that we might very well pause before adding to it. The honourable and learned member for Brisbane corrected something that was said to the effect that one-third of the total revenue of the Commonwealth was spent in interest upon our public indebtedness. I admit that it is not correct to say that one-third of our revenue is devoted to that purpose; but of the total revenue of the States,namely,£28,500,000,£7,500,000, or more than one-fourth, goes to pay interest and charges upon the national debt. has not deducted the earnings that one-fourth of our total revenue, including those earnings, goes in interest and charges upon our national indebtedness. In this connection I have a few figures which show how Australia compares with other nations of the world. These figures are derived from the Statesman's Year Book, and show that the indebtedness of AusI cannot similarly congratulate tralia is considerably greater than that of any other country.

256,Mr Kirwan,"Some of the countriesmuch caution before embarking upon any loan policy. I do not urge that loans ought not to be floated in cases of great urgency, or for the carrying out of works of a national character. For instance, if no other means could' be adopted, I should not object to the flotation of a loan for the purpose of locking the river Murray, or for constructing the transcontinental railway to ""Western Australia. Such works occupy an altogether different plane to some of those included in the schedule of the Loan Appropriation Bill, which, according to the Treasurer himself, are not urgently required; numerous changes that are constantly being effected in telegraph)'' and telephony, there is every indication that if these works are constructed, they will be virtually out of date within a few years. I quite agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca, in reference to the wisdom of retaining our fourth of the Customs revenue. I would much prefer to see the Commonwealth spend that money upon reproductive undertakings than return it to the States to be expended in utterly useless works. In one or two of the States which I could mention the States Governments have a huge surplus, which they are spending in a way that is altogether unnecessary. They are virtually wasting the money, and it would be much better, if we are pressed, to draw on this source rather than increase the already heavy indebtedness of the whole of Australia. From all sides of the House this Bill has met with general condemnation, and the Government would act very wisely if they accepted the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth and withdrew it, at any rate temporarily. adjourned. Debate resumed from 5th June (vide page 13361), on motion.by Sir WILLIAM LYNE That the Bill be now read a second time. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I did not expect that we should reach this measure to-night, and I am certainly not prepared to deal with it in the manner its importance demands. Buti t would not be well for the second reading to pass without a word or two of discussion. I went through the Bill when it was first distributed, but we cannot remember all the provisions of a large number of measures, and unless we know when the debate is to be resumed we cannot be properly prepared. The impression on my mind is that there is a great deal in the Bill to commend it to favorable consideration. It contains a great many, useful provisions, toone of which I should like to direct particular attention. That is the provision dealing with the proportion of representation to be given to the great centres of population and to the country districts. I understood the Minister for Home Affairs, in introducing the , Bill, to say that the Government were Owing to the favorable to the adoption of equal electorates, though I think the Bill provides that that principle may be departed from in certain cases to the extent of 25 per cent. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Belo w or above one-fourth or one-fifth. MrA . M c LEAN We should place clearly on the face of the Bill what we mean to do as to the proportion of representation. It would be a fatal mistake to adopt anything approaching a system of equal representation. Those who know me will not suspect me of any desire to give to property or territory that representation which, I think, should be exercised by individuals alone. I have on all occasions, from the very commencement of my Parliamentary career, opposed anything in the form of plural voting, and I have always advocated, the system of adult suffrage. My desire is that every section of the community shall have an equal voice in its government, but if we adopt the system of equal electorates, that wholesome principle cannot possibly be given effect to. If honourable members consider the advantages which the metropolitan population possess over the scattered population of the country, they cannot fail to see the force of what I say. In the first place the country population is so scattered that people cannot get together to discuss matters of mutual interest. They are split up into different political sections, one person scarcely knowing, what are the views of his next neighbour. In the metropolitan districts the people are all aggregated within a small area, and can readily meet to discuss public questions. They can form associations of various kinds, and>give effect to their views in a manner utterly impossible in the country. Large numbers of people in the country districts have to travel long distances to the poll, and in , consequence many are unable to vote.

When we were dividing Victoria into federal electorates we gave to the country districts, with a population of 700,000 or a little under, electorates, while we gave eight electorates to the metropolitan a population of close on 500,000. that time the present Treasurer pointed out that my Government favoured the metropolitan contended that there should have been a greater disparity between the representation of metropolitan and country electorates. I should like to know what the Treasurer thinks of this proposal to have practically equal electorates. cannot be in agreement with it. toria sent 29 members to the House of Representatives notwithstanding the fact that the country districts have fifteen electorates as against the eight allotted to the metropolitan districts, there are only eleven members who can, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as country is, country representatives who reside in the country, and have their interests while the metropolis has returned eighteen members in both Houses. There are twelve members in the House Of Representatives who are permanent residents of the town, and who cany on their business or professions there, although only eight electorates have been allotted to the metropolis. The country electorates have not sent one man into the Senate : and unless we make a very great disparity between the representation representation of the towns, the latter without will exercise almost the whole of the All the head influence brought to bear upon legislation. Honourable members, especially those who know my political career, will credit me People with not desiring to give advantage to any section of the community. I only wish to give to the country districts that preponderance which is absolutely necessary to place them on something like a fair footing. This Even in horsebecomes even more important seeing that in the future women will have the right to exercise the franchise. I am one who from the first day I entered Parliament has supported the claims of women in this connection. A t the same time, we know that The same principle there are far more women in the metropolitan districts, in proportion to the total population, than there are in the country. If we give anything approaching equal electorates we shall largely increase the political power of the great centres of population, which I maintain already fifteen exercise too much influence on the Governments of the various States, and of area with the Commonwealth. It is scarcely fair that At Melbourne and suburbs, with a population of 500,000, should have eighteen members had unduly in the two Houses of the Federal Parliadistricts, and ment, as against eleven members from country districts, with a populatian of 700,000. I hope no one will think for a moment that I wish to convey that the Melbourne gentlemen who represent country districts do not represent them well and faithfully. But I I feel sure that he do say that they, being intimate with all Victhe conditions prevailing in the metropolis, are naturally i u a position, whilst not and the Senate; and neglecting the wants of their constituents, to render that help to metropolitan representatives which a country member pure and simple would not be able to render, owing to his want of knowledge of local conditions. Precisely the opposite prevails representatives-that in regard to the country districts. Although there are many honourable exceptions, and theresome in this House, we cannot reasonably expect a permanent resident of a city to have as much knowledge of country matters as a person who is always intimately associated with them. Therefore, regarding the matter from every stand-point, I maintain that unless we insert a provision in the B ill setting forth clearly what shall be the basis of representation for the metropolitan and country districts, the country will be completely submerged.

In country districts, let the department approximate the number as nearly as possible. In districts where the population is veiy scattered, I would certainly give a larger proportion of representation ; I would allow fewer electors in respect of every member to be returned. There is no difficulty in the matter. I hope that the Minister will abandon that part of his proposals, and take due notice of these points, with a view ito doing what he may think fair and just when we get into committee. Another part of the Bill makes provision for electors to give some special representation to changing their districts. Of course it is absolutely necessary that every reasonable facility to vote shall be given to a person who changes his place .of residence after the compilation of the rolls ; but we must be careful that we do not leave that provision open to abuse by allowing electors to .change their electorates within a very short date of polling day. To do that would be to enable one electorates to lend electors to another. If it 'was thought necessary to do so, it would be very easy for a certain number of the population to shift from one electorate to another -immediately before an election. I think that the Bill makes provision for votes being recorded by electors who shift to another electorate within not less than one month from polling day, but in any case, to do justice to every person, to let him record his -which is passed is exactly .the same. vote legitimately, and not to give undue facilities for the removal of electors from one district to another for some political purpose, is a matter which requires careful consideration. I do not remember any other points which impressed me when I read the Bill, but probably I shall have a good deal to say on the details when we get into committee. W it h the exception of a few points of the kind that Fhave referred to, I think that on the whole the Bill is a very good one, and can be made a very workable and liberal measure. oil the whole we can congratulate the is just as great as iu the metropolis.

To my mind one of the labour party in federal politics are spared best features of the measure is that to long enough we intend to wake them up. which objection has been offered by the honourable member for -Gippsland, namely, that it fixes an absolute equal quota right throughout the Commonwealth as to the number of persons required to return a representative to this House. I have often heard the battle in :favour of special representation for the country fought out. AlthoughI was. not in Parliament at the time, I watched with a great deal of in terest the debate on the Electoral Bill introduced into the New South Wales Legislature in 1893 by the Government of which the Minister for Home Affairs was a member. An effort was made then country electors in excess of that to which their numbers entitled them. A t the first sight it would seem that a plausible case had been made out for such a proposal; but with the experience which I have gained, as a-representative of a country electorate for the last eight years-firs t in the local State Parliament, and subsequently in this HouseI contend that there is not only no political justification, but no practical justification for it . In the first place, every man or woman in the Commonwealth has the right to an equal voice in our legislation, whether he or she resides in town or .country. I presume that the honourable member for Gippsland will admit that, whether a man resides at the extreme of civilization or .in the very centre of the metropolis, his interest in the legislation He should be allowed to exercise similar power in either case, and no more. My experience of the people in country districts is that they have a greater appreciation of the value of the franchise than have residents of cities. I have found that in the country men will travel immense distances in order to record their votes, while frequently a man will not go round a street corner in Sydney in order to register a vote for any one. In New South Wales, where our electorates arebased upon an equal quota for country and city, we find that the percentage MrA . McLEAN -That is not so in Vic-",55,Elector Albill Second Reading
262,Mr Watson (Bland),I think that of votes recorded in the country districts,56,Elector Albill Second Reading
263,Mr Watson,"That shows that thevotes ""was exercised in the country than in the metropolitan districts in connection with the federal elections. So far as New South Wales is concerned, we have had just as large a percentage of votes recorded in -the country as in the metropolitan districts. It is said that the men in the country districts cannot come together for the purpose of discussing political matters in the same way as voters living in the city. I admit that they cannot come together so easily, but they have very little trouble in arriving at a fairly correct estimate of political questions. MrA . McLEAN -Does the honourable member know of any country resident who represents a metropolitan electorate ? member know of any metropolitan resident who represents a country electorate 1 and on several occasions on which I have submitted, myself to the electors I have been opposed by candidates who have resided in the district. MrA . McLEAN -They failed because of local jealousies ? count, but because the majority of the people preferred my politics to those of my opponents. I desire to emphasize the point that the basis of the whole system should be the influence upon legislation, and I contend that residents in the country districts understand political questions just as distinctly as do those who reside in the metropolitan areas. Further than that, they are willing, taken as a whole, to make greater sacrifices in' order to insure that the candidate they favour shall be returned to Parliament. upon administration is concerned, the residents of the metropolitan areas have considerably the best of it , but the only way in which that difficulty could be got over, whilst at the same time allowing equal power in regard to legislation, would be by having one House to deal with legislation only and another to deal with administration. Of course, we know that that is impracticable. arguments which might be advanced in favour of a larger proportion of country representatives in the State Parliaments, owing to the great variety of interests to be attended to there, cannot be applied with the same force to the Federal Parliament, where a few large matters have 'to be dealt with, and where there is a more geneI am glad to hear it . 'ral community of interests. The honourable member stated that, whilst the voters in the metropolitan area of Victoria were entitled to fill eight seats, in this House there are twelve metropolitan residents amongst the representatives of that State. I suppose that the explanation is to be found in the fact that gentlemen were returned who had some knowledge of the districts they represented, and whose political. views most nearly accorded with those of their constituents. It would be a very sorry reflection upon the intelligence of the country voters of Victoria to say that they were not able to -select the best men. It seems to me that the honourable equal electoral districts, having regard to population, is a natural corollary of the one -man one vote-system. The honourable member for Gippsland seems to misunderstand the application of the one man one vote principle when 'he seeeks'to give the country residents, merely because they are country residents, a greater proportion of power than is enjoyed by their city brethren. This is the same old cry that we had to fight against in New South Wales in reference to the Federal Constitution when we were asked to give votes in consideration of territory and not of population. It was contended that we should give greater proportionate power'to some of the States with comparatively small populations, simply because they were States. for one man one vote the labour representatives declared that they would not press for equal electorates. Having secured the one man one vote principle, they are now I admit that so far as influence making another demand. sentatives -did that, I would be the first to attack them for making any such bargain, because it is against the whole principle for which the labour party have been fighting, namely, that the power of governing should beshared by the people in absolutely equal proportion.

I contend that the influence of the country individual voter under the New South Wales system is as strongiy exercised in proportion to his representation as is that of the city voter. So far as New South Wales is concerned we have not equal electorates. have. which the electoral divisions were fixed was equal representation, but the number of voters in many electorates considerably exceeded the quota. presented in the local Parliament there were considerably more than the quota of voters, and in the adjoining district, which now forms a part of the electorate which I represent iu this House, the voters numbered a third more than the quota. at the federal convention showed that there was by no means an equality of voting power in the various districts. accident rather than design. During the time that the distribution of seats was taking place in 1893, the electoral commissioners had absolute equality given them as the standard to work upon, but they were allowed to depart from that standard, just as is proposed in this Bill, according to local circumstances, so long as they did not vary the numbers to a greater extent than was laid down by the Act. After the distribution of seats inequalities occurred. In one portion of my present electorate a gold field was discovered, with the result that a large number of men congregated there, and upset all previous calculations. Something similar happened in various city electorates, because jiopulation decreased in some places, and increased in others. The electorate represented by the honourable member for North Sydney presents a case in point. Inequalities occurred and were not remedied by the operation of the automatic clauses of the Bill which provided for a redistribution of seats every five years. those inequalities 1 mine what bad results may have followed.

We should see that the men returned to this House represent the voice of the people. If the same number of votes is required in one portion of the State to return twelve representatives as would suffice in another portion to return fifteen members, justice is not being done. So far as this Bill is concerned, not only shall I endeavour to have the present clauses reI n the electorate I retained, but I shall go a little further. I think that a variation of one-fourth from the standard quota is too much to allow. We may assume that with the extension of the franchise to women the quota will be somewhere about 20,000. If that is so, the variation of one-fourth from the standard would permit of electorates being so divided that there would be 15,000 voters in one electorate, and 25,000 in another. In some instances there might be a difference of 75 per cent, in the numbers of voters in two electorates, and I cannot understand why, under these circumstances, the honourable member for Gippsland should raise any objection. tive. lar provision to be fully operative in New South Wales. We passed an Act for the division of New South Wales into federal electorates, giving as the standard the same quota throughout. What was the result 1 The electoral commissioners brought down a report, which we had to accept, because we had no time to make a fresh subdivision, allowing for 9,000 voters in some districts and 15,000 in others. That is not equal representation, and the conditions ought to be altered at the earliest possible opportunity. I hope that the Ministry will secure a different set of commissioners on this occasion, and that they will insist upon the divisions being made according to the principles laid down by the Bill as it is passed.

Buti t is just possible that we inay find ourselves confronted with the difficulty that faced the Parliament of New South Wales upon the occasion to which I have alread}' referred. The report of the commissioners came back just before the date fixed for holding the election, and if we had not acted upon it , the State would have had to vote as one . constituency. I quite agree with the honourable' member for Gippsland thab the facilities offered to men for changing their electorates should not be too lax. A section should not be able to swamp an electorate, simply by changing their residence within a week of an election. But such a remark coming from Victoria is rather peculiar, seeing that the laws of this State permit of something of that sort occurring, in that they allow people with property in more than one electorate to vote in any electorate in which such property may be situated. Thus, if a conservative is safe in one particular division, they can flock over to another and knock out the liberal. abolished in Victoria. liberty here to do as I suggest. I hold that do away with any possibility of influence we should not facilitate that sort of thing being exercised. under the Commonwealth law.

A t any rate, we should make it perfectly clear that there shall be no break so far as a man's ability to vote is concerned. There are two or three other points to which I should like to direct attention. One has reference to the postal vote. I am not too certain that that vote is likely to be a great success. I agree as to the desirableness of allowing persons to register their votes for their own electorates wherever they may happen to be, but if a man can get an authority to vote away from a polling booth and can register his vote before certain officials, the door is at once opened to the exercise of undue influence. We want to preserve the secrecy of the ballot. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The postal vote is secret. * contrary it may not. registered before officials its secrecy is safeguarded almost absolutely ? ing it to be registered before permanent Government officials, the risk of undue influence being exerted is minimised. But if, on the contrary, it is registered before other people, there is a danger that they may successfully insist upon the elector disclosing the way in which he is voting. I prefer the system which obtained i u Queensland and Tasmania during the first federal elections. That system allows a voter upon polling day to enter the nearest polling booth and sign a declaration that he is upon the roll for a particular electorate, whereupon he is given a blank ballot-paper. That paper, when marked, is posted by the prereturning officer of the division to which the To some extent that will safeguard the am doubtful whether I secrecy of the ballot.",58,Elector Albill Second Reading

McLEAN -We have never found it so in Victoria. South Australia it was abused. Idonotknow that the electors there enjoyed the same safeguards as are contained in this Bill, but I am assured that the women voters were influenced to a considerable degree. took out these certificates, and voted by post. It seems to me there is a fine field for the exercise of undue influence unless the Government proposal is safeguarded to a very considerable extent. The only objection which can be urged against the system I have indicated is that it may delay the declaration of the poll by a few days, during which the votes are being forwarded by post fiom the places where they have been recorded to the divisions for which they are cast. That, however, is a very minor matter. The contingent vote which is provided for in the Bill will, I fear, prove confusing to the electors. is the experience of Queensland. It has not been used by either political party there. A t each election the different parties have strongly advised their followers not to uso the contingent vote. Mr L. cases it has been used, and has affected elections. are unwilling to avail themselves of it . for that. to any party man. The element of confusion is, I think, worthy of consideration, because there will probably be an attempt made to synchronise the elections for the two Houses, so as to minimise expense. As the time approaches when a proportion of the Senate must go to the country, there will be an attempt made to bring about the dissolution of this Chamber, so that the two elections may take place upon the same date. Probably BUI. I am not certain that it that will save Australia£40,000 or £50,000, and there will naturally be a desire on the part of Parliament that that course shall be adopted as often as is convenient. Of course, a penal dissolution affecting this House only would prevent that being done ; but, assuming that in a majority of cases the House of Representatives and one half of the Senate have to be elected upon the same day, the position is that the electors will be given twoballot papers, one of which will have to be marked with crosses, I have been told that in whilst upon the other the voter will have an opportunity of recording his preferences according to the number of candidates in the field. That will most likely result in confusion. polling booths. be a risk of confusion arising, and it would entail all the expense attaching to two. elections, because the engagement of extra pollclerks and presiding officers, and to a moderate extent the erection and renting of buildings, wouldrun intornoney. Thereisthepossibility of confusion resulting, and the large political parties in the Commonwealth will probably advise their followers not to use the contingent vote. Afte r all, there is not a great deal of trouble likely to ensue through men being returned by minority votes. Some members in this Parliament have been returned by minorities, but the cases are I understand that that comparatively few. Por myself I am not afraid, because in the past I have always had an absolute majority. I am not speaking with any personal feeling, but I think we can afford to run a small risk in this regard rather than run the risk of the E. GROOM.

The powers that we should still have in regard to the discussion of public questions would give us considerable influence in the disposal of such questions even under the referendum. I am sorry to say, however, that when I spoke against the Constitution Bill, I had but little influence. People had made up their minds to vote for federation, and my voice was a "" still, small"" one, so far as effect was concerned. with regard to the voters' certificates under the Bill, which are designed to meet the cases of men who, having been set down for a particular polling place, think they are unlikely to be 'able to vote there, and desire to vote somewhere else within the division. I object absolutely to that provision, being of opinion that there is no necessity to confine men to one particular polling place. The object of the Minister is a good one, and no doubt in his opinion the provision sufficiently meets the case. But I know of instances where men could not possibly know of their probable absence in sufficient time to apply for a certificate. Men who live in the country, and have to look after stock, may be away from home 20 or 40 miles on the day of election, and yet still be within their division. Under this 39 F 2 Bill, unless such men have, in sufficient time, given notice of thenprobable absence, and unless they can spare the time to get a certificate, they are absolutely disfranchised. In order to get the certificate it may be necessary to go to a post-office a distance of 10 or 15 miles ; and because they are unable to do this they, through no fault of their own, are disfranchised, although they are just as good citizens as they were a few daysI am more concerned previously: Some means should be devised to avoid the likelihood of personation or I fraud, and, at the same time, insure an opportunity of voting, so long as a man has remained in his division. A t the last election in my own district quite a number of men were disfranchised because they were away from home, and they would not have had an opportunity of obtain^ ing certificates -under such a Bill as this. There are other cases where men have ridden, say, 20 or 30 miles, in order to obtain electors' rights, only to find that the official was too busy to issue them, or away. That is just as likely to occur in. regard to the issue of these certificates. able member substitute ? it is necessary to substitute anything. Personally, I have a liking for -the system of electors' rights which obtains, in New South Wales. I admit, however, that at this stage it would be unfair to ask the House to consider a provision of the sort, which would necessitate an elaborate set of clauses. Further, I admit that there is a good deal of difference of opinion on the question. Another point is It does seem to me, however, that if there was any doubt about the voter, he could' always be asked to sign a declaration. After all, the leakage from this cause would be comparatively small, if any. If the penalty for false declaration were imprisonment without the option of a fine, I do not think there would be much likelihood of men running the risk of. incurringit. difficulty is to get men to vote. what the honourable member says.

It is a mistake to confine him to one polling place, been made between country and State elecand I trust that honourable members may see the wisdom of making some alterations. I give the Minister every credit for introducing an up-to-date Bill. I have pointed out what seem to me some errors, but these are errors of detail rather than of principle. I , for one, am so anxious to see this measure, or something like it, become law, that I am prepared to give way to some extent rather than delay legislation which I believe will go far to ensure that the representatioa of the people in Australia will be at least -equal, if not superior, to that found elsewhere, gretted that the Bill has been sprung so suddenly on the House. I am sure that, had the circumstances been otherwise, there would have been a larger attendance of' honourable members ready to discuss the provisions. I have only glanced at the Bill and cannot deal with it at the length I States into electorates solely upon a populashould like, but generally I may say I regard it as a very good measure. There are a number of provisions in it which are entirely, new in Victoria, though I believe they are in operation in some of the sister States, and have proved very acceptable. fairs may claim to have reached the high-water mark of liberal legislation in electoral matters. I join with the honourable member for Gippsland in taking exception to the provision dealing with the distribution of districts. Like himself, I had to do with the redistribution of electorates in Victoria for the federal elections. That was not a very hard task, and we certainly do not require an elaborate and expensive body, such as that proposed in the B ill , ' to carry it out. I suppose that in committee the Minister will say whether or not he intends to disturb, the existing districts. In Victoria, there has been no objection raised on this score, and it is to welcome the provision for voting by post, and, personally, I do not see why all the voting should not be done in that way, and enormous expense thus saved. But everything must have a beginning, and I am glad to see a provision by which distant or delicate persons may exercise the franchise. One important provision in the Bill to which I take serious objection, together with the honourable member for Gippsland that a proper distinction has not torates. The honourable member for Bland takes very strong exception to any difference being made in the proportion of representation between city and country electorates. He claims that the basis should be purely that of population. If that basis is adopted it will be most unjust,to the rural districts. The people there cannot meet together and arrive at conclusionsin the same united way as can those in the city. If we form the electorates simply upon a population basis, the country constituencies in many parts of Australia will be enormously large, entailing increased difficulty upon the electors in regard to the recording of their votes, and certainly imposing greater difficulties upon honourable members. It is set forth in the Bill that in regard to the demarcation of the electoral districts regard shall be had to community or diversity of interest, means of communications, and pli3'sical features. If we are to divide the tion basis, what necessity can there be for asking the commissioners to make any discrimination in regard to those matters? They will only have to findoutwhere the population is and carve out the districts accordingly. If regard is to be had to the three points to The Minister for HomeA f which I have referred we certainly cannot act in accordance with the present provisions of the Bill.

I ask simply for justice. The provisionfor equal representation on thebasis of population maybe ideally correct, but pracundetermined, and it should be settled tically it works out in a most unjust way. The population of Sydney and suburbs is equal to 35 per cent, of the total population of New South Wales; the population of Brisbane is equal to 24 per cent, of the total population of that State; the population of Adelaide represents 44 per cent, of the population of South Australia ; the population of Melbourne represents' 41 per cent, of the population of Victoria; and the population of Perth is equal to 19 per cent, of the population of Western Australia. We find that out of a population of 1,359,133 in New South Wales there are no less than 582,617 resident in ten large towns, including Sydney and suburbs. Out of a total population of 503,266 in Queensland, no less than 210,122, or nearly one-half, are to be found in eleven towns. In Victoria, out of a population of 1,206,438, 577,254, or nearly half the population of the State, reside in three cities, namely, Melbourne and suburbs, Ballarat, and Bendigo. tion according to population, Melbourne, Ballarat, and Bendigo will have a majority of the votes and representation. country districts would stand that?

I would ask the honourable member for Bland is it fair that representation should be discratic sense. tributedJn such a way that in Victoria, for example, we would have some eleven or twelve members representing Melbourne and suburbs, and only eleven or twelve representing the whole of the State? The principle wo.uld be most unjust' to this State. On the accomplishment of federation, the Victorian Government brought down to the State Parliament a proposal, which was endorsed without any objection, other section, to take, approximately, about 14,000 electors for every town constituency, 12,000 for every urban 'constituenc}-, and 10,000 for every country constituency. that population if we have representation absolutely according to population. Provisionis made for a margin of one-fourth in the Bill,, and if that is made specific and allowed we shall be content. But the whole matter is too definitely one way or the other. The provision in regard to the recording of votes by persons who change their electorates shortly before polling day is one in regard to which care must be taken. A provision for the issue of voters' certificates, -which was intended to remedy an injustice in Victoria, has worked out most unjustly.. Instances have happened in which a monthbefore pollingdaysomehundreds of people who have emigrated from one district to another, and, have taken up their quarters in deserted; houses or other places, have been ablelargely to influence elections. No honorable member would desire that. It is not f a i l that at the last moment, and after therojls have been compiled, a district which, has a settled population should be liable toa sudden influx which could upset an election. This provision is an instrument which, while it may be used to suit the working classes on certain occasions, can also be used with very vicious effects by Therefore, if we have representarich men. I do not know that I have much more to say, because the Bill is really one more for consideration in committee than What for second reading speeches. I am sure that that part of the Bill which relates to the limitation of election expenses will be welcomed by honourable members generally. It is taken, I believe, from the South Australian Act, and I think it will work well in a demoSpeaking for myself, I welcome it most heartily, because if it is in force at the next general election the tricks which were tried in my constituency on the occasion of the last election will be impossible.

In the first place, it seems to me that the returning officers throughout the Common wealtli should be authorized to use the various post-offices. That would save a great deal of money. It seems to me that, if men are paid for certain work, it does me to forfeit the confidence of honourable not matter to them how they are required to carry out that work. I know that when I was in the employ of a certain institution it did not matter to me what I had to do as long as I received the same pay. I wish to enter my protest at once against the idea that we who have been sent here by the various constituencies, because the people believe in us, cannot act fairly in the division of the various States into electoral districts. I want to ask honourable members to l if t up their voices against what is really a premium to people outside to discount the honesty of purpose of members and their sense of justice in carrying out any work. I refer to the fact that everything to be dor.e, not only in connection with this Bill, but in relation to other matters, is to be carried out by some one outside Parliament. Government at once select some one outside for the work. ""When the proper time comes I shall move that a select committee, similar to that in existence in South Australia, be appointed for the purpose of cutting up the Commonwealth into electoral divisions. up that cutting up. Mr O'MALLEY -Very well. In that event, the House will have to deal with the matter ; but if we allot the work to outside experts, they will be able to take as long as they like in the performance of it t h e y will, perhaps, bring in an imperfect measure, which, must either be accepted or else we must fight the election again with some of the States undivided. We could appoint two honourable members from each State on the select committee.. If honourable members are afraid to be appointed to delimit the electoral boundaries of their own States, I shall be perfectly prepared, for exaniple, to let the honourable and learned member for Corinella go to my State for that purpose. I would raither trust my brother members than outside experts. It is strange that I have more confidence in my brother members than they have in themselves. honourable member. MrO ' MALLEY It is a matter of indifference to me what confidence they have in me. I am one of the most independent ""men in the House. I have done nothing in this House that should cause members, but if they are so absolutely narrow intellectually that they are unable to appreciate the intelligence that I bring to bear here, then the Lord pity them. Another point to which I desire to refer is in regard to the enrolment of electors. We continually . find courts of revision sitting here for the purpose of striking' people off the rolls. It is difficult enough to put them on, without desiring to put them off. It seems to me that there should have been courts of revision to place people on the rolls, and not to throw them off. The police should be employed wherever possible to help to place people on the rolls. Unless we make it easy to place people on the rolls, thousands will never be able to exercise, the franchise. It will be just as it was in Tasmania. If it is only to skin a dog the Last year I put upon the roll in Tasmania 3,200 men who had been disfranchised because no one had exercised sufficient energy to travel' over the mountains and arrange t»",63,Smith The N The Honor Inequality Under Any System

331,Mr Mccay,"Than they have in thehave them registered as electors. In one of the States certain people looked down the rolls before the courts of revision sat, and lodged objections against numbers of working men whose names were on the roll. Notices were sent to these electors, who resided 30 or 40 miles away, calling upon them to appear at the revision court to answer the objections, and those who failed to attend had their names struck off the roll. When I offered myself as a candidate for election to the Legislative Assembly in South Australia a second time, I was defeated by months before the elections, a number of Votes were transferred from other electorates to that which I was seeking to represent. People stopped at the hotels in my electorate for the ten days required to' qualify them as electors in that district, and then voted against me. We should exercise the . greatest care with regard to transferred or "" faggot"" votes I am glad that, in fixing the divisions of the electorates, a margin of one-fourth is to be allowed. Upon the mines of the west coast of Tasmania there are thousands of men whose wives live in Melbourne, Sydney, Launceston, or Hobart, and, therefore, if a strictly equal standard is provided for, or a narrow margin only is allowed, the gold-fields will not receive the representation to which they are properly entitled. In some cases the mining fields may be associated with agricultural districts, and the miners will be virtually disfranchised if a farmer is elected to represent them. In reference to the purging of the rolls of the names of dead men, I might point out that great pleasure has been taken in Tasmaniai n striking off the names of hundreds of living men because of their temporary absence from the district in which they were enrolled. This is another matter regarding which we shall have to exercise great care. I do not agree with the proposal that certificates should be issued to enable electors to register their votes at polling booths away from the locality in which they reside. The aristocrats will be all right if certificates have to be obtained, because they are always prepared to exercise the franchise, but working men will not have the time or opportunity to bother about obtaining certificates. In Tasmania they have what is known as the Gilmore Convenience Clausesi n their Electoral Act, he booth nearest to the place at which he may happen to be on the day of election. When he records his vote a certificate is sent to the returning officer at the booth to which his vote properly belongs. Why could not this be done in the case of our elections 1 I wish to state a case which will give point to my remarks. There is a train leaving Mount Lyell early in the morning before the polling booth is open. Electors travelling by this means to Zeehan are, under' the Tasmanian system, allowed to exercise their votes at the latter place. Under the plan proposed in the Bill fourteen votes, because for two they would require to obtain certificates before theycould register their votes. Weshould provide that, wherever a man or woman may be within the Commonwealth on election day, he or she should be able to vote. Supposing a Queensland elector happened to be in Victoria on election day, he should be allowed to register his vote in the latter State on making a statutory declaration that he was on the roll"" for his own State. A penalty of five years' imprisonment might be imposed upon persons who were found guilty of making false declarations. I shall make a proposal in this direction when we deal with the Bill in committee. I do not approve of the proposal to refer all election disputes to the High Court. My experience in South Australia has shown me that the system of referring such disputes to the law courts involves very heavy expense, and I venture to say that if the South Australian system had been in vogue here it would have cost the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, £500 each to defend their seats before a ' Judge. This House should exercise absolute authority in the settlement of all election disputes, because they relate to questions of fact, and not to points of law. I shall also oppose any proposal to refer election disputes to the State courts. What chance should I have if a case in which I was concerned were referred to the Judges in Tasmania. The Judges of that State, for whom I have"" the greatest respect, are influenced by their environment, and I should want my case to come before the members of this House. I have a strong objection to the proposed system of voting by post. I regard post voting as an absolute violation of the secrecy of the ballot, and as placing an engine in which enable a man to vote at the hands of the aristocracy for the destruction of the democracy ? Sir honourable member provide for the cases of men located in remote portions of the back blocks? Mr O'MALLEY -Arrangement s could easily be made for such men to vote at the nearest booth. During the last election in which I was concerned in South Australia the local postmasters and postmistresses were engaged travelling around in vehicles with the agents of my opponent, collecting post votes. I did not know, what they were doing until it was too late, and as a consequence I was beaten. to post-voting, because it offers facilities for getting voters out of the, way on election day, and using their votes in the interests of particular candidates. During one election I went to a watering place near Adelaide, and on speaking to a number of nice young ladies, whom I saw there, was informed that their mistresses had given them a holiday in consideration of their leaving their votes behind. These votes virtually decided the election for the district of North Adelaide. Sir honourable member voted in favour of female suffrage. Mr O'MALLEY -Yes ; but I want the female voters to face theresponsibilities of the suffrage in the same way that the males do. I further intend to oppose the,proposal to assist electors. That is another great scheme which has been tried in America. I can assure honourable members that if they will allow me to enter the polling booths with the electors I will have three-fourths of them blind before the day is over. I remember seeing the secrecy of the ballot utterly destroyed in Melbourne some ten or twelve years ago. Upon that occasion a man entered the polling booth, secured a blank ballot-paper, had some copies struck off. marked them in favour of a certain canx didate, and afterwards deposited them in the ballot-box. I note that this Rill prohibits candidates from addressing elecEors in any public-house. In my electorate, nearly every hotel has a hall -attached to it, and I should like the Minister to explain what effect that provision will have in this connection. Furthermore, in the case of senators, why'should a man be compelled to vote for three ? I might think that only one candidate is worthy. I am also opposed to disfranchising the returning officer. Does clause 185 mean that every candidate must one.; I am my own agent. These are points that I intend to fight for in committee. I trust that honourable members will not relegate every fu notion wh ich has to be discharged, to outsiders. When we came here it was supposed that we were the picked, men of Australia, and yet Ministers to-day, by their actions, are continually declaring that, we are fit for nothing except to register their decrees. I am opposed to that sort of thing. Everything that we can honestly and justly do, we should do, because we are I also object paid for it . I am perfectly willing to act as a member of a committee to define the electoral divisions of South Australia and Tasmania. When the proper time comes, shall have more to say upon this matter. journed. General) I moveI n doing so, I desire to ball attention to the state of public business. It is now evident that the Senate is likely to be engaged upon the discussion of the Customs Tariff Bill for some three or four weeks longer. Under these circumstances, and recognising the strain which has been imposed upon honourable members, the Government feel that a short interval should be afforded to them before they resume consideration of that measure upon its return from another place. The only remaining Bills which absolutely require to be disposed of prior to that short adjournment consist of the Electoral B ill the second reading debate upon which I had hoped to see concluded this evening-and the Bonus Bill, which forms part of the Tariff proposals^ of the Government. The House has made it evident that the latter measure will require amendment, and certainly senators are entitled to know what those amendments are, especially as some of those already proposed would radically alter the characten of the. measure. They are, therefore,-justified in asking to be made acquainted with the. form which the amendments will take before being called upon to deal with Division VIA . of the Tariff, which is dependent upon the Bonus Bill. It is because of, not",64,Smith The N The Honor Inequality Under Any System

I ask honourable members to complete its consideration. When -we have come to a decision upon these points we -might well adjourn. I have taken an opportunity of consulting Mr Speaker, and believe that there is no constitutional objection to that adjournment being of a provisional character. That is to say, we might adjourn until a fixed date-possibl y three weeks or a month hence-o n the understanding that if unexpectedly the Tariff were disposed of by the Senate before that date, Mr Speaker could, by giving honourable members some days' notice, fix a day for the re-assembling, of the House. It is undesirable that the discussion upon the Tariff should be delayed a single day by any adjournment. Once we have disposed of the business which is absolutely preliminary to the Tariff, there is uo reason why we should not adjourn. Mr Po-Tjrrox -I s it intended to adjourn this week ? of the business I have mentioned. terests of representatives from the distant States, we should, if it be necessary, sit a portion of next week to dispose of the business referred to, so that honourable members may have two or three weeks' adjournment, which will enable them to return to their homes. worth) I certainly think that the adjournment should take placo at the ond of the present week. It is not fair to ask honourable members to attend here during Coronation week, and to expect us to come back again in view of an adjournment would not be reasonable. The Attorney-General has set before us rather a large order. I think that if we dispose of the Electoral Bill this week we shall dovery well. I do not quite see with him that we ought to consider the other Chamber in connection with the Bonus Bill. It would be just as reasonableforus to wait for the Senate to either accept or reject Division VIA . of the Tariff as an indication another place. I do not think that the whether it is of any use for us to proceed further with the Bonus Bill. I am quite willing to expedite matters as much as possible. I think that our first aim should be to shorten the debate upon the i second reading of the Electoral Bill, because, after all, nearly everything in connection with that measure will have to be. said over again. It is essentially a committee Bill. I do not intend to speak upou the second reading, but I think that whilst we will do our best to reach the Bonus Bill this week, if we finish the consideration of the Electoral Bill, the adjournment should take place. those whom the Attorney-General declares has earned a rest and I agree with him in that I feel that if we are asked to complete the consideration of the Electoral and Bonus Bills this week, we are expected to do something which a good many do not feel themselves justified in doing, in view of the opinions which they may have to express on behalf of their constituents; I know that the honourable gentleman is always amenable to reason, and I hope that upon reflection he will .see his way clear to allow honourable members; to reach their homes prior to the festivities in connection with Coronation week. There are a number of provisions in the Electoral B ill which will have to be altered. If we finish dealing with that measure this week, Yes,; and in the inI think we shall have done very well. In view of the fact that the Bonus Bill, if passed, will have to come into operation on dates much later than are now proposed, I do not see any great necessity for dealing with it now I do not agree with the honourable member for Wentworth when he says that we ought to wait until we know whether the other place accepts Division VIA . of the Tariff. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I said it was just as reasonable that we should wait, as that they should wait to see what we do with the Bonus Bill. cise. MrM c CAY All the other place con do is to.make requests; and to suggest that out Bill should depend on those requests seems an abrogation of our rights. We ought to be very jealous of those rights, because there can be no definition of them except by ourselves and the honourable members Of other place is.any more likely to be affected by what we do with the BonusB ill than we are likely to be affeoted in ""our treatment of the Bonus Bill, by the nature of their requests in regard to Division VIA .",66,William Mcmillan A N D Yet The That The House Do Now Adjourn
