Is the Prime Minister able to inform the House of the progress of the Conference? £ have been advised by the Minister for Tirade and Customs that the progress towards a three power pact has been satisfactory. A message from another source stated that there was still a possibility of a five power pact being entered into. I cannot understand the emphatic newspaper statement that the dominions are an obstacle to agreement. My advice from the representative of the Government is that whilst he is' supporting a pact for disarmament or the reduction of armaments, he is not prepared to subscribe to an agreement that will involve Australia in an obligation to intervene in the internal troubles of Europe. His attitude is that whatever action is necessary in that regard should be decided at the Assembly of the League of Nations. reference to article 16 of the Covenant of the League? the newspaper messages have exaggerated the attitude of the dominion representatives.

I gather from the files that representations of a similar nature made to the Bruce-Page Government were being favourably considered when the elections occurred. The deputation pointed out that the proposed agreements could not be entered into with the law as it stood, without the fear that they might be declared illegal. It was stated that the main objects that would be achieved by such agreements were:1. The definite establishment of co-operation between the exporters of Australia and the oversea shipping service*. 2. Adequate and efficient transport services to meet the needs of the Australian exporttrade, both general and refrigerative. 3. ""The establishment of contracts for each of the chief commodities exported at fixed rates of freight for each complete season. 4. The conserving of berth cargo for regular berth vessels. 5. Equality of freight and of treatment to all shippers, large or small, irrespective of quantity shipped. 6. The more direct despatch and quicker delivery of cargoes oversea (perishable curgoes). 7. Tlie better organization of tonnage and the elimination of waste. 8. The avoidance of immediate freight increases. When thu first representations were made to me it was stated that the object of the proposal was to regulate shipping, and the amount of produce to be shipped, in such a way that costs could be kept down, and an increase in the present freight rates avoided. On looking through the draft of the proposed agreements, I found that no mention was made of any fixed rates of freight. When I dreAV attention to this fact I was informed that the ship-owners did not desire provisions of that kind to be inserted, although it was understood that there would be no increase in the existing rates. I was not satisfied with that understanding, and intimated that if the law were to be amended to permit agreements to be made with the object of keeping freights down, it was essential that it should be set out in them. The representatives who waited upon me were rather afraid that the head offices of the shipping companies would not agree to the insertion of such a provision. I insisted upon the necessity for it, and a subcommittee of the Cabinet was appointed to go thoroughly into the whole subject. Subsequently the representatives agreed that fixed rates of freight should be inserted in the agreements. Separate agreements will be made with each organization and each shipping company which handles different classes of produce, and in every case a schedule of freights will be included in the agreement. The agreements will remain in force for twelve months, and during that period no variation of the freight rates may be made. ample guarantees will be given to that effect? be part of the agreement. No change in the rates may be made for twelve months, and then not without the giving of three months' notice, and consultation with the exporters. The object of the amendment of the act is simply to allow these agreements to be made between the ship-owners and shippers. The Government does not come into the matter at all, and does not endorse or ratify the agreements, which will be mutual arrangements between the parties concerned. When this act was 'first passed in 1906, the object of it was to prevent combines and monopolies squeezing any section of the community. Originally it was not intended to apply to shipping, but had relation principally to the Coal Vend and similar organizations which might attempt to act in restraint of trade, or bring undue pressure upon the community. In this case it is obvious that, as the agreements are being made mutually by all the parties concerned, there can be no suggestion that pressure is being exerted with the object of injuring any one. It was never contemplated that the act should operate to prevent the making of mutual agreements. The 22 shipping companies which trade to and from Australia are already well organized, and are known as the shipping combine. They have it in their power, in the absence of agreements of the kind now proposed, to increase freights on our produce at any moment, but if these agreements are made they will not be able to do so, except after the expiration of twelve months, and the giving of three months' notice. If no notice is given of an intention to terminate the agreements, they will remain in force for another year. The result, of the making of the agreements will be to stabilize shipping and freights. At present the shipping companies may increase their rates without consulting any one; but it is now proposed to provide that no increase shall be made without consulting the shippers. There will still be competition between the various shipping lines, but there will also be a certain amount of regulation. among the shipping lines in the Inchcape combine. to this extent, that shippers have the choice of certain lines. British buyers of wool, for instance, ship their wool on British ships, and Italian and French buyers on Italian or French ships. That choice will still be available. But the Running of the ships will be arranged so that overlapping and wastage of effort will be eliminated. If these arrangements come into force it will be guaranteed that sufficient ships will be run to",17,Australian Industries

That will be much better than half a dozen boats calling at that port to l if t small parcels of meat, and then calling at other ports along the coast to load other small parcels. If a boat is filled at one port, it can go direct to its destination, and the meat will open up in better condition than if the hatches have to be lifted half a dozen times before the holds are filled. The same remarks apply to fruit. One boat will be able to go to Tasmanian ports, for instance, and fill up, and another boat go to mainland ports and fill up, which will be better than both boats calling at all the ports and only partially filling at any of them. It is claimed that the agreements will provide for a regular, efficient and speedy service. The ship-owners have discussed the subject fully with representatives of different industries, and a general desire has been expressed that something of this kind should be done. Resolutions have also been passed by different producers' organisations requesting the Government to take this action. The president of the Australian Farmers Federal Organizations, in the course of his remarks at the deputation to which I have referred, said that the agreements would marshal the freights and organise the tonnage. added:At the present time the shippers do not know what tonnage is available. It is absolutely essential for'the primary producers to their holds at an even lower charge than have the whole transport business thoroughly organized. The ship-owners say that if the tonnage is organized, they will organize the freights. This will ensure cheaper rates, and special cases; but chartered boats will a better service. At present there is no system and no organization. It was also pointed out that this is the only practical means by which the tonnage can be organized and freight charges small parcels of wheat.

However, the Government is not taking any responsibility for the methods that are being adopted. A body is being set up to organize the tonnage and control the cargo available from time to time, so that the shipping companies will know the number of boats that will be required. tee that the tonnage will be available? the agreements that the tonnage shall be adequate, efficient and regular. The agreements apply only to the regulai berth cargo, and not to the cargo of chartered boats such as carry our wheat overseas. The wheat organizations have only been represented in the negotations because a certain proportion of wheat is exported on the regular lines. The great bulk of our wheat is carried by tramp steamers. These will not be affected by the agreements. The freight charges of He chartered boats are, as a rule, somewhat lower than those of the ordinary boats. cargo boats take parcels of wheat to fill that of the chartered boats. still be necessary for the handling of our wheat. The bulk of the harvest will be still handled by special wheat boats, and the regular berth boats will handle only affect only the boats trading regularly with Australia. steamship owners view this proposal? cargoes of ore, and rough cargo generally.",19,Australian Industries

CAMERON -If these agreements are entered into it w ill not cut out the tramp steamers? agreements are being made between the organizations concerned and the shipowners with respect to produce like f r u it , butter, meat and wool. The organizations concerned w ill undertake to ship only with the overseas companies which enter into agreements. Paragraph 4 of the proposed agreements is important. It reads:The ship-owners further agree during the term of this agreement, and in respect of the goods specified, not to enter into any arrange-' ments with any shippers on more favorable terms than those of this agreement, and that any shipper is entitled to enter into an agreement with the ship-owners in all conditions irrespective of the quantity of cargo shipped by him. That was put in after discussion as to whether, perhaps, some small producer who had not entered into the agreement in the first place might be debarred from getting these freight rates. Throughout the whole discussion members of the Cabinet and myself carefully watched the interests of Australian producers. were met on every point we raised, and I believe that every possible safeguard has been made. Honourable members must realize that this is a matter of organization by both parties; not by the Government. It is an arrangement that the two parties concerned w ill give each other service, and not give their service to any one else. The ship-owners guarantee that they w ill not give the same freight rates to persons not in the agreement, but no one w ill be debarred from coming into the agreement if he chooses to do so. On the other hand, shippers agree to ship only by these 22 lines. obligation ? vided in the case of breaches of the agreement. obligations exacted as a condition to joining the agreement? wording of the bill makes it plain that those who offer to come into the agreement cannot be discriminated against. If the ship-owners refused to admit any one, and then charged him the higher freight rate, this provision would not relieve them from any of the penalties to which they would be subject under the existing act.. That is a further safeguard. Unless the producers in Australia can obtain the cheapest rates and the quickest service for their wheat, f r u it , butter and other produce it will seriously affect the development of the country. Mr Osborne, representing the butter cooperative and cheese factories, stated that all the producing industries were unanimous in their desire to bring about this agreement. He said that the New Zealand Dairy Produce Board had made a satisfactory agreement as a result of which their products are transported at freights considerably lower than are paid by Australian producers. The Dairy Produce Board here is in a position to control the whole of its exports, but it is unable to arrange a contract with the ship-owners owing to the existence of section 7 A of the Industries Preservation Act. This agreement is not intended to cover wheat, flour, or cargo of that kind, which will be left to tramp steamers. The ships which carry the bulk of the We wheat are chartered in London. If honourable members desire further information I shall be pleased to give it during the committee stage of the bill, and also to deal with any paragraph in the agreement upon which they desire enlightenment. Although the agreement is nor embodied in the bill, and the Government is in no way responsible for it , we must be guided by the terms of the agreement in determining the wisdom of this legislation. The Government believes that the interests of the producers w ill be' safeguarded by their representation on the Association. If any producers feel that organizations at present in existence are not representative of them, there is nothing to prevent them from forming new organizations, and becoming parties to the agreement. There is nothing to prevent an individual farmer or exporter of goods from becoming a party to the agreement on the same terms as are enjoyed by organizations. It may be argued that this w ill enable the shipping combine to make contracts with the producers to the exclusion of the tramp' lines; that it is in effect buttressing trade combines. In this connection it is well to remember, however, that",20,Australian Industries

69,Mr Scullin,"Non e at all. Thewhatever combination can be effected in the shipping trade exists already. There is hi existence a shipping conference which has organized the Australian trade fairly completely, though it has not organized the allocation of ships to various ports. Arrangements in that regard are still haphazard, and there is much overlapping and waste. On the other hand, the exporters are not organized at all. When there was an Australian-wide wheat pool in existence, organization was very complete. Those in control knew exactly what space would be required, and arrangements were made to get it. We must face the fact that this is a period of trade organization. Whatever opinions one may have on the general subject of shipping combines, it must be admitted that it is better for our producers, through their organizations, to enter into an agreement such as this, and thus have some control over freight rates, than that they should remain at the mercy of the ship-owners. I do not use that expression with any desire to be offensive to the ship-owners. Erom my discussions with them, I believe that they realize that it would be unwise for them to risk killing the goose which lays the golden egg. * They are aware that excessive freight rates would so seriously hamper Australian production as to injure their own trade. They desire to leave freights as they are, provided they can carry on at a profit to themselves. Hence the need for 'regulation. I believe that it would have been better to have kept the Commonwealth Shipping Line in operation as a check on the combine, but we must face the fact that the line has gone, and the shippers now must deal with the shipping conference. with serious misgiving, any possibility of an increase of present freights on Australian produce. For that reason we have gone into this matter, and have agreed to amend the law in the manner set out. I commend the measure to the favorable consideration of honourable members. I am glad to be able to approve fully and tion Act 1906-10. That act belonged to wholly of this bill. The measure had a past age in regard to many of its probeen prepared in part by the last Governvisions.

It is a me that if we were reconsidering the matstep towards the rationalization of one ter now a good many modifications would important industry affecting Australia. We are, I think, beginning to realize that while we may he afraid of combines, trusts, monopolies, and the like, the successful conduct of modern industry demands organization, and unless we are prepared to follow the example of other countries, we shall find ourselves doing everything on a small scale, and in a foolishly competitive manner. I believe in competition, but competition in some cases can be overdone. In past years we have had an unnecessary number of ships calling at some of our ports. There has been, in consequence, irregularity of service, and failure to serve the interests of the community as a whole. The scramble for cargoes reminds me of a bus running ahead of a tram and picking up the passengers on the same route. There is no sense in it. When the Commonwealth Shipping Line was sold by the last Government it was done because of the serious losses which were occurring, and because of certain matters of principle on which the two sides of the House were acutely divided. At that time, it was apparent that all shipping lines trading to Australia were losing heavily. It was predicted that freights would inevitably increase as a result of selling the Line. The Government was anxious that the best shipping service possible should bp rendered to Australia at the lowest cost. Consequently, when an announcement was made that freights would be increased, Mr Bruce invited a delegation of British ship-owners to come to Australia. This bill is partly the result of the work of that delegation, and partly of the work of the Australian producers, as menI contemplate, tioned by the Prime Minister. The Australian Oversea Transport Association was formed, and it is a very representative body indeed. As soon as those interested began to get down to the facts, and sought to arrange co-ordination of sailings, security of loadings, freight rates, &e., they found themselves faced with the Australian Industries Preserva-",21,Australian Industries

This bill is a modification of the act, and I am glad that the Government has introduced it , because it constitutes a recognition by the Government of the very obvious principle that industry must be profitable if it is to be carried on. Section4 of the existing act imposes very heavy penalties, up to £500 a day, upon any person who enters into any contract in relation to trade and commerce with other countries, or among the States, in restraint of, or in an attempt to restrain, trade and commerce. That is rather an amazing provision. The' act specifies defences, and if it can be shown that what was done was not to the detriment of the public, no offence is committed. hesitate to take part in a transaction which might render them liable to such a heavy penalty. Section7 also provides a penalty of £500 a day, and of £1,000 a day in the case of corporations, against those who monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with others to monopolize any part of the trade and commerce with other countries or among the States, with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of any service, merchandise, or commodity. Section 7A fixes a penalty of £500 uponAny person who, in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, cither as principal or agent, in respect of dcsvlings in any goods or services gives offers or promises to any other person any rebate, refund, discount, concession, or reward, for the reason, or upon the condition, express or implied, that the latter person(«) deals, or has dealt, or will deal, or intends to deal exclusively with any person, either in relation to any particular goods or services or generally. Section 7B contains similar provisions with respect to refusals to supply services for the reason that the other person concerned does not deal exclusively with the person so refusing. The agreement proposed is one under which the shippers contract in relation to the shipping of specified articles to deal exclusively with the shipping companies who are the other parties to it . That agreement almost certainly would be an offence under the provisions of section 7A ' of the act, and action in pursuance of it would involve an offence under section 7B. Accordingly, if this degree of rationalization of the shipping industry is to be brought about there is very little doubt that a measure like this is necessary. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has stated that the bill is introduced to remove a doubt that exists as to the legality of the proposed agreement. I have seen that agreement only this morning, and from a first reading of it have not the slightest doubt that under our present law it is hopelessly illegal, and that therefore it is necessary to enact this legislation. The Prime Minister has referred to certain of its provisions. The agreement fixes the rates of freight for a period of twelve months. Clause3 provides:Nevertheless, persons would The ship-owners agree to provide vessels to maintain berth sailings for the ordinary requirements of the trade from usual ports in the Commonwealth of Australia to those ports in the United Kingdom and the Continent of Europe customarily served by the respective ship-owners. That is as definite an agreement as it is practicable to make to provide a regular shipping service. Clause4 provides:The ship-owners further agree during the term of this agreement and in respect of the goods specified not to enter into any arrangements with any shippers on more favorable terms than those of this agreement; and that any shipper is entitled to enter into an agreement with the ship-owners in all respects similar to this agreement and for the same cargoes rates and conditions irrespective of the quantity of cargo shipped by him. If the terms of this agreement are not final, it might be adyisable to reconsider the wording "" any shipper is entitled to enter into any agreement."" The agreement is made between certain persons of the one part, called the ship-owners, and certain persons of the other part, called the shippers. The object of Clause4 is to provide that every person who desires to ship goods shall have the same rights. It might be worthwhile to consider an alteration of the phraseology so as to make it read "" any person desiring to ship goods of the class mentioned in the agreement shall be entitled"", &c. MrE .

71,Mr Latham,"The Government isof a doubt it will do so; and the shipowners will probably meet it. Clause5 contains the provisions relating to exclusive shipments which would make the agreement subject to the penalties provided by the act if it were not amended. It reads:In consideration of the foregoing the shipless. I suggest that there should be a pers agree to confine shipment of all goods report indicating the operations that are specified in clause 1 to vessels loaded by the taking place under and by virtue of this ship-owners at ports in the Commonwealth of law.

Here we have a combination of wealthy ship-owners threatening that, unless they are given certain conditions, they will raise freights. The bill is designed to keep freights at their present level for a period of twelve months. I should like the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) to say whether he will undertake to withdraw this concession if the ship-owners should act contrary to the spirit of the agreement when its term has expired? of fact, I have already pointed out that that is the action which the Government would take if this right were abused. assurance satisfies me on that point. But there is another danger that I apprehend. We know that there is always a tendency towards industrial unrest on the wharves. If any shipping companies combined to enforce conditions that were repugnant to waterside workers no penalty would be provided for breaches of an award. to industrial conditions. so long as the workers, as well as the shippers and the consumers, are protected. I shall watch with interest the operations that are conducted under this legislation, and hope that they will be for the benefit of the country. I have no desire to prolong a discussion upon a matter that appears to be noncontroversial ; but as the representative of a rural constituency from which considerable quantities of primary produce are exported, I wish to voice my entire agreement with the bill that has been brought forward this morning by the Prime Minister, and to say that it is indeed a pleasure to be able to congratulate the right honourable gentleman upon having taken action with which I cordially agree. Reference has already been made to the fact that when, early last year, it was reported in the press that there was a likelihood of an increase in freights on goods coming from overseas to Australia, the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, invited representatives of the shipping companies to visit Australia and meet importers and exporters before taking action in that direction. The shipowners accepted that invitation, and met representatives of the importers and exporters in Sydney. At that conference the representatives of the ship-owners pointed out very forcibly that the tonnage coming to and going from Australia was far greater than was warranted by the quantity of cargo offering. It was stated that freights must inevitably be higher in the long run if ships left Australia with cargoes that taxed their capacity only to the extent of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent. It was unanimously agreed to ask the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth to reduce port dues, to alter the incidence of income tax, and also to amend this act, as it prohibited the making of agreements between shipper and ship-owner. For some years agreements have been made by the Export Control Boards, such as the Dairy Produce Export Control Board and the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, that were set up by legislation by a former government. Those boards were given power to negotiate on an industry basis with the ship-owners with a view to obtaining the best possible terms I shall be satisfied for the carriage of the produce, the export of which they controlled. As a layman I have been unable to understand why a body set up by the Commonwealth could make agreements which ordinarily are prohibited by another statute. [Quorum formed.'] The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) expressed the view held by some people, that the greater the number of tramp steamers coming to Australia to lif t cargo, the lower the freights will be. Certainly, at times, tramp steamers have picked up, at cut rates, cargoes which otherwise would have been carried by other lines, and the shippers have enjoyed a temporary advantage. But we have to remember that ultimately the exporters must pay for all ships that come to Australia to carry their products. If the number of ships is in excess of requirements, the shippers will have to pay more, and ultimately an excess of shipping must mean an increase of freights. Certain steamship lines can be relied upon to maintain a regular service, not only in the busy season, but also at times when the .trade is not sufficient",24,Australian Industries

80,Mr Patersokr (Gippsland) [13.18].,"to be profitable, and they deserve special consideration. I recollet a sentence, in a report by a committee appointed by the British Government, to the effect that the shippers expect the ship at the wharf without f a i l , whilst the ship-owner expects the cargo on the wharf without f a i l . Shipping companies, which provide a regular and dependable service, have a right to expect the shippers to provide cargo for them, rather than to give their business to tramps, which, call only when profitable business is offering, and give, at best, a spasmodic service. The only practical way of ensuring the concentration of cargoes for the regular shipping lines, is by the shippers agreeing to send the' whole of their products by those lines in return for concession rates. If these agreements should result in the reduction of the number of tramp steamers to such an extent as would make possible an increase of freights by the regular lines, some action to protect exporters might be necessary, and the Prime Minister stated that, in such an event, the Government would be prepared to repeal the clause that he is now proposing to insert in the. Industries Preservation Act. arrangement proposed by the Government may be highly beneficial to Australian exporters, and proves that despite the dismal prophecies of Labour members, no harm was done to the primary producers by the sale of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. I support the bill. It proposes an experiment that is worthy of a trial. We are not sanctioning the creation of a shipping monopoly that w i ll be able to exploit disorganized shippers; there is to be organization on both sides, and that will provide the necessary safeguards. The suggestion that competition w ill bring down freights comes strangely from Government supporters. praises of competition are sung most loudly by honourable members on this side of the House. To-day the trend in industry and commerce throughout the world, is towards organization on a big scale, and the contention that the bringing to our shores of a larger number of ships than is needed to carry the cargoes offering, would mean a reduction in freights, is strange reasoning. I believe that this measure for what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has described as the rationalization of shipping, will prove beneficial. Shipping is divided into two classes-the regular lines to which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) referred, and the tramp steamers which roam the seas in search of profitable cargoes. If the proposed wheat pool is established it w ill be an organization of shippers which will prevent undue exploitation by the tramp steamers There is a danger that the 22 regular shipping lines may increase freight rates; but I believe that counter organization w ill prevent that. As a representative of the primary producers I cordially approve of the bill. one who is opposed to government interference w i th business, I welcome this measure. The Government should function, as the bill proposes, by giving legal sanction to agreements and arrangements between various bodies engaged in industry.

In 1921 the Commonwealth acquired about 161 acres of land at Mascot, and since that date a comprehensive scheme of improvements has been carried out by the Defence Department and people interested in civil aviation. The development of civil aviation in New South Wales has reached a stage when it is considered necessary to improve further the aerodrome, and to that end the Government proposes to carry out an extensive scheme of drainage and levelling, and also to provide a number of essential buildings, water supply, sewerage, roads, and footpaths. total area of landing ground available when the drainage is completed?

My object is to assist the smaller States. The following resolution, which, among others, was carried at a meeting of farmers at Beverley, Western Australia, illustrates the feeling that is growing in that State against the imposition of prohibitive tariffs:In the event of there being no amendment of the tariff charges that are hampering the wheat and wool industries of Western Australia, this meeting presses for State control of the customs for 25 years, and failing that urges areferendum ""on the question of secession, and the making of reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain. that the Constitution should be amended to speak on the bill . to enable the Commonwealth to give tariff concessions to certain parts of Australia.

We there are essentially a primary-producing people, and we have suffered from federation to a f a r greater extent than either Tasmania or South Australia. I want to force a division on this issue, so that the people of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania may see which honourable members of this Parliament are prepared to hand over absolute power to the Commonwealth Parliament, and so remove from us the safeguard we at present have in the Constitution, namely, equal representation in the Senate anda minimum representation in the House of Representatives. Some honourable members have said that I can see only the disasters that might If any of the follow the adoption of this proposal. WhatI want to do is to make it unnecessary for any State to come to the Commonwealth for financial sops. That policy always leads to extravagance.

118,Mr Mctiernan,"If the honora'blecates the incompetence of the honourable member to give any valuable legal advice on this subject. I certainly prefer to rely upon the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr left to the judge to determine them. If Latham.) on a constitutional question of this nature. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) must surely realize that the adoption of this proposal will be injurious to South Australia. In pref ederation days South Australia had many small but flourishing engineering industries. Some of them were among the best that we had in Australia. But to-day they have all disappeared. I cannot see any future for the Holden Motor Body Works in South Australia if we insist upon enforcing the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act and by prohibitive tariffs make it impossible for them to compete with Sydney or Melbourne. The proposals of the Government are undoubtedly wholly in the interests of those two centres. Our whole fiscal policy necessarily increases the cost of timber and other raw materials required for motor body building. In order to ascertain definitely whether it is the desire of the Government to take away from the smaller States the right to equal representation in the Senate and minimum representation in the House of Representatives, I move the following amendment:That after the word "" section,"" proposed new section 129, the words "" other than in the proviso to that section"" be inserted. I second the amendment. years' experience of Commonwealth industrial arbitration has shown that this Parliament is not capable of exercising effective control in this sphere. It surely cannot be denied that state or local authorities are much more fitted to deal with industrial matters than a central authority, for they are able to gauge local conditions and decide accordingly. If the power to control industry were vested in local authorities, this continent would benefit from one end of it to the other, for there would be a closer personal contact between employers and employees. One of the most serious vices of our Arbitration Court system is that it tends to keep employers and employees apart. Invariably, the unions apply to the court for shorter hours and higher wages, and the employers for longer hours and lower wages. The issues are fought on party lines', and it is always we could bring the people more closely together we should do something that would result in more efficient and less costly methods of production, which, in turn, would help to overcome the unemployment crisis which faces us. I believe that under a system of industrial control by local authorities, our people would get substantially higher wages and better conditions than are possible under the existing arrangements. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that industrial matters should be dealt with in the legal atmosphere' of a court, nor was it anticipated that thecourt would give the unexpected decisions that ever come from it. appears to me that one aspect of the subject before the committee has not received the attention that it deserves. . Sufficient has been said about the differences between the limited authority of the nonsovereign legislature under the American Constitution, upon which our Constitution was modelled, and the unlimited sovereign power of the legislature in England under the British Constitution to render it unnecessary for me to make any further reference to the subject; but I doubt whether we have yet demonstrated the character of the cleavage insofar as it affects the actual Twenty-five needs and lives of our people. In every direction in which ""this legislature has attempted to move it has been obstructed by decisions of the High Court. We surely reached the culminating point recently when events occurred in an industrial dispute which were without precedent in our industrial and constitutional history As honourable members know, we have been sorely tried by a great industrial crisis on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales. After the Government had exhausted every constitutional means to effect a settlement, the High Court was approached for an interpretation of the legal position.

Our friends opposite, who frequently profess admiration for British methods should at least realize that the competence of the British legislature is a sovereign power, that the ^constitution of that country is the greatest in the world, and that the American constitution, which is modelled on presidential government, should not be taken as a guide by a country such as Australia, which functions under parliamentary government.

We should not lose sight of the most important fact that we are alive. The contributions to the debate that have been made by some honourable members opposite have been as from the dead.

General) [2.56] -During question time It is our to-day the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) asked me whether I would take an opportunity before the close of the debate on this bill to advert to an To a opinion given recently by Sir Edward Mitchell upon the subject of the amendment of the Constitution, and I.promised that I would do so at some convenient time. As there is a general.desire that the debate shall be brought to a close in time to enable honourable members who are leaving Canberra to-day to catch their trains, I shall be brief. While speahing of lawyers, legal opinions, and courts, may I be permitted to say that, although I am particularly anxious to defend and maintain the rights of all honourable members of this chamber, I do not associate myself in any way with personal attacks on either members or ex-'members of the judiciary. Sir Edward Mitchell's opinion affirms several propositions. One of thpse is that section 128 of the Constitution extends only to the amendment of the Constitution itself, and not to the covering sections which constitute an act of the conventions ' that preceded the Imperial legislature. That is certhat does not touch the validity of the proposed amendment, which, by adding a section to the Constitution, merely provides an alternative method for altering it. an alternative method by which the Constitution may be amended; but if it should be carried, will there not be only one way in which the Constitution can be altered? than one, but that will be a consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Constitution.

163,Mr Brennan,"There will be morecovering sections, which create an ""indissoluble Federal Constitution"", as it is described. I would not be inclined to admit that that was not an arguable proposition as it stands, but, for the sake of this argument, it may be admitted as correct, for the very simple reason that the proposed amendment is not incon; sistent with those sections. In section 128 the Constitution contains a power that is unlimited 'as to subject-matter to amend the Constitution. That power is part of the Constitution itself, and, being such, is necessarily subject to amendment. amended, will not thereupon, at least, cease to be a Federal Constitution. Whatever may happen afterwards, the amendment of the Constitution in that way does not cause it to cease to be a Federal Constitution. Sir Edward Mitchell may be taken to say that section 128 is unalterable. That proposition, of course, as appears from what I have already said, is challenged. The amending power applies to the whole Constitution, of which section 128 is a part. No limitation of subject-matter is stated, and no siich limitation can be implied, nor has any argument been adduced to show oh what principle one part of this Constitution which may be amended should, or couldj be amended more readily than another part. The machinery for its amendment is applicable to all parts of the Constitution. In my view it is not open to serious argument that the Constitution runs from section 1 to section 128, and excludes entirely the covering Sections; it confers a power of amendment applicable with complete and perfect uniformity to every part of the Constitution. tend that, by an amendment of the Constitution,we could take the federation away from the Crown? rather of imperial status; it is a matter of arrangement rather than a constitutional consider a'tiori. for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) advocated the adoption of that course. Mi-. BRENNAN -No. When he was interrupted last night by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), he : was making 'a very serious and well-informed 'contribution to the debate, and he 'was endeavouring to ascertain, and -state his own-view upon, just what the constitutional relationship is between Australia an'd Britain. The opinion he expressed, as I understood itahd I agree with it gen'eraily-is that, viewe'd as a legal and purely constituti'Gnal 'question-, there as, at the present time, following upon the Balfour note and the latest definitions, complete constitutional independence. The hohorablha member for 'Corangamite was more than The Constitution, when BO necessarily emphatic that ""that did not imply, even in the Slightest 'degree, a desire on the part of Australia to dissociate herself from the commonwealth of nations nor involve separation or disintegration of any practical kind, the honourable member is well able to defend himself, as he is well able to state his case, and I followed his remarks with great interest. Purely captious and political interjections were heard with very little sympathy, so far, as I wa& concerned, and I may add with very little respect. Sir Edward Mitchell suggests further that the manner of altering the Constitution cannot be changed. This proposition is contained in the preceding one, and it also is challenged. The Constitution is ""full of machinery for necessary adjustments and re-adjustment's, which may be tightened up or loosened by use' of the amending power, and yet it, is suggested and argued that the key amending power-sectio n 128-the compartment, so to speak, which must be opened before the other adjustments can be attempted at all, is itself exempt from the possibility of amendment. That argument, I submit with great respect, reduces itself to an absurdity I ii other words, it is suggested that we may amend all sections and parts of the Australian Constitution, except the most material and vital part so far as its working and structure are concerned, and that, according to the views expressed, may not be amended. To the contention, as put by Sir Edward Mitchell, that constitutional amendments made under the proposed amending power which purported to bring about unification would themselves be invalid, no answer is necessary, except the question why we should",34,Constitutio N Alteratio N

166,Mr White,"The honourable memberjump before we come to the stile, why we should begin to anticipate difficulties that may never arise? It seems to me as illogical as the stand taken by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) who, in what I venture to describe, with great respect, as a spirit proposed amending power which purof pitiful parochialism, always seems to. suggest that the power of the majority in the Australian Parliament, and in Australia itself, would necessarily and inevitarisen, when it is not involved in the proably be exercised against the best interests posed amendment of the Constitution now of the minority. Such an argument, if it had substance, would be applicable to every Parliament and to every State in the Commonwealth, and to every part of a State, and, if pursued to its logical conclusion, it would mean that parliamentary government is necessarily a failure, and ineffective to protect the rights either of the minorities or of persons resident in the more outlying parts of the electorate. of incompetence has been shown in government. to govern, or attempt to govern, notwithstanding our obvious limitations. never looks beyond the cities. member cannot claim all wisdom; if he does, he claims too much. It is admitted that all forms of government have their imperfections, and all statesmen have their manifest limitations, too; but 1 am speaking in general terms of systems of government, and especially of the system of democratic government which is admittedly imperfect in the very fact that it involves the government by majorities of minorities, and the coercion of minorities by majorities. If the history of fedetion "" it refers to the whole "" Constitution of ration has taught us anything at all in the the Commonwealth "" mentioned in and followlast 30 years, it has manifested an extraordinary readiness on the part of the more populous States to recognize the disabilities of the people resident within the boundaries of what are known as the smaller States, and governments have faithfully endeavoured to adjust revenues to meet the disabilities under which they labour. But the very fact that for so long the Constitution has remained as it is proves the good-will , of the more populous areas to the iess populous, 4 reserving, as we have, equal representation in the Senate and minimum representation in the smaller States. Returning to the point taken by Sir Edward Mitchell when he said that constitutional amendments passed under the ported to ""bring about unification, would themselves be invalid, I asked why we should meet that difficulty before it has before us. It is well to remember that such amendments would be no more invalid, if they were passed in the new way than in the way already existent. The truth is that the present proposal only provides an easier way of amending the Constitution. It does not purport to extend the scope of the amendment of the Constitution, and it does not extend it. Indeed, it could hardly be extended, because the present power to amend the Constitution is absolute, but cumbrous, difficult, and expensive; so much so that amendments which might long ago have been won for the long-suffering people of the Commonwealth have been long delayed and difficult to obtain. Sir Edward Mitchell's objections seem to be completely answered in the much more succinct opinion of Mr Owen Dixon, when he was still a brilliant member' of the bar, and before he became an ornament to the High Court judiciary. He summed the matter up in these wordsTlie existing power of amending the Constitution is contained in section 128, and the question is whether that power authorizes the alteration in section 128 itself, which would be required in order to confer for the future the power of amendment upon Parliament alone. In my opinion it does authorize such an alteration. When section 128 speaks of "" this Constituing section 9 of the covering clauses. It includes section 128 itself. I do not think that there can be any doubt that complete power of amending the whole instrument, including the provision prescribing the methods of alteration, was intended to be given by section 12S. Although Sir Edward Mitchell suggested that Mr Owen Dixon did not advert, in his opinion, to certain of the points raised by himself in his lengthy and learned disquisition, it is not to be assumed that Mr Owen Dixon did not, in fact, consider the matter covered by",35,Constitutio N Alteratio N

170,Mr Brennan,"The honorableSir Edward. The truth would appear to be that in a very small compass he has completely answered the objections. His view I entirely endorse. The Government launches its major proposal for the amendment of the Constitution with the utmost confidence in its validity, and with the fervent hope that it will be carried in all States. Some honourable members say that the smaller States will reject ir contiimeliously; but the recent election in South Australia was a vindication of the claim I am making; because the party which succeeded and has since formed a Government stood for the simplification of government in the smaller States, the abolition of useless and expensive trappings, including the unrepresentative council, and the setting up of less expensive and .more effective forms of local government. That principle has been accepted by the people of South Australia. General state Mr Collier's opinion ? will happen in Western Australia on Saturday next, but I hope that the same spirit will animate public opinion there, and that the same verdict will be recorded as in South Australia. I conclude my part in this debate, as I began it, by expressing the hope that if we are to regard Australia as in fact a nation, we should take the responsibility of setting up somewhere a national legislature which would have in the last resort the last word upon public questions, and any matter which it is within the competency of this Parliament to consider. Such matters should include all those with which the members of this Parliament think fit to ""deal. Less than that we should not have; more than that, we do not ask. We seek for this sovereign legislative power, local legislatures for local affairs, and power for this Parliament in the last resort, to speak for Australia upon those matters that the duly appointed representatives of the people in this Parliament think it wise after consulting the constituencies, to consider. The Attorney-General has dealt with Sir last paragraph of section 128 imposes a Edward Mitchell's opinion that section limitation upon the alteration of any 128 cannot be amended in the same way provision of the Constitution'affecting the as other portions of the Constitution, and has cited a contrary opinion of Mr Owen Dixon. As a matter of opinion, I agree with Mr Owen Dixon that section 128 is amendable, although I am impressed by the fact that so eminent an authority as my learned friend Sir Edward Mitchell takes the opposite view. The preamble to the Constitutioii refers to "" an indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown,"" and difficulty would arise if a proposal were submitted for amending the Constitution in such a way as to remove the Commonwealth from the Crown. I am glad, however, that that stage has not yet been reached. A further difficulty arises from the fact that section 128 commences, "" This Constitution shall not be altered except in the following manner."" It is arguable that the first 127 sections set out the frame of government, and that section 128, prescribing the only method by which that frame may be altered, the Attorneyis permanent. The question which Sir Edward Mitchell has discussed I do not know what most, interestingly is whether section 128 can be amended by the procedure of amendment which it sets forth. I have said that I agree with Mr Owen Dixon, but I recognize that the contention of Sir Edward Mitchell is quite tenable. It is a dubious course to submit to the people a proposed amendment which, if carried, would throw upon the High Court the responsibility to determine whether on-legal grounds it should overrule the political opinion of the people. sirable that the position should be clarified ? would be placed in a most unfortunate position if, after a measure had been passed following approval of this amendment by the people, it had to declare that legislation invalid. WhilstI support the view of Mr Owen Dixon, I do not think it is possible to disagree so emphatically as the Attorney-General has. done with the opinion of Sir Edward Mitchell. The Attorney-General has not' dealt with another matter I mentioned when speaking on' the second reading. The",36,Constitutio N Alteratio N

If proposed section 129 were carried in four States any amendment of the Constitution affecting the matters mentioned in the last paragraph of section 128 or any other matter could be made applicable to those four States by parliamentary action, but it could be made applicable to the other two States only by the procedure prescribed in section 128. That would create a chaotic condition of affairs. Summarized,section 128 provides that the Constitution may be altered by parliamentary action plus a referendum. Proposed section 129, if accepted by four of the States, will mean that in respect of those four States the Constitution may be altered by parliamentary action alone. Suppose for the sake of argument that this Parliament proposed to alter the Constitution by conferring power on itself to legislate in respect of education. "" If the amending bill were 1 passed after a month's delay by an absolute majority in both Houses of Parliament, the Constitution w ould T be amended accordingly, but only in relation to the four States which had endorsed section 129. If it were desired to legislate in respect of education in the two States that rejected section 129, it I submitted would be necessary to adopt the procedure prescribed by section 128, which requires that the alteration shall be approved by a majority of the people and a majority of the States. would fail. other two States might agree that education should be a subject for Commonwealth control. It is a peculiarly chaotic of amending the Constitution in relation to some States, and another method of amending the Constitution in relation to other States. Under those conditions we shall never know where we are. amendment with respect to education come within the final paragraph of section 128? it would. But new section 129 does, I am suggesting, come within that final paragraph. I am suggesting at present that, H this Parliament now desires to confer powers to, legislate on education upon itself, we have to pass bills through both Houses, have a referendum of the people, and also the majorities prescribed under section 128. The proposed section 129 would bring in a new method of amending the Constitution, and if only four States accepted it, that new method of constitutional amendment would apply only to those States. amending the Constitution is not an alteration which per se would affect any of those things mentioned in the final paragraph of section 128. ment affects the last paragraph of the most important provision in the Constitution, namely, section 128, itself relating to these matters.

I submit that the proposed section 129 comes under the last heading (4), "" in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto,"" because it in itself is an alteration affecting a prolege. If individually we do not abuse vision of the Constitution namely section 128 in relation to the three other headings. will find this subject discussed on pages 228 and 229 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. That is the view that I put forward though not with mathematical dogmatism. It appears to me to be sound. I think that, if this amendment is passed by a majority of the States, biit not by all the States, we shall inaugurate an era of legislative and political confusion in Australia which all honourable members will later profoundly regret. this debate we have heard many constitutions mentioned, discussed, and debated, and constitutional authorities galore have been cited. We have listened to valuable contributions by learned and legal gentlemen in this chamber. It has all been very enlightening, but still the fact stands out vividly that this Parliament has not sufficient constitutional powers. The experience of the past few years has borne that out. Every honourable member will admit that this Parliament should have more powers, and all that the Government is now proposing is to ask the people to confer greater constitutional powers upon this National Parliament. I stand for giving full and unfettered powers to this Parliament. I was much struck by the point made by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr proposal. This Government is quite satisStewart) yesterday, that one of the State upper houses, elected on a narrow franchise, could flout the will, not only of the lower House, but of the big majority of the people. Such a position is intolerable and untenable. and accepted by the people, it will be possible for the second chamber of the Federal Parliament to be elected on a : restricted franchise. opposite fear, not the good but the abuse that may be brought about by conferring greater powers upon this Parliament. Every member of this House has certain privileges. We can say things in this chamber which we dare not say outside; yet, we do not abuse that priviour privileges, why should we collectively, as a Commonwealth Parliament, abuse Honourable members the powers that may be conferred upon us as a result of the referendum? No Parliament dares to abuse its powers, because it knows that it must face the electors every three years. The people are our masters. would break the bond that was entered into at federation would do anything. stitution. Why should I not have an opportunity of voting for a better one? or agreement may he modified with the mutual consent of the parties concerned. The Constitution is a contract that was entered into between the Commonwealth and the States, and why should there be any objection to an alteration of the Constitution by mutual consent. This Government is merely submitting its proposals to the people. I see nothing undemocratic about that. The Constitution made provision for the passage of legislation to prevent and settle disputes* by conciliation and arbitration. Legislation was passed, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court established. It has been operating for 25 years, and yet the Bruce Page Government was prepared to abolish it without in any way consulting the people. That was not a democratic fied to seek the consent of the people before making any alteration to our system of conciliation and arbitration.

That is no argument. If a young man proposed three times to a young lady and was refused three times, would she expect him to take that as final; would she not. expect him to propose again ? I certainly think she would. Take the case of the Labour party. We made many attempts to gain office, but the electors said "" no."" us, but I am not speaking for any parThe Labour party refused to take that as a final answer. We kept on asking the people for their support, and at the last elections we won handsomely. I believe in Australia, as a nation, with one flag and one destiny. Parliament should guide the destiny of Australia, and to that end it should be clothed with plenary powers. Had the Commonwealth greater industrial powers, many of the industrial disputes of the last few years would have been settled in their infancy. Under the Constitution as it stands at present, the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, in respect of industrial affairs is restricted. I am confident that, the people will see the necessity for granting greater constitutional' powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, and I look forward to the time when these dark and gloomy clouds of depression will be broken and dispersed, and Australia will be bathed in the sunshine of peace, prosperity and happiness. afraid that in these committee speeches we are getting back to the second reading stage, quite overlooking the fact that we are discussing the amendment which has. been moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). The amendment is rather outside the genoral merits of the question whether increased constitutional powers should be granted to the Commonwealth Parliament. The object of the mover of the amendment is to provide that if these powers are granted, they shall uot be enforced against any State that votes against the referendum proposals. The amendment certainly needs re-drafting, and should be considered quite apart from the general member of merits of the Government's proposals. Any State which is opposed to the granting of these powers to the Commonwealth should not, if the proposals are accepted by a majority of the States, be compelled to surrender to the Commonwealth any of its present powers. For that reason the amendment might very well be accepted. ber advocating secession? ticular State at the moment. It would obviously be unfair to enforce the Government's proposal upon States which ; do not favour it, seeing that it is so totally different from the original federal plan. The Commonwealth I do not think it was ever contemplated that an alteration of this description could bo made in the Constitution, and that should be borne in mind in voting upon the amendment. I find myself in an exceedingly difficult position. Though wholly in favour of clothing this Parliament with full power in regard to all national matters, I cannot approve of the method which the Government has chosen to bring that about. In my opinion, it should set out in definite terms the exact power that it desires, so that the people may know what is intended. Something has been said about our power to amend section .128 of the Constitution. I asked the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) while he was speaking just now, whether he thought we have power to amend the Constitution Act, which recites in its preamble that the people of certain States ""have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown.""

198,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [3.46].,"my opinion, section 128 of the Constitution relates, not to the preamble and first eight sections of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, but to the subsequent sections. Section9 declaresTlie Constitution of the Commonwealth shall ceed along those lines. The conception lie as follows:Section 128 gives us no authority to alter anything but the Constitution itself, which is, in effect, the schedule to a statute of the Parliament of Great Britain. [Quorum formed.'] The Attorney-General said that he could not subscribe to the argument that section 12S could not be amended. I agree with him. The section may be amended, but only in the manner therein set out. I take it that the Government is earnestly desirous of obtaining the assent of the people in all the States to the proposal in the bill before us, in order that it may end, once and for all, the present intolerable position. This Parliament, as the Attorney-General has said, though asked to do the nation's work, has been given little more power respecting certain things that really matter than that of a municipality. Buti f the argument of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) is sound, and I think that on the whole it is, there can be no amendment of the Constitution regarding the matters set out in the last paragraph of section 128, except with the consent of each particular State affected. It follows, therefore, that even if this Parliament were given the authority sought in this bill, it could not create new States, except, of course, by the subdivision of such States as might assent to the proposal. It appears to me that we should not unnecessarily risk the industrial and trade and commerce proposals by submitting the first proposal, seeing that even if it were approved it would only give the Parliament power to legislate in respect of those matters contained in the last paragraph of section 128 in the States which assented to the proposal. I am not in favour of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), because it would take from this Parliament the power to deal with matters which are in their scope and essence national; but it is undeniable that if the proposal of the bill is carried the power given to this Parliament wiii be ineffective except in the States which carry it. It is most necessary that we should have power to create new States. Our development will proof honourable members opposite and of myself, is that there should be a devolution of wide powers upon the central or National Parliament, and that bodies clothed with full powers of local government should be set up. The local governing powers of these bodies would, of course, be great, but they would nevertheless be merely those of provincial legislatures. This conception is, I believe, quite conformable with the principles of democracy. ""We have a Constitution which was intended to be amended only in the way set out in section 128. Any departure from that method, such as the method proposed in the bill before the committee, is a violation of the spirit of the federal pact. ""Whatever the legal consequences which might follow the attempt to pass this proposed law, the people were under the impression that when this Constitution was assented to it was a bargain that bound them indissolubly in a certain form. That the powers of the Parliament should be extended in this direction or that, and that there could be a better distribution of power among the Commonwealth and the States, is undeniable. But it is clear that it was intended that in their own particular spheres the Commonwealth and the States should be supreme. If this proposal of the Government is carried, that will no longer be the case. Yet the provisions of the Constitution are entirely opposed to democratic principles. If is odious that a progressive people should be told, when they seek relief in a certain direction and can find no relief in any other, that the dead hand of the past makes it impossible for them to obtain what. they desire. It is repellant to every concept of democratic Government that we should be bound by the edict of men who, 30 years ago, prescribed certain remedies for the conditions that then existed. The democratic ideal is that the people of each generation should legislate for their own needs. That is a sound principle. But was to point out to the Attorney General of Unhappily, there is yet very much to be done before the citizens of the Commonwealth are made to understand exactly what will be the consequence of amending the Constitution as proposed. They will be told ad nauseam about the rights of the States, and they will be told that those rights-whateve r they may be-ar e gravely threatened. I cannot help thinking that this bill will very seriously i m peril the other amendments. However, I leave that for the present. The Government cau hardly say now that this amendment goes as f a r as we could wish. Very obviously it will not clothe the Federal Parliament with power to introduce the system of proportional representation in this chamber. ""When the Constitution was before the people in 1900, I opposed its my 1 believe now, that the only sound democratic principle is representation according to numbers. compromise was made, and a tradition has been established which it is now very difficult to break down.

Therefore, if this proposed law is accepted by the people, it will enact a new method of amending the Constitution which is free from the restrictions imposed by section 128. proposed law through, the people of Western Australia must approve of it. appears to be clearer to me than, it does to some other honourable members. I have stated my view of it as lucidly as I can, and no amount of repetition would make it any clearer. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr of Sydney, Melbourne, and other cities Latham) has read the last paragraph of section 128 in a manner with which I do not agree. I submit that the words "" or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto "" refer to the subjects that have been already mentioned in the final paragraph of section 128. "" In relation thereexist, it will be competent for this Parliato"" means in relation to the proportionate representation of any State in either House of Parliament, or the minimum representation of a State in the House of Representatives, or increasing or diminishlegislature have not been deaf to appeals ing, or otherwise altering the limits of a State. I submit that this proposed bill does not i i i itself affect any of those matters which have been mentioned in the final paragraph of section 128. Honourable members representing Western Australian constituencies believe that they are acting the part of friends of WesternAustralia in opposing this bill. I think that it would be a friendly acr on their part, and beneficial to their State, if they were to support this measure, because the bill proposes to empower the federal legislature to amend the Constitution. There are certain sections of the Constitution which have the result, possibly, of inflictiup' those disabilities upon Western Australia to which honourable members have referred. For example, section 51, which confers the power of taxation, contains the following:,, (ii) Taxation; but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States. It is impossible for this legislature to pass any taxation measure which would discriminate between Western Australia and the other States of the Commonwealth. The incidence of taxation must be uniform throughout the whole of Australia. If this bill is passed, and the Federal Parliament is empowered to amend the Constitution, it will be enabled to relieve Western Australia from any unfair incidence of taxation that arises from the fact that taxation must be uniformly imposed. Section 88 of the Constitution provides that uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth. That time having elapsed, the tariff must be uniform in its application throughout Australia, and the citizens of Perth must bear equally with the citizens the taxation that is imposed. If the Commonwealth Parliament is granted the power that is sought by this bill, and the representatives of Western Australia can show that any tariff schedule operates unjustly against that State, because of any special circumstances that may ment to make provision to meet those special circumstances, and to vary the incidence of customs taxation. We know from experience that members of this that have been made to them by representatives of what are termed the smaller States. One of the first debates to which I listened after my election to this Parliament was that which took place on a bill to make available financial assistance to some of the States. It was urged that that measure was necessary because the federation had subjected those States to particular disabilities, and a great deal was made of the fact that customs duties were levied uniformly on all the States without regard to their industrial or economic circumstances.",42,Constitutio N Alteratio N

I have had no hesitation in voting for measures that have been introduced to grant special financial assistance to some of the States The two cases, from my point of view, are analagous. I submit that, having regard to the language used, one can rjlace a perfectly reasonable construction upon section 128 of the Constitution, and ,according to that construction the proposed, alteration of the Constitution will be perfectly valid and effective in every respect. The flexibility that it is proposed to give to the Constitution will be of immense advantage to the States, and will enable this legislature to grant relief where it is shown that any State is entitled to special consideration. ringah) [4.20] -If I represented one of the smaller StatesI should not lose sight of the fact that the Constitution contains certain provisions that safeguard the rights of the small States, and that those rights will disappear if the referendum is carried, because the Commonwealth Parliament will then be the sole arbiter of their case. Are they the more likely to be protected by the safeguards that are embedded in the Constitution, or by the promises of politicians? There can be no comparison between the two. I have r.ot the slightest doubt that the rights of the small States ansafeguarded by the Constitution, and that those rights will be retained so long as those safeguards are not removed from the Constitution. As a layman, it appears to me that the provision that the representation which the States enjoy to-day shall not be altered unless the States concerned agree to such an amendment, is part and parcel of the machinery that is being used to alter the whole of the Constitution. force of circumstances, some of the likely to listen to sophistries such as those smaller States had their population reof the honourable member for Parkes( Mr duced to a ridiculously small number, would the honourable member still insist that they should control the vast majority of the people in another portion of the Commonwealth ? am not discussing that aspect of the matter. I have never been in favour of the principle of equal representation of the States; but at the same time, from the point of view of the small States, and in view of the fact that they entered into an indissoluble union under certain clear and definite provisions, it is necessary that their rights shall be adequately safeguarded. There is every indication to-day that in a few years' time those which are now regarded as the smaller States .will become the larger. Therefore, the contingency referred to by the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), is not .likely to arise. 'AlthoughI am not prepared to vote for the amendment, I consider that the Government would be well advised, in its own interests, if it withdrew the proposal contained in the bill. the consent of the committee, I propose to withdraw the amendment. I am glad, however, that I brought it forward, because I feel satisfied that the debate that has taken place upon it will have the effect of influencing many electors to vote against the Government's proposal, especially in view of the suggestion of the Attorney-General, that any State which became depopulated would not be justified in having equal representation in the Senate, nor a certain number of representatives in this chamber, even though that depopulation was the effect of federation. I have been induced to withdraw my amendment by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), who pointed out that the difficulties that, were likely to arise under it would be greater than those which have so far been encountered. If the committee had been agreeable to the proviso that I wished to have inserted, many electors in the smaller States might have been induced to vote for the Government's proposal, on the ground that the special protection of their rights, for which provision is now",43,Constitutio N Alteratio N

""When they go to the court, the employer usually suggests a reduction of wages and an increase in . the hours of work, while the employee asks for shorter hours and higher wages. When the judge gives h'is award he generally compromises, and the workmen immediately have an idea that they owe nothing to their employersj so they determine that they will give back in return for their wages as little service as they can. What industry in Australia most' needs to-day is efficiency by the manu-' facturer and good service by the worker. Turning again t0' the Canadian wagesheet a'sshown by the official statistics , 1 in the building trade I find that in 1929 the wages for an' eight hours' day were-Bricklayers , 33s. 4d. to 51s.; carpenters, 23s. 4d. to 36s. 8d.; electrical workers, 23s. 4d. to 58s.; painters, 16s. 8d. to 30s. ; plasterers, 33s. 4d. to 50s.; plumbers, 16s. 8d. to 41s. 4d.; stone cutters, 26s. 8d-. to .58s.,. and labourers, l is . 8d. to 21s. 8d.

If honourable members opposite are resolved to continue the present system of dual control the existing chaos will be accentuated. the Commonwealth Parliament is givencomplete industrial power the present Government will be able to do almost what it pleases, but the workers should realize that equally wide powers will be enjoyed by its successor.

229,Mr Pateeson (Gippsland) [5.3],"which prevents me from supporting it as a whole. As a former Minister for Markets, I realize the disability that we are suffering, because of being unable to organize as completely as we would like in respect of the sale of our exportable! products, both in this country and overseas. If the amendment moved by the right honourable member for Cowper were carried, it would give us sufficient power over trade and commerce to enable us to bring about the more profitable disposal of Australian products. Let me give one or two concrete illustrations of the difficulties which beset us because of the lack of this power. I shall take first the position of the wine industry, which is to some extent in the minds of honourable members because of the difficulties with which it is faced, and because this Parliament has, for' some years, been paying to that industry a bounty, which the Government now proposes to extend. Government paid a bounty on the wine exported and this Government is extending it, both Governments being actuated by a desire to assist, not so much the wine-maker as the grape-grower. The Government cannot compel the winemaker to pay a fair price for the grapes that he buys, but it can make that a condition of the payment of the export bounty. The Government can say to the wine-maker, "" We will pay you this export bounty on condition that you pay the grape-grower a certain price, not only for the grapes used in wine that is exported, but also for grapes used in wine that is sold locally."" The wine-maker, who buys grapes with the object of selling his wine entirely in Australia, is not interested in the bounty, and can consequently snap hisfingersat anything that the Government may do to ensure a fair price to the grape-grower. Again a winemaker who sells not only overseas and obtains a bounty for that part of his product which is exported, but also in the local market, pays f u l l price for the whole of the grapes which he uses. He, therefore, may meet with unfair competition from the maker who sells only on the local market and pays any price he likes for his grapes. That is one difficulty which we have to face. It seems insuperable unless we obtain the powers set. out in the amendment moved by the fight honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). A further concrete illustration may be draw?i from the dried fruits industry, although it is true that it has been possible, by following a very difficult and complicated course, to give to growers a substantial measure of marketing organization. The dried fruits industry produces a large exportable surplus which is sold at world's parity. It is sold at the rate obtaining in the big centres overseas, less the cost of transport. Without a complete selling organization it only is possible to obtain in Australia the prices ruling for export, and the producer in such circumstances is compelled to accept for what he sells in Australia*, world's prices less all the costs incidental to transport overseas. The export parity determines the local rate. That means that the producer has to suffer deductions from world's prices to the extent of the cost of transport, marine insurance, The late the exchange position in London, and deterioration in transit, on goods sold in. Australia, and even though those costs are not actually incurred. the honourable member do something for the dried fruit-gowers when he was a member of the Government? price, without marketing organization, is based on the export price less all the discounts that I have mentioned. The man who is producing on that basis finds himself very often unable to carry on, and it is essential, if he 'is to continue his business, that he should enjoy the benefits of complete marketing organization to enable him to obtain a fair Australian price for what he sells in our home market. Steps were taken by the former Commonwealth Government and State Governments to do this, but it involved many difficulties. State boards were appointed, and, they have certain powersin regard to sales within the various States. A State board cannot compel any producer within the State to export hisgoods. It can, under the statutorypowers that it possesses, restrict the saleof those goods within the borders of that; State; but without complete organization the producer would be able to send his goods into another State, and by cutting prices do serious injury to the growers of that State.",48,Constitutio N Alteratio N

The localject relative to the bill? necessity for an amendment such as that moved by the right honourable member for Cowper in order to confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with the situation that at present exist? 1 in certain primary industries. honourable member for Cowper has said, the bill covers the amendment, but it also covers a thousand other things which we do not desire. It is probable that the people of Australia will not be prepared to confer the whole of the trade and commerce powers upon this Parliament, but it is extremely probable that if this amendment were substituted, the people would accept it. The point I wish to stress is the great difficulty which besets an exporting industry in attempting to organize its marketing, so long as the Commonwealth is limited to its present powers. Even after State boards and a Commonwealth Export Control Board had been established, we had to resort to further legislation to make use of our interstate powers and a bill was brought down about eighteen months ago which made use, as Commonwealth instruments, of the State Dried Fruits Boards for the purpose of regulating interstate trade. They were given statutory powers requiring licences to be granted for interstate trade. By adopting this extremely round-about method, we were able to compel growers to export a certain proportion of their production. I support the amendment because T the amendment will do the thing that is believe that although these additional suggested. We know very well, that the marketing powers are necessary to overproposal, im the bill will doit. While the come the difficulties of procedure I have honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr mentioned,, the wide powers which the Paterson) was speaking in favour of Government is seeking are not needed.

In all the years that they were members of the previous Government, they did not even suggest that this power was necessary; but now that this Government is seeking to do something effective to organize the marketing of our products they are deing their best to sidetrack it. The amendment is entirely without substance and is neither more nor less than a placard.

249,Dr: Earle Page (Cowper) [5.24.],"the Government knows very well that there is not the slightest chance of carrying its first proposal, we are entitled to call that a political placard. On the other hand there is a good chance of securing an affirmative vote for my amendment. Seeing that a referendum is to be taken, this is an. appropriate opportunity to try to secure this necessary additional power. If the Prime Minister had not introduced his trade and commerce proposal, I should not have moved my amendment. If the Government really believed that its first proposal would be acceptable to the people it would not have introduced its industrial powers and trade and commerce proposals. I obtained expert advice before moving my amendment, and it is ridiculous for the Prime Minister to suggest that there is no substance in it. The talk of the Government about desiring to assist the primary producers does not mean anything. I am amazed that it should have been suggested that our interest in organized marketing is of sudden growth. If the Prime Minister will consult almost any issue of The Round Table published in the last six years, he will find numerous articles by independent and non-partisan persons, which declare in no uncertain terms that the Bruce-Page Government did a very great deal for organized marketing. Everybody knows that the dairying industry was converted from a condition of penury to a decently paying proposition by the efforts of the previous Government. The Dairy Export Control Board has done remarkably good work. Paterson Scheme has placed the industry on a new level of prosperity, while a revision of the tariff, for which the former Government was responsible, put an end to the importation into Australia of large quantities of New Zealand dairy produce. scheme was purely voluntary. who was responsible for it, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), was a member of the last Government, and has travelled throughout Australia to advocate the adoption of his scheme. It is acknowledged throughout Australia, and indeed throughout the world, that he is chiefly responsible for it. The previous Government also did a good deal to improve the conditions in the dried fruits industry. The Dried Eruits Export Control Board has rendered invaluable service to fruit-growers generally. Another thing that the previous Government did to assist in the marketing of our primary products was to establish a Rural Credits Branch"" of the Commonwealth Bank, through which, during the last four or five years, advances up to 80 per cent, have been made in respect of products marketed under voluntary pooling schemes. In spite of what the Prime Minister has said, I moved my amendment with the honest and deliberate object of securing necessary additional power to the Commonwealth, and I am certain that the primary producers of Australia will realize this. When the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) brought down the first proposal for an extension of the trade and commerce power of the Commonwealth, twenty years ago, he was not concerned about organized marketing. His object was to deal with monopolies and combines. He was trying to prevent the formation of trading combinations of any kind. Now we are told that he is interested in organized marketing. The power to carry on organized marketing would be conferred upon the Government if its first proposal were accepted by the people, but it knows very well that it is not likely to be approved, and it has adopted this method of trying to get other The power. Minister for Markets and Transport) [5.28] -The righteous indignation of the Prime Minister, to which the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has referred, was as nothing to the indignation of that honourable gentleman because his little scheme has been exploded. The whole object of this amendment is to enable the Country party, in its next ""weekly bulletin,"" to tell the primary producers of Australia what a big effort it made to assist them, and how it was ignominiously thrust aside by a Government which is out of sympathy with them. Unfortunately for the right honourable gentleman the bubble has been pricked, and the real purpose of the amendment exposed. The",51,Constitutio N Alteratio N

252,Mr Parker Moloney ( H U M E,"right honourable gentleman said that certain newspapers, including The Bound Table, have called attention to the wonderf u l organizing methods put into operation during the regime of the last Government. During the four or five months I have been associated Avith the Markets Department I have had an opportunity of studying this organization, and I say unhesitatingly that chaos reigns even to-day in regard to the activities of every one of those industries served by boards brought into existence by the Bruce-Page Government. The right honourable member for Gowper mentioned the Dairy Export Control Board. He would have us believe that as a result of the setting up of that board everything is now quite all right with the "" dairying industry. But. I assure honourable members that there is very much wrong with it, and I challenge any honourable member on the other side to contradict me. There is in existence an advisory body known as the Australian Dairy Council, which speaks for the dairying industry throughout the whole of Australia. Members of that council, in their very latest advice to me, said that it was impossible, to organize the dairying industry properly until a proper marketing actwas passed. At the present time we have trouble in marketing our butter overseas owing to its excess moisture content. If , as the right honourable member for Cowper suggests, everything is right with the dairying industry, we should have power to rectify such difficulties of a manufacturing nature no matter where they arose. Actually, however, the position is that federal officers can go a certain distance in regard to controlling the manufacture of butter, but no farther. They cannot go into the factories in the various States and enforce the proper grading of cream. would be quickly told by the State authorities that they had no power to interfere there. proposed by the right honourable member would not confer power to control the industry right from the grading of the cream up to the export of the butter overseas. The dried fruits industry was never in a more chaotic state than it is to-day. Yet one would imagine from listening to the right honourable member for Cowper, that as a result of the t achievements of the Government with which he was associated, all the disabilities of that industry have been removed. I found only the other day, however, when I was trying to allot the export quotas, that although I had power to control the export trade iu dried fruits from one State to another, producers had the right to do what they liked within the boundaries of their own States, and could disorganize the market in any way they pleased. That is typical of what obtains in other industries of a like nature. The right honourable member for Cowper stressed the fact that the Rural Credits Bank had been making advances to producers during the last five years, but he did not mention that not one penny more had been advanced than during the previous five years. I have said enough in regard to dried fruits to show that, without the power which we seek, we cannot organize any primary industry as it should be organized. The only reason for this amendment is to enable the Country party, in its next bulletin, to delude primary producers into the belief that the parliamentary representatives of the party are trying to do something tangible, and to make out that the party is something other than what it has always been, a sham and a bluff, and an imposition ou the producers of the country. [5.37] I have for long advocated increased powers for the Commonwealth Parliament to permit of the control of the marketing of primary products within and without Australia by producers themselves. The amendment proposed by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) is designed to confer such power. The Prime MinisThey ter ( Mr Scullin) maintained that there was no substance in the amendment, but it seemed to me that the heat which he Even the amendment put into his argument, if one can call it such, indicated his perturbation at the possibility of having to vote for or against a proposal which meant so much to the primary producers of Australia. He said that the amendment meant nothing, but it was framed on the advice of a greater authority on such matters than the Prime Minister can claim to be.

255,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [5.44],"whether they were prepared, as a body, to come under tbe operation of that measure. The Ministerf or Markets has stated that the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank has been of little use to primary producers. In reply to that, I say that during the last three years the sum of £25,000,000 has been advanced by that department on the security of primary products at one-half per cent less than the rulingrate of interest. That is an evidence of the tremendous advantage which the rural credits department has been to the primary producers. The last Government exercised, for the first time, the interstate powers that the Commonwealth possesses in connection with marketing problems. It brought down legislation which, at that time, was quite unprecedented, quite new to this Parliament, granting to an authority power to regulate interstate trade. In the trail. I point out to the Ministerf o r Markets that it is only now, after the powers which the Commonwealth possesses have been exercised to the f u l l for some years, that it is possible to determine to what extent they are insufficient to deal with the position. Judging by the remarks of the Minister, one would think that it is possible to seek additional powers from the people every twelve months. Very few governments go to the people, by way of a referendum, on more than one occasion during their tenure of office. The last Government used to the utmost, for the benefit of primary producers, the constitutional powers that it possessed; and we are only now able to determine f u l l y the extent to which those powers f a l l short of what is necessary. Having determined the extent to which they f a l l short, we have brought forward this amendment. I repeat that we believe that if this amendment is put to the people it w ill have a much better chance of being carried than w ill the proposal that the Government intends to place before them. Mr F0RDE (Capricornia-Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs) [5.49]. -The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), referring to the Government of which he was a member, said "" We blazed the t r a i l . "" How did that Government blaze the trail? It is well known to every honourable member who has been in this Parliament for a number of years that it refused to ask for the powers that this Government is now seeking in regard to trade and commerce. It realized in 1926 that if it were granted these powers it would be called upon by the primary producers to bring down a comprehensive marketing scheme; and as that would have conflicted w i th the interests of those who dominate the Nationalist machine, it did not propose this amendment of the Constitution, nor did it ask for any other power in relation to trade and commerce. Now, however, honourable members opposite would have us believe that their hearts bleed for the primary producers, that they fear that this proposal of the Government w ill be defeated at the referendum, and that, in that event, the primary producers may not be able to secure an orderly marketing scheme. But what was their attitude towards the comthat connection, also, it blazed pulsory pool which was asked for by the dairymen of Australia ? D r . Earle Page, Leader of the Country party, speaking at Maitland on the 30th J u l y last, saidI have always been opposed to compulsory pooling. I do not know much about the Primary Products Act; but, if it is a full brother to the Queensland act, I advise growers to have nothing to do with it. Queensland Council of Agriculture, commenting on the above utterance, saidDr. Earle Page goes out of his way to allege political bias on the part of the Queensland Council of Agriculture, and brackets the producers' organization of Queensland with the late Labour Government. In the setting forth of the facts as I have explained them above, f have shown that the Council of Agriculture has endeavoured to co-operate with the Bruce Page Government in the matter of legislation affecting the dairymen, and in the making of the full use by Queensland of the provisions of the Eural Credits Act. The Council of Agriculture, although admittedly established by a Queensland Labour Government, has been definitely non-political since its inception. 1 have been associated with it since its inception as a member of the rank and file, later as a member of a district council, . and subsequently as vice-president of the organization, and I know many of my colleagues who are prominent in the Queensland Country Progressive National party will bear me out when I give an emphatic assurance that no course of action has ever been formulated, and no decision has ever been arrived at from motives of political exigency. . . .

Yet he severely condemned in the press the utterances of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), who he said, was actuated by political bias and was trying to discredit the Queensland marketing and organization schemes. Those schemes are the best rhat are to be found in Australia to-day. At the present time sixteen products, of a value of £16,000,000, are being marketed in Queensland through the farmers' pools that are run, not by Government interests, but by the farmers themselves, with a great deal of success. ""What happened in 1924, when the Bruce-Page Government had the following proposition placed before it by the Australian Dairy Council:That the Federal Government be asked to take urgent steps to introduce a bill to create basis. It would be politically dishonest of a board for the purpose of controlling the interstate and oversea marketing of dairy produce. That such bill provide for the election of a board to control interstate and overfor the Paterson scheme. sea trade in dairy produce. That Government appointed a board to deal with the export trade, but took no action to deal with the marketing of two-thirds of the farmers' butter on the Australian market. since been solved in a better way. Mr Bruce, said at that time that he could not do anything in that regard; yet two years later his Government took a referendum of the people, but did uot ask for powers that would have enabled it to take the action which, in 1924, he said there was not the power to take. It was afraid of offending those who are making big profits by exploiting the primary producers of Australia. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser), speaking at a dinner in my presence at Kingaroy, said that the Bruce-Page Government was responsible for the Paterson butter stabilization scheme. As a matter of fact, that Government had nothing to do with the scheme. I believe that the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) is generous enough to admit that the originator of the scheme was Mr Delroy, a Queensland farmer, and a constituent of the honourable member for Wide Bay. The late member for Wide Bay, Mr E. B. C. Corser, was good enough to rise in his place in the Commonwealth Parliament in Melbourne and draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that Mr Delroy originated the scheme, and circularized every member of the Federal Parliament on the matter. I give the honourable member for Gippsland, who at the time was a private member of the Country party, credit for having advocated the scheme before co-operative butter factories, and for the part which servants or proprietary he played in getting it adopted. But to Mr Delroy is due the honour of having originated the scheme. When the Bruce Page Government was asked to introduce legislation to give the scheme its backing, the reply was that that could not be done, and in consequence the scheme was initiated on a purely voluntary any honourable member to claim that the Bruce-Page Government was responsible That Government was in office for nearly seven years, yet it did absolutely nothing to bring about the organized marketing of primary products in Australia, because such action would have struck a blow at the men who stand behind the Nationalist machine, and other persons-the exploiters, the middlemen, the speculators, the men who have been battening on the primary producers, and who, in the words of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) dictated the policy of the Bruce-Page Government and caused him as an honest man to retire from the Cabinet because he could not tolerate the methods that they adopted. personal explanation. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs has referred to the part which I played in promoting what is known as the Paterson scheme. He has also stated that that scheme was originated by a Mr Delroy. It is only fair to both Mr Delroy and myself that I should state the position. When I first",55,Constitutio N Alteratio N

The position is that the Country party voted last evening against a proposal for the effective organization of the marketing of primary products within and beyond Australia. I take it that its present proposal, which the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), with the concurable member's speech at the dinner at rence of the Attorney-General( Mr Kingaroy?

I regret that the Country party, with the exception of two honourable members who have been consistent in this matter, will not support the Gomarketing conditions in regard to dried vernment's third proposal; but I believe that the feeling among the primary producers is so strong that this proposal will be carried, irrespective of any decision by. the Country party, and I shall do all that I can to assist its passage.

Honourable members will recall that when the Government brought down these remarkable, and so-called emergency tariff proposals, we on this side asked the Prime Minister to consider two things, first, that these new proposals which were brought down for the ostensible purpose of adjusting the trade balance, should be kept separate from the ordinary duties imposed either for revenue purposes or for the protection of Australian industries; and secondly, that a time limit should be placed upon this emergency tariff. brought down the financial position was extremely serious, and we admitted that the Government was justified in taking strong measures to cause some improvement of the situation. Although the Government's object was warmly applauded by the Opposition, serious doubt, was expressed as to the wisdom of its action. At that time, honourable members were not in possession of the proclamation setting out the 60 or 70 prohibitions which had been decided upon. To some extent, therefore, we were called upon to express our opinion of these phenomenal proposals in the dark. The proclamation is now in our hands, and there has been time, although not sufficient time, for consideration of the Government's action. I am disappointed indeed that the Government has not anticipated this debate by acceding to our very moderate requests, that the Government has not stated officially that this new tariff is an emergency and temporary measure, and that it has not imposed a time limit, so that when the financial position improves we could revert to normal tariff conditions? a big majority must be trusted to do the right thing. right thing.

After considering, this new tariff, I am not now prepared to accept the mere statement that it is but a temporary measure.

I am surprised at the statement of the Acting Minister because already three members of the present Ministry have told this country that this prohibition is temporary and will be rescinded when the Government's object has been achieved. Even that statement is not sufficient, because a time limit must be imposed.

There were strong reasons for asking for the time limit a week ago, but there are very much stronger reasons for asking for a time limit now that honourable members and the people of this country are. familiar with the contents of the proclamation. The attitude of the Opposition when these extraordinary proposals were introduced was in no sense a party one. There was no carping on the question. We were actuated by a sincere and generous desire to give the Government every assistance within our power, but since I have had an opportunity of studying the proclamation and the list, of prohibitions, I compelled to speak -with far more reserve than' I did a week ago.

At the same time. I am quite open to be convinced that am wrong. We must all be be able to show me that it has adopted Let me ask the committee.to consider the embarrassing situation in which the Government found itself before it imposed these surcharges and prohibitions. Last November it took a step which was entirely new in the fiscal history of Australia. Hitherto, even from our pre-federation, days, it has been the policy of Australia to take into consideration in imposing tariff duties the Australian cost of production and standard of living, and to give a measure of protection a little larger than that which would be sufficient to enable our manufacturers to maintain our standards and yet compete with the outside world. But when the Government introduced its amazing schedule of 300 items last November it entirely departed from, that basis.

One item alone, which is known .to every honourable member, could have been put on the prohibited list without offending more than a handful 'of people. knows very well what it is. welcome helpful suggestions. If the honourable member will mention that item, we might still prohibit it. not prohibited it, because it derives from it a large amount in revenue duties. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) said in Sydney that this measure had no association whatever with our fiscal policy. I propose to mention some 25 items against which prohibition has been imposed and ask the committee to consider, in a non-party spirit, whether any one of them could have any considerable influence upon the balance of trade. The first is glucose. Our total importations of proclamation under the cloak of emerglucose are valued at £9,531 per annum.. Imagine the great effect that the prohibiGovernment. tion of this item will have on our adverse trade balance, and the vast number of employees that will find work in making £9,500 worth of it ! The next item is laundry blue, the imports of which in 1928-29 were valued at £1,351. How can any one say that the prohibition against this item is imposed for any other reason than to satisfy the demands of the manufacturers of this country? A prohibition is a profoundly serious thing, and invites retaliation. The only agreement tentatively reached at the Geneva Tariff Conference, on the whole tariff question, was that the countries represented would not impose absolute prohibition. They retained their right to impose what duties they liked, but they would not actually prohibit importation of any article. But this Government, in its ignorance of conventional tariff making, has rushed in where all others feared to tread. The importation of candles has also been prohibited. In 1928-29 the value of candles imported was £8,639, while the value of candles manufactured in Australia was £276,169. That furnishes a good example for my argument. It cannot be seriously advanced that the importation of candles is being prohibited for the purpose of adjusting the balance of trade. £8,000 one way or the other will not affect the matter to any appreciable extent; nor can it be advanced that the making of an additional£8,000 worth of candles here will help to relieve local unemployment. This action, in my opinion, has been deliberately taken to create a monopoly in favour of the candle-manufacturers of Australia, and to honour a promise made by the Government. We now come to eggs, of which £6,419 worth were imported in the year 1928-29. The Government is prepared to make enemies of countries with whom we hope to trade for the sake of keeping out £6,000 worth of eggs. at all? may be no reason for bringing eggs here, but if it is desired to keep them out, let us do so by imposing a prohibitive tariff, not by prohibiting their importation altogether. There is no need to do it by gency. That is my complaint against the In the year 192S-29, lemons were imported to the value of £6,709, and oranges to the value of £5,956. Again, I say, if it is desired to keep those articles out, let us do it by means of a tariff, and not by insulting and offending our customers overseas. For sheer stupidity and ignorance of tariff conventions, nothing like this has been done before either by this Parliament or by any other Parliament. Of cornflour, £10,838 worth was imported during the year 1928-29. The next item is jams and jellies, concerning which we have imposed a prohibition against the world. This smash in the face for the buyers of our wool, wheat and butter,has been imposed for the sake of prohibiting the importation of £13,133 worth of goods! The Australian manufacturers, for the year 1928-29, supplied the Australian market with £2,180,616 worth of jams and jellies.

Other items are starch, of which £7,336 worth was imported, and starch flour, of which £4,808 worth was brought into the country in 1928-29. A further item is custard powder.

This is merely an alternative to another tariff schedule which the Government had not the courage to bring down, and which has been rushed through, signed by the Governor General, and brought into force without any opportunity of debate. Tents are another prohibited item. The tents imported are valued at only £3,000, and the value of tents manufactured in Australia £654,000. What good will that do in relieving the financial position? The whole thing is tainted. The values of some other commodities, the importation of which is prohibited, are as follow:-Barbed wire, £20,000; railway dog spikes, £10,000; wire and other nails, £4,000. able member has -a great mind. any ulterior motive, and 1 wish the Minister would be fair. I have said that the whole proposals are tainted, and have been introduced with the idea of giving effect by subterranean methods to a policy of extreme, rabid, and insane protection. The Government is giving effect to its policy under another banner. spoiling the good speech which he made a few days ago. He then made a statesmanlike utterance. spoke in the absence of the schedule. The Opposition is willing to be geuerous to the Government, but we suggest that it should drop this scheme and introduce new proposals on national instead of on party lines. The value of other commodities, the importation of which is to be prohibited, are:-Glue, £11,000; gelatine of all kinds, £18,000; vinegar, £32,000. The total for the particular 25 items I have selected is £228,000, or try of £9,000 a year. These proposals will not have any beneficial effect on our adverse trade balance. Moreover, few, if any, additional employees will be required to manufacture the goods necessary to meet the normal demand, and it is possible, and even likely, that the additional of the Government upon unemployment quantity could be produced with the existing plants and the present number of employees. This course has been adopted, [45] first as a sop to the manufacturers, and, secondly, to benefit the trade union supporters of the Government, who in the end will not derive any benefit, as they .will have to pay much higher prices than those at present prevailing. This is class legislation, and is an invitation to the manufacturers in the industries concerned to put up prices, and to the workers to increase their demands. In the end we shall be faced with higher prices, increased costs, and even more unemployment .than exists to-day. I emphasize the point that the quality of the goods placed on the Australian market is of major importance, as the importation of a certain amount of goods must have a beneficial effect in keeping up the quality of Australian manufac1 tures. The percentage of imports to the annual consumption of some of the items in the schedule is as follows:-Candles, 3 per cent.; lemons, 2.25 per cent.; oranges, .4 per cent.; cornflour, 14 per cent.; jams and jellies, .6 per cent.; dried milk, 2 per cent.; tents and sails, 0.4 per cent. The importation of these commodities, even in small quantities, must have a restraining effect on prices, and assists in keeping up the standard of Australian goods. If we prohibit imports we have no check upon prices or qualities.

325,An Average For Each Indus,"Mr GULLETT -The honorablemeat within Australia, so long as it is wisely applied to secondary industries in which there is room for expansion But let us consider what has happened since the Government came ' down with 300 prohibitive items in November last. When that new tariff was 'imposed the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, and practically every other member of the Cabinet, immediately began to announce, estimates of the scores of thousands of additional workers who as a result of it would find employment. But what has occurred since this Government came into office? According to the latest official figures, there were 13,600 more trade unionists out of work on the 31st March last than at the end of the year 1929. I do not blame the Government for that, but I do say that the tariff which it brought down iri-November last' has not had the effect of reducing the amount of unemployment in Australia -twice as many more out of work had it not been for that tariff schedule. in saying that since this Government came into office the number of trade unionists who are unemployed has increased by something like 20,000. Honourable members opposite are somewhat aggrieved because they have been kept here to-night. They should be in their places to discuss this important question. They had no right to scamper home eight days before Easter. Opposition have gone borne. responsible for these * miracle-working proposals for providing ..work for the workless.

At one fell blow the Government has destroyed a very big proportion of the import business of this country. Honourable members opposite say that the importer is the enemy of this country. ber for Angas( Mr Gabb) says "" Hear, hear."" Let me tell him that, by the destruction of the import business thousands of Labour supporters in the ranks of the clerks, wharf labourers, carters, draymen, and other callings have been thrown out of work. At a time of dire economic and industrial distress such as that which we are now experiencing a wise Government would have kept in work those who were in work. One job of which an Australian is sure to-day, to-morrow, and to the end of the year, is worth five or six that might be found for him by a manufacturer who has not yet built his factory. I would. have supported the Government on a few major items; but when it introduces prohibition on a wholesale scale and in an unscrupulously extreme manner it is not deserving of the support of either this Parliament or the people of Australia. I charge the party opposite with having taken violent and unscrupulous action against industry in this country, but particularly against the interests of thousands of workers. The immediate result has been the dismissal of large numbers of employees. Ultimately the result may be the employment of thousands of other persons; but what good will that do for those who, as a result of the Government's policy, are paid off this week? It has been suggested that this action was taken on the advice of the associated banks. I am unable to say whether that is so or not; but to my certain knowledge some of the most influential and highlyplaced bankers in this country are diametrically opposed to this policy. I have evidence of that in my pocket at the present moment. There is as great a volume of banking advice opposed to it as there is in favour of it.

The only definite result of this action has been to create immediately widespread unemployment. Any other possible result is still "" in the air."" The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has just delivered an extraordinary speech, full of inconsistencies. The honourable gentleman appears to be concerned for the unemployed section of the community. Indeed, since he took his seat on the other side of the chamber, he has become almost hysterically eloquent on the subject of unemployment. His solution of the problem is to l if t the balance became more favorable. He prohibition on the importation of canary seed, eggs, candles, glucose, jams, and jellies! He is not opposed to a large number of the major items which are now prohibited. On his own statement that the prohibition of imports causes unemployment, the honourable gentleman must bo adjudged guilty of advocating a policy which would intensify the unemployment evil. He would allow the importation of a number of articles, the volume of trade in which is not large; but he would prohibit the importation of those items which form the bulk of our imports, and consequently provide a greater amount of unemployment. The honourable member could scarcely have been more inconsistent. According to him, the prohibition of the importation of a few minor items is problem.. kind. gentleman instanced 25 items, and said that the volume of trade in them was so small as to have no great effect on unemployment; and in the next breath he said that the Government policy in prohibiting their importation had increased the unemployment evil. He has entirely failed to substantiate the charge he levelled against the Government. By calling history to our aid, it would not be difficult to show that the Government of which the honourable gentleman was a' member was largely responsible for the present unemployment. Our huge adverse trade balance was accumulating all the time that the Bruce-Page Government was in office. A very strong case in favour of fixing the responsibility for the present unsatisfactory state of affairs on the late Government could be made out if one desired to deal with this matter from a purely party political stand-point. The honourable gentleman began his speech with a demand that the Government should declare whether the restriction of imports was permanent or temporary. He then proceeded to read a number of statements made by various members of the Ministry. He quoted a statement by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) that the proclamation restricting imports was not connected with the fiscal policy of the-Government, and would be reconsidered when the trade referred to the Prime Minister's statement that the proclamation was designed to deal with a national emergency. He also read a' cabled report of a statement made in England by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Fenton), that the action taken was of a temporary nature. Yet with all that information in his possession, the honourable member demanded to know whether the restrictions were, or were not,, of a temporary nature! member believe in a time limit?. statements of members of the Ministry which the honourable gentleman read. nothing. they say definitely and clearly that the action taken is of a temporary nature, and is not connected with the Government's fiscal policy. When I asked the honourable gentleman what time limit he would fix, he stated an arbitrary period of six months. I now ask him upon what data he fixed that period, and on what date it should commence. ' The honourable member should recognize that at this stage it is not possible to say when the proclamation should expire. All that can be done is to set out clearly the principle underlying the proclamation.

338,Accentuating The Unemployment Mr Mctiernan,"On the contrary,the Government. manded that the Government should declare its policy; then, having told us what responsible Ministers had said, he ventilated the darkest suspicion and distrust of those declarations. What is the use of the Government stating its intentions if the honourable member is resolved not to believe what Ministers say? The honourable gentleman proceeded to launch an extreme attack on the proclamation. He denounced it as an extreme departure from the tariff policy of colonial and post-federation days, and said that it was tainted with a sinister motive to help Australian manufacturers, and too drastic and radical to be the subject of moderate and temperate speech. After that vitriolic and vituperative Gomnient. he argued that the schedule was not drastic enough, and ridiculed it by picking out such minor items as glucose, eggs, and canary seed. Government, he said, should not waste its time on trifles, but should direct its attensuddenly; they have accumulated over tion to the larger imports, the restriction of which would have a beneficial effect on the trade balance. He was asked to specify those mysterious which could be beneficially kept out of Australia, but he omitted to do so. With his tongue in his cheek he professed to be taking a broader outlook than that of the mere party politician, and to have a genuine desire to help the Government in a time of national emergency; but, although he claimed to have a knowledge of voluminous imports that could be prohibited with advantage to the country, he kept it secret. His refusal to disclose the information he professed to have showed clearly that he was dealing with the problem as a nagging party political hack. His speech contributed nothing to the solution of the difficulties with which the Commonwealth is confronted. believe that the Ministry, when issuing the proclamation, acted conscientiously and on expert advice, after pursuing every line of inquiry that was open to it. It is a genuine and patriotic attempt to restore the trade balance while causing a minimum of interference with internal industry. Although the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the effect of the proclamation was to increase unemployment, he has not mentioned one He clamorously deperson who has lost his job because of it. His insinuations concerning the sincerity and political honesty of the Government are more justly applicable to himself. He has shown a poor appreciation of the courtesy of members of the ministerial party in remaining here to-night so that he might continue this debate. their job. but the honourable gentleman prefaced his remarks by expressing appreciation of the courtesy of the Government in affording him an opportunity to speak on the tariff. Evidently that was sheer hypocrisy. We expected something better from a gentleman who occupied the responsible office of Minister for Trade and Customs iu the last Ministry. The economic and finanThe cial problems which the Government is called upon to solve have not developed many years, and the charge against the Government, that it is not doing anything to reduce the grave unemployment commodities in Australia, comes with little grace from a gentleman who was in office while these unfortunate conditions were developing. [Quorum formed.'] The speech of the honourable member for tinguished more by its vigour than by its relevance. The honourable member did not appear to have followed in the least degree the arguments of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). The point that the honourable member for Henty made in the first portion of his speech was that there were some 25 items in the schedule, the imports of which into Australia last I year amounted to £228,000. According to the statement of the Prime Minister, the whole volume of imports affected by the prohibition and other tariff provisions introduced last week, amounts to between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000. Of the 70 odd items scheduled, 25 involve an amount of only £228,000. The statement advanced by the Government is that these restrictions upon imports were brought in to meet the exchange position only,.and that I am using the words of",67,Ministerial Supporters Hear

No reasonable person could possibly believe that those 25 items were introduced for the purpose of altering the exchange position. i lie honourable member for Henty. He contended that this procedure by way of proclamation was adopted in order to satisfy certain claims which were not satisfied by the tariff schedules. Accepting the Prime Minister's maximum of £.12.000,000, the balance of the prohibited imports above and beyond those 25 items amounts to, say, £11,750,000. Surely it is obvious that the sudden stoppage of the flow into Australia within a single year of some eleven million pounds worth of imports must necessarily produce immediate unemployment. It may be that that will be caught up later and that an adjustment w ill take place, but it is patent that immediate and serious unemployment must result from the action of the Government. was the argument of the honourable member for Henty. The honourable member for Parkes did not even begin to get near to an answer to it . I shall refer to a limited number of points, and I think that I can put them shortly to allow other honourable members an opportunity to speak on the subject. 1. call attention to the procedure which has been employed by the Government on this occasion. For many years there has been a simple provision in the Customs Act tinder which any imports can be prohibited by proclamation. Up to the present that provision has been utilized only in exceptional cases. No very serious action has been taken under it . On this occasion an entirely new use is being made of the procedure. The point that I am making is apart altogether fro m any views that any honourable member may have as to these particular prohibitions. It is, that by a proclamation made by a Minister, not reviewable by Parliament, that cannot be effectively discussed in Parliament, upon which no amendment can be made in Parliament, and which Parliament is unable either to approve or reject, between ten and twelve million pounds worth of imports are to be shut out. of Australia. executive act, by a stroke of the pen. If it were a proposal to impose a duty of 5 per cent, on an article, be' that, article canary seed or snuff, it would be necessary to obtain the approval of both this House and the Senate. But when, in That is the argument of stead of a duty of 5 per cent., ii is a prohibitiona duty, let us say, of ten thousand per cent.^ the absolute exclusion of goods-then, if you please, Parliament is to have no say in tlie matter. It would have been possible to bring down a schedule prohibiting the importation of these goods, or to impose absolutely prohibitive duties. Had that been done, Parliament would have had an opportunity to discuss the provisions of the schedule which would nevertheless have operated forthwith. It is useless to say that the introduction of these proposals in the ordinary form of a tariff schedule would have created any difficulty for the Government, or placed any obstacle in its way. Exceptf o r the procuring of the assent of the represenThat, again tatives of the people, there would not have been any obstacle. The procedure followed means that no assent of the representatives of the people is required. I hope that at au early date I shall have an opportunity to ask this House to agree to a modification of the Customs Act to prevent such a course being followed in the future. Whether our views are in favour of or against the particular proposals, the procedure is radically wrong in this case. There must necessarily be a disturbance of business and of industry as a result of the action taken by the Government. It must inevitably increase'unemployment. immediately. It may be that the measures taken can be justified even though they will bring about that result. I call attention to the fact that the unemployment figure at the end nf September last wa3 12.1 per cent. A t the end of Decemberi t was 3 3.1 per cent... while on the 31st Marchi t was 14.6 per cent. I do so for a particular purpose. We all know that the Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) is an enthusiastic propagandist. For some months he has been conducting a publicity campaign in support of the November and subsequent tariff proposals of the Government. Many honourable members have That is done by heard of, and some have seen, the circulars that have been sent to manufacturers, designed to elicit any evidence that might support the tariff proposals of the Government by saying that there had been some increase in employment. I suggest that there should be a clear distinction between official statements made by Ministers, based on information obtained from the Statistical Department, and propaganda by Ministers. The Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs has been indulging in the most remarkable propaganda. what he said is true, the official figures in regard to unemployment must be false, because the honourable gentleman has repeatedly announced an increase of employment to the extent of 50,000. The last occasion on which he did so was in Sydney. In confirmation, I refer honourable members to the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday last. have been out of work had it not been for the action of this Government. different proposition from the allegation frequently advanced by the Acting Minister( Mr Forde) in his propaganda. problematical and hypothetical. is a mere matter of opinion and is not capable of demonstration and proof. It is a proposition different from everything that the Minister has been saying up to date. An example of this propaganda is a speech made by the Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs at Marrickville on Saturday night last. industries, which, he said, were employing an increased number of hands. I hope that they are. We are all agreed that everything should be done to solve the acute unemployment problem, but I submit that the Acting Minister is doing an ill service to the community by conveying an entirely false impression of the facts. said:The hosiery trade is to-day employing 2,400 more than it would be if the tariff had not been imposed. would be increased to 10,000. That statement to the casual reader would appear to be a repetition of an earlier statement of the Minister that some thousands of additional hands were l>eing employed in the hosiery trade, but when examined, it is found to be a different statement altogether. Those figures certainly suggest that there has been an increase in employment, but amounting to thousands. D u r i ng the past few months the Minister has repeatedly stated that there had been a great increase of employment in the textile trade. In the Sydney Morning Herald, on the opposite side of the page from which I have just quoted, appears this stateIf ment :The Textile Industry; Employment in Victoria. The position in the textile industry was reported at a quarterly meetin"" of the Victorian district oif the Textile Workers Union to be far from satisfactory. The Secretary ( Mr A. U. Loft) said that many reports had recently appeared purporting to give estimates of increase in employment as the result of the recent tariff schedule. Mr A. R. L of t was obviously referring to the statements of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. The report coutiuuesWhile one or two mills had employed additional hands, the fact was that a larger number of operatives were now idle, and indications were that this number would be increased in It is largely speculative, the immediate future. It was expected, howIt ever, that when the trade readjusted itself, a number of those at present unemployed would be absorbed in the industry. I sincerely hope that they w ill .

He states that unemployment is unfortunately increasing in the textile He dealt with a number of industry, yet for mouths past we have had almost weekly statements about the increase of employment in tlie textile industry as a result of the tariff action of the Government. I put these facts before honourable members. The report which I just read is sufficient answer to the statement of the Acting Minister. I ask him to consider very seriously his propaganda Speaking at Marrickville he methods in the interests of his own Government and the Commonwealth as a whole. The Acting Minister is overdoing this thing, and when the press publishes Ultimately this number such a report as this from a union secretary, who probably is a strong supporter of the Government, it must naturally create mistrust in the mind of the general public in respect of the many statements emanating from the same ministerial source.",68,Ministerial Supporters Hear

The report proceedsReplying to a question as to whether the Government intended to take any action to prevent the consumers from being exploited, the Acting Minister said that he was of operation between the Government and the local manufacturers to safeguard the interests of the public. He hoped it would not be necessary for the Government to take any steps to compel local manufacturers to realize that it was their duty to give the best service possible. Bather than increase prices be would like them to follow the lead set by the makers of farming implements, who had pledged themselves to reduce prices immediately by 5 per cent. Any instances of exploitation would be investigated by the Government, and some action would be taken. One journal referred to statements like that as "" Ministers waving their tin swords."" That is avery apt metaphor. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs says that -some action will be taken, but what action could be taken? Surely every honourable member knows that, whatever the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth may be, it is quite impossible to deal with price control. It would be impossible to deal with the various items of the tariff. There are ( some 500 classes of items and many subclasses,' and it is quite inconceivable that we could employ a method of price control in respect of any considerable number of those items. Again and again we have heard in this chamber the most formidable threat, mainly from the PrimeI am suggesting, not Minister, but to a considerable extent from the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, that if the local sellers or manufacturers of articles do not behave themselves, duties will be removed. Everybody knows that that is idle talk, that the' Ministers are waving a rusty and a bent tin sword. If two or three manufacturers exploit the public, is the duty that protects 500 manufacturers to be removed? There is nothing in the Minister's statements, and every honourable member knows that. Honourable members may sit and applaud such statements, because they sound very fine, if Speaking generally, the only way to reduce the prices' of commodities is by some measure of competition. If prices are unduly high, the people will refuse to buy, or else competitors will enter the field. There is no other real way of bringing prices to a reasonable level. I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs to arrange for a census to be taken of the prices of all articles affected by last week's oroposals, opinion that there would be coas from the nearest convenient date prior to their introduction, and in addition to arrange for another inquiry into wholesale and retail prices at about the 30th April, and thereafter, say, at threemonthly intervals.

Opposition wish to show up some of his -.supporters ? -on that point. I have not heard from any of my supporters on this matter The Prime Minister stated definitely that some manufacturers had given an undertaking not to raise prices. They should be held to their agreement, at least to the extent chat, if they break away from it, they should be exposed and required to give reasons. I should welcome a census of prices before and after the prohibition of imports so that honourable members may be in a position to know the actual facts. Having regard to the exceptional character of the Government's proposals, special information should be prepared relating to those articles of manufacture, which are affected by the Government's embargo upon imports. On Friday afternoon, I asked the Prime Minister whether he would allow honourable members an opportunity to discuss the imposition of a time limit upon the prohibition of imports. The right honourable gentleman replied that it was an important matter, that the Government had an open mind upon it and would be glad to hear the views of honourable members. Because of that definite pronouncement from the Prime Minister, I was surprised to-day to hear from the ministerial side of the House a chorus of jeers and gibes when the member for Henty and Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) mentioned the desirability of imr posing a time limit embargo. in charge of the House will'follow the lead given by the Prime Minister on Friday afternoon la3t. Every one knows that the prohibition of imports and. the surcharge of 50 per cent, upon certain classes of imports is not part of' the' Government's protective policy. Its action, therefore, must result in a serious disturbance of the business of importers and distributors, which necessarily must inflict harm upon the community. If there is no time limit, and if business people are unable to prepare in advance for the lifting of the prohibition^! give the Government credit for acting in good faith, believing that, in due time the Ministry will l if t the prohibition-ther e will again be a serious disturbance of business if it is removed without warning. The Government submitted its proposals as a I am quite indifferent means to relieve the exchange situation. If it is acting in good faith-and 1 am assuming it is-unles s a time limit is imposed, vested interests will develop ami place the Ministry in an almost impossible position when it seeks to remove the prohibition. If , hawever, a time limit is indicated, every one will know that the prohibition of importations will last only for a season unless the continuance of abnormal conditions renders it desirable for the Government to allow the prohibition to remain in force a little longer. With a time limit, both importers and manufacturers will be able to make their arrangements in the full knowledge that the prohibition of importations will cease upon a given date. Without a time limit it, will be impossible for manufacturers to expend capital in extending their plants for the purpose of providing for further employment. On this matter I have consulted a considerable number of leading business men, manufacturers as well as importers, and all are agreed as to the wisdom of a time limit. No manufacturer who gave credit to the Government for honesty of intention would incur expenditure under the existing conditions. On the -other hand, certain manufacturers might take a chance, thinking they could"" "" wangle "" a continuance of the prohibition by bringing influence to bear upon the Ministry and inducing it to break its pledge to the people of this country.

I ask the Minister in charge of the House not to dismiss the suggestion merely because it emanates from the Opposition. The Prime Minister on Friday last regarded it as of great importance, and promised to give it consideration.

It is quite apparent that honourable members opposite have been disappointed because these emergency proposals of the Government have been so well received by thinking people throughout the Commonwealth. looked at our economic situation without party political bias, has admitted that something drastic had to be done, and that the Government has made a courageous effort to tide Australia over '..he trying period through which she is passing.

The Prime Minister and I have both said in this House and elsewhere that this action has been taken to meet a national emergency, and has no relation to our general fiscal policy.

357,Mr Forde,"The honourable memberof the Tariff Board, including those who are not public servants, were asked by the Government to express a frank opinion on the items that it was proposed to exclude, and they could not point to one that should be removed from the list. The Governmentinvited the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and honourable members generally, to offer any suggestions that they pleased on the subject, and the only response has been the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to-night that he could enumerate, though he would not do so, a number of items that could be prohibited, with the result that millions of pounds worth of exports could be excluded without hardship. The honourable member has fallen very far from the high stand that he took last week. It has been suggested to-night that the Government should indicate the period for which the prohibitions will remain in force. I remind the committee that the people returned this party to power with an overwhelming majority in October last, and entrusted it with the duty of getting the country out of the financial difficulties long that prohibition would continue, and into which the previous administration had allowed it to drift. The Government has taken the responsibility of imposing these surcharges and prohibitions, and it will also take the responsibility of determining when they may safely be lifted. If we were to fix a date now for the lifting of them, the period might expire during a parliamentary recess, and many anomolies would result. The Minister in charge of the Customs Department has a large discretionary power to vary prohibitions or grant general permissions and to deal sympathetically with any cases of hardship that may be submitted to him. We have already indicated that goods in bond or in transit on the water on the date of the proclamation will be admitted under the old rates. It has also been intimated that the fullest and most sympathetic consideration will be given to any application by the importers of goods from the United Kingdom in respect of goods on order from the factory or actually in transit from the factory to the ship at the time the proclamation was issued. General permission has also been given for the importation of certain lines which it is ascertained are not made in Australia such as copper rivets, bifurcated Mr Forde. rivets and horse-shoe nails. The Government will exercise the greatest care to ensure that no undue hardship is caused in the application of this policy. It would be farcical for the Government to agree to put a time limit upon its emergency tariff proposals, because it has the power at any time to vary or amend the proclamation. Previous governments have 1 issued prohibitions and proclamations, andhave inserted time limits only when it suited their particular purpose. In 1917 the Hughes Government issued a proclamation affecting approximately sixteen items, among"" them being eggs, fur, apparel, perfumery, jewellery, potable spirits, ale, beer, and so on, and the prohibition then made continued for nearly three years. It is, of course, true that the prohibition was imposed because of the difficulty in securing shipping space, but nevertheless it had the effect of building up some great Australian industries, notably confectionery manufacturing and motor car body building. The point 1 wish to make is that the government of that day was trusted to determine how surely the present government can be trusted to say how long the present prohibition shall continue. Complaints have been made about the fiscal effect, of the step the Government has taken, but, while that"" consideration did not actuate the Government, any prohibition of imports must necessarily stimulate local production. said that it had nothing to do with the present prohibition. to meet a national emergency, but just as the prohibition imposed by the Hughes Government led to the establishment of the motor car body building industry, so is the present prohibition likely to lead to the development and expansion of other industries in Australia. I should like to show the .difference between the party political attitude of honourable members opposite and the attitude of the Secretary of State for the Dominions, who has telegraphed. Exceptional circumstances surrounding recent tariff increases and import restrictions adopted by His Majesty's Government in tlie Commonwealth of Australia are fully realized, here, as well as their temporary character, and",73,Ministerial Supporters Hear

That is a very fine attitude indeed. Then monwealth and the States borrowed we have an authoritative journal like the £162,700,000, and our dividend from London Times, in its issue of the 4th April, sayingAustralia is facing the financial crisis with courage and determination, which will go a shortage of £104,900,000. No wonder the long way to re-establish her credit. She is banks, at a conference with the leaders of showing resolution to balance her accounts and the present Government declared that not shirk the sacrifice necessary to maintain this policy of drift should not be allowed the stability of her finances. The Melbourne Age, which is not a be consulted in the matter. The Deputy Labour newspaper, saidThe nation will rally to the support of the Scullin Government in its heroic attempt that the Prime Minister was wrong in to conquer the almost overpowering difficulties saying that he had consulted the banks of inherited from its predecessors. resolved that there can be no restoration of financial stability until imports and exports have been reconciled, the Ministry is boldly pursuing a well-defined policy to its logical conclusion. The Age gives the Government great pra'sc for its courage in tackling this problem. There are 420 items in the tariff, of which 52 were affected by the schedule brought down in August; 77 are prohibited from being imported except.with the permission of the Minister; 11 are affected by a partial prohibition and 5 of the lastmentioned are also subjected to the 50 per cent, surcharge in the schedule, making a total of 140 out of 420. Last year £140,000,000 were imported. The step taken by the Government will affect goods worth approximately £16,000,000, and it is .estimated that the imports will be reduced by approximately £10,000,000 affecting the revenue by approximately £4,750,000. This action, together with the policy being followed by the banks in rationing credit, will, it is believed, rectify our adverse trade balance within twelve months. The policy of drift which characterized the last Government over a period of six and a half years has led to Australia having in the aggregate an adverse trade balance of £91,000,000. It is absolutely scandalous that the late Government did not attempt to tackle the position as this Government has done. If to the £63,500,000 by which our imports exceeded exports we add interest and cost of services abroad for the same period amounting to £213,300,000 we find that we have a total of £276,800,000 to meet. The late Government did not attempt to face the situation except by borrowing, and during six and a half years the ComBawra amounted to £9,200,000, making a total of £171,900,000, which leaves a to continue. They were among the first to Leader of the Opposition said he felt sure Having Australia. went as near as any man could to saying that the Prime Minister had not told the truth in the matter. It is unfortunate that there is unemployment in Australia, but this is nothing to what it would have been had the present Government not tackled the position in a courageous way. When the Government was returned to power on the 12th October last our secondary industries were languishing; Australia was in the grip of big importing interests which were strangling our secondary industries. Those industries goods worth approximately appealed in vain to the late Government, for protection. The generous measure of protection which this Government has given them in the first tariff proposals, hurriedly brought down and placed on the table, has resulted in thousands of men finding employment, and in thousands being kept on who would otherwise have been dismissed. I have had numerous letters from manufacturers saying that as a result of the protection given by the present Government they are able not only to keep their employees working but also to engage additional hands. Unfortunately, because of the serious drop in the price of wool and wheat, amounting approximately to £31,000,000 in the present year, and because of enforced falling off in our loan expenditure to an extent of approximately £20,000,000, there is in circulation this year £51,000,000 less than was in circulation last year, a condition of affairs which must have a serious effect on",74,Ministerial Supporters Hear

361,Mr Forde,"The honourable memberemployment. If the present Government had been returned to power in 1928, and had thus been in a position to bring down tariff proposals to give protection to Australian industries before the bottom fell out of the wool and wheat markets, there would have been a great revival in industry. Trying to grapple with the situation in a period of depression does not give the tariff proposals of the Government a fair trial. After all, unemployment is not peculiar to Australia; it. is world-wide. Wo have read in the newspapers that there is almost an' unprecedented number of unemployed in the United States of America to-day. Germany has more unemployed than at any previous time since the war: England, and almost every other, country in the world, is in the throes of economic depression. Ours is not the only country that has taken drastic steps to balance the ledger. It would have been easier to shirk tackling this problem, but the Government, after consultation with those who knew how the country was drifting, made up its mind to face the position resolutely. It came to the conclusion that this was the only way in which the existing national emergency could be met. This has nothing to do with the Government's fiscal policy. The Government took this step on its own responsibility, and it is for the Government to determine for how long these emergency measures are to be kept in operation. We shall not shirk our duty in this matter. I realize that honourable members are weary, and I do not propose to inflict a long speech upon them. I desire merely to record in a few sentences my concurrence with what has been said by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to the effect that it is desirable that a time limit should be imposed upon the operation of these provisions. I still support that view in spite of what the Acting Customs( Mr Forde) has just said. L do not think that lie realizes that embargoes generally are the most drastic and dangerous weapon that can be employed. They are more likely to provoke retaliation than anything else that could bo done. If a time limit of six months, as has been suggested to-night, were adopted by the Government, so that at the end of that period the whole provision would automatically lapse and would, if necessary, have to be renewed, it would go a long way towards impressing on the minds, not only of the people of Australia, but of those elsewhere, that the Government was sincere in its statement that this was a temporary measure only to deal with an emergency. It would prevent the possibility of vested interests growing up under the extraordinary hothouse conditions which the 50 per cent, additional tariff creates. If these high duties and embargoes remain in force for longer than six months, certain vested interests will establish themselves, and it will be much more difficult to pull away the props than if a time limit of six months were definitely declared now. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs said that the House might not be in session in six months' rime. That is probable, but it would not. matter, because the Government acted by proclamation on this occasion and it could do so again. The imposition of a time limit would do something to minimize the possibility of retaliatory measures being resorted to by other countries. It was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) that he found it difficult to dissociate what had been done by the Government from the Government's general tariff policy. I assure the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs that there is a strong feeling in certain quarters that the Government did not require much persuasion to take this step, that its action was dictated rather by a desire to do this thing than by tinnecessity of doing it. over it for two months. ter that such an impression does exist. Minister for Trade and There is a feeling that the Government is making use of the existing temporary exchange difficulty as an excuse for doing something which it wished to do, but which it. would not have dared to do except under the cloak of trade necessity.

364,Mr Paterson,"I assure the Minisof following a policy of drift. There are different ways of considering that matter. An Australian manufacturer, referring to the Government's action in bringing down tliis measure without placing a definite time limit on its operation, expressed his opinion in these words: "" It was a gambler's last desperate throw to avoid facing the industrial position."" He believed that the Government was following a policy of drift. The best answer which the Government can give to those who believe that it has acted rather in accordance with its expressed tariff policy than with any desire to correct the exchange position is to accede to the appeal made by the Leader and Deputy Lea.der of the Opposition for the imposition of a time limit of six months on the operation of this provision, after which it would lapse, and would have to be again renewed if that were though necessary. This is the first time. I have had the pleasure of listening to a debate on a tariff schedule. The speech of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) reminded me of a story of the lad who joined the army. any chance? assure the honourable member that it would not be the army which he joined at Rothbury. The lad's mother, after watching the march-past in which her son took part, remarked that all the soldiers were out of step except him. It would seem that everybody is out of step in regard to this measure except the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). He referred to the embargo on the importation of such articles as eggs, lemons, peanut butter, and canary seed, the value of which did not amount to anything worth considering. He said that if the Government would tackle this matter seriously, and place some really big items on the schedule, he would support it. If , as he suggests, the embargo on these articles is going to render so much assistance to local manufacturers, to how much greater an extent would they be assisted if the embargo were extended to the really important items? Several honourable members of the Opposition suggested that a time limit should be imposed upon the operation of the embargoes and of the higher duties imposed in this schedule. The Labour party has always stood for the protection of Australian industries, and for providing employment for our own people in our own country upon the manufacture of our own goods. What is responsible for the present unsatisfactory economic situation in Australia to-day? As a result of the decline in the exports of primary products such as wool, there was built up, during the time that the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition were members of the last Government, an adverse trade balance amounting to £62,000,000 by the end of 1928. During its term of office the Bruce Page Government was continually warned by influential Australian newspapers which had consistently supported its policy of the crisis which was approaching. The Sydney Bulletin, which has always been a strong supporter of the Nationalist party, advised it of the difficulties which it would have to face if drastic steps were not taken to check the drift. The members of the late Government, and those who supported it, remind me of the man who keeps on borrowing money to attend race meetings, and in the It was not yourself by end finds himself "" out."" Since this Government has been returned, and has had an opportunity of giving effect to its policy of protecting Australian industries, a by-election has been held in Tasmania, and a seat which had always been held by a Nationalist candidate was won by a member of the Labour party. Last Saturday the South Australian elections were held, and although this Government has been in power since last October, and the people of Australia are fully conversant with its policy, the Liberal or National party in that State was practically annihilated. As a result of the Nationalist party's unsympathetic treatment of Australian industries nationalism is on the decline. During the long term when the Bruce-Page Government was in office, our financial and economic position steadily became worse. This Government is now making a determined attempt not only to adjust our adverse trade balance, but to make the conditions of the people better than they are to-day.

The Commonwealth is in a worse position now than it has ever been, but it is unfair to compare this sparsely populated and undeveloped territory with older countries. With the assistance of the Development and Migration Commission, and in other ways, the Bruce-Page Government increased the number of migrants coming to Australia, and as a result of its migration policy thousands of men have been compelled to walk the streets vainly in search of work. With winter approaching, the position will be serious, but it will not be so bad as it would have been had the Nationalist party been in power.

If , during those years, when the Bruce Page Government was iu office, it had submitted an effective fiscal policy, the imports would have decreased instead of increased to the extent indicated. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) and honourable members with whom he is associated, have made an appeal on behalf of the unemployed; but they should realize that the policy which confronts us. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also criticized the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs for saying that 50,000 men had been placed in-employment as a result of the Government's protective policy.

369,Mr Riordan,"That is a question the Bruce-Page Government had beensection of the community except members . of the Nationalist party. Prior to the 12th October last that party had had such a long tenure of office that it considered that it could not be removed. But the people of Australia at length became alive to the effects of its policy, and whenever it now appeals for support it is knocked over like ninepins. Australia supports this Government in its endeavour to relieve the unemployed position, some good will be better than honourable members opposite that importers have large stocks of goods that it will take some time to quit. It would, therefore, be wrong of this Government to limit the time during which the prohibition shall last. If the result of the prohibition is to provide more work in our manufacturing industries, it should be continued indefinitely. Any person who is prepared to build factories and carry on manufacturing operations should be given the guarantee of protection so long as he charges a reasonable-price to the consumer. Honourable members opposite allege that prices will rise. The price of the harvester on the Australian market is no greater than it is in the Argentine. There will be competition among our own manufacturers, and that will have the effect of keeping down prices to a reasonable level. Whenever tariff schedules are to be discussed in this chamber we find the lobbyer/ or stool-pigeon, hanging round, endeavouring to obtain inside information. One speaker to-night expressed views identical with those that were voiced by an importer who came to Canberra by train last Tuesday He said: "" I do not import a great deal. I give employment to wharf-labourers and carters. You will throw those men out of work."" The men who are thrown out of work as the result of .this protection will be absorbed in the manufacture of the very goods the importation of which is. prohibited, and it is more than likely that their numbers will be augmented. I hope that the Government will pursue this policy despite the criticism of the friends of the importers, or any other criticism that may be levelled against it. If it puts into operait.

That Government gave effect to 90 per. cent, of the policy that it placed before the electors at each election. I am confident that if the Government continues along the lines that it is now following it will If the press of remain in power in the National Parliament for very many years. accomplished. Nobody knows support the criticism of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett), but go further than he did. When the proposal was first brought forward to impose a super tax on certain imports, and a prohibition with respect to others, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) whether any consideration had been given to the question of preference, and he replied, in effect, that this was not a fiscal matter, but merely an emergency measure to adjust the adverse trade balance. That reply was entirely unsatisfactory to me. I do not intend to-night to be captiously critical, but I shall put forward a scheme for the adjustment of the trade balance without the adoption of harsh measures. It must be admitted ' that this proposal of the Government is an experiment. Itmay be called courageous, or audacious, but it is difficult to say how it will react. To say that it is not a fiscal proposal is rather beside the point, because in its incidence it places a tax on certain goods that enter Australia, and a veritable prohibition of the importation of other goods. If these imports and prohibitions had been so arranged as to be equitable, as between debtor and creditor nations, and also respected empire reciprocity, they would have been more useful. Let me first of all deal with the criticism of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ,( Mr Gullett.) in regard to the fixing of a time limit. If the Government does not fix a timelimit the proposal may react very adversely against Customs( Mr Forde) has displayed a great deal of'zeal in his defence of-' the",78,Ministerial Supporters Hear
370,Mr White (Balaclava) [10.37],"Iwho have spoken from the Government benches have shown a vehemence that I am sorry I cannot imitate. I point out, however, that a time limit is necestically in a state of siege under police sary, first from the manufacturers' point of view. The Prime Minister( Mr gate conditions there, and I commend such Scullin) wisely called a conference of agricultural implement makers, and obtained from them the promise of a reduction in price of 5 per cent., so that the primary producers would not suffer' by the imposition of the additional duty. But what is the position of those manufacturers? If they have no guarantee as to how long this impost will last, they that all my life I have worked as hard will not be prepared to buy up-to-date machinery nor to make an effort to increase production and thus reduce costs. I have put it to certain manufacturers in that line whether they could not have made the reduction greater than 5 per cent. They have assured me, and I believe them, that competition is keen enough not to warrant any greater reduction, and that, as in the case with other businesses at the present time, they chiefly because of the honourable member's are hard pressed by the high cost of labour and overhead, and are thus unable to reduce prices to a greater extent. If there is no fixed period they will not install labour-saving machinery, or extend their works; consequently they will carry on as they are now doing and endeavour to obtain a larger production. The result will be that prices will not fall. less than is the case in Canada, yet their grace to Australia that coal can be prices are nearly double. which this Government should consider. This is not a party matter. honourable member claims to speak in a non-party spirit, but usually any statement to that effect is not believed. But there are occasions when we must rise above party considerations Such an occasion arises when we are discussing industrial questions, any reference to which usually arouses honourable members opposite. That is particularly the case when the coal industry is mentioned. If the Government wishes to put its house in order, it must be courageous enough to settle the dispute in that industry. I had a passage with the last speaker ( Mr Riordan) in regard to the Rothbury mine, where miners, whose only offence is their desire to work, are pracprotection. I went to that field to investia course of action to honourable members who sit opposite so that they may ascertain for themselves what is going on. ThatI did some work there during my visit was merely incidental. It was for experience and not for gain. Honourable members opposite who think that I have never worked may be interested to learn manually as any of them. I have been in industry for 25 years, both manufacturing and importing. I hope that hereafter honourable members will cease their gibes about Rothbury. In my speech in the House on the coal question I purposely made no reference to the honourable member for Htinter( Mr James) or other representatives of coal-mining districts, then absence from the chamber, and because I realized the embarrassing position in which he found himself. Yet he saw fit to attack me on his return. I have quoted definite figures to show the wages paid to miners and the difficulties under which the coal-mining industry is operating. These, I submit, are an effective reply to their utterances. The effect of the high price of coal on the agricultural implement trade will be realized when we reflect that it takes two tons of coal to make one ton of steel. It is a disbrought here from other countries more cheaply than it can be hewn here. Steel which could be imported for £6 a ton Every costs £13 a ton to manufacture in Australia. Honourable members will realize from these figures how the primary producer is being hit by the industrial turmoil on the coal-fields. These difficulties and charges react on both manufacturers and primary producers. A time limit is essential; without it there will be greater unemployment, because manufacturers will not know where they stand, and will be afraid to launch out in bigger undertakings. On the other hand, the fixing of a time limit will assist to establish new industries on a sound footing. It will enable them to do what the",79,Ministerial Supporters Hear

372,Mr White,"There is another factmotor body building and confectionery industries have done. ""When the embargo is removed they will be able to bold their own. It is true that there will be a 5 per cent, reduction in the cost of agricultural implements under the newimposts; but that reduction may be offset by higher shipping rates. If our imports are less, the ships trading with Australia will carry smaller cargoes. The result will probably be that in order to maintain their businesses, shippers will be compelled to charge higher rates on exports from Australia, m which case the primary producers will be hit again. Australia is in desperate straits, and something must-be done if we are to avoid a financial crash. At the moment the essential consideration is how shall we get more money on the other side of the world. We shall not get it by prohibiting imports. I do not say that a restriction of imports is inherently wrong. We shall probably have to wait until our harvest of wheat and wool is -exported at, we hope, favorable prices, before our financial position will improve to any extent. Australia supplies only about one-third of the world's wool, and is only fifth in the list of wheat-producing nations. Had the Government in imposing restrictions discriminated between creditors and debtors, and encouraged inter-Empire trade, it would have done something to bring about financial stability and at the same time stimulate Empire trade.

Let us now turn to our trade with the United States of America. In 1927-28 we imported from that country goods valued at £35,005,736, and exported to it goods valued at £8,954,823. In the following year the imports and exports were respectively £35,308,345 and £5,831,794. Honourable members will see that our large adverse trade balance is largely due to the great disparity between our imports from and exports to the United States of America. That is the country against which .we should be justified in discriminating. Not every person in Australia realizes the extent to which Great Britain purchases our products. The Empire Marketing Board has estimated that Great Britain annually consumes agricultural products to the value of £426,000,000. Her imports of grain and flour each year are valued at £98,000,000, while the figures in respect of meat, wool, and hides and skins are respectively, £109,000,000, £64,000,000, and £26,000,000. In 1928 Britain bought 52,787,000 cwt. of wheat from other parts of the Empire, and 51,000,000 cwt. from foreign countries. Australia supplied only 10,233,000 cwt. of that wheat. Britain buys annually about 672,000,000 lb. of butter, of which in normal years Australia supplies about one-eighth. Importations of cheese into Britain total 336,000,000 lb. per annum, Australia's proportion being about 7,000,000 lb.

If the latest schedule were not masquerading as an emergency measure necessitated by the adverse trade balance, but had been brought before us as a tariff policy that we could have discussed on its merits, with a view to the wise rationing of imports, it would have received from the Opposition some measure of support. Honourable members opposite, as well as those on this side, profess admirationfor the late Honourable Alfred Deakin and frequently quote from his speeches. I do so with diffidence but in the press of to-day is a quotation that is particularly apposite. Referring to an item of duty that was preposterously high, Mr Deakin said that "" its effect was to pull down the flag of protection and hoist the black flag of prohibition."" The Federal Government has hoisted the black flag of prohibition and perhaps the red flag is flying beside it. I deplore its attitude and join with my colleagues and members of the Country party in condemning the Government for introducing this policy under false pretences. I do not offer this criticism in any party spirit, and I hope that, the Government will consider the suggestions I have made for the sake of Empire unity, the defence of Australia, and the safety of our people in time of crisis. Government's honoring of the promise given by the Prime Minister to allow members of the Opposition an opportunity to debate the emergency tariff proposals has not been very gratefully received. The speech of the Deputy Leader of was nothing but words, words, words. If he had any desire to assist the country in its time of trouble he did not give evidence of it to-night; for his speech did not contain one constructive suggestion. When he was asked what he would do to solve the problem o confronting the Government he replied that that was a matter for the party in power. The honourable member was Minister for Trade and Customs in the last government, and is no doubt the chief exponent of the tariff policy of the Opposition. One would have thought that he would have endeavoured to assist the Government and the country with his knowledge and experience. AH he did was to seek to obstruct the Government's policy. I am satisfied with what the Government is doing. ployment pleases the honourable member? interjection. The honourable member knows that I am much concerned about the unemployment that prevails. The Government is earnestly endeavouring to solve the unemployment problem and its tariff policy is evidence of that. I welcome these proposals and am glad that the increased protection of our industries has already enabled them to give more employment. I believe that as time goes on and this tariff is given an opportunity we shall be able to employ many more thousands of people in Australia. That is the idea that prompted the action of the Government. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) is very displeased that the Government has made good in handling the affairs of this country. I regret his attitude. The people of Australia looked to the honourable member, who previously occupied the high and dignified position of Minister for Trade and Customs, at least to give a helping hand in these troublous times. The manufacturers and exporters of Australia have assured this Government of their support. They believe that it is out to save Australia. I am sure that it will do so. I am confident that it is working along the right lines, and that its efforts will meet with the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) buccess after success. I am concerned about the primary producer, of whom we hear so much, but I believe that side by side with the development of our wool, wheat, wine, fruit, dried fruit and other industries, we should encourage our secondary industries. I think that that will be done by this Government. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) raved about Empire reciprocity.

In what way would he justify the cost of training a few youths at those colleges? could be reduced under the changed circumstances. man made no attempt to reduce the cost of those colleges when he had the power to do so, and because this Government is facing its responsibilities and endeavouring to keep down costs, the Opposition is becoming exceedingly perturbed. Our first method of approach was to consider whether the Jervis Bay College could be closed, and the trainees removed to Duntroon. The officers of the department considered'the problem from that angle. When the statement to which the Leader of the Opposition has directed attention was made by the Minister for Defence the investigation was proceeding along those lines. Then we had to consider what we should do with the Jervis Day College. Before coming to a decision we visited Jervis Bay, and realized that there was a difficulty in the way, since the Government property there was more valuable than at Duntroon. As a result departmental officers were asked to consider the amalgamation of the two colleges, not at Duntroon as was at first suggested, but at Jervis Bay. It will be seen that our policy was the same, but there was a change in regard to the proposed location of the amalgamated college which was to serve the dual purpose. proposition ? tion to say until I have had an opportunity to consider the reports from de* partmental officers.

I do not wish to detain the House, but I should like to reply briefly to the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who urged the payment of a bonus on the production of gold. The Government has not favourably considered that proposal. We have not disguised that fact. Neither did our predecessors in office. But we have been impressed with the case that has been made out for the stimulation of the goldmining industry. If this can be done, it will be of great advantage to Australia at the present time. The payment of a bonus ' merely to ensure extra profits to established mining companies, however, would not stimulate gold production.

Wc have been in touch with the Government of Western Australia on this subject for some time. Tf that Government is satisfied after investigation that it can guarantee a loan of £300,000 proposed to be raised by the company in question, then, as the Treasurer has already said, we are prepared to shoulder our share of the responsibility by standing behind that Government in respect of the guarantee. We believe that this policy will be of substantial help to the industry. In this matter we are working through the State Government rather than by direct negotiation, because we have not at our disposal the necessary facilities to conduct investigations into mining propositions. I believe Western Australia has a special claim for consideration. Gold production in that State is greater than elsewhere in the Commonwealth, and Western Australia has not benefited by the national policy of protection to the same extent as the eastern States, particularly New South Wales and Victoria To some extent protection has been detrimental to Western Australia. This fact would not justify the scrapping of protection, but it would justify the Commonwealth in giving special consideration to industries indigenous to a State which has not benefited from protection to the same extent ns others.
