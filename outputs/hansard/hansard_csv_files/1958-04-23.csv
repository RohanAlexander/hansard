External Affairs whether he can inform the committees, I point out that the fourth House of the latest developments in concommittee was very important to Australia. nexion with the international conference That committee adopted a definition of the dealing with the law of the sea. Is there continental shelf which would give the any likelihood of agreement being reached coastal state authority and sovereignty out on this subject? Will the Minister take to a depth of 200 metres from its own steps to see that proceedings are not conshores. The proposal was adopted both included if no agreement is reached, but that the fourth committee and at the plenary in some way or other discussions are satissession, and the matter is to be made factorily continued? on the law of the sea has been in progress for a considerable number of weeks and it has still nearly a week to go. It is a very large conference of 87 delegations. The Australian delegation, led by the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Professor Bailey, is a small but strong delegation from the Department of External Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department. Professor Bailey was made chairman of the first committee. That is a most important committee which dealt with the breadth of territorial waters and contiguous zones beyond the outer limit of territorial waters in which the coastal state would have authority and sovereignty over the further space of sea in respect offisheries,customs and the like. Considerable efforts were made by a number of countries to maintain the traditional 3-mile limit for territorial waters, but all these efforts failed. Subsequently, six or seven proposals have been considered, but none of them has achieved the necessary two-thirds majority. At the present time, the most promising proposal is an American one to have a 6-mile territorial limit and a further 6 miles in which the coastal state would have control of fisheries, with a proviso that any country which has been fishing within this outer 6 miles for five years or more would continue to have the right to fish there. That proposal was narrowly defeated in committee, but I understand that the United States of America is proposing to submit it again in substantially the same form to see whether it cannot be agreed to. Australia is very interested, also, in having carried a resolution giving the right of might infringe the territorial sea limit but which were normally used for international navigation. This matter is important to us from a geographical point of view.

The definition would .include the right of .the .coastal state to control pearl-shell fishing, which is satisfactory to Australia. The other committees dealt with matters of lesser importance than the ones I have mentioned. The conference will end next Tuesday, in the ordinary course of events. I certainly endorse what the Leader of the Opposition has said-that it would not be right to allow .the conference to end with no decision being arrived at on the -matter of territorial waters, but that it would be much better for the conference to adjourn so that two-way discussions might take place between a number of countries in order to avoid the inevitable chaos that would result if no resolution were carried with respect to territorial waters; and our delegation has been instructed to that end. We have been in daily touch, by telegram, with Geneva and, of course, in contact at Geneva with all relevant countries in connection with this matter. whether the Commonwealth Statistician has quoted potatoes as being significant in the recent rise in the cost of living, which is reflected at 5s. a week in New South Wales. I ask also whether it is generally known that potatoes are realizing for the farmer, particularly in the Burrawang-Wildes Meadow area, the lowest price since preWorld War II . days, and, in value, probably the lowest price in living memory. Is it a fact that while the farmers are unable to meet the cost of digging potatoes, the only rise that has taken place has been in charges due to high transport, power, and general distribution costs arising from socialist inefficiency in New South Wales, so that the farmer receives only a little more than l i d . per lb. for his potatoes, and the cost to the housewife is 5id. per lb.? ment, either up or down, in the price of potatoes, has always been a very significant factor in the C seriesfigureswhich are used as an index to the cost of living. I suggest, with all due respect, that the honourable member address the latter part of his question to the New South Wales Government. aware of the difficulty that was experienced the House to know that during this financial by the South Australian Government in serving the writ issued by it in connection with the River Murray Waters Agreement and the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme? Does he agree that such a difficulty should not arise? Would it be possible to arrange for some person or persons to accept service on behalf of the 'Commonwealth? Further, in view of the importance of the pending litigation, will the Prime Minister assure this House, and the people of South AustraUa, that his Government will not proceed with the proposed legislation until the court decides the issue raised by the South Australian -Government? service of a writ is -one governed by the normal rules, and the normal rules have, I believe, been observed. The honourable member asked about the Government's intention in relation to the legislation. The Government proposes to proceed with the legislation because it proposes to proceed with the Snowy Mountains scheme. Any delay in the carrying on of the work of the Snowy Mountains scheme, if it is sufficiently protracted, even for a few months, can readily involve the Government, and the people, in the loss of anywhere between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. We are going ahead. addressed to the Postmaster-General. In view of the handsome profit made by the Telephone Branch last year, will it be possible to accelerate work on the installation of new telephones? In supporting my question, I mention that while there has been a gratifying improvement in the position over Australia as a whole, the case of many applicants in newly settled areasand this includes many of my constituents -is still desperate. constantly planning not only to keep pace with current applications, but also to pick up the lag in telephone installations which has developed over a period of years.

12,Mr Davidson,"The department isyear more than 100,000 lines have already been connected, that the number of deferred applications has been reduced by about 26,000, that more than 100 rural automatic exchanges have been installed-the y are essential, of course, for the overall operation, particularly of country services-and that the trunk lines installed this year total about 1,100. So, in this year, as a result of the increased capital made available by the Government to the department in the last Budget, there has been considerable improvement. I thank the honourable member for his mention of that. I assure him that it is the department's desire to continue on that basis so that we may continue overtaking the lag and so that we may also provide in newly settled areas, both industrial and rural, the services that are so badly needed. I can assure him that, consistent with the amount of capital available to the department, which will be determined in conjunction with the demand on the public purse from other instrumentalities, we shall continue with that policy. state whether it is the practice for very important visitors to this country-know n as "" V.l.P.'s ""-to be accommodated at Government House, Canberra, when visiting this Territory? If so, what was the need for renovating, refurnishing and maintaining Kirribilli House, Sydney, at great expense, presumably for the accommodation of VIP.s', when Admiralty House, the Sydney residence of the Governor General, could have been made available for this purpose? Is it a fact that the Prime Minister now regards Kirribilli House as his official Sydney residence? Finally, will the Prime Minister state whether he has continued to collect the £10 10s. per day allowance with which he is provided during his absences from Canberra, for such period as he has been accommodated at Kirribilli House? I had better answer the last bit first because J am sure that it will be a great comfort to the honourable member to know that, although my daily allowance is rather greater than the one that he mentioned, I do not collect it when I am in residence at Kirribilli House. Therefore, I am rather disposed to think that the taxpayer makes a profit on the deal. As to whether there should be such a place as Kirribilli House, the honourable member is the only Sydney man of whom I have heard who does not believe that it is a good idea. The idea that the Governor General's arrangements should be subject to what I believe will be more and more frequent visits from distinguished overseas people is a strange one. No such arrangement obtains in any other country in the world. We decided that it should not obtain here. It is a very good thing for this country that we should be able to give distinguished visitors from overseas, in the largest and senior city of this country, accommodation appropriate to them. whether it is a fact that the New South Wales Government, by legislative action, over-rode the State arbitration court and restored quarterly adjustments to the basic wage. If it is a fact, does this political intervention in the functions of the arbitration court cost the State Government annually approximately an additional £3,500,000 in its payroll? Could not this £3,500,000 be devoted to the needs of State education, and would not this be better than for the State to appeal to the Commonwealth for more funds? the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States is always a very delicate matter, but I think there is very .great substance in the question raised by the honourable member. Obviously, any saving in any direction could be diverted to works within the order of priority which it is the responsibility of the State concerned to determine. inform the House whether the report is correct that the Government is seeking a loan of 25,000,000 dollars on the loan market of New York? If so, what has actuated the Treasurer in turning to this financial centre from which Australia has not sought new money loan accommodation since May, 1928?

The Government, as I think is known, is very actively encouraging manufacturers to engage in further export. There has been magnificent success in this regard in the New Zealand market, and quite notable success has been achieved also in other markets. The Trade Commissioner Service is now very extensive, and devotes much time to aiding manufacturers who desire to sell overseas. The trade commissioners send back to Australia commercial intelligence so that manufacturers may be kept informed of marketing opportunities and the terms upon which business is done in different markets. I think that six trade missions have proceeded overseas in recent times. At present, the honorablernernberfor Darling Downs is leading a trade mission .of some 20 to 30 business men. We have exhibitions at trade fairs. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation has been set up to enable Australian merchants to do business in distant lands when they are not themselves able to predict with certainty that an individual customer will pay, or when they have problems in relation to the currency of a country with which they are trading.

The target date for the nuclear reactor. opening of the project was in June, 1957, since when many months have gone by contract, however, the Commission encountered during which the people of Australia have the been deprived of the benefit of radio isotopes, a by-product of this very important activity. The reactor project was commenced in October, 1955. The contract for its completion was let to Hutcherson Brothers Proprietary Limited, the architects being Stephenson and Turner. I do not doubt that the contractors were most enthusiastic people. We know the type of error which takings, including St. Mary's, this Government persists in giving them the responsiassistance and support of a very large work fortunate in having the enthusiastic support anxiously awaiting the completion of this project. However, despite all the enthusiasm behind the project, the Government has let of Australia generally.

John Mcleay),"The Commonwealth Government-in keeping with its economic policy-reduce d its capital works now responsible, for this work, but he was programme, and, as a result, commencement of construction of the main laboratory buildings was deferred until 1st July, 1956, at the earliest. many hundreds of men involved that he Without these buildings it will not be practicable to operate the reactor at full power, nor adequately to develop the research programme. This will necessitate a large Australian scientific team mention that the retrenchments from this consisting of over 40 chemists, chemical engineers, very important project took place right at metallurgists, physicists, engineers and others, remaining in the United Kingdom at Harwell, where laboratory space is already greatly overcrowded because of the rapidly expanding British programme of research. I do not know what expense is involved in retaining those 40 specialists at Harwell as a result of the Government's failure to provide sufficient funds for this project to continue, but I do know that the number of specialists has sincethis report was prepared. The Public Accounts Committee might well find scope for. its enthusiasm by examining the progress of this report. report continuedTowards the end of May (1956), however, it was necessary to reduce the rate of expenditure, pending a decision by the Government on the funds to be allocated to the Commission for capital works during the financial year 1956-57. This curtailment unfortunately involved retrenchment by the contractor of a portion of his labour force. So it has gone on. Several months before the presentation of the Budget in each of the years involved, the labour force has been' retrenched and work has come to a stand-still, although many people in this House have enthusiastically described the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes as Australia's most important project. As themember for the area in which the reactor is located, I have taken deputations of men to the Minister concerned. First it was Mr Beale, who is now languishing in Washington. expressed their great enthusiasm for the job and their desire to press on with the work. They said that they could keep progress well ahead of the programme if they were given the opportunity to do so. The Government's failure to regulate the available amount of money caused the retrenchments, but it was completely inconsiderate in dismissing a large number of men when the money ran out. Last year, in a similar crisis, when we again ran out of money for this project, I attempted to get a deputation before the Minister for National Development(Senator Spooner), who is so disinterested in the displacement of the refused to see the deputation. This is an absolutely shocking state of affairs. I might the time when there was a serious trend towards unemployment in Australia. If the Government sincerely wanted to do something to arrest unemployment, it could have demonstrated its sincerity in respect of this matter. But the work has stopped, and now only a skeleton force remains on the job. The skeleton force has been used principally in recent months to set the stage for the glamour opening of the establishincreased considerably ment by the Prime Minister last Friday. It is an unfortunate fact that many honourable members were deprived of an opportunity to see the opening of the reactor. The commission's Members from States other than New South Wales were not given invitations to attend. Ten or twelve more employees will be sacked from the reactor project next week, and then there will be hardly anybody lefton the job apart from the scientists and specialists, who are unable to do the work which it was intended they should do. A great deal of the work is uncompleted. A great many things have not as yet been constructed, but I can see that time will not permit me to go right through the list. A short time ago, during the debate on theAddress-in-Reply to the Governor General'.* Speech, I referred to the fact that the physics laboratory had not been commenced. P went on to sayA chemistry and chemical engineering block iswithout equipment, while essential, extensive protective concrete cells are not even under construction. A. lecture theatre to be used for the trainingof atomic scientists has not been comThe men menced. Another incompleted section is the engineeringworkshop and the metallurgy block. There are a number of other important, sections uncompleted. When the Prime Minister went there last Friday, he. was said to be going to open this project. The impression was given to the people of Australia that the Lucas Heights atomic reactor was to be opened, but, of course,, the whole show turned out to be a great political sham.. It was one of the greatest poUtical hoaxes that this country has known. The Prime Minister is reported to have pressed a button in order to put the reactor into motion. All he did, in fact, was to press a buzzer system which called on an operator inside to do the job that the Prime Minister was supposed to be doing. His photograph was taken during the process, and he capitalized to the full on the sideshow of the century. The whole thing was a complete and utter hoax. The real point I want to come to is that the reactor has not reached the stage of completion. It is just ticking over at one watt, instead of at its ultimate capacity of 10,000 kilowatts, or 10,000,000 watts, or, as the electrical people say, 10 megawatts. It is operating at one miserable watt! One newspaper states that the reactor is operating at one-twentieth of a watt at present. The reason for all this shamming is that insufficient funds have been made available. There are many reasons why the reactor cannot be in full operation at the present time. The first is that the temperature control unit has not been completed. I understand that although the boiler installation is near completion, the construction of the pipepriority-to re-employ the labour force line from the power house, about a quarter of a mile away, has not even been commenced. The pipeline will bring steam from the power house to the reactor to operate the temperature control unit. The uranium fuel element storage block has not been completed. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" and the Sydney"" Daily Telegraph"" came out with the announcement that this great reactor is now in operation, but in fact it cannot be put into operation until the storage unit for the uranium fuel elements has been constructed. The effluent disposal scheme is another arrangement which has not been completed. No Government member has come out with a frank admission of this, either in the House or at the opening ceremony. The impression was given that there was nothing further to do so far as the effluent disposal arrangements are concerned. This is a matter concerning thedisposal of radio-active waste, but at present thousands of gallons of effluent are just tipped on to the ground, finding their way under a public road and finishing up in/ scrub country. The very technically desirable effluent disposal arrangements have not been completed. The Prime Minister talked about the emergency control button, known as "" Scram"". He said that he felt like a naughty boy because he was tempted to push it, but if he had pushed the emergency control button it is likely that nothing at all would have happened, because there is no equipment in the emergency control centre. What an incredible state of affairs for a Prime Minister to participate in such a great hoax as this has turned out to be! Frustrated as a result of these things are numbers of highly trained scientists and technicians who want to get on with the job of developing atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to make some contribution to raising the living standards of the Australian people. They sum up the position in this way. They say that if the reactor in its present condition is run at full strength, a highly dangerous situation will develop. If the reactor is not run at a greater strength than one watt, then highly skilled personnel will be left cooling their heels, denied the opportunity to do the worthwhile work for which they have been trained. The answer is to give this project top-line necessary to provide essential safety features and to begin and complete the large number of partially built and uncommenced buildings. The stimulus to Australian living standards which would follow would more than justify such consideration. Jt is a crying shame that the Australian people have been misled in such a deliberate fashionwith regard to this matter. The Labour party is enthusiastic about the project. It will be recalled that it was Labour which first gave some legislative encouragement to this development, when Senator Ashley was the Minister for Supply. The Labour Government of that day made some provision whereby incentives would be given to people, to discover the element on which these great reactors operate. Labourcontinuesto be enthusiastic about the project. We on this side are not prepared to sit silent in the House while the Government continues to misrepresent developments in relation to this matter. A comparison of our progress in this most important scientific field with the progress of other countries shows that the Government stands condemned for its inactivity. member's time has expired.

60,Mr Speaker,-Order! The honourable,21,Atomic Energy
61,Mr Osborne (Evans,"Minister forLucas Heights, near Sydney, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) opened a new reactor established by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. That was a very notable event in the scientific and industrial reactor is new in atomic history? life of this country. We are well accustomed to the use of the emergency procedure by honourable members opposite for the purpose of attempting to make political capital by denigrating the work of the Government, but I do not think we have ever before seen a more mean-spirited or a more improper use of that procedure than on this occasion. The honourable member for Hughes( Mr pleted when the Lucas Heights reactor was L. R. Johnson) began with the charge that the ceremony last Friday at Lucas Heights* was only an electioneering stunt. If a charge of indulging in an electioneering stunt lies anywhere, it lies fairly and squarely on the honourable member himself. He represents the electorate in which this reactor is situated. During recent months he has made one attempt after another to identify himself with publicity relating to the reactor. He has issued statement after statement to the press, but most of those statements have not, so to speak, seen the light of day. The purpose of the statements was obvious to any pressman who glanced through them, so they got nowhere. The honourable member for Hughes has adopted several different attitudes to this matter in recent months. What were his charges? The first was that the Government was insincere in opening the reactor. It was done in the presence of a large and representative body of the scientists and industrialists in this country. experience in the work they are to do in The honourable member was there himself, so he knows what the reaction of those people was. Those who were present at the ceremony, including myself, were well satisfied that a good job had been done by the Atomic Energy Commission, that it had been done fast and well and that the first stages of the operation of an enterprise very important to the Australian people ber tried to make is particularly misleading were proceeding successfully. The next point made by the honourable Government deliberately dismissed workers member was that there had been a delay of from the project, resulting in the work being ten months-that the opening ceremony delayed. That charge is completely false had occurred ten months later than was and has been publicly stated to be false. originally planned. The honourable member What actually happened was that the conquoted from a report of the Atomic Energy tractors, as theyfinishedcertain portions of Commission, not for last year, but for the the work, discharged the men for whom no year before that. Does the honourable further work was available under their member for Hughes take into account the fact that the first decision by the Government to build this reactor was made in September, 1954? Does he realize that the Mr L. R. Johnson -That is all rubbish. ber says that what I have stated is all rubbish. The nearest counterpart to the Lucas Heights reactor is the "" Dido"" reactor built by the British Atomic Energy Commission which, however, was not comcommenced. The honourable member may shake his head and disagree with what I am stating, but I am stating facts. Is it surprising, therefore, that changes of plans have been necessary in the course of development of the reactor? This atomic reactor, which is the latest and most up to date in the world, has been planned and built over a period of four years at a time when techniques in this field are rapidly developing and changing. Had planning in the course of the construction of this reactor not been altered, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission no doubt would have been open to a charge of excessive conservatism in not observing trends in other parts of the world. At the same time, the scientists of the commission who are now, and will be in the future, working on the reactor at Lucas Heights have also been engaged at various atomic energy establishments in the United Kingdom, particularly at Harwell, where they proceeded beyond the stage of gaining Australia. There were able to commence laying the foundations of the research programmes which are being continued at Lucas Heights. It will be seen, therefore, that productive work was proceeding in the field of research before the actual opening of this atomic reactor last Friday. The next point that the honourable memand distasteful. He suggested that the",21,Atomic Energy

The honourable member is aware of those facts because he has made similar charges previously which have been answered by the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) in another place.

As the honourable member has conceded, the main construction of the member for Hughes whether he imagined reactor was carried out by private contracthat a project such as this could suddenly tors who, as they completed their contracts, leap into the full scale of activity expected naturally paid off the men, thus making them available to proceed to other work. the unit to remain inoperative until the The honourable member, however, has not stage of development had been reached at bothered to mention that a total of 400 which it could do all that it will be able to scientific personnel will be employed at do in the future, obviously time would be Lucas Heights, 200 of whom are already on wasted and potential research would not be duty and 200 of whom will be employed as carried out. That is an absurd suggestion time goes on. Yet, according to the Oppoto make. sition, the reactor is not completed.

If honourable members opposite were to criticize the Government at some future stage for not spending this money, perhaps the criticism would be justified. But that is not the position at all. The position is just the reverse of that. I am convinced that the Government is going ahead on this reactor programme and that it will do things in their proper order so that Australia's atomic energy programme may be pushed ahead without delay, and without waste by providing facilities out of order. There is still ample time for a start to be made, for example, on these concrete examination cells to which the honourable member for Werriwa has referred and to have them completed well before they can be used. The Government could be justifiably criticized if it stopped the project dead now and did not go ahead with it, and I would join in that criticism. But I repeat that that is not the position. The Government is being criticized for acting with ordinary prudence. In the early stages, when we wanted to get ahead with the programme as quickly as possible, we had to adopt the cost-plus and other methods of construction which perhaps were not as economical as they might have been but which did have the virtue of getting the essential things done quickly and in time. Now, because we have had those essential things done quickly and in time, the programme can go ahead and we can proceed with the next stages which are not and cannot be needed now, because we cannot run a reactor up to full power immediately. We can proceed with those stages in a more economical way. Only a few months ago, Opposition members were raising the roof about the St. Mary's project being constructed-in their view-in an uneconomical and rushed way, but now they are raising the roof because the Lucas Heights project is not being proceeded with in an uneconomical and rushed way. At Lucas Heights, the Government did exactly the same as it did at St. Mary's; ( Mr Acting Deputy SpeakerMr W. R. it did quickly those things that had to be done quickly. Now that the urgent part is past, it is possible to place proper contracts in order to complete the remainder of the buildings which should and will be completed in accordance with more economical practice. So far from being open to criticism for this line of conduct, the Government has been acting with prudence, and that should commend itself to the House and to the country. Now let me turn to the more serious side of the question. Australia should have a great atomic future, but we will not be able to go into that future if we are to have this silly, captious knocking for political purposes from one side of the Parliament. Let us get together and realize that we have a great opportunity before us. We must undertake not merely research at Lucas Heights but also the development of nuclear power which springs from research and which will be furthered by that research. I believe that a very wise decision was taken at Lucas Heights and that the reactor which was ordered and which has been constructed in record time was the right type of reactor to acquire as an experimental tool. This is the beginning; it is not the end. It is only a small beginning, but it will be developed into a big, constructive programme. But that cannot be done unless there is a willingness to co-operate. This captious criticism, which is made for a political motive by people who fear that their seats may be in danger at the coming election, does not do Australia any good. It is not merely that at Lucas Heights we built this reactor in record time-no t much more than half the time that it took to build a similar reactor in Great Britain Order!

The bill now before the House proposes to amend the Tariff Board Act which, in most important respects, has remained unchanged since 1921. The only important amendment in recent years was in 1953 when the strength of the board was increased to Holt, Harold seven members to enable it to handle an Jack, W.

Honourable members are aware that the board normally Minogue, D . divides into two committees and that the chairman is a member of both committees.

He would, under delegation from the chairman, exercise all the powers, duties and functions of the chairman. He would also act for the chairman in the latter's absence through illness, leave or for any other reason. In some respects, the responsibilities of the chairman, as laid down in the present act, are ambiguous. This is not conducive to efficiency. The chairman must be in a position to co-ordinate the work of the board, and clause 6 of the bill would make him specifically responsible for the administration and general working of the board, as well as for the control and direction of the board's staff.",27,Atomic Energy
73,Motion (By Mr Mcewen),by leave,28,Tarife Board Bell 1958
74,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forAmong other things, he would(i) Decide which members shall take part in any particular inquiry; (ii) Convene meetings and public hearings; and (iii) Decide on the form of minutes and other records to be kept by the board. He would be specifically required, however, to consult the other members, to the extent practicable, before taking decisions on the time and place of meetings and the form of the board's records. When the departmental organization was changed in 1956, the administration of the Tariff Board Act became the responsibility of the Minister for Trade. References iu that act to "" the Minister"" became, by virtue of the Acts Interpretation Act, references to the Minister for Trade. Section 15 of the act lists the matters which may be referred to the board by that Minister. Several of the matters now listed in section 15 are, however, matters which bear directly on the responsibilities of the Minister for Customs and Excise. For this reason, clause 11 of the bill gives to that Minister power to refer to the board(i) certain questions relating to the operation of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act; (ii) certain questions relating to the admission of goods under Customs by-laws; (iii) questions of the value for duty of goods in cases where that value is difficult to arrive at; and (iv) questions of the interpretation of the Customs and Excise Tariffs and the classification of goods under those tariffs. Because the two last-mentioned subjects are matters which are solely the responsibility of the Minister for Customs and Excise, clause 10' of the bill deletes the relevant provisions from, section 15 of the act. As already explained, section 15 covers the matters which may be referred to the board by the Minister for Trade. The present act providesthatat least two, but not more than three, members of the board shall', at the time of appointment, beofficers of the Department of Trade. Suitable officers for appointment to the board; from the Public: Service: are not, however, to befoundi only in> the Department of Trade. Clause4 of the bill, therefore, provides that at least two, but not more than three, members shall, at the time of appointment, be officers of the Public Service of the Commonwealth. An allied amendment is contained in clause 9 of the bill, which will delete the existing provision that one former public servant shall be a member of each committee of the board. This will permit more flexibility in the arrangements for handling the work of the board. The limitation in the number of former public servants who may be appointed to a committee of the board is, however, retained. The remaining amendments to the act which are proposed by the bill are either drafting changes or relate to minor administrative matters. The latter relate to such things as the leave and allowances to be granted to members, the retention by former public servant,? of their existing rights, the presence of the chairman or deputy chairman to be necessary for a quorum of the board, and the control of proceedings at inquiries'. I should like, however, to direct the attention of honourable members to the provisions in clauses 11 and 12 of the bill relating to the tabling of reports made by the board. The act provides that copies of the board's annual reports and of certain other reports by the board shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within seven days of receipt by the Minister or, if Parliament is not sitting, within seven days of the next sitting of the Parliament. The Government Printer has found difficulty in printing copies of such reports within that time limit,, and this has, on at least one occasion, necessitated a typed copy of the report being tabled before sufficient printed copies were available for distribution to honourable members and the general public. Clauses IIand 12 of the bill would alter the time limit to fifteen sitting days for each House. In conclusion, I repeat that the bill arises out of the. Government's efforts to speed up the work of. the Tariff Board and to reduce delays in the consideration of the claims of Australian, industry for adequate tariff protection.. There is one matter relatingto the Tariff. Board's work which is not' covered by the: bill, but whichi I should' like to mention here: because; it has a: considerable bearing on the board's ability to discharge its responsibilities. The board has power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, but its general practice is to rely on the voluntary submission of evidence. The Government appreciates the reasons for the board's reluctance to use its powers in this respect. There have, however, been occasions when evidence has been submitted on a voluntary basis by only a small section of the industry producing the goods to which a particular inquiry related. I am sure honourable members will agree that, in such circumstances, it must be almost impossible for the board to present a balanced report or formulate appropriate recommendations. I mention the matter here to indicate the importance that the Government attaches to the board's receiving adequate evidence on the matters referred to it, and in the hope that it will induce Australian manufacturers and other interested parties to assist the board in this matter. I commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Pollard) adjourned. Motion (by Sir Arthur Fadden) -by leave-agree d toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an the recipient resides to collect its tax in act to amend the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953. Bill presented, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [4.24] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The principal purpose of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Bill is to give the force of law to an agreement entered into last October by Australia and Canada for the purpose of relieving the double taxation on incomes flowing between the two countries. A secondary and minor purpose is to delete from section 16 of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 reference to interest on certain government loans taxable at rates not in excess of 1930-31 rates of tax. Securities bearing this interest are not now held by the public and the reference in the existing law to the interest is redundant. In order to simplify the section, it is proposed to omit reference to this class of interest. The amendment will not apply for past years and will not detract from the rights of taxpayers. The agreement to which it is proposed to give the force of law follows closely the income tax convention entered into with the United States of America and approved by the Parliament in 1953. The broad purposes of the agreement are similar to those adopted in the 1946 taxation agreement with the United Kingdom. Double taxation frequently occurs when income is derived by a resident of one country from sources in another country. Unless the burden of the taxation imposed by two countries is relieved, a serious impediment to international trade and investment may prove detrimental to both countries. Agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States of America have facilitated the investment of capital in Australia, and the development of this country has accordingly been assisted. It was in the light of the experience gained from the operation of these agreements that the Government concluded the present agreement with Canada. In relation to some classes of income, double taxation is avoided by the country in which income arises agreeing to forgo its tax, thus leaving the country in which full. The classes of income to which this procedure will apply are -listed in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. Other income, which constitutes the great bulk of the income flowing between the two countries, may be taxed in both countries. In these cases the country of origin collects its full tax. If the country in which the taxpayer resides also imposes its tax, the agreement places upon that country an obligation to allow a credit against its tax. By this means, the total burden of tax in the two countries is limited to the higher of the taxes imposed by the two countries. The tax on dividends paid by a company resident in one country to a shareholder in the other country is, in the generality of cases, restricted to 15 per cent, of the dividend. This levy is additional to the tax payable on the profits out of which the dividend is paid. In the case of dividends paid",28,Tarife Board Bell 1958
75,Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,"by Australian public companies, all but an insignificant part of the profits at present bears company tax of 7s. 6d. in the £1 before the tax of 15 per cent, is imposed on dividends. Upon reaching the hands of individual shareholders in Canada, the dividends are also liable for Canadian tax, subject to any credit that the Canadian law may permit. In addition to relieving undue double taxation, the agreement permits the taxation authorities of the two countries to exchange information in respect of income tax if the information is required for the operation of the agreement, the prevention of fraud or the administration of provisions against the avoidance of tax. The respective laws of the two countries enforce secrecy in relation to the information exchanged and, in any event, there is an embargo on the exchange of information relating to trade secrets or trade processes. If the bill receives the Royal assent before 1st July this year the agreement will apply in Australia to income derived in the current financial year. Correspondingly, it will apply in Canada for the present taxation year which began on 1st January, 1958. A copy of the agreement is set Out in the schedule to the bill and an explanation of each article will be found in the memorandum circulated. Inquiries received since the signing of the agreement was announced indicate considerable interest in the efforts being made to encourage trade and investment between Australia and Canada. The Government is confident that the agreement will produce results favorable to the Australian economy and to the further expansion of industry in this country. I commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. (UNDISTRIBUTED MONEYS) BILL 1958. agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to provide for the appUcation for the purposes of wheat research of certain moneys held by the Australian Wheat Board. Bill presented, and read a first time. Second Reading. Air) [4.30] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. In the unavoidable absence of the Minister have introduced the bill and make this second-reading speech on his behalf. The bill is intended to provide more money for wheat research. The moneys are the residual amounts left from the war-time wheat pools; they total £284,000. This is money that would have been paid to the growers as payment for wheat acquired by the Commonwealth, if it had been practicable. It has always been recognized that the money belongs morally to the growers; but legally it belongs to the Commonwealth as money received from the sale of Commonwealthacquired wheat. So this bill to appropriate the amount is necessary. The wheat pools concerned are Nos. 2 to 11, covering the seasons from 1938-39 to 1947-48, and the amounts of the undistributable fractions for the pools are£ No. 2 .. 84,743 No. 4 6,677 No. 5 .. 63,004 No. 6 .. 43,937 No. 7 .. 36,234 No. 8 .. 2,553 No. 9 .. 47,270 No. 10 Nil No. 11 Nil 284,418 It will be noted that there is no reference to pool No. 3. That was really a part of No. 2 pool, and is included with it. Pool No. 11 shows no balance, as it was paid out in full, while in the case of No. 10 pool, a balance of £4,000 has been repaid to the Commonwealth against an overpayment that was made to the pool some years ago. The growers wish the money to be used in wheat research, although in the meantime, it has been held by the Australian Wheat Board and has served a good purpose by reducing the interest charge against successive wheat pools. The intention now is to combine this money with the amounts being contributed each season by growers for research. Last year, the Wheat Research Act was passed. That act met the growers' wish that they should be taxed, on their wheat deliveries each season, to provide regular",30,Income Tax International Agreements Bill 1958
76,Motion (By Mr Osborne),by leave,31,Wheat Acquisition
77,Mr Osborne (Evans,Minister for,31,Wheat Acquisition
78,"For Primary Industry ( Mr Mcmahon), I","funds for wheat research. The Wheat -Research Act makes full provision for the use of the money that growers provide, and the amount covered by the present bill will be brought into the same plan. It will be a substantial addition to the regular payments, and good use can be made of it for the benefit of the wheat industry. Naturally, full consideration was given to the method of using the money. Obviously, it could have been given to a federal research body, to a State authority, or to a number of different research organizations. In fact, the advice of the State Ministers for Agriculture, meeting in the Australian Agricultural Council, was sought, tendered, and accepted. The Australian Wheat Board was able to advise on .the division of the amounts between the States. It was calculated according to the deliveries in each State to each pool; and so it gave accurately the share, of each State in the sum available. The Australian Agricultural Council recommended that the amount should be divided on the basis just mentioned, and this is provided for in the bill. The amounts to be paid to each State are set out in the schedule to the bill, and they range from £98,776 for New South Wales down to £95 for Tasmania. Earlier it was said that the present £284,-000 is to be brought under the terms of the 1957 Wheat Research Act. The allocation for each State will be paid into a separate account, and from the account it .will be paid out as approved by the committee for the State. I make it clear that growers will control the disposal of these funds, because wheat-grower members are in the majority on each State Wheat Industry Research Committee. Those members are nominated by the State grower organizations that are affiliated with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. 'Tfoe bill itself is simple. Provision is made authority, .as it was during the war period for aSie Australian Wheat Board to pay the amount ,to Consolidated Revenue. This bill tben provides that the £284,418 is -ajpjwopriated. TJae amount is apportioned among Ike State accounts; and the schedule sets -out the amount to be .allocated to each. That finalizes the pool fractions; but it also starts -something that will benefit the wheat industry for years to come. Unease is :a .great .scope for -research in Australia. The need for it is known and recognized;, and here we are making it possible for more research to be carried out in connection with one of our greatest rural industries. The Minister for Primary Industry is pleased that the stage has been reached of introducing a measure like this. The growers, the States, and the Commonwealth have combined in a worthy cause. All recognize the benefits that have come from the research done in the past. It revolutionized our wheat industry, changed the appearance of the wheat districts, and gave benefit and profit to the whole Australian economy. All recognize the benefits still to come from research in the future; and all are anxious to provide .the money that will ensure progress for the industry. Growers, States and Commonwealth are doing their parts in promoting research. This bill is one part of a big programme for our future benefit, and I know that it will be welcomed. quite true that .not much time is available for honourable members to make a very thorough study of the contents of this measure, but I frankly admit that the second-reading speech delivered by the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne) was notable for its clarity, lt explained very fully the purpose of the bill, and honourable members should be aware that the moneys which are to be appropriated from Consolidated Revenue represent part of the proceeds from the sales of wheat from the pools -which were established and operated 'from 1938-39 to .1947-48 under the Commonwealth's war-time powers. For the benefit of honourable members who may not know, I point out that after 1947-48 wheat was no longer acquired under war-time legislation. Pools have operated since 1947-48, with the exception of two crops after the war-time period, because to-day all of Australia's wheat is marketed by one and for -a few seasons thereafter, but with the difference that to-day the wheat is marketed by a semi-governmental authority on which the wheat growers' representatives form a majority. The flour-millers and employees .are represented also. The authority to market wheat is vested in the Australian Wheat Board by legislation of not only this Parliament but also of the six State parliaments.",31,Wheat Acquisition
79,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [4.37],"It isThe present system differs from the wartime and immediate post-war marketing system' ""of outright acquisition of the whole of the wheat-growers' product. It is quite apparent that iff the marketing of a huge crop, such as wheat, when an authority deals with freights, fares, storage charges and all the other administrative expenses, balances will accrue in the final accountancy, in some cases involving decimal points. In dealing with the distribution of the proceeds of pools the authority is dealing with the proceeds of sales made from time to time. must inevitably come a time when it is very difficult, in finalizing accounts, to obviate fractional balances which are really the property of the people whose product has been, marketed but which it would be manifestly absurd for any authority, government or otherwise, to endeavour to distribute among growers, particularly as a proportion of the proceeds usually does not come in during the growing or marketing year. It would be foolish and futile to attempt to distribute amounts to a decimal point of a penny to the growers concerned. The end result of refraining from any such endeavour has meant that in respect of the series of war-tirne marketing pools and the few pools immediately after the war a balance of £284,000 has accumulated. Morally, this is undoubtedly the property of the wheat-growers, but legally it is the property of the authority which acquired the wheat under war-time legislation. the growers, no matter who acquired it. ber had only listened he would have heard me say that as the wheat was acquired by the authority under the defence powers of the Commonwealth, legally it was the property of the Commonwealth Government. Surely, he does not dispute that. But I said also that, morally, the proceeds from the sale of that wheat were the property of the wheat-growers. This Government, as would any government, recognizes that fact and it is now proceeding to distribute to the industry, but not to the growers, receipts, which have accumulated in the way I have indicated'. I would prefer-as no doubt the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) and the Minister would-that if it were feasible to do so, the actual last penny or decimal point of a penny should be paid to the men who produced the crop. But that would involve huge administrative expenses and all sorts of difficulties. I believe that the wheat-growers, as an enlightened section of the community, appreciate the fact that any government, whatever its party political complexion, which devotes the undistributable proportion of proceeds from the sale of their product to the important purpose of research on behalf of their industry, confers an eminently desirable benefit on them. One could quibble about this type of measure. The Minister told the Parliament to-day that the wheat-growers have agreed to this method of applying this sum of £284,000 for research purposes. But everybody knows that the wheat-growers have not, in fact, been consulted about the matter. All that we can conclude from the Minister's statement is that the executive members of the wheat-growers' organization, after considering this matter and believing that they voiced the wishes of the people whom they represent, have said, "" Go ahead "". of the opinion of the rank and file. is fairly right for this sort of thing to be done, although occasionally it is quite wrong. However, I think it is agreed that this decision is sound and sensible. I have no doubt that many of the growers, the sale of whose product has contributed to this sum of £284,000, will shuffle off this planet before the benefits of its expenditure on research become apparent. Nevertheless, those growers realize that such benefits will be enjoyed by their sons and relatives who will carry on in the industry long after they have left this earthly scene. The Opposition has always advocated research in the wheat-growing industry. Honourable members on this side of the House realize that research which is designed to advance any industry will, directly or indirectly, also foster the welfare of the nation as a whole. Consequently, the Opposition wholeheartedly supports this measure. It is &. happy thought on the part of the industry and the Government.

85,Mr Pollard,"Generally speaking, itthat in which the moneys derived from the tax which growers recently imposed upon themselves are to be distributed. In case the Government should feel that it is pioneering this type of distribution, I shall delve into history and remind the Minister of the wheat pool that operated in Victoria as part of an overall wheatmarketing arrangement during World WarI . Under that arrangement, the Victorian Wheat Board sold a large cargo of Victorian wheat to the Rumanian Government. Unfortunately, so far as I know, the Rumanian Government was never able to pay for that wheat. Certainly, it had not paid for the wheat by 1931. However, each year until 1931, the Rumanian Government religiously paid interest to the Victorian Wheat Board on bonds which it had issued to the Victorian Government, those bonds being of a value equal to that of the wheat it had purchased. Over the years, a substantial sum of money accumulated in the Victorian Treasury from this source. On one occasion, the Victorian Director of Agriculture asked me to sign a certain document. Being of an inquiring, almost inquisitive, turn of mind, I asked what it was all about. He told me that the money involved was revenue that had accumulated from the payment of interest by the Rumanian Government on bonds issued by that government for the supply of wheat during World WarI . When I asked what was being done with the money, I was told that it was put in a trust fund in the Treasury. I said, "" It is time the money was rooted out of the Treasury"". After some investigation had been made, directly interested in the industry but also it was decided that this money should be the economy as a whole. invested in Victoria upon research. As a result, we have to-day at Walpeup one of the best wheat research farms in Australia. the directions in which research work can Its work is devoted entirely to research into be undertaken for the benefit of the comwheat, and its establishment was made posmunity. For instance, an excellent example sible by the expenditure of these accumuof the benefit of research is to be found in lated moneys. I do not think even the the history of the research conducted into honourable member for Mallee( Mr the prolongation of human life. It is due Turnbull) was aware of how that institution mainly to research by persons skilled in came to be established. I have always felt medicine and surgery, over the last 50 years, proud of the part I played in initiating the that the average expectancy of life has been move that resulted in taking that money out increased by approximately fifteen years. of the Treasury and putting it to active work Anything, whether it be legislation or any in the interests of the wheat industry. I other action designed to encourage, extend mention that instance as a previous example and assert the improvement of the conditions of the type of expenditure proposed by the under which the human race lives, is measure under consideration. Although on this occasion the source of the money is different, the principle is similar. As I was pushed off the scene in Victoria, I am unable to say whether the Rumanian Government ever paid its original obligation. The Opposition wishes this measure well. We support it ardently. We feel sure that the allocation of this money to the respective States for utilization in a manner similar to that in which the moneys provided under legislation passed recently are to be used will do much to develop research work calculated to benefit this industry. There is great need for this research work. It is said by some that Australian wheats are not all that they ought to be. When that assertion is made, I always reply that it cannot be said that any wheats produced anywhere are all that they ought to be. Despite what may be said to the contrary, I hold the view that Australian wheat has many qualities which are not possessed by wheats produced in other parts of the world. For instance, it is true that Canadian wheat has certain virtues, but it lacks certain other qualities possessed by Australian wheat. I feel that it can be said with truth that there is room for improvement in all wheats. For example, there is great need for research into the development of varieties suitable for certain climates. There is great need for research into the development of varieties which are resistant to certain diseases that attack wheat at the moment and which will be resistant to other diseases that might attack them in future. Anything that ! can be done in these directions is a worthy contribution to the welfare of not only those I do not suppose there is any limit to heartily welcomed by the Opposition as something really worthwhile. We welcome the bill and support it strongly. shall be very brief on this occasion, for all I wish to do is compliment the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) upon the explanation that he has given of the bill, supplementary to the explanation given by the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne), on behalf of the Minister for Primary Proreading speech. There is no doubt that the bill meets with the approval of all honourable members. I do not think it likely that any honourable member will oppose the legislation, either during the debate or when the measure is put to the vote. I take it that the moneys involved are to be distributed in the same way as the profits from the sale of wool by the Joint Organization were distributed when the owners could not be found. Legislation similar to this was passed for that purpose. I should like to express one hope at this juncture. I hope that the Government will be able to get operating as quickly as possible the committees that are being set up in the States for the purpose of conducting research into the wheat industry. I understand that at the moment some difficulty is being encountered in setting up these committees in some States. The bill is a good one for, as was ably pointed out by the honourable member for Lalor, research into the development of the wheat industry is necessary. The higher the standard we can develop, the better it is for the community and the nation. one aspect of the bill which can be stressed with advantage at this stage. As the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne) has so ably explained, the bill provides for the payment of £284,000 which is at present held in reserve and which cannot be distributed without legislative authority. It is money derived from the sale of wheat which was compulsorily acquired during the war period. The money is to be paid by the Australian Wheat Board to the Treasury, and from the Treasury into a wheat research trust fund, which was set up by this Parliament under the Wheat Research Act. From that fund, moneys will be paid to the States in accordance with a formula based on deliveries of wheat in each State to some nine pools. Western Australia's share will be £50,477. The feature that I wish to highlight is that this is another instance of a self-imposed tax. Wheat-growers set a splendid example in this respect when the Wheat Research Act was first introduced. Under that legislation, the growers agreed to impose upon themselves a tax for the purpose of financing research into ways of improving both their product and their industry. Although, as the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has said, each individual wheat-grower who is concerned in the distribution of this amount has not been consulted in connection with it, the leaders of the wheat-growers' associations have been consulted and have intimated that this is the way in which this money should be used. It would not have been possible to have consulted all the wheat-growers concerned. I feel on safe ground when I say that had the Government, even without consulting the wheat-growers' representatives, decided on this course of action, it would have received the approval of the wheat-growers because they are determined to take all measures possible to discover ways of improving their industry and its product. This is a matter which needs finalizing at this stage because it can be accepted, and it should be accepted, as an example to the rest of the community and to other industries. Earlier this week, in this House, I had occasion to say that the remarks that are so often passed concerning the need to improve efficiency in primary industries in order to meet world competition, could well be applied to other industries. Certain industries, instead of seeking protection from competition, and instead of seeking handouts from other people so that they may continue to make profits, should themselves try to discover how they can produce more efficiently and effectively and improve their products in order to meet overseas competition. If those other industries, particularly secondary industries, were to adopt the principle that is so generously adopted by a section of the community which has not very much reason to say "" Thank you "" for the treatment that it has received generally, there would not be so much need for the Government and the",33,Wheat Acquisition

As the honourable member for Lalor has said, this is not a contentious measure but it is one that can be hoisted to the highest point of the mast as an example of the self-sacrificing endeavour on the part of a section of the community which is desirous of helping itself instead of asking the Government to help it. I support the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed pro forma; progress reported. Message recommending appropriation reported. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr Osborne) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to provide for the application for the purposes of wheat research of certain moneys held by the Australian Wheat Board. Resolution reported and adopted. In committee: Consideration resumed. Clauses1 to 3-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause4 (Board to pay certain undistributed moneys to the Commonwealth). 4 there is a reference to the undistributed fractions that are responsible, of course, for the accumulation of this great sum of money. I speak at this moment only to direct the attention of the industry to the fact that had it not been for acquisition and the system of marketing introduced at the direction of the Commonwealth Government, during the war, there could not have been any fractions available for return to the wheat-grower or for research. A similar situation will, of course, arise under the present scheme of stabilization and marketing under State and Commonwealth legislation. I remind wheat-growers and members of Parliament that under the old order of things, in peace-time, all the fractions went into the pockets of those who dealt and speculated in wheat. Any moneys required for research came, not from the industry, but from the general taxpayers. Little research work was done, but some of it was very good. However, it was not the wheat-grower who gained the benefit from the funds provided by the taxpayer. The only persons who gained the benefit and who pocketed the fractions were the wheat dealers and speculators of this country and of other countries who came here to buy wheat. It should be remembered that under the present type of marketing, to which this bill does not specifically refer, the same situation could arise. It should be always remembered that in marketing under governmental authority and in organized marketing provided for in subsequent legislation, the fractions all go into the pockets of the wheat-growers and not into the pockets of the middlemen. I shall leave it at that. I thought that this was an appropriate occasion to remind the industry that it should never relinquish that which has been won and that which was pioneered by a Labour government. am tempted to say a few words in view of the remarks made by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). I agree with him to the extent that some fractions might have gone to the dealers in wheat who also gained the benefit of the increase in the weight of wheat during its carriage from Australia to its destinations on the other side of the world. I am reminded, however, that a long time before these fractions were made possible by legislation Western Australian wheat-farmers were successfully engaging in a voluntary wheat pool. The honourable member for Lalor shakes his head in dissent. He will remember, I think, that one of the reasons for the establishment of the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank was an endeavour to finance that voluntary wheat pool in Western Australia. He will also remember that, as a result of the experience gained during that period, when the last war broke out two men who had been closely engaged in conducting the wheat pool in Western Australia were co-opted by the Commonwealth to help in the handling of wheat, not only Western Australian wheat, but Australian wheat generally. These two men were John Thompson and Sir John Teasdale. monwealth pool then. I remind the honourable member, with",35,Wheat Acquisition

I hope that this system will continue in existence so that in future more fractions can go to wheat research, not only to benefit the farmers as a result of the experience gained but also to benefit the community because, Sydney by and large, under this organized marketing principle the community has benefited. seem more interested in investing their money Clause agreed to.

As the Ninth Annual Report of the Australian is his usual custom-and I am certain that Broadcasting Control Board, and the extent to which the newspaper combines have control of this additional means of disseminating mass information is quite readily seen there. The holdings are very substantial in practically every existing television station. The lists give the names of the combines and the number of shares I join issue with the that is held by each. They give the direct We believe that it is wrong that this means of disseminating public information should be held as it is held by the newspaper combines. It is interesting to quote from the fortnightly journal, "" Broadcasting and Television "" which, in an editorial published in its issue of 6th September last year, in discussing frequency modulation broadcasting, had this to sayMost significant aspect of the FM inquiry in was the intense interest shown by newspaper companies in entering the field.

The honourable member for Mackellar",36,Wheat Acquisition
93,Mr Pollard,I did not say that.,37,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
94,Mr Hamilton,"he will not mind my saying this, although he is not in the chamber at the momenthe devoted the time at his disposal to an attack on the Labour party. I have heard a great number of speeches made by the honourable member for Mackellar, and they disclosed that, practically without exception, he seems to follow the precept that the best defence is attack, and devotes his time to a constant and continuing attack on the Labour party and its members. I think that there was one notable exception to this, when he made a speech dealing with the need for a unified rail gauge in Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar referred quite definitely to the possibility of Labour's returning to the treasury bench in this Parliament. He referred to it as a remote possibility, but his words showed a really urgent fear that the return of Labour to the treasury bench was much more imminent than he would really wish to convey to the Parliament. It may be that he has the ability, as he has demonstrated before, to read the writing on the wall and that he seeks to prepare for the change that will take place. When the honourable member spoke of the necessity for amending sections 86 and 87 of the principal act-whic h are the sections providing for the revocation and suspension of licences-h e spoke of it because, he said, he feared a misuse of those powers by a future Labour government. I shall quote from the honourable member's remarks as reported on page 1115 of ""Hansard"" of 22nd April. He said. . . as it happens, the power to control radio and television is inherent in the Federal Government, and if, by any evil chance, a Labour Governfor Mackellar hates socialism so much, let ment should come in at some far distant time, it would not scruple to use that power to develop a permanent totalitarian monopoly of the sources of information. Labour has tried to do thai before. Those are the words used by the honourable member for Mackellar. I remind the honourable member and any other honourable member who may hold similar ideas, or may, at this stage, express similar ideas, that when Labour was in office, with majorities in both Houses of the Parliament, it did none of the dreadful things forecast and feared by the honourable member for Mackellar and those who speak in a similar strain. If there is a danger in the provisions of the act it is, in my view, in the possibility that by some misfortune an honourable member of the outlook of the honourable member for Mackellar will be appointed to a future Cabinet and be entrusted with the administration of the act. Mr J. R. FRASER I agree with my friend from Grayndler who made that pious ejaculation. The honourable member for Mackellar, I think, should be reminded that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a completely socialized institution. It was established by the State, it is controlled by the State and it isfinancedby the State. It has no need to compete for business or for listeners. It has no need to make profits and no need to pay dividends. Indeed, it has no shareholders to whom it must report. ship. Mr J. R. FRASER -Yes, it has no private censorship. The honourable member for Mackellar should remember that this socialized institution was established by a non-Labour government, a government of the complexion of that which now occupies the treasury bench and to which the honourable member sometimes gives his support. He should have remembered, when he was dealing with certain action taken by the well) during the years of war, that it was a Country party Postmaster-General, using the powers of the act which we are now debating, who put radio station 2KY off the air and kept it off the air for several days. Where power has been misused, it has not been by a Labour administration or a Labour Minister. If the honourable member us ask him what he would do with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, this completely socialized institution set up by an anti-Labour government. Would he sell it? Would he hand it over to a newspaper combine, perhaps appointing Mr Frank Packer as managing director or chairman of directors of the company? I should like now to refer to television services in this country. I am one of those who, when the introduction of television was being discussed in this House, rose in their places and opposed it. I opposed it because I had a very real fear of the effect that television would have on the children and young people of this country. I think that fear",37,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

97,Honourable Member For Melbourne ( Mr Cal,"has been largely justified, and in this regard I remind honourable members of the programme examples given by the honourable member for Melbourne last night. I opposed the introduction of television on the further ground that there was no public clamour for it at the time. Honourable members of the Country party also opposed the introduction of television services because they felt-and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Minister himself opposed it on these grounds-that there was a greater need to press on with the extension of telephone services in the country areas than to bring television services to the crowded cities of the Commonwealth. That view, I believe, was held quite properly by the Country party at that time. I repeat that I feared the effect that teleAdelaide and Hobart may well involve the vision would have on the children and young people of to-day. For that reason I opposed its introduction. Now television is here. It is already established in two of the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and there is not the slightest doubt that there is now a public clamour for the extension of television services. I do believe, however, from my own viewing of television, that there is a real reason to fear the effect that the type of programmes now being shown will have on the minds of young children and adolescents. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in his speech last night, spoke of the kind of so-called entertainment that is being shown by both national and commercial stations. grammes from America. Mr J. R. FRASER -That is so. Of course, there are similar programme problems in that country, where television stations are showing cowboy pictures seventeen years old. I , personally, do not mind cowboy pictures; what I object to are programmes depicting stabbings and other brutalities such as were mentioned last night by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. There is, however, a real demand for the and to say whether the estimates that I have extension of television services. The Postbeen given could be correct. I repeat that master-General has indicated the way in my information is that with the extension of which these services will be extended.

Perth, Adelaide are quite adequate and that television and Hobart, followed by an extension of antennae could easily be erected on the services to the larger country centres. I existing masts-w e could have a repeater regret that the Minister has not been more definite in setting out the stages in which this progression will take place. When he is replying on this bill he may, perhaps, feel inclined to be more definite than he has been in replies that he has given in this chamber and in another place. I assume, from the remarks of the Minister, that he includes Canberra, the National Capital, in the larger country centres that he has mentioned. It also appears that the plans for extended television services provide for two stations in this National Capital. I assume that one of them will be a national station and that the other will be operated by commercial enterprise. It seems to me that the establishment of television services in the capital cities of Brisbane, Perth, Commonwealth, or those establishing the services, in very considerable expenditure. I suggest, however, that we should not delay the introduction of television services to Canberra because of considerations of expense, nor should we put those considerations forward as a good reason for delaying the introduction of television here. I am not in any way an expert on electronics, but I have been told by persons who are knowledgeable in this field that with the extension of the microwave radio link from Goulburn to Canberra, and the use of existing buildings and existing transmission masts, a national television service, a relay or repeater station, could be established in this city for as little as £5,000. This estimate envisages, of course, a low-powered station I think a half-kilowatt station. This would give adequate service to the National Capital and the adjacent town of Queanbeyan, and would possibly enable programmes to be received on the outskirts of Yass. No excuse of expense can, therefore, be put forward for failure to introduce television services in the National Capital. The Minister may be able to disprove the figures that I give. I should like him to refer to them when he replies in this debate,",38,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
98,Mr Duthie,"They show cast-off prostation broadcasting, the programmes of Sydney stations for as little as £5,000. I am also told that, in the same way, with the extension of the microwave link and the use of existing buildings and transmission masts, we could establish in the National Capital an initiating television station for as so on, according to the policy that is little as £20,000, and that if it were necessary to provide separate buildings, mobile trucks and certain other equipment, this could be done for as little as £50,000. If the figures given to me are correct, it is quite clear that those who are now resident in the Australian Capital Territory, and those who are soon to be transferred here from a city in which they already have television services, could be provided with television here for a cost that is practically negligible. I hope the Minister will have something to say on this aspect of the matter when he replies in this debate. get bad programmes, too. Mr J. R. FRASER -The programmes, in my view, are bad, but the fact is that people here are demanding television services. Perhaps that fact is worth bringing to the notice of the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall), who is now in the chamber. I understand that many of those who are scheduled to be transferred here from Melbourne are reluctant to leave the fleshpots of that city, one reason being that the television sets on which they have spent large sums of money, and which have become part of their family lives, will be of no use to them when they come here in 1959, unless the Postmaster-General is able to arrange for the provision of television services here. artist shows here than in Melbourne.

It seems to me that, in have been admirable indeed, and have given large measure, the commission is in the same position as the large newspaper organizations. Editors and sub-editors who are handling a large amount of news fed to them from outside services quite naturally tend to re-write, to head up and followed by the proprietors of their newspaper. I very much fear that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in its handling of news services and news commentaries, is affected by a certain timidity a reluctance to say or do anything that might give offence to the government of the day. mercial broadcasting stations like that. Mr J. R. FRASER -That may be so. I repeat, it is not the fault of the news gatherers. I do not suggest that it is even implemented as an actual policy, but rather by means of inter-office memo, by casual conversation in the news room and so on, in order to tone down what might be critical of the Government, and so avoid offending, those who are providing the wherewithal. I believe that the commission is extremely sensitive to criticism and I would suggest, that, so far as the news services, and the news commentaries in particular, are concerned, it would be better not to have quite so many academicians handling the commentaries but, instead, more competent,, trained journalists-me n with keen minds,, who know what news is, know how to. present it and know how to interpret it. I really believe that that would lead to a great improvement in the news commentaries. Perhaps some of the forums also could be a little more daring, and put men on the air who will express a forceful point: limitations such as I have mentioned.

101,Mr Duthie,"There are one or two coma great fillip to the cultural pursuits. However, I suggest that it has been done at the expense of the variety programmes. Although the commission, as a socialized institution financed by the Government and responsible to the Government, has no need to woo its listeners, no need to show a profit, no need to pay dividends, there is, I suggest, a real need for it to compete actively with what other stations are offering; that it should aim at drawing at least 50 per cent, of the listening public. Although its work is extremely valuable in the fields that I have mentioned, it cannot really achieve its full purpose unless it attracts to its beams the great majority of the listening public. Some of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's programmes are really excellent, indeed, and there are some men who stand out in the field of light entertainment -me n like Reg Adams, with his programme in the morning, "" Yours' For the Asking "", or his much earlier programme, "" Music Bright and Early"" or, as he says, "" Much too early "". There is Russ Tyson and his breakfast session, and "" Hospital Half Hour"". There is the children's session, conducted by that famous Scotsman, MacTavish, who has been conducting it for years; the "" Country Hour ""; the "" Kindergarten of the A i r "" , and the women's sessions. Those sessions really come up to the standard of commercial programmes and really compete, but in the main the Australian Broadcasting Commission is not competing with other stations. It is dropping behind in the race. It should aim at getting at least 50 per cent, of the listening public, so that its valuable work can really achieve widespread results. Of course, in the ultimate, if the commission is not attracting listeners to its programmes, if it is beaming programmes that are above the heads of the listening pubhc, it might as well not be on the air at all. I hope that some of the money now being expended on classical programmes-o n programmes that could be classed as highbrow-wil l be devoted to the variety and light programmes. It is tragic to listen to some of the programmes that are broadcast in the name of variety. The only worthwhile variety programmes are those which are first put over the air by the British Broadcasting Commission. F.2286/5S -[44 ] Show ""? Mr J. R. FRASER I must admit that while I was speaking to my younger brother in Hobart last night I heard the bells ringing and said, "" I must go into the House "". My brother said, "" Will it be broadcast? "" I said "" Yes "". He said "" I might as well listen to it. I have just been listening to the other Goon Show "". The programmes to which I have referred are the only worthwhile variety programmes put over the air by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Much more money should be spent on script-writers. 1 am certain that we have the actors and performers, but I am equally certain that you cannot hope to produce a lively and bright variety show unless you are prepared to pay a salary that will attract the really competent, brUliant and witty script-writer of the kind that writes the shows of the British Broadcasting Commission, which is so pre-eminent in this field. In the minute or two left to me, I should like to say that it seems to me that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board acts in such a way as to give protection to the vested broadcasting and television interests. I say that for this reason: From time to time we have heard tributes to the pioneers of the broadcasting field-men who started on a shoe-string, worked hard to attract advertising sponsors, and finally made a success of their business venture. That cannot, of course, be done to-day because the Australian Broadcasting Control Board requires that certain conditions shall be complied with before any one is granted a licence to establish a broadcasting station. The first requirement is that a frequency channel shall be available. That is understandable. What is not understandable is the refusal of the board to give further consideration to the European practice of reducing the separation in kilocycles per second from the standard ten, used here and in the United States of America, to nine used in Europe.

102,Mr Stewart,"Such as the "" Goonbeen clearly established by a careful engineering survey of the area concerned; (c) the ability of the proposed station to earn sufficient income to permit of its satisspacing between stations of 10 kilocycles per factory operation in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 19421934 has been established; (d) the effect of the operation of the proposed station on the existing stations has been Copenhagen List of which the Minister for determined; (e) the suitability of the applicants to provide a broadcasting service for the locality has been established; (f) generally, the licensing of the proposed station is, in the widest sense, in the public interest, having regard, in particular, to the broadcasting services already available. Those conditions are a complete bar to the man who has technical knowledge, ability and enthusiasm to enter into this business as has been done in the past with stations that already exist. Those conditions mean that the only man who can enter the field of broadcasting and television is one who has considerable capital behind him. The actual result will be that the combines and the big companies that are already interested will monopolize those fields. There are country areas in Australia into which broadcasting services could well be extended by a re-arrangement of the broadcasting band. I repeat that I am not an expert on these matters, but I have had expert advice which suggests that the spacing between stations of ten kilocycles per second is more than the separation required. It leads to sloppy broadcasting. No commercial broadcasting station needs anything like that spacing to give sharp and clear reproduction. If we did examine again the possibility of reducing the spacing to nine kilocycles per second, as is done in Europe, more than the present 150-odd stations could be fitted into the existing broadcast band. I do not think that difficulties of this sort should be placed in the path of those who wish to enter this field. We pay tribute to the pioneers of the past, but we are killing any opportunity for pioneers to start again in this field. That proposition was put to the previous Postmaster-General and an answer was subsequently given by the present occupant of that office in the following terms:The possibility of using 9 kilocycles a second separation between stations in Australia has been examined but has been rejected as not being in the best interests of Australian listeners. It is of interest also that, despite the large number of stations in the United States of America, the second has been maintained. I repeat that in the list available in publications from overseas, particularly the the Interior( Mr Fairhall) would have knowledge, it is stated that satisfactory broadcasting is obtained with a separation of nine kilocycles a second. I believe the Australian Broadcasting Control Board should examine this matter again because, with the improved techniques and equipment available to-day, surely sharp broadcasting could be obtained without the spacing between stations that is followed in Australia to-day. measure that is before the Housea bill to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1956-is , in the words of the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson), who introduced it, more or less a machinery measure. Therefore, I do not propose to discuss it in detail; but I take advantage of this opportunity, as has been done by other speakers, to say a few words about television services and their administration and the general conduct of this great medium of publicity. I should say at the outset that a significant feature of this Parliament has been the lack of desire on the part of Government members to defend their legislation. This afternoon I have been called upon to speak directly after another member of the Australian Labour party because honourable members on the Government side are not prepared to defend this legislation as they should do. They realize that the criticism that is levelled at them by the Opposition is difficult to answer. I am not worried about the responsible Ministers. They alone on the Government side know anything about these matters and do not care to speak. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver), who has been interjecting persistently, probably has not been told anything about the provisions of this measure. Therefore, with other supporters of the Government, he sits on a back bench, while this important subject of television is under discussion, like one of the hillbillies whom we see constantly on the television screen. I am not surprised",41,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
103,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [5.38],"Th ethat the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce), who will follow me, did not want to precede me. He knows very well that he would come under strong criticism from me and he seeks to dodge it. I mention these matters because supporters of the Australian Labour party are opposing this measure, as was stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) in a splendid speech last night. The Opposition is opposing this measure for the same reason that it opposed the original act. I shall not go into the lengthy amendment that was submitted previously by the Opposition and which was read by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night. He made it clear to the people that this great medium of publicity should be under government control. I was interested to receive and read a document relating to television services generally, and I want to refer to one aspect of its contents in order to clarify the position of the Australian Labour party on the issue of television which is so important to the people. In its 1955 report, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board statedTelevision is so effective as a medium that a wrong use of it would do tremendous harm, especially in the early stages before any. local stanLimited, Email Limited, G. B. S. Falkiner, dard of taste has been set, and the very novelty of the medium will encourage the viewer to look at anything. Television, on the other hand, can confer real benefits on the Australian people. Whether it does or does not will depend on the standards demanded at the start, and the willingness of the licensees to accept their responsibilities and to develop their services with proper regard to the public interest and an appreciation of the privileges conferred on them by the grant of a licence. That view was endorsed by those who gave evidence to us on behalf of applicants for licences for commercial television stations. All these witnesses agreed that the privileges which will be enjoyed by the successful applicants for T.V. station licences will be very great, and licensees should, therefore, have no reluctance to comply with the high standards which will be required. For those reasons, among others, the policy of the Australian Labour party includes nationalization of radio services and television. We believe that this medium of publicity has such far-reaching effects upon every section of the community that, in the public interest, it should be under national control and under the control of the people's representatives. What do we find to-day? As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has stated, the Government has set up in business with television licences the huge newspaper monopolies and combines. Since this Government came to office, every section of the community has come jto realize that, in all spheres of industry, monopolies have grown bigger and bigger. That has been one development under the Menzies-Fadden Government. The annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ended 30th June, 1957, gives, at page 29, a list of companies which have been granted licences for television stations. They include: Amalgamated Television Services Proprietary Limited, licensee of Station ATN, Sydney, whose shareholders include the Sun-Herald-2UE Group-Associate d Newspapers Limited, John Fairfax and Sons Proprietary Limited, Radio 2UE Sydney Proprietary Limited; the John FairfaxMacquarie Group-includin g John Fairfax and Sons Proprietary Limited and 2GB Macquarie-Artransa; and the 2GB-Macquarie-Artransa Group. The shareholders of Amalgamated Television Services Proprietary Limited also include the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Group, including Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) W. H . Paling and Company Limited, Australian United Investment Company Limited and the Australian Record Company Limited. All of these are just battling companies with interlocking directorates which control the destinies of the people in the television field. A little later, it is stated that shareholdings are held in Television Corporation Limited, licensee of station TCN, Sydney, by Consolidated Press Limited, Associated Newspapers Limited, England, Philips Electrical Industries Proprietary Limited, Broadcasting Station 2SM Proprietary Limited, and Paramount Film Service Proprietary Limited. Examining the position in Melbourne, we find that shareholdings are held in General Television Corporation Proprietary Limited, licensee of Station GTV, Melbourne, by Electronic Industries Limited-the Honourable Sir Arthur Warner is a prominent figure in the Liberal party and industries associated with this company-David Syme and Company Limited, Hoyts Theatres Limited, Greater Union Theatres Proprietary Limited, and Nilsen's Broadcasting Service Proprietary Limited. Shareholdings are held in Herald-Sun TV Proprietary Limited, licensee of Station HSV, Melbourne, by Herald and Weekly Times Limited, and Associated Newspapers Limited, London. So we see again how this monopoly of newspapers, film interests and others have added to their great wealth, power and influence over the Australian people by being granted by a benevolent government through its instrumentality, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, these licences which confer power, as claimed in evidence before the royal commission, to change the lives and the destinies of people throughout the length and breadth of this country. Last night, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), said that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board intends to set up 42 new channels in New South Wales, two in Canberra, 26 in Victoria, twenty in Queensland, twelve in Western Australia, ten in South Australia, and eight in Tasmaniaa total of 120 new channels. Are they to be granted to the huge newspaper monopolies in these States so that the conditrol press publicity and this medium of tions we have seen will continue? Will the Labour party be given one of the licences? I think not! This Government seeks to tie up political control as well as newspaper control through its friends that give out these licences to the vested interests mentioned in the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. It will be found, for instance, that there will be a further expansion of private enterprise into these avenues of publicity and these mediums of influence far beyond anything that should be permitted people with no responsibility or no rights in respect of this great medium of publicity. It is well, Mr Speaker, to bear in mind the growth, under a benevolent government, of this monopoly which means so much and affects the people so greatly. Why, for instance, was not the "" Daily Mirror"" given a licence at one time if the Government seeks to give licences to newspapers? It was for one reason only: The proprietor of that paper, Mr Ezra Norton, is at times somewhat critical-and rightly so-of the collection of incompetents who make up the Government. They do not like criticism. They realized the value of television and, therefore, they were determined not to give the medium to newspaper proprietors who might use it in the public interest by presenting impartially to the people the shortcomings of the Administration in Canberra. There is a dangerous trend in our nation. It is dangerous when interests can be given control over a huge medium of publicity whilst the Government sits idly by. Its members will not get up and defend the legislation, yet they seek to give this great power and influence to people with no responsibility, as they have done in banking and industry and other things in order that the monopolists may be served in preference to the people of this country. These are matters that might well be considered by all and sundry because whilst to-day the Government thinks they do not matter a great deal, an additional 120 licences, when they are given out, will have a great effect on all sections of the Australian people. It should therefore be realized that the Postmaster-General and those who sit behind him are responsible for the granting of licences; they have been given to the newspaper monopolies, those who conpropaganda in Australia. As you know, Mr Speaker, those licences affect every section of the people, and when you realize that to-day there are over 200,000 television sets in Australia, that in America four out of five people own television sets, you will realize the power that is given to private interests. It need not be said that the Labour party is the only one that believes in the nationalization of this service. Great churchmen have spoken on this problem and mentioned it in evidence before the royal commission that was set up on this matter. They pointed to the need for the nation to control this medium of publicity through its government, the elected representatives of the people. We find, as the honourable member for Melbourne said last night, that in all spheres of activity associated with television, from the granting of the licences to the manufacturing side as well as the propaganda side, monopolists are taking control. As he said, in 1957 there were 23 manufacturers of television sets in Australia; by the end of this year, there will probably be only six or seven left. I shall leave that point, as my time is somewhat limited, but I should like to reiterate that the nationalization of television services in our time will prove to be the only effective way in which this great modern medium of propaganda may be administered in the interests of the Australian people. 1 say quite frankly that I like television. I have seen it in America and in Great Britain and I realize its importance and the great things that can come from it. In this country of ours with but a limited sphere of activity so far despite what has been done by those monopolists who control it, there is the average session that is well worth looking at and well worth enjoying. I enjoy, for instance, hearing the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other people as they have appeared in "" Meet the Press"" and other sessions of that nature. I think there are great things that can be brought to the people by television, but at the same time, I am not unmindful of the fact that many of the programmes require continued supervision and that something should be done to improve them. Last night, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other speakers dealt with a number of programmes. I am concerned with the programme situation because I think it is vital that in television we should give preference to our own artists. We should see that the people have Australian productions by Australian artists. What is urgently needed in this country is an Australian sentiment in the production of entertainment. nothing against the American productions; they probably suit the American people. Many people here probably like them, too, but there is no reason why the television screens in this country should be cluttered up with the American type of hill-billy programmes, crime programmes and other things, when there are many stories that could be written about the development of this great nation which could be provided entertainingly, effectively, and educationally by Australian artists employed in this great industry, thus bringing some form of benefit to the country. But what do we find? billy programmes. starts, the members of the Australian that on ABN, the national station channel Country party will all be in business, and the honourable member will be a top-line artist. Mr Speaker, I think, quite modestly, that, having had a look at a few of the hill-billy sessions on television and realizing that some artists from overseas are evidently getting high-class fees for appearing in these productions, I would be worth a fair amount of money on television in comparison with them. It is said in this country that our programmes are quite satisfactory, that you need to have a bit of crime, a bit of murder and a few other things which appeal to the public taste. As is always the way, people who are connected with great mediums of propaganda or banking for profit do not give a hang about what happens to the average section of the community. Private banks are in business to make money; they care not who goes to the wall; and the private interests controlling television stations do not care much what the public are seeing as long as the people will look at the programmes and they can sell their advertising space. sold at £32 a minute. says there were 32 murders £32 a minute. will be frank. I knew from the outset that I have the honourable member was underestimating the murders. Let me refer again to something that is worth reiteration. It is contained in a document that was forwarded to me and to other members of this Parliament by the Australian Television Rights Council. A survey was made of what was taking place in respect of television licences. It has been quoted in this House before. It is significant that the press of this country, with one exception, that controls the television stations of Australia, leave out these facts when they are presented in the Parliament. A survey was taken by competent listeners in Sydney a few months ago. I know that the position has not changed a great deal because I watch .television occasionally when I get time away",42,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

109,Mr Daly,"Oh! £32 a minute. I2, there were nine stabbings, three strangulations, one attempted murder, one wounding, one suicide, three murders discussed and one murder demonstrated. That is a fairly good proposition from the national station. I have details of programmes shown by ATN, a commercial station. Government supporters have heard this before, and they do not want to hear it again, because it is dynamite. This is the type of programme that the Government is sponsoring in this country, while all the time it is talking elsewhere about cultural development. Channel 7, which is operated by the huge monopolies I mentioned a moment ago, showed six bashings, one maiming, eight brawls, one blinding, one armed robbery, eleven murders, two woundings, two killings, eighteen corpse's and one scene where a child described how both his parents were murdered. Another commercial station, operating on Channel 9, showed two bashings, three brawls, four murders, one maiming, one armed robbery, one assault, two stranglings, one wounding, two attempts to murder a child, and a dope fiend showing his dope needle marks, and discussed four murders. This was the language which was used to enlighten the people and improve their English : "" A dirty double-crosser""; "" I'll get that mug""; "" Let's go find a sucker""; "" I'll blow your brains out""; "" Shoot 'em in the stomachthey take longer to die that way "". Dozens of somewhat similar expressions were used. These took place over a period of ten hours.

Why is this Government not in the production of programmes that are doing what the people want it to do? Why in keeping with Australian sentiment and is it not employing artists and actors in outlook. Instead of using the medium of order that real Australian pictures and entertainment, expressing true Australian sentiment, may be presented? It is said that we have an Australian board which will watch these matters. Let us have a look at what has happened in other places where all kinds of boards are also looking after such things. In Los Angeles, where a board controls radio and television, in a single week 228 murders, 357 attempted murders, eleven gaol breaks, 93 kidnappings, and three cases of branding with hof irons were televised. Of these crimes, 72 per cent, were shown in children's programmes. Probably the whole of those programmes will be sold out here on a canned basis, while Australian artists are walking the streets. It is idle to say that these programmes will not be foisted on to us by private enterprise. Private enterprise does not care what the people like so long as the turnover and profits are high. These violent crimes are reflected in American society by the number of child delinquents, and the extent of violence and crime generally. Why not write into our television programmes something that is really Australian in sentiment, so that children do not have to watch stabbings and other violence? Let me tell the House what can be presented on television programmes. In San Francisco recently, it was reported thatThe outraged mothers saw 13 murders and assorted killings; four sluggings; six kidnappings; five hold-ups; three explosions; three instances of blackmail and extortion; three thefts; two armed scene and one miscarriage.

Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the sitting I brought to the notice of the House the action of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in giving to the newspaper combines of this country, with the approval of the present Government, television licences which give those combines greater influence over the nation. I said also that the growth of monopolies in other spheres was exemplified by the action of this Government in the allocation of television licences. It is quite obvious that, thanks to the patronage of the Government, before the next federal general election the huge newspaper combines and monopolies which operate television in this country will be lined up, together with the press, in opposition to the Labour party. Television will be used to the full in an endeavour to defeat the Labour party again. The Government's television policy is a pay off for services rendered. The Australian people must realize that, far from administering television in the interests of the majority of the nation, the members of the Government are acting for political gain too much power to the press monopolies and to benefit the wealthy interests which of Australia by the allocation of television put most of them into the Parliament. There is no doubt that the vast majority issued later. I repeat that the Government's of television programmes are put on at the policy on the allocation of television licences expense of Australian script writers and represents a pay-off to the huge press inartists. At least 55 per cent, of the proterests in this country for the favorable gramme time should be allocated to producpropaganda that they have promised to the tions by Australian men and women. There Government during the next federal general is no excuse for the continued expenditure election campaign. Of thousands upon thousands of dollars on the importation of cheap films of the hillbilly and other types. These matters should be supervised by the Australian Broadcastto the advantage of the people. I can seeing Control Board, but, as the Deputy stations should not devote the majority of Leader of the Opposition said, the board has their time to the presentation of Australian thrown overboard any exercise of authority productions. It is idle to say that Ausin that respect, so that those who control tralian productions are no good, because the private television stations in Australia we know that throughout the world Aus-thi s applies also to the national stations, tralian artists command top salaries as a to a limited extent-d o as they like, irrespective of the effect of the programmes on the minds of the people. A great deal could be said about the general attitude of Government members to this important subject. As I said earlier, they adopt quite a casual attitude to the effects of television programmes on the community. I point out that not one backbencher on the Government side has been prepared to get up and defend the Government's legislation, even though this is only a machinery measure. That proves that backbenchersI think this applies to most of the Ministers as well-ar e ashamed of the Government's policy on television, because they realize that it represents a sell-out to the huge monopolies. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) has often talked in this House about child delinquency and other such matters. The Government's television policy may result in an increase of child delinquency in Australia, yet the honourable member sits idly in his place. Why does not he get up and explain what present television programmes are doing in regard to child delinquency in this and other countries? Why does not he make a study of the problem, instead of contenting himself with occasional interjections? He is afraid to speak on this great national issue because he knows that the Government has put forward a proposition which is selling out the Australian people. I believe that the Government has given licences. I fear what will be done in the allocation of the 120 licences that will be Although some television programmes are good, there is wide scope for improvement, no reason why the national and private",45,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

We have seen it happen in the life-time of this Parliament on many notable occasions when Labour members have expressed a view that was contrary to the views of the executive of their party. We have seen men walk into King's Hall, approach members of the executive of the Labour party, and within the twinkling of an eye Opposition members have bent the knee and come into the chamber and voted in accordance with the directions they have received from their outside controllers. That is the truth of the matter. When honourable members opposite say, "" We want to nationalize this medium "", what they really mean to say is, "" We want to hand control over this medium to our executive"". The people of Australia have a growing awareness that the Labour party to a great extent is, and is becoming more so, under Communist control and domination, as alleged by Mr by this Government and the chairman is Dougherty, general secretary of the Australian Workers Union.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) last night went into a song and dance because this Government had appointed members of the Australian Broadcasting Control BoaTd for a period of seven years. He said, ""What a dreadful thing to appoint, members of the board for seven years "". But when we look at the record we find that the original appointment of a member of the board for a period of seven years was made by a Labour government in 1948, when the appointments to the board were for seven years for two members and three years for one member. Those terms of office have been amended appointed for seven years and the other four members for five years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, "" This is a young people.

The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) appeared in the session, "" Meet the Press"" a week or two ago. He put on a mighty good show. Although honourable members opposite are prepared to use the medium of television and appear on commercial television programmes on which they can air their views to the public, in this place, for some reason they say that television is a wretched thing which must be guarded by the outside junta that controls their party. Earlier in the life of this Parliament the document that was prepared six months ago honourable member for Wilmot( Mr by Actors and Announcers Equity AssociaDuthie) complained bitterly about the introduction of television which, he said, would wreck the lives of young people throughout Australia. On three or four occasions since then, however, he has asked, "" When are we going to get television in Tasmania? We want it, and we want it badly."" The honourable member for Grayndler read to the House all the torrid things which he alleges occur in television programmes. However, he says, "" I look at and listen to television programmes whenever the opportunity presents itself away from my duties"". Here we have a television addict, a man who loves it himself but does not want anybody else to view it. I can repeat to the House the utterances of the various members opposite on this subject since the introduction of television was first mooted. In one voice they say, "" We do not want it "" , but in another, by question and complaint in this House, they say, ""When is television coming to our State? We want it."" Whenever applications for licences are called in the capital cities of Australia, the Labour party is the first to say, "" Please, can we have a licence to broadcast and televise in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane?"" The Opposition wants to control television, but when its purposes are suited it says, ""Television is a wretched thing and we must not have anything to do with it. But, please, give it to us. We like it."" We have heard from Opposition members a lot of complaints and a great deal of nonsense about allegedly bad programmes. I ask Opposition members: What programmes are bad? gramme. man would probably dislike that programme. He has been bucked by his own party and leader recently, and he probably feels a little sympathy for Hopalong Cassidy. We have not heard from Opposition members of their own experience in watching television. Not one Opposition member who has discussed this measure has said, "" I do not like this programme "", or "" I saw something in that programme that I did not like "". Opposition members were content to take this wretched little tion of Australia in order to make for itself a case for presentation to this Parliament. That document, on the basis of six or seven days' listening and viewing away back in September of last year, set out a list of so many murders, stranglings, and suicides, and all the other things that have been mentioned. Opposition members have been content to quote from that document, and have not drawn on their own practical experience, although many of them must be television viewers. We have not heard them point to one programme that they can say is ruining the minds of our young people. There is a reason why no Opposition member can say, from his own practical experience, that any particular programme or item is dangerous to the mental health of Australia's young people. The reason is that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the programmes presented on the various television channels throughout the day are properly classified under a system of rigorous censorship in order to make sure that no programme presented is at all harmful to the young people of Australia. The Chief Censor of the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board is a loyal and faithful servant who performs his task with great efficiency. Mr Campbell was known to all the members of this Parliament when he served as a ministerial",49,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

119,Mr Pearce,"The honourable gentleprivate secretary, and he has taken to bis high and important post as Chief Censor the attributes that he displayed then. He brings to his task a clear mind, good judgment, and a great deal of courage, as is exemplified by his reports and the judgments that he makes in regard to films. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission have come to an arrangement with Mr Campbell to have their own representatives sit in on the censoring of films for broadcasting on television. The censorship, which is aimed at completely eliminating material not suitable for transmission in Australia, depends, not solely on the Chief Censor, but also upon the representatives of the board and the commission. This censorship entails, in addition to the elimination of undesirable material, the classification of films, as is indicated by the list of film categories in paragraph 135, at page 41, of the ninth annual report of the Broadcasting Control Board. Films that may be broadcast on television without restriction are classified in the G category. Films that are not suitable for children are placed in the A category. Films that may not be telecast before 8.30 p.m. are in the AO category, and those that are not suitable for television at all, as I have indicated, may not be broadcast at all. I commend the whole of this report to presented, which are suitable for children Opposition members who have been so and which are not. No programme that critical. In paragraph 135, at page 41 of the is not suitable for children will be prereport, the board statesDuring the period under review films totalling is not suitable for television audiences will over six million feet were examined and classified be presented at all "". by the Film Censorship Board. The majority was classified in the "" G "" or "" A "" categories, but it was found necessary to make eliminations in 401 the people are buying increasing numbers films, and 25 films were rejected for television. Of the films examined, 75 per cent, originated in of television sets. In both Sydney and its the USA., and 18 per cent, were of UK. origin. In paragraph 136, at page 42, the board sets out the details of the procedure adopted in the censorship of films. In paragraph 137, at the same page, the board statesIt was expected that some difficulties might arise people. The average family is acquiring a in respect of appeals against the classification of films for television as the appeals procedure under television set for its entertainment, because the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations the parents know that they have complete applies only in respect of conditions imposed on control of the set, and the responsibility, the registration of films, and not on their classificaif any, after the initial official censorship, tion. Arrangements have now been satisfactorily worked out which permit television stations to is upon them to see that no influence harm* appeal against classification of films as well as ful to the mental outlook of their children against their rejection. . . . Although licensees enters the home through the agency of claim to have selected overseas films with considerable care, and to have avoided much that was considered undesirable or inferior in type, the Chief Censor had found it necessary to reject some films, and to classify an appreciable number in the ""AO"" category. I remind honourable members that that is the category for films that may not be telecast before 8.30 p.m. The report continuesIn some cases classifications of each of the groups "" G "", "" A "" and "" AO "" have been found necessary in a single programme series containing a number of half-hour episodes. This indicates the desire of both the commercial and the national stations to present programmes that satisfy the requirements of censorship. The report states, alsoIn several cases, it has been necessary for stations to remove a partly-completed film series from ono time channel and place it in another in order tc comply with the Board's Standards. The board then goes on, in this report, to compliment the Chief Censor on the work that he has done. The board makes no complaint there that the commercial stations or the national stations have at any time attempted to evade censorship, and have presented restricted films in violation of the restrictions. On the contrary, the television stations have changed their programmes, and the times of broadcasting programmes, in order to meet the requirements of the Chief Censor. So we can say to the people of Australia with some confidence, "" You may be sure, before the programmes are sented before 8.30 p.m., and no film that The proof of this lies in the fact that suburbs and Melbourne and its suburbs, increasing numbers of people are investing in television sets. Market research indicates that these new sets are going, not into the homes of the well-to-do, but in the main, into the homes of working-class television. This fact is encouraging the people of Sydney and Melbourne to buy increasing numbers of television sets with confidence. The number of sets being purchased is increasing as the weeks go by and the viewing audiences become larger. Why? It is because the people like television, which has become a healthy form of entertainment in the home. The honourable member for Grayndler, in his usual glib, blase way, said that teleDaly, referred to America, spoke about vision has contributed to juvenile delinquency, but it is interesting to note that, since the introduction of television, the police in both Melbourne and Sydney have been able to report that the peak year for juvenile delinquency seems to have passed. I do not say that television in the home has been entirely responsible for the decline of juvenile delinquency, but I do know that increasing numbers of parents in both Sydney and Melbourne are expressing their gratitude for the advent of television in Australia, because it is keeping their childbeen spurious. ren in their homes, where the parents can keep an eye on them and supervise the programmes that they see. In the light of this, I say that television is not contributing to juvenile delinquency, and that time will show that, because it encourages young people to remain in their homes under the watchful eyes of their parents, it is contributing to the welfare of the nation as a whole. I urge Opposition members, who, as a result of bias and prejudice, rather than from practical experience, have expressed so much criticism of television, to read the ninth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which will reveal to them tbe care that is exercised in the planning and control of television programmes. A lot of stress was placed upon the fact that the Department of Audio-Visual Aids, University of Melbourne, had presented a report on the telecasting of "" westerns"". The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Postmaster-General why he had not obtained the report and read it. The plain fact of the matter is that not only have the Minister and members of the Broadcasting Control Board read the document but that the work was undertaken as the result of a financial contribution from the board. So eager was the board to ensure that it knew all there was to be known, about the psychological impact of television programmes upon the young' people of Australia that it contributed to this valuable work in relation to the production of "" westerns "". I think I have shown to the House just how spurious have been the attacks of the Labour party. Honourable members opposite have just selected arguments that have suited their case. The honourable member for Grayndler again became dilly-dally stranglings in Chicago, and read from some document that was published in that country. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, too, quoted from a document that was prepared by the Actors and Announcers Equity, but not one member of the Opposition spoke from personal experience. All Opposition members are eager to see television introduced in the areas that they represent, as they have demonstrated by repeated questions over the years. I repeat that the arguments of the Opposition have The main thing that Labour wants is the elimination of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission from the radio and television fields and the setting up within Australia of a completely nationalized radio and television network. Why does Labour want that? It wants a nationalized network so that it will be able to control the radio and television programmes that are received into the homes of the people of Australia. Honourable gentlemen opposite will do a grave disservice to the people of Australia if they proceed with a policy of nationalization. I urge them to take into account attempts at nationalization that have been made in this and other fields in the cities of the world and to realize that the road to nationalization, the road to socialism, eventually leads, sometimes more quickly than is anticipated, to the communizing of a country and the destruction of the moral fibre of the people within it. a personal explanation. Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? misrepresented by the honourable member for Capricornia in that he misinterpreted my whole speech. In addition, he said that",50,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

122,Mr Daly,"Yes, I have been completelyI was opposed to television. Such is not the case. During my speech I said that I liked television, but that I believed good programmes suitable for the Australian people should be presented. The honourable member said, moreover, that I wish to break down the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Nothing is further from the truth. I desire to have its authority built up by nationalizing broadcasting and television services. was stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) last night, the Opposition wishes to take advantage of this opportunity to oppose the measure and to remind the Parliament and the people of Australia of the views that were advanced by the Australian Labour party when television was introduced into this country. It was interesting to note how the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) accused people of being eager to jump into the television limelight by appearing in certain programmes and obtaining some advantage from it. As you know, Mr Speaker, it has always been the practice for speakers to rise alternately from the Government and Opposition sides of the chamber, but this afternoon not one supporter of the Government was prepared to rise after the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) had spoken. If it had not been that the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr to make a tour of those cities with the Daly) had risen, the debate would have lapsed. Honourable members opposite were frightened to rise and defend the charges that had been levelled against the Government in relation to this measure. It is all very well for the honourable member for Capricornia to rise to-night and speak about programmes and so forth, but he did not answer Labour's charge in regard to the allocation of licences to the vested interests which already own the press and radio facilities of this country. Instead, he spoke idly about everything else. I repeat that he did not attempt to refute that most serious charge against the Government. He, in turn, levelled against Labour a certain charge in regard to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. We believe that it is necessary to nationalize television and broadcasting undertakings in order to lift the standard of the programmes in the interests of the Australian people. Labour's attitude is not governed by the fact that it does not want television. It is true that we raised some doubts about the wisdom of introducing television into Australia some time ago when thousands of people were unable to obtain telephone services. Those people are still in that position. We wondered whether the Government was trying to take on too much. But television has been introduced, and all we want to do is to ensure that it functions properly in the interests of the people. The honourable member for Capricornia spoke about what he believed would happen when a Labour .government assumed office, thereby indicating that he knows the time is drawing near when a change of government will occur. He jumped in at the glamour hour of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates in the hope of reaching some of the people in his electorate and, if possible, of wooing back many of the thousands of people who are deserting this Liberal-Australian Country party Government. He said, too, that in Melbourne and Sydney television sets were being purchased by the working class and not by the wealthy people in the community. I am sure that my colleagues from Melbourne and Sydney would be quite happy honourable member to ascertain exactly what the position is. He would discover that those who are in the lower income bracket are hot able to purchase television sets. Indeed, those people find it most difficult to buy the necessaries of life for their families. This Government is responsible for a rapidly spiralling condition of inflation which is forcing up the cost of living, and the acquisition of a television set is quite beyond the hope of the ordinary worker. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for me to remind the House of the arguments that were advanced by Labour in 1956 on this vital question of television. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to those arguments last night, but they are so important that it is worthwhile recording them once again to see just what answer the Government will offer. I repeat that not one",52,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

The fact of the matter is that the Government has no answer to the case that was advanced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night. Supporters of the Government in this corner of the chamber are compelled to sit idly by. As my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler remarked, they are well qualified to listen to the hill-billy programmes that are telecast at the present time and which seem to constitute the majority of programmes that are presented. We asked for specific safeguards against detrimental monopoly practices by guaranteeing to the general public and to religious, the television industry to the press, broadeducational, cultural, political and social organizations opportunities for a fair and just share of ownership or control of broadcasting and television licences and a fair and just use of the facilities of such services. Is there anything wrong with that? Is it not preferable to see that such safeguards are implemented than to give television licences to the people who at present own the press, the radio and the motion picture industry? That small group of people is being given the right to control and influence public opinion. That is a dangerous weapqn to give to any section of the community. Government supporters believe to-day that that is very good because those people are their friends and will always be on their side, but the time may come when those interests will desert them. It is completely wrong for any political party to give to such a powerful group the opportunity to control public opinion. We also asked that specific provision be made to re-establish and assure the regular ensure that facilities were provided, free of functioning of the Parliamentary Standing charge, on an equitable and impartial basis Committee on Broadcasting and Television for the broadcasting and televising of as guardian of the public interest in those matters of political or industrial controtwo vital fields. What is wrong with that? versy or relating to current policies of This House applauds the work o i : the national importance. What is wrong with Public Accounts Committee as watchdog that? We also asked for adequate safefor this Parliament. The re-establishment of guards against the flooding of Australian the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting and Television could only be of great value to the nation. I spoke a few moments ago of the people who had obtained television licences. One cannot help thinking that giving the licences to those people was a big pay-off to them because they have always been on the Government side at election time. It was the pay-off for services rendered by the press, broadcasting and even the motion picture interests to the Liberal and Australian Country parties at election time. The Government has given them these licences in the hope that further services will be rendered. This is very similar to the banking legislation, which was a pay-off to the private trading banks by an attack on the Commonwealth Bank. Despite opposition from the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), the Government was forced to pay off because it owed this to the private trading banks for services rendered. Now, the Government is forced to give control of casting and motion picture interests because, if it does not, it will be thrown out of office at the first opportunity. Without the support of those interests, the Government could not remain in office. The Labour party is aware of the danger inherent in giving these interests complete control of the press and such fields. Ever since this party was born, we have had a bitter experience. The press has never been on the side of the Labour movement. It is true that, between elections, the press has criticized the Government at times, but the moment an election comes within measurable distance, the whips are out and the newspapers swing right around to support the Liberal and Australian Country parties. These people who have helped the Government so much have been paid in full, if I may use that expression, by the issue to them of television licences. We asked that provision be made to",53,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

We know how necessary such a safeguard is. The entertainment dished up by television stations to-day is undoubtedly cheap trash and tinned films that were produced in America 30 years ago showing gangsters and artists of the Hopalong Cassidy type. In their time, some of them were very good, but why cannot we produce films for television that would portray our country and our way of life, and so build up our own culture. We do not want to see films of Hopalong Cassidy, and I am sure that our children do not want to see them. When television was first mooted, companies were formed to produce films. They spent huge amounts of money because they believed -and rightly so-that Australian productions would be shown on television. To-day, they are gradually folding up business. knows who they are as well as I do, because he has had the same letters from them as I have had. There is no doubt that they have been squeezed out of this field. Before long, television stations will be forced to use only tinned programmes because the very basis of the Australian industry will be destroyed. It is the old story of the motion picture industry over again. Periodically during the last 20 or 30 years, attempts were made to build up a motion picture industry in this country, but because proper guarantees were not given the industry is gradually folding up. Instead of having an established industry, we are still struggling to produce films. All we asked was that a guarantee be given that no less than 55 per cent, of the transmission time of television stations would be used to show Australian artists and Australian productions. Do not say that we have not the artists. The honourable member for Grayndler has pointed out that many artists have left Australia. Probably more artists have left Australia than are here now. However, many artists are ready to take their places on television, if given the chance, and they should be given that chance. Australian-produced dramatic plays should also be shown. I have watched many shows on television and I have attended many repertory theatres. Without a doubt, many Australian amateur productions surpass the programmes shown on television. But the Government is not concerned about that. Those productions have been pushed aside. The reason is that the people who control the television stations can buy American films a little bit cheaper than they can produce Australian shows. They are concerned, not with what is good for Australia, but with the profits that they make. We also asked that no less than an average of 7 i per cent, of the transmission time of any station broadcasting musical items be devoted to the broadcasting of works by Australian composers and that in the calculation of this time no account be taken of time occupied by news and sporting events. to the 1956 bill moved by the Opposition. That amendment is still the basis of our protest against the way in which television is being operated to-day. We believe that television is a medium that could build up a culture, a better social way of life and a better moral code in the community. But we do not believe that this is happening to-day. We do not believe that television is being used as it should be used. A great responsibility rests on this Government, as well as on the people who control television, because the future of Australia may well be in their hands. The Opposition appeals to the Government to give some thought to this matter. The mere fact that Ministers have not spoken in this debate proves that they are worried about the position. We know that, in 1956, when this measure was before the House, the Postmaster-General, and Cabinet, decided to include in the act a provision that would have destroyed the sporting and racing clubs, but because the Opposition raised its voice in protest-and many backbenchers on the Government side of the House were aware of the reason-the Government was forced to capitulate and give some protection to those sporting bodies.

We now appeal to those people to join with us again in order to rectify the mistakes that were made when the act was passed. The honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) was one of the leadersprobably the leader-in the move to obtain protection for sporting bodies. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) was vitally interested from the point of view of the racing clubs. I recently had an opportunity to watch television in London. During the whole afternoon racing was televised, and I could not help thinking of this House and the struggle that was put up by members of the Opposition, supported by a few members from the other side of the House, to make the Government change its mind with regard to the televising of sporting activities. by the Adelaide"" Advertiser"", the News If the Government had had its way, sporting activities would have been televised all day, which would have reacted detrimentally to the sports concerned and, in the case of amateur bodies, would have very quickly put them out of business. It is not to late to bring about further amendments in the act. Just as some members on the other side of the House helped to force the Government to amend the original bill and give protection to sporting bodies, so they may now take this opportunity to rectify mistakes that were made in issuing licences to the people who control the country per medium of the propaganda in which they indulge. The only reason why the majority of Government backbenchers support the present set-up is because they think that they will get a good run at election time if the press controls television. They believe that they have a guarantee that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party will get more than their fair share of propaganda. They can be sure, they think, that the propaganda ahd news will be featured in such a way as to be detrimental to the Labour party and advantageous to the parties they support. It is this thought that is influencing most backbenchers on the Government side of the House to-day. I suggest to them that tfiey should think more along the lines of what is good for Australia, and what in the long run will be best for our children. There might then be a different tone in their speeches-if they were game enough to speak in this debate. The honourable member for Grayndler mentioned some of the people who control television in Australia. He quoted not from some propaganda that is issued by Actors Equity, but from the official report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ended 30th June, 1957. I need not go through the whole list again, but included in it are such organizations as the SunHerald, Associated Newspapers Limited, John Fairfax& Sons Proprietary Limited, 2GB-Macquarie, the A.WA. Group, and others such as Hoyts Theatres Limited, Greater Union Theatres Proprietary Limited, and the Herald and Weekly Times. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) said last night, as soon as licences are issued in other States those combines I have mentioned will be joined Limited, and the Queensland "" Courier Mail "". of the Labour party in that list, or any unions? issued exclusively to those people who have been supporters of the Government, and those people will not continue to support the Government unless they are paid off. That is our main opposition to this bill. We think that our protests are legitimate, and we press them in the hope that something will be done to protect the public and to promote the welfare of the country. Some television programmes have been very creditable. I do not say that all television programmes are bad. I think that Ihe coverage of the Olympic Games and many other features-eve n the one the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) was worried about"" Meet the Press ""-ar e of some value.

With four stations, we have five choices. We can have any one of the programmes presented by the four stations, if we wish, or we can have none at all. That is a pretty wide field of choice. When we learn that in the programme for television that is envisaged in the last report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, provision is made for 120 television stations in conscious, not only of the danger of the Commonwealth-whic h will give us as many television stations as we now have commercial broadcasting stations-it can be appreciated that the programme contemplates a very wide field of licence holding. mean 120 separate programmes. stations. A far more serious matter dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night pertained to the quality of television This question is under constant and close programmes. This is something with which we cannot juggle. The quality of programmes provided by a medium such as television is an extremely tricky matter and is something which can be handled, if it is handled at all, only by experienced people, of whom there are very few. It is easy to say that a programme is unsuitable for the public because it is unsuitable for oneself. Very often we hear things on the air, or see things on television, that do not suit us personally, but to attempt to apply our particular taste to the whole community is a very different kettle of fish. catastrophic! it would be catastrophic. I assure you, Mr stationsI am referring to imported proSpeaker, that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which has had many years of experience in this field, is aware of the dangers of lowering standards in respect of both television and broadcasting and has taken very strong action to see that all licence holders maintain a high, and perhaps a rising, standard of entertainment. years old, but they have passed through the hands of the Commonwealth Films Censor, who is very experienced in the field of censorship. I note that, last year, he rejected 25 films for television, which indicates that he is vigilant to see that really objectionable films do not find their way on to the television screens. From a perusual of the last report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, that for 1957, we find that the board also is objectionable material being shown on television, but also of the danger in lowering standards. The board admits, quite freely and frankly, that it is not satisfied with the standard of much of the film material that has been appearing on television during the last year or so. In its report, it statesMany are excellent productions which provide much appreciated entertainment for Australian viewers, but others are of a type which, while in general complying with the Board's standards, do not appear to the Board to represent the type of programmes which would be desirable as a permanent feature of the Australian television services. review by the board and the Minister, in addition to the review that Tesults from consultation with the licensees of the stations. In studying this aspect of the matter we must make some allowances, I think, for the short period during which we have enjoyed television in Australia. It is in its infancy here. There will be many problems such as this to be ironed out over the next few years, but provided that we have, on the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board, men who are conscious of the requirements be of their task, as are the present members of those boards, I am sure that the problems will be overcome and that the standard of the programmes put out by the television grammes chiefly-wil l continue to rise.

141,Mr Ian Allan,"They may be tenfar by the television stations. I am pleased to see, from the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, that at least one station has used two-thirds of its total time in showing Australian material. The percentages for the other stations were 45 per cent., 61 per cent, and 45 per cent. It is true that these percentages include children's sessions and periods devoted to news, sport, women's sessions, religious matter, talks and interviews, variety shows and similar programmes. But what is wrong with those programmes? Do we want drama all the time? I think we get an overdose of drama on television as it is. I would be happy if we could have more live material from Australians. I am sure that we will get the opportunity to see more of it as the network spreads throughout Australia. Only recently when the Queen Mother was visiting Canberra, we had an example of what can be done in this direction. I understand that the commercial stations in Sydney really scooped the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the matter of broadcasting a live showing of the Queen Mother's visit to this Parliament. As the network extends over the Commonwealth and technical developments make it easier to transmit programmes, I am sure that we can look forward to a great deal more of this kind of Australian material which is not only of entertainment but also educational value. It will help this country enormously in the years to come by providing something such as we have never had before and which will be needed increasingly in the age which we are now entering. I notice that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, in its report, asks for support of television. We should give it our support and cease knocking it, as the Opposition has been doing throughout this debate. If it is necessary to voice criticism, let it be constructive. I believe that television will be the greatest boon to this country that has ever appeared in the form of communications media since the invention of the telephone. A couple of years ago when the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) was introducing a cognate bill he saidThe objective of all stations, from the outset, should be to provide programmes that will have the ultimate effect of raising standards of public taste. The Broadcasting Control Board expressed the view thatTelevision stations have an obligation to ensure that television will be used constructively for the welfare of the community. I believe that the licensees of these stations at present are fully aware of their duties to the community in that regard. The Broadcasting Control Board in its report saidIt is too soon to express any opinions as to the extent to which licensees have succeeded in attaining these high ideals, but it is essential that they should be borne in mind constantly by all those who have any part to play in the production and the presentation of programmes. I believe that as these stations gain in experience and as the plan unfolds and this medium becomes more popular, the full power of television will be realized and, as I have said, it will prove to be a tremendous boon to this growing nation. Personally, I look forward to that development. I deplore the attacks which have been made on the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, both of which have been doing a magnificent job. The system peculiar to Australia which has worked so well with broadcasting promises to work equally well with television, that is the system which permits competition between private enterprise^-no t one, but several groups of private enterprise-and government organizations. That system has worked extraordinarily well. We might regard it an example of Australia's political genius. It is really our contribution to the western world. We have these opposing forces of private enterprise and government enterprise in a number of different fields. They operate in shipping, transport, airways and a number of selected fields, and in every case the system has worked extremely well. I see no reason why, in view of the success of sound broadcasting under this dual system, television should not operate just as successfully in the future. Opposition) [9.16] I do not propose to deal with the whole subject at length because we have debated the principles of this legislation before. But this debate has been important because it has taken place at a moment when there is a good deal of experience of television in its early stages in Australia, and some of the principles which",58,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
142,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thehave come into question here should be understood. First of all, the position had to be faced by the Australian Labour party, when television stations were about to be instituted in Sydney and Melbourne. The Labour party then faced the position quite frankly. It was realized, as the Federal Labour conference knew perfectly well, that it was not possible to establish a system of national ownership of radio or television stations under the Constitution. As in the case of banking, it would be necessary to amend the Constitution before that could happen. Therefore, the Labour party faced the position that, until the Constitution was amended-and it is not easy to amend the Constitution on any point-for the time being commercial radio and commercial television were to be practised in this country. This is what the party decided, and I think it is soundThis Conference, as the supreme body of the Australian Labour party expresses its deep concern at the possibility of television licences being granted to corporations, constituting, in effect, combines of newspaper, radio broadcasting, film and similar interests which already monopolize to a large extent, mass communication for information to the people of Australia. That is a principle which is recognized by every student, whether it is applied to newspapers, films or broadcasting. Even in the United States of America, where the claims of so-called private enterprise are put at their very highest and monopolies are in existence, I think it is recognized that combination and concentration of the power of giving information to the public is a very special thing. It must be controlled and regulated; otherwise only a few opinions can gain any currency in the community. If one is going to criticize, that system is infinitely worse than would be the case with these mediums under national controlthat is, control in the interests of the people. But when the control is exercised by authorities whose primary purpose is the making of profit for private interests, private profit will come into the picture to a great degree. profit element? should listen, although he never does. In any event, we can have question time afterwards, if he so desires. Here is another proposition, stated more broadly, and I am sure honourable members will agree that it is rightThere is a grave danger to the public interest and true freedom of expression is threatened, if those newspapers which are anti-Labour organs It would be just the same if their politics were the opposite colourextend their interests not only to sound broadcasting but to television which will be the most powerful instrument of all from the point of view of providing information for the people of Australia. Admittedly that puts forward the political view of the Labour movement, but it is the decision of the conference, and that is the general principle, stated from the Labour point of view. The Labour movement is opposed to allowing control of not only the press of Australia-in almost every State with few exceptions this is the case-bu t also television to get into the hands of great corporations or individuals of commanding wealth, they having the supreme right of freedom of expression in what is their property. How far can such a system be allowed to go? There must be some balance in the community so that the opposing view may be put. That is really what is behind the principle that I have outlined. It cannot be accepted that television should follow the same route as the newspapers have done. Under such a system, the community in general would have extreme difficulty in obtaining both sides of the case. There are some newspapers that make a feature of putting both sides of the case in public affairs; but there are some which do not do that. We know that to be the position. I think one of the great tragedies in these new democracies, especially the comparatively new democracies, is the absence of a bi-partisan press in the sense that one section of the press will to some extent put the views of one great section of the community while other sections of the press wdl publish the opposite point of view. This was the conclusion reached by the conference in connection with televisionSo long as commercial television is permitted by the law of the land And, of course, it is permitted; it cannot be altered except by an amendment to the Constitutionthis conference declares that the Labour movement of Australia, both political and industrial,",59,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
143,Mr Anderson,What is wrong with the,60,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
144,Dr. Evatt,"The honourable memberrepresents so large a portion of the people that it is entitled to a fair and just share in the direct control of the television medium. We do not say that because we have any desire to monopolize television at all. Deputy Leader. simply will not listen. He is not trying to understand what I say; he simply will not understand. If he made a great effort, he might understand the difference between what he thinks that decision means and what it says. It says quite clearly that a fair and just share should be held by the Labour movement, both political and industrial, so that its views might be put, so that, from what might be called an editorial point of view, it might make its representations to the people. I do not think anybody who has any intelligence disagrees with that. Even a school child with only a smattering of knowledge of the subject would agree with that. That is the true basis of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not simply the right to speak under conditions which will affect only certain people; it is the right to express an opinion before an audience such as readers, listeners, and so on. That being so, I submit '.hat the early Sydney and Melbourne decisions relating to television were wrong. I understand that it was the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan) who praised the members of the AustraUan Broadcasting Control Board. I think it failed completely to understand its duty. It is of no use talking about the English practice, for the English law supports what I am advocating because section 3 (1.) (c) of the Television Act 1954, in dealing with the authority which controls commercial television stations saysIt shall be the duty of the Authority to satisfy themselves that, so far as possible, the programmesthat is, the commercial television programmesbroadcast by the Authority comply with the following requirements, that is to say(c) that any news given in the programmes (in whatever form) is presented with due accuracy and impartiality. It is possible to present news, either political or non-political, in a completely partisan manner. It is admitted that news can be presented fairly and justly, or with complete partisanship, and the statute passed by the English parliament imposes upon the authority controlling commercial television programmes there an obligation to present news with due accuracy and impartiality. If this is not done, the commercial television stations will not be allowed to operate. The English law contains a further condition which comes closer to the point we are discussing. Section3 (1.) (f) imposes on the authority the responsibility to see that the programmes comply with this requirementthat due impartiality is preserved on the part of the persons providing the programmes as respects matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current pubhc policy; That is to say, the authority controlling television has a duty to satisfy itself that the programmes broadcast by it observe that condition. Consider the application of that principle to a strike. It demands that the views of both sides of the dispute shall be put in relation to "" matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy"". It provides that those views shall be put with due impartiality. Certainly, that is an ideal, but I think that it has been reached in England. I say emphatically that such matters are not treated in that way by the stations of Australia yet. AlthoughI readily admit that in many cases there is a fair presentation, we do not get it in the way insisted upon by the English statute to which I have referred. When we tried to amend the legislation to have similar provisions included in the Australian law, the Postmaster-General and Government supporters derided our suggestions simply because the Australian Broadcasting Control Board did not understand or appreciate that unless these things are provided for in our statutes there can be no assurance that they will be put into effect.. The English law also saysProvided that nothing in paragraph (g) of this sub-section shall prevent(i) the inclusion in the programmes That is commercial television programmesof relays of the whole (but not some only) of a series of the British Broadcasting Corporation's party political broadcasts.",60,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
145,Mr Hamilton,You differ from the,61,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
146,Dr. Evatt,"The honourable memberMr Speaker, I ask honourable members to note that the English Authority is entitled to include in its programmes relays of the British Broadcasting Corporation's party political broadcasts. There might be eight or nine openly political broadcasts by one side or the other in twelve months and the television authority in England cannot select and televise only parts of them; it must include the whole series. The British Broadcasting Corporation does that with complete fairness to both sides, and I emphasize that it does this not merely for a few weeks before an election but throughout the whole year. That is the standard of political reporting and political judgment There is also a growing trend to follow which is possible in a democracy under a provision similar to that included in the English law. We should do the same here. I do not propose to deal with details. We submitted certain proposals which were rejected. But it will be found that in this country public opinion is ahead of the laws which this Government passes. There are signs that those controlling television in Australia have an appreciation of the justice of hearpresentation was a supreme experience ing both sides of a case, not because the law tells them to do so but because public opinion demands it. Such television programmes as "" Meet the Press"" fulfil a very important role in the community because they are really a substitute for what cannot or does not appear in many newspapers. Let me say at once that the public appreciates the modern tendency on the part of commercial television authorities in dealing with matters of political controversy to interview first a representative of one side and then the representative of the other side. For instance, they might interview the representative of a particular trade union and then perhaps an employer. Even men engaged in public affairs take part in these programmes. It might develop in a way that is satisfactory, without a statute. But there are other questions, although they may not be greater ones, because nothing is greater than the right of the individual to free expression and it is the duty of those who have control of information to see that both sides of the case are put. It can be done in television, strangely enough, although it is not so easy to do in radio broadcasting or, perhaps, even in the press. We are passing through a stage of change in this country in relation to these great matters. Criticisms which I think are justified have been based on other aspects of television. I do not think that there is a sufficient presentation of the works of Australian writers, artists, or actors, many of whom are among the best in the world. But there are signs that, even there an improvement is taking place. It is true that in the early stages of television, the tendency is to use old films from abroad which are not at all satisfactory. I think that details of them have been given. the example of England where, I think, the standard in television is the highest in the world. The trend in England is to have special performances for television. For instance, the Australian Broadcasting Commission recently reproduced on television, I think from the British Broadcasting Corporation, a dramatic account of the life of Christ. Previously, such a thing was almost impossible. It was frowned upon because of its great difficulties. But this and it made a great contribution to the people of this country, especially the youth. Where was there scope for that type of production before television? Only television could provide the opportunity for its presentation. The same remarks apply to the drama. Let us go back to films which provide the simplest comparison. The abandonment of standards has brought Hollywood films down in the last ten years. Despite all the technical facilities possessed by Hollywood, and despite the superb casts of actors and actresses, somehow Hollywood has failed in recent times. To-day, I think it is universally recognized that the film productions of countries such as Britain, France, Italy and Germany are superior to those of the United States which held the field for so long. These things will have to be worked out and one cannot dogmatize about them. But it would be wonderful for Australia if the writers and artists of this country were given the opportunities that they merit. It is no use consultingfiguresin the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and saying that the Australian content of programmes is so much. Included in what -is called the "" AustraUan content"" of television programmes is every film of something in Australia. It may be a horse race or a sporting car test. Whilst these programmes are worth seeing and I am all in -favour of them, they do not come into the realm of competition between the plays and other works of Australian writers, artists and actors, and those of their counterparts in other countries. That is my concern. It is only with respect to those activities that percentages of Australian -content are relevant. A mere arithmetical calculation of the amount of time given in television programmes to horse races, or surfing contests which may last for two hours, is not relevant to the encouragement of the art of Australian actors, writers, and other artists. These people are able to take their place in any part of the world with honour and credit to Australia. Very often, it is their fate to be able to obtain employment only in other parts of the world so that Australia receives only the credit of having produced them. Some of our greatest artists in thesefieldsare abroad. Australia would save valuable dollars, too. matter. I have now practically concluded what I wish to say. I am not sure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is a suitable body to exercise the functions under this bill. I know that it is difficult to get suitable people to exercise these functions. The principles which I have suggested have been written into English legislation in which they are sacred principles. principles. Britain has adopted them, not because the matter has been disputed, but because everybody knows that they have to be accepted. objection to the institution of commercial television resulted from the fear that the principles which were originally adopted by the British Broadcasting Corporation would not be observed by commercial television. So the United Kingdom Government made provision in the relevant statute for the principles to be observed by commercial television stations and they are being observed. In this country, the same end may have to be accomplished by some different procedure. Concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I do not agree, altogether, with the honourable member for Gwydir. I think that the commission, on the whole, does very important and useful work. But I think it is open to criticism in relation to both television and broadcasting, because of its selection of news and its commentaries, for instance, on international affairs. Honourable members must surely be amazed at the collection of commentaries on international affairs that the A.B.C. puts over. I invite honourable members to run through the list of people who deliver these commentaries. Not long ago when vital debates on the Suez Canal took place here and in England, a commentator was chosen by the A.B.C. to put his views on the matter. His views were so critical of the Government that he was told that either he would have to withdraw them or he would have to go off the air. He said that he would not withdraw his remarks and he was put off the air. In this way, the A.B.C. exercises something in the nature of a censorship on some occasions. I have mentioned this before. This particular commentator was put on the air again at a later stage but his later broadcasts did not preserve the same approach. I invite honourable members to examine the list of broadcasts by the A.B.C. They will see a bias in favour of whatever the Government does in international affairs. I admit that there may be one critical broadcast out of ten. conscious of the fact. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) is even more biased than I am. In England, the great I have suggested to the Postmaster General, or to some one who was acting for him, that if there are two views to be put on international affairs, they should be put by two people. The Minister should not assume that, by selecting a long list of people, fairness and justice are preserved in these matters. It is not done in that way. It is done in politics by broadcasting both sides of a case. The public hears both sides in broadcasts from this august chamber.

150,But They Are Elementary Dr. Evatt,"I am biased, but I amhear opposing views. It is only from opposing views that one can form a fair judgment. It does not matter what the judgment is; the people are free to make it. A.B.C. commentaries, on the whole, simply echo Government policy on international affairs, which is perhaps the most important subject of all. For that reason they are quite unsatisfactory. I apologize for dealing with this subject by on which we can criticize the general adselecting certain matters only, but they are matters that have come into the debate. We want television and broadcasting to be successful. We want all parties to get a fair go in all mediums. We cannot ask for more, but we ought to ensure that that is so. I think there are good trends apparent in the way television is developing. We want to encourage them where they exist, and keep a close eye on what is happening. That is why I strongly favour what the honourable member for Kingston( Mr honourable member described his erstwhile Galvin) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) said in connection with the old Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. The members of such a committee are the watchdogs of the House. They can see that things which seem tiny are looked at closely, and I believe that they can render very valuable service, not only to the Parliament but to the whole of the people of Australia who want to ensure that these great mediums are conducted fairly and justly to all persons whatever their opinions may be. support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), particularly those at the close of his speech. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has failed to be contentious and stimulating on many great public issues. That is one of the reasons we challenge it in this debate. It is possibly also one of the reasons why members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties have chosen to remain practically silent in this debate. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that listeners to the debates here can get two sides of a question. In this debate, that opportunity has been notably absent. I think I am the ninth speaker in the debate, six of whom have spoken from this side of the chamber and only three from the other. That fact is an indication of the position that honourable members opposite take up on great public issues. This is a great public issue. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) spent a good deal of his time in attempting to traduce the Labour party. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan) tried to put us in the corner as being continuously opponents of the A.B.C. That is not so. There are many reasons ministration of the whole system of broadcasting and television in this country. However, I do congratulate the honourable member for Gwydir on some of his remarks. It was interesting to hear them spoken by a man who spent some part of his working life as an employee of the A.B.C. and who became excessively loyal to it. Here is a man who, when he becomes part of a government instrumentality becomes a socialist and becomes proud of the institution of which he is a part. The fellow employees in the A.B.C. as loyal, devoted and dedicated public servants. It is great to hear such a statement from a member on the Government side of the chamber, because Government supporters continually attack the Public Service. We say that the Government has failed to give a lead to public servants to establish a dynamic and stimulating A.B.C. with vigour in all its works and all its ancillaries. That is why we are speaking so forthrightly in this debate. I am not surprised that honourable members opposite so vigorously support the present set-up in the broadcasting and television field. Here are the remarks of one of Australia's leading legal men, Shand, QC, to the Royal Commission on Broadcasting in 1955It cannot be disputed that the Herald, Sun and Telegraph have political allegiance to the Liberal party, which they support. They do not support the Labour party. Also appearing before that royal commission was the very distinguished and uprising Liberal, the present-and , at the moment, absent-honorabl e member for Parramatta ( Sir Garfield Barwick). Yet no attempt was made to deny the truth of these statements. There are four or five points on which we oppose the general administration of the Broadcasting and Television Act and of the system generally. In the first place, there",63,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
151,Mr Bryant (Wills) [9.40],"I wish tois not enough competition from the A.B.C. I think that there should be more A.B.C. television stations than commercial television stations. The control of our television in particular is moving into the hands of people who are, politically speaking, completely irresponsible. They are not answerable to anybody. Over the last few years we have seen that this Government has no intention of controlling its instrumentality, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. We have seen the same thing evidenced in the replies by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to questions about what the Government proposed to do with the banking system and to other questions about the Government's intentions regarding airlines and such things. In this we have a blatant example of the failure of the Government to give any direction whatsoever to its agencies. This is fundamental to the doctrinaire position taken up on the Government side, particularly as expressed by people like the honourable member for Capricornia. The third point on which we oppose the human behaviour. That is my own personal present administration of broadcasting and observation of television on Easter Sunday television is that the whole system is movnight. ing towards suppression of the development of natural Australian culture and sentiment. You have only to see the programmes put the honourable member would turn off the over the air, you have only to hear the set. accents of the people who play in these programmes, you have only to see what the content of most of the programmes is, in order to understand that point.

There was a great the people. The"" Meet the Press"" session deal of banging going on. The proprietor of the milk bar, who is a new Australian, as I looked at the screen with astonishment, not being accustomed to such scenes of violence, waved his hands in the air and said, "" They are always shooting one another on that thing "". And that is the fact. This is the type of programme that viewers are given. On Easter Sunday evening I went to view a televison programme which emanated from Melbourne. From8 p.m. to 9 p.m. the programme was a drama session broadcast under the name ""Sunday Drama"", ""Sunday Playbill"" or some such term. An hour was taken up in this session with some out-of-date film imported from America at low costa fact which keeps Australians out of work because they cannot compete in this field. This supposed drama, this entertainment, as honourable members opposite would term it, featured marital infidelity, several murders, and several brawls, and riots. The whole television network was devoted to the more distasteful and sordid aspects of house in which there is one. I do not belong to the honourable member's class, so I do not own one, but I am well-mannered and did from the wild and woolly West.

This programme involved more marital infidelity, several murders and a pursuit across, I presume, America. I admit that the "" baddies "" came to a sticky end, as is always the case, which no doubt must depress members of the Government rather sorely. That is the account of my own personal observations on one of the few nights on which I have seen television. It cannot be denied by anybody that the programmes being offered to the Australian people are exceptionally low in quality and are not fit for people to see. Incidentally, it is folly to believe that the children go to bed on Sunday nights when television is on. We say that the things I have described are a denial of Australia's own traditions. The accents being broadcast across the country are not Australian accents. The scenery shown is not Australian scenery. In fact, it is rather an oddity to hear an AusWeekly Times Limited owns one of the tralian voice unless it is advertising an imported product in an imported accent. This is commercialism run mad, and there is absolutely no justification for the Government's attitude. Honourable members opposite have dedicated themselves to such a doctrinaire position on this matter that they are unable to see the dangers inherent in the present trend. I am glad that honourable members on this side at least are prepared to take the matter up here. Another point I should like to put is the concentration of the control of mass communications mediums in Australia in the hands of very few people. That brings me back to the point I originally made about the management of the television medium falling into the hands of irresponsible people. I believe that this is an historic struggle taking place in this and every other community. The matter of political responsibility was resolved 300 years ago. That historic struggle ended with Charles Stuart meeting his just deserts outside Whitehall. The matter at issue was the divine right of kings, and the struggle culminated in victory for those who contended that political sovereignty shall be held by the representatives of the people and that the divine right of kings shall not prevail. What has interested me during the little more than two years that I have been in this Parliament is the almost completeacceptance by those on the other side of the House of the divine right of the owners of' big businesses and great property aggregations. These are the people who havemoved into control of our whole television system, and the situation now presents oneof the challenges that we must face. I have nothing in particular, or personally, against any one who is involved in. the ownership of television or radio stationsor newspapers, but there is no doubt that the control of these mass communicationmediums is becoming monopolistic in the extreme. In Melbourne we have two newspaper firms. One of them publishes the ""Herald"" and the ""Sun News Pictorial"". The former paper is sold in the morningsand the latter in the evenings, and about 500,000 copies of each are sold each day. In addition, about 100,000 copies of the "" Age"" are also sold each morning. The great combine represented by Herald and television stations in Melbourne. The other newspaper firm is a part controller and owner of the other station. Both these organizations have extensive radio networks at their control. This position is dangerous in the extreme. Honourable members on the other side of the House who spoke during this debate challenged us to read the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Let us look at that report, for the year ended 30th June, 1957. There are four great organizations controlling commercial television in this country. Only one of these firms, the one which controls station TCN in Sydney, has its shares available for purchase on the Stock Exchange. In only one of those four great companies can a member of the general public hope to gain any controlling interest. Who are these people who enjoy .this divine right, who have been chosen from among our population of 9,000,000 to have at their disposal this great facility?

They have shown their irresponsibility by the Let us consider some of the directors of these concerns. Sir Arthur Warner is easily shift the Legislative Council. When one considers these matters, it is easy to understand the kind of programme that would be approved by this gentleman, because when his government was attacked recently for the flogging of prisoners in a Victorian gaol, Sir Arthur Warner said, "" What is wrong? We did not draw blood "". That is the kind of person who has moved into control of television. It is no wonder that the Liberal party denies its duty and does not face its responsibility. After all, the Liberal-Country party government in Victoria still allows flogging, and the shootwhich is one of the auxiliaries of the ing of live pigeons, ahd that fact alone furnishes us with a fair commentary on the programmes that would be sponsored by members of that government who have control of television. I should like to refer to a great number of matters, but the principal points that I wish to make are these: First of all, there is the challenge on ownership and control; secondly, there is the challenge to stimulate the people's thinking on general lines, and the opportunity to do this is not being availed of by the present television network. Thirdly, there is a failure to develop Australian culture and to give a stimulus to Australian drama. I have some figures before me, which may be a little late, having been given in September last by the Postmaster-General in reply to a question by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr capital cities there ought to be twice as Cairns). The figures give the percentages of Australian-produced drama in television programmes. The percentage for station ABN was 11, for ABV it was 10.1, for ATN 0.9, and for each of the stations TCN, GTV and HSV the percentage was nil. The Australian Broadcasting Commission at least is taking some steps towards the encouragement of Australian drama, but the people in whose hands has been placed the greater part of the power and resources at our disposal through television have accepted no responsibility whatsoever in this direction. doing about it? doing nothing about it. This is the challenge: Australian culture should be encouraged, Australian thought stimulated, and the Australian people generally should gain some advantage from the resources that have been placed at the disposal of the people I have mentioned. I understand that there are now about 250,000 television licences in existence, and I presume that this means that there are 250,000 sets in operation. This shows a capital investment of about £40,000,000. Great things could have been done with that amount of money, but this challenge is being completely ignored by the Government and by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Government in carrying out the will of the people. Research has shown that, generally speaking, the people demand a higher standard of entertainment, but they are not getting it. The general desire to stimulate sales, which has been seen in advertising in the press and by radio, and is now evident in TV advertising, is a powerful reason for depressing the standard of the programmes, so that the stations get the largest possible viewing audiences. They are not attempting to find critical audiences or to stimulate their thinking. All that is required of viewers is that they buy a certain shirt or motor car. We cannot expect better programmes from commercial institutions. It is the Australian Broadcasting Commission that will have to do the job in the end. Instead of having only one national television station in each of the many national stations as commercial stations. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has pointed out the constitutional difficulties in the way of nationalization of this medium, but I remind honourable members of the great resources at the Commonwealth's disposal. I am thinking of the kind of resources that enable this Government to buy transport aircraft by the dozen at £1,250,000 each, and to have 12 tons of nails left over when a project such as that at St. Mary's is finished. A government with such resources can surely use them to develop this important medium of communication for the betterment of the people. I have before me a report of the Australian Humanities Research Council on the effect of television, so far as cultural activities are concerned. The whole tenor of the report is that where television networks have taken the opportunity to raise cultural",66,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
158,Mr Cope,What is the Government,68,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
159,Mr Bryant,"The Government isstandards and critical faculties there has been an immediate response. The report refers to the fact that in a recent book entided ""Top TV Shows of the Year"", which has an introduction by chief executives of the National Broadcasting Company and the American Broadcasting Company -bot h commercial operators-the top twelve shows are listed, and that three of them are from the Johns Hopkins University series, two are news commentaries and three are good playsThe report statesIt has been noted, both in the US. and the UK., that the ability of television to increase the desire for classical literature has exceeded all expectations. Last year, 19S6, the American Federal Communications Commission reported a fantastic increase in the sales of books of the classics, of works of art and literary treasures, all of which could be traced to television sessions. Honourable members will see the opportunities that are being placed in our hands. We should accept the challenge and use this new medium to best effect. For many years I taught in Victorian schools. The education systems of Australia will soon have to face great pressures as a result of increased enrolments. We must raise the school leaving age and increase the resources in the hands of the teachers. We shall be able to handle the greater number of students only by using these new technical developments. opportunity to turn this new communication medium to the national advantage, and we should accept it. I hope that the Minister will put pressure on the Australian Broadcasting Commission to ensure a higher quality of programmes is provided, and will examine very closely the ownership and control of television, radio and press in this country. The Minister should see whether something can be done to counteract the tendency towards monopoly capitalism-if I may use a term which will probably upset Government supporters. At present American programmes which may cost 50,000 dollars to make are put on the Australian market for £100. No organization in this country can produce a comparable programme at such low cost. In this way, Australian television production is being strangled. We may well have to subsidize local production. We can enter the field ourselves. I remind honourable members of the material available through the News and Information Bureau and the Australian War Memorial. Such films could be used to develop a consciousness that we can stand on our own feet in the production of television programmes. Government supporters say that we are mere carping critics of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and want to dispose of it entirely. That is nonsense. What we hope to do is make constructive criticisms of the kind that have produced, in the 57 years since federation, some of our most notable enterprises. Unfortunately, for ten years the Australian broadcasting system has been in the hands of a government which is anti the people's assets. We must fight vigorously to ensure that the people are made aware of this fact. General and Minister for the Navy) [10.5]. -in reply-The proposed amendment of the Broadcasting and Television Act is, as I stated in my second-reading speech, relatively simple. It deals mainly with machinery matters and aims at tightening up some of the provisions in the existing legislation. However, this debate has been notable for the fact that few speakers have applied themselves to the actual clauses of the bill. The exception was the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) who indicated a wish to suggest certain amendments. I think that on an occasion We have an like this it is understandable that the debate should be fairly wide in scope, and I accept the lead given me by previous speakers in making my remarks on a wide basis also. I shall endeavour to answer some of the criticisms which have been uttered by honourable members opposite concerning the general operation of the broadcasting and television systems. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, opened the debate for the other side. He followed his usual pattern in dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. We have come to accept the fact that, for some reason or other, he has a particular aversion to those bodies, and loses no opportunity of decrying both their personnel and activities. I find it rather difficult to understand why that should be so. We know that the honourable gentleman is a very decent fellow, who is easy to talk to and not given to decrying others. For that reason,",68,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde
160,Mr Davidson (Dawson,"PostmasterI am not prepared to accept the suggestion that he attacks these broadcasting bodies for personal reasons. I think that there must be an underlying, deeper reason, and that can be seen if one pays special attention to statements which he has made from time to time, and which he and other honourable members opposite repeated last night. One can see, shining clearly through their criticism, a belief that Australia's broadcasting and television system should be under the control of a political bodyof the Minister of the day. The existence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board prevents complete control of that kind. Therefore, it seems, the system now in operation must be attacked. However, Labour thinks it better to attack the instrumentalities rather than the system itself. The honourable member has said that broadcasting and television are powerful mediums for the influencing of public opinion. It is easy to see, flowing from that perfectly true statement, the conviction that those who control these powerful mediums can, eventually, control the minds and the thinking of the people. We all remember a certain gentleman called Hitler who believed in the technique of controlling mediums of communication and repeating a false statement so often that ultimately it was accepted as true. I say definitely and deliberately that the real reason for the attitude of honourable members opposite may be found in this belief that the political party or person who controls these powerful mediums of communication can mould public opinion. I do not make that statement lightly. My belief is supported by evidence that speaker after speaker from the other side-wit h one notable exception to whom I shall refer shortly-state d definitely that Labour believes in the nationalization of the broadcasting and television services. There you have it. Members of the Opposition have said that they believe in the nationalization of these services. BeforeI pass to some comment on those statements and what they mean, I shall refer to the rather strange and possibly significant fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) who came into this debate rather late and spoke only briefly and rather disconnectedly, was at pains to point out that the federal conference of the Australian Labour party recently had decided that it was not possible to establish national ownership of these mediums. It had decided that the present system could not be challenged except by some constitutional amendment, according to the right honourable gentleman. That seemed strange to me for a moment, but suddenly I realized, as the Leader of the Opposition had realized, that the forthright statements by his followers that they believed in the nationalization of broadcasting and television were dangerous. Therefore, the right honourable gentleman had to enter the debate and do his best to create a different impression. In other words, was the statement of the Leader of the Opposition something in the nature of a square-off? Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot have the Leader of the Opposition saying, "" We recognize that this system cannot be nationalized"", and all those behind him saying, "" We believe in the nationalization of broadcasting and television and will plan for it "". What would nationalization of broadcasting and television mean? The people know what it would mean. They know what nationalization meant when it was proposed by the Australian Labour party with respect to banking. From time to time, they have heard of proposals to nationalize insurance and other systems. Therefore, they know that the nationalization of broadcasting and television would mean simply that there would be a complete stifling of the freedom of private enterprise, and that such stifling would prevent true freedom of expression of the people. It is rather interesting again to turn to the statements that were made by the Leader of the Opposition and to find him saying that all he seeks is a fair and just share of time on the air. All he wants is a fair and just opportunity for himself and the Labour party to give expression to their principles. My reply to that statement is that under the present system, which is not a nationalized system, better opportunity exists for a fair and just share of time for the expression of opinions than would be provided under any system that has been suggested in this debate by the Opposition. I can produce for honourable members further evidence that I claim exists as to the real reason for the opposition of honourable members opposite to the present system established by this Government for the control of broadcasting and television. For example, it was stated in this debate that one of the objectives of the Australian Labour party was to make provision for greater political ownership of broadcasting and television stations. I agree that any organization should have a fair opportunity to control the operation of a broadcasting or television station. But what is meant by this claim that there should be greater opportunity for political ownership of stations? Does it mean, for example, that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which handles recommendations for the granting of licences, is to be instructed that priority should be given to applications from political organizations for the control of broadcasting and television stations? This Government will not accept that proposition. It believes that a fair share of control should be given, but it will not sive priority to any organization. I believe that that is the correct attitude. Again, it was claimed in the amendments --""'ich were moved in a previous debate and which were quoted again last night by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) that there should be wider provision for free political use of broadcasting and television stations. The Leader of the Opposition said that there should be better provision for all sides in political and controversial matters to be presented. I say that one of the things that can be claimed for the present system is that there is complete impartiality, particularly by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in the presentation of controversial and political matters. As a matter of fact, because of the very existence of that impartiality, there are some on both sides of the political fence who claim that the other side is given more favorable treatment by the commission. If we reach a stage, as a result of submissions by our opponents, that broadcasting and television stations, both national and commercial, shall be required or forced by legislation to give unlimited free time to political parties, the time could easily come when we would have what some people might describe as Evatt Unlimited. Some would say that that is the position now. I will not support any proposal which would lead to such a state of affairs. At present, the stations are required to make certain time available for the dissemination of matter of national import. During election campaigns, any station which gives time to one poUtical party is required to ""give similar time to all other parties represented in this House, provided the time is paid for. That is something vastly different from the proposition that all stations should be required to give a great deal more free time for the dissemination of poUtical views, particularly if, as has been proposed by our friends opposite, the control of both commercial and national stations should pass to the government of the day. Another suggestion that has been made by honourable members opposite provides further evidence of the real objectives of the Opposition. They suggested that representatives of the Treasury and the Postmaster-General's Department should sit on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is a feature of this Government's policy that the commission, working under a general charter, should not be subject to departmental control. But it is perfectly obvious that if we were to put representatives of the Department of the Treasury and the Postmaster-General's Department on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the result would be the exercise of direct political control which members of the Opposition seek and which we desire to avoid. The final suggestion which indicated the objectives of the Opposition was that the control over broadcasting and television should be transferred from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to the old Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. So we see that the objective of the Opposition is the development of complete political control of broadcasting and television. That is not possible under the system which this Government has developed. Our system has been applauded by many recent visitors from Great Britain and the United States of America who have examined our dual system of commercial and national stations. At least half a dozen visitors to whom I have had the privilege of talking in the last six months have told me that they have seen nothing elsewhere to compare with the system that has been developed in Australia. That is our system; but honourable members opposite seek to hide their real opposition to it. I have tried to draw out their real objecsuch-and-such a programme is unsuitable tives and to present them to this House and through the microphones to listeners throughout the country. The Opposition has tried to hide its objectives behind a smoke screen. Honourable members opposite have tried to tell the people that this Government is building up a great monopoly of broadcasting and television in the hands of newspaper interests and others. They have tried to hide the fact that the monopoly control which the Opposition would impose is of a far more sinister and dangerous nature than any other control. It is proper and right that I should not allow the vilification that has been uttered by several speakers against the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission to pass without comment. Therefore, I want to point out exactly what is involved in the system that this Government has established and supports. First, we have the national service implemented by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in broadcasting and lately in television. Operating that service we have a number of commissioners. They are men who have given great public service to Australia. I was very interested to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan) because he, more than anybody else in this House, has had personal experience of the operation of the broadcasting system. honourable member by quoting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He conceded the fact in his speech-it can be seen in "" Hansard ""-that because of the experience of the honourable member for Gwydir in this field his views should be given considerable attention and can be taken as representing or providing knowledge that other members in this House do not possess. The honourable member for Gwydir, when speaking to-night, pointed out that there has been given to the nation by the members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board a very high range of service, because they are in a position to determine, as far as programmes are concerned, for instance, just what is desired by the majority of the people. He pointed out, very rightly, that many of us say that and should not be continued; he is able to tell us that that opinion cannot be accepted as being reliable because the services must be of a nature to appeal to a wide variety of people and no one knows more and can choose better in that regard than those people on the Australian Broadcasting Commission who have had years of experience and have given years of service to the nation. The Australian Broadcasting Commission operates under a charter provided by the Broadcasting and Television Act. In that charter, the commission is given overall directions as to what is required of it but the Government, having laid down those overall directions, charges the commission to operate under its own authority. I make this point because under our system there is no direct control of the operations of the commission by the Minister or by the Government. That is a factor which we say is a good one in our system. There is the overall indication of what is required of the commission; the Government retains control over the general policy, and the commission proceeds to carry out that pohcy under its own authority. This is a factor which annoys our friends opposite because they want direct ministerial and governmental control over what the commission does from day to day, so that if at any time they come to power they can use it for their own purposes. We, on the other hand, propose to preserve that factor and, if possible, strengthen it to ensure that it will continue to operate on these lines. As a result, we say that a fair and just share which is being sought by the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) is available and will continue to be available under this system, but not under the one he proposes. I turn now to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which is another part of our system. This has been vilified by certain honourable members opposite, particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The board is composed of reputable men-me n of high standing. There are men on it who are capable of presenting a variety of views on all the problems that come before it. The chairman is a competent and able man in the Public Service.

The board exercises an oversight might not be palatable to them if they of the quality of the services required. The should get into government. Finally board is required to deal with the many and varied problems associated with broadcasting and television. Honourable members opposite sneered a hour if you will give me an extension of lot when they claimed that the board had time, because this debate affords me an allotted 30, 40 or 50 licences for television. opportunity to say quite a lot of things, just It did nothing of the kind. The board is as it afforded members on the other side required to deal with programmes, the an opportunity to do so. change of power of broadcasting stations and the coverage available to them. All these things represent problems. The board is required to deal with all the investigaare the duties of the board.

There again is an attempt to bring in comon the people in the Australian film plete political control of these matters. Not only is the work involved quite beyond the scope of such a committee, but also such a committee was proved to be ineffective previously. Before this Government ever put the committee into the discard, it had been put into the discard by the leader of the previous Labour Government, who realized that it was not effective broacasting and television industries can and although it was not disbanded, it was not given any work to do. I could also say a great deal in support grammes, the more it will be possible for the of the commercial services, but my time is running out, and I content myself with saying that I am not tolerant on this quesago that in twelve months the number ol tion of employing Australian talent. 1 am constantly watching the situation. I have had within the last few days a report showfrom 30 to 102 per month. The amount ing exactly the Australian content of programmes. Those who say that commercial television licensees are not making an honest and sincere attempt to increase the use of Australian talent and to increase the Australian content of programmes do not present the situation properly as I know it to be. I have plenty of instances to prove the truth of what I am saying, but I have not the time to give them. I know that there is a sincere and honest attempt on the part of the commercial licensees to do a national task by increasing the Australian content of programmes. But I also know, as do many other people, that if, in order to achieve that end, the licensees were told that the Australian content of programmes must be 50 per cent, or 60 per cent., that would be the worse possible thing to do. If we did that as our friends opposite suggest, and, having done it, said, "" We have carried out our obligation"", it would be equivalent to running away from the obligation because the licensees would be set an impossible task. Anybody who thinks that to pass such a resolution and to leave the matter at that is to deal with the situation has another think coming -In the second reading debate, I suggested Australian talent is slowly building up. It is improving and will keep on improving. Our objective will not be achieved overnight. Let us not forget that the motionpicture industry has been in operation for 30 or 40 years, and still there is no film-producing industry in Australia, in spite of what the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) said a little while ago. He asked, "" Why can they not draw industry?"" One of my colleagues said, ""Who are they?"" and the honourable member could not answer. I too say "" Who are they?"" The more we can develop broadcasting and television in Australia, the greater will be the market available to the Australian film industry for the sale of its wares. The more that the promote the use of Australian talent and increase the Australian content of their profilm industry to develop. One company reported two or three days Australian artists employed by one commercial television licensee had increased expended per week in wages for Australian artists increased from £499 in March, 1957 to £1,052 in March, 1958. Those are examples of what is being done. I presume that honourable members also know that two commercial licensees are conducting a competition for a play by an Australian writer, and providing £3,000 by way of prizes. I have said before that, as a result of my experience and the attention I have given to this matter, I believe that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial licensees are doing more to assist the development of Australian talent than are people like Actors Equity who criticize their efforts.

The first is that the decision as to what programme is to be listened to or looked at is a very easy one, and it is made by the person sitting in his house by a radio or television set, with the power to turn this or that station on or off with a flick of the switch. I believe that we must have some regard to the person who supports this industry, namely the person who owns a set, who is a listener or a viewer. It is regrettable, perhaps, that so far, the Australian national television stations have not achieved the rating that the commercial stations have achieved. In spite of the large amounts of money which have been spent, the national stations have a much smaller percentage of viewers than have the commercial stations. This, of course, is determined not by the Government but by the viewers themselves, who have that power of turning the dial to the right or the left, to take in this station or that station. But this preference for commercial stations is not exclusive to Australia. Even the wellentrenched British Broadcasting Corporation in England tends to lose viewers to the newer commercial stations. Also, I feel a very great sympathy for the view that as much local talent as possible should be used. That is a view which I myself have expressed from time to time in this House. I think that the House will remember that many years ago I moved that the ownership of radio stations should be in Australian hands. The Opposition spoke vehemently against that motion at the time. That is shown in the records of "" Hansard"". The House carried my motion, and that has subsequently been applied as a principle in the allocation of television licences. I would regard that as a very salutary principle. It is rather strange that the Opposition, which professes to support this principle, showed its insincerity by voting against it when it was before the House. But luckily the F.2286/55 -R -[46 ] House saw fit to disregard the Opposition's view and to sponsor the Australian outiook. I know also that it is not possible to conjure up local talent out of thin air. It cannot be developed all at once. If we demanded too much, we would simply kill the industry in its infant tracks. Many stations are doing their best to put Australian shows on the air. I know for a fact that station TCN in Sydney, if it could get a suitable Australian show, sponsored by somebody here, which, after being tried on the air, showed a rating, would make station time available free so that the show could get a run. ThatI know to be the case with that one station, but it is probably true of other stations, too. There is no lack of goodwill for Australian shows. There is a desire to get Australian shows on the air, but there is a difficulty infindingAustralian shows that would get a high rating from the public, which, as I have said, has the right to turn a switch to the left or to the right. Unfortunately, most Australian shows have a comparatively low rating. Do not let us try to make political capital out of this matter one way or the other. Let us try to build up the Australian side of the industry in a reasonably constructive way. In conclusion, I thank the Government for having accepted in principle the amendments I have suggested. I am very pleased to know that they will be drafted and presented to the Senate. speak again because I am perplexed. I listened carefully to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) on the motion for the second reading of the bill. In that speech he attacked the Opposition most violently and said that the bill as now drafted would enable the Labour party, if it came to power, to do the most dastardly things to television in Australia. So disturbed was he by the loopholes which he said existed in the bill that he announced his intention to move the amendments that he outlined. He was very indignant then. Now he has risen again. No amendments have been moved and apparently he now believes that there are no loopholes in the bill. He has thanked the Government for accepting in principle the ideas that he enunciated in his earlier speech, in the course of which he said that this was a",74,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

He said that that would be done not at the direction of the caucus of the Labour party, but at the direction of people outside the Parliament. There is an astounding difference between Mackellar was saying. I hope the honorthe long speech that he delivered in the second-reading debate and the second second-reading speech, if 1 may so describe it, which he delivered just now. In his committee speech he said, "" I discard the utterances that I made earlier. I say now, in order to get on the band waggon, that I believe that television programmes in this country should be provided to a much greater degree by Australian artists. I say that more Australian artists should be employed in television than are employed at present."" He has tried to outdo the members of the Opposition. We proposed that 55 per cent, of transmission time should be given to Australian artists, and our proposal was rejected by the Government. The honourable member for Mackellar has gone further than that and has said that television stations should be operated only by companies that have a standing in Australia, not by companies with only a standing overseas. I welcome this support by the honourable member for our proposition that a greater percentage of the television programmes in Australia should be provided by Australian singers, Australian dramatists and Australian artists of other types. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, the television of this country is the television of America. I was in America for three months. I am on.

Chairman, the honourable member for Scullin has admitted that he is making a second-reading speech. I cannot find any clause in the bill to which his remarks could be considered as relevant. Order!

IfI follow his example, he at least will believe that I am not far wrong.

177,Mr Davidson (Dawson,"Postmastersuggestions which he stated briefly during his second-reading speech and which he has since discussed with me. I have informed the honourable member that I believe one of his amendments is very sound and desirable, but further consideration of it is necessary from the drafting angle. It may be that on consideration an alternative method of achieving the result sought can be developed. I wish to have a further look at the other suggested amendments before committing myself, and I have assured the honourable member that attention will be given to them in another place. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. Public Service. Motion (by Mr Davidson) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. desire to raise two matters which involve rather serious charges against the Public Service Board. The first relates to a matter I raised in this Parliament recently showing how the board was discriminating against ex-servicemen in favour of other applicants for positions. I quoted the case of an ex-serviceman with a 50 per cent, war disability pension who had applied for a clerical position in the Public Service and had been accepted. However, on perusal of his repatriation file, the board refused to appoint the applicant because it was stated that he would not be physically able to carry out the duties of the position. The ex-serviceman concerned is of good build and is carrying out very laborious work at the present time, and has been doing so consistently since his discharge. Because of his disabilities, naturally he felt that a clerical position would be more satisfactory and, therefore, he applied for the vacancy. As I have stated, he was accepted in the first instance but was subsequently refused appointment due to the report of the Repatriation Commission. I approached the Prime Minister( Mr The position carried a lesser salary than he Menzies) and in this House asked that the ex-serviceman be examined by a specialist. 1 received a letter to the effect that even if the man were examined by a specialist whose report was favorable, that report would have to be considered by the board and its medical advisers in the light of departmental requirements. The letter continuedSpecialists are not always completely familiar with departmental requirements, or with the circumstances governing the fixing of medical standards for admission to the Commonwealth Service. While their reports are fully considered, for the reasons stated they are not necessarily accepted as a definite guide to the final course of action. I forwarded that letter to the person concerned and received from him a communication which readsOn reading your extract from "" Hansard"" dated Wednesday, the 12th March, 1958, it gave me a great deal of satisfaction and a feeling that all I had sacrificed in security of a career and good health had not been in vain. At least I had a stalwart who was prepared to stand up in the proper place and ventilate to those in the right quarter my case, which I state is one of victimisation. I had served as a cadet and constable in the New South Wales Police Force since 1937, straight from school and it was from this department I had enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy. On my return from active service I was debarred from returning to the career from which I enlisted and supposedly had protection under the Re-establishment and Re-employment Act of 1945, through my accepted war disabilities. As I look back now I would have been better off in both health and security if I had stayed put and had not given sway to my strong-felt patriotism to help my country in the hour of need. Since that time my disabilities have caused me to give up my own business in which I was progressing in a very successful manner. My health was not up to the task of carrying on. These circumstances were all caused by my disabilities. And now I find the Commonwealth will not defend my case; particulars of which have been put forward, as aforementioned, to those concerned by Mr Daly, M.H.R. It seems that the disabilities from which I suffer will always debar and stop me from obtaining a position which will give me a career of security for the future, something which I had when I enlisted. Now when the Commonwealth is able to assist me in obtaining a position of security, it is found lacking. The person to whom I refer was not endeavouring to obtain a position involving laborious work or one the nature of which would have seriously affected his health. was then receiving, but he was, nevertheless, debarred from the Public Service because he is in receipt of a war pension.",76,Broadcasting And Television Happily There Is Still A Healthy Measure Of Inde

I refer now to another matter which I readshave raised during question time.

I have before me particulars of a case in which a man was accepted for employment in the Public Service in a temporary capacity. He subsequently approached me and stated that in the first place he had been advised that he had failed the examination for permanency, but on recheck it was stated that he had passed. As his appointment was not proceeded with he contacted the Public Service Board and asked whether something could not be done to hasten his appointment. I brought this case to the notice of the Public Service Board and received in reply a letter from the Sydney office, dated 23rd October, which readsThe present position in this case is that the Public Service Board is unwilling to proceed with Mr 's appointment for administrative reasons. Their reasons are not connected with the fact that an error was originally made in computing his examination marks. After receipt of that letter I wrote to Sir William Dunk, chairman of the Public Service Board of Commissioners and received a letter dated 10th February, 1958, which stated, inter aliaThe question of Mr 's appointment has been reviewed and the board does not propose to proceed with his appointment. This, as already advised to you by the Public Service Inspector in Sydney, is for administrative reasons, and the board is not prepared to amplify that statement. What are the administrative reasons? Subsequently, I asked the man concerned questions as to his political associations and other personal matters of that nature, not because of my interest in them, but in order to ascertain whether the board was taking action against him for political reasons. ask the Postmaster-General( MrI shall read now to the House a letter he forwarded me after advising that he has never at any time been a member of any subversive organization or affiliated in any way with any organization which would debar him from employment.

We both decided that the only way to get ahead and secure our future was to study. After failing in the 1955 exam., I enrolled at Cleveland Street Evening College and attended four nights a week through 1956, successfully passing that year's exam. My pass was achieved mainly because of the confidence and home coaching of my wife, who has never failed to encourage me in whatever I have undertaken. T was dux of my school, but economic necessity curtailed my secondary education, completing only first year at Canterbury HighI had a few jobs up till the war, all dead-end, was unsettled after overseas service in the Army, and did not take advantage of the C.R.S.

I am 35 years of age and have never been charged with any crime, although after kicking my brain along for fifteen months, all to (so far) no avail, I certainly feel like indulging in a little justifiable mayhem. I have never at any time belonged to a subversive organisation, whilst firmly believing that a person's politics should have nothing to do with appointments to the P.S. I was demoted recently in position and salary as a direct result of my lack of permanency. My work and conduct are quite satisfactory to the O.I.C. of my Section. I hope you can do something to unravel this mystery. I submit that this man has been refused appointment on political grounds, and there must be a security file, or something of the kind, relating to him. This sort of thing could happen to any of us. The man in question may have been debarred on account of his politics, his religion, or something else, at the whim of some person who does not like him for some reason or other. This is a matter that must be ventilated. There may be many moTe such cases. Certain Public Service associations have indicated that security files on certain members of the Public Service are kept. I ask the Prime Minister to investigate this case personally. On the facts as presented to me, an injustice is being done to the man involved, because, although he has all the qualifications required, including that of being an ex-serviceman, he is being refused appointment. example of scandalous ill-treatment, if the facts have been correctly stated to me, and f ask for an inquiry.

The Commonwealth Trading Bank, which is required by law to maintain a Special Account, took over the business of the General Banking Division in December, 1953. Local Government Finance. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. Are local governing bodies throughout Australia, generally speaking, in a parlous financial position? 2. Do the financial difficulties of these authorities arise principally from the rapid growth of population due largely to the high intake of immigrants? 3. Does this rightly place an obligation on the Commonwealth, particularly as it is responsible for ihe functioning of the immigration scheme and the control and regulation of financial policy in this country? 4. If so, what steps does the Government contemplate to discharge this obligation? The following answers to questions were circulated:Commonwealth Bank Special Accounts. Mr Luchetti asked the Treasurer, upon noticeOn what dates and in what amounts since 30th This is another June, 1952, were (a) calls made from the trading banks to the special accounts of the Commonwealth Bank and (b) releases made?

As local authority matters do not come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth I am unable to express an authoritative opinion on the extent or causes of any financial difficulties whicn local authorities may be experiencing. 3 and 4. Successive Commonwealth governments have taken the view that, as the functions and sources of finance of local authorities are determined by the State parliaments and as the States are responsible for local authority matters, it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to attempt to assume financial responsibility for local authority matters. Each State government is, of course, at",77,Adjournment

Mr Clark asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r National Development, upon notice1. Has the price of lead fallen to uneconomic levels in the past twelve months? 2. Has this caused a loss of spending power in Broken Hill to the extent of £55,000 per pay and necessitated the loss of one day's work a fortnight, with a consequent effect on the local and national economy to which Broken Hill is a very great contributor? 3. Has this position been caused chiefly by the United Kingdom and Russia flooding the market by selling their stock piles? 4. If so, will he make representations to the United Kingdom Government to withhold its stocks? 5. Will he point out the serious effect these sales are having on Australia's economy and the urgency and importance of enabling the lead industry to recover? Development has replied as follows:1. The substantial fall in the price of lead has caused considerable concern to Australian producers Some small producers have ceased production although the larger producers are continuing operations. The present level of lead prices would leave little, if any, margin of profit to any producer. 2. The loss in spending power in Broken Hill resulting from the reduction in the lead bonus and the loss of one day's pay a fortnight may amount to £55,000 per pay as suggested, but the average rate of pay in Broken Hill is still well above the level prevailing generally ih Australia. The reduction of lead output at Broken Hill is intended to help bring production and consumption into balance and so eventually to increase the price. 3. The disposal of stocks by the United Kingdom Government was not in itself a major factor in the decline of the lead price since April, 1957. For some years the United States Government has been taking excess production off world markets by direct stockpile purchase and through barter arrangements involving agricultural products. "" Prompt"" metal became in short supply and prices were lifted to high levels. With the termination of barter transactions in mid-1957, the prices first fell to lower levels; then, as consumption fell in the United States with continued recession in business activity, the available surplus of lead further increased and prices declined to their present abnormally low level. Although small quantities of Russian lead have recently been sold in Western Europe, there has never been any question of Russian sales being responsible for the present state of the lead market. 4 and 5. The Australian Government has informed the United Kingdom of its views towards the United Kingdom's disposals of lead. Subsequently the United Kingdom reduced the rate of disposal. Trunk Lines. Mr Griffiths asked the Postmaster General, upon notice\. How many trunk-line channels operatebetween Newcastle and Brisbane? 2. How many cities and towns, including Newcastle, use these channels? 3. What is the average number of calls registered daily? 4. How many trunk lines operate between Sydney and Brisbane? 5. How many calls daily are made between. Sydney and Brisbane and between Newcastle, and places north of Newcastle and Brisbane, using, the same channels? 6. Are Newcastle-Brisbane calls ever madethrough Sydney channels; if so, how often? 7. Are Sydney calls to Brisbane made through Newcastle; if so, how often? 8. Are existing trunk-line facilities betweenNewcastle and Brisbane considered to be satisfactory? 9. Is any improvement contemplated? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. One direct trunk channel is available. 2. This channel is used for calls between Brisbane and Newcastle and about 30 other centres, in the Newcastle area. Traffic is also disposed of over alternative routes via Grafton and Lismore and some Brisbane to Newcastle traffic is handled via Sydney. 3. One hundred and fifteen. 4. Forty-nine. 5. One thousand one hundred and sixty callsSydney to Brisbane; 780 calls Brisbane to Sydney: 160 calls between Newcastle and places north of Newcastle and Brisbane. 6. No. 7. No. 8. Present facilities are not completely adequate. 9. Yes. Plans provide for all NewcastleBrisbane traffic to be routed via Sydney. Additional automatic trunk switching equipment will' be installed at Sydney and the Sydney-Brisbane trunk-line group will be increased by twelve channels. This relief is expected in May, 1958, when operators at Newcastle and Brisbane will be able to dial via Sydney direct to the called subscriber in Brisbane and Newcastle respectively without the intervention of other operators. It .s also planned to provide 34 additional channels between Newcastle and Sydney in about six months'time, after which a "" no delay"" serviceshould be available between the Newcastle and Brisbane areas.

Entry Permit Application Forms. Mr Ward asked the Ministerf o r I m m i gration, upon notice1.

If so, why is such a question omitted? the member's questions are as 3. From what source does his department secure its information for the preparation of the tables published in its statistical bulletins regarding the nationality of new arrivals in this country? able member's questions are as follows:1. and 2. All application forms used in connection with entry permits to Australia do contain a question as to the country of birth of the applicant or nominee. 3. The information on which the nationality tables, contained in the statistical bulletins issued by the Department of Immigration are based, is supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. The Statistician does not use entry permit application forms for the compilation of migration statistics, as many permits which are granted are not subsequently used; additionally, there may be an interval of time between the issue of a permit and the time when it is used. The documents actually used by the Statistician are ships' passenger lists and aircraft passenger cards. These contain information on nationality, but do not at present include any question on birthplace; these forms have recently been amended, and the new forms to come into operation from 1st July, 1958, will contain such a question.
