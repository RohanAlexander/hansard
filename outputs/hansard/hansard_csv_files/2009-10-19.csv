But it is really Monday, 19 October 2009 ----Tangney Electorate: Medical Workforce Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (4.00 pm)-Just two weeks ago, a major doctors surgery in my electorate abruptly closed its doors after giving its 4½ thousand patients only a few days notice. Only a short distance away is another major clinic which closed last year, again leaving thousands of patients without access to their GPs. In both cases, the closures were ordered by their corporate owners-major enterprises which have bought up local surgeries across Australia. These closures have caused immeasurable distress, particularly to older constituents who are not able to travel to more distant clinics, which are increasingly turning away new patients anyway because they are so overloaded. The most recent to close its doors was the Murdoch Centre, which has been providing for the local community for some 40 years, including a major retirement complex for RAF veterans and their widows. The corporate operator has told patients to travel to another clinic in a different suburb or, alternatively, pay $22 for copies of their own medical records so that they can go to another GP-pay for their own records. The previous clinic to close was the Farrington Medical Centre, whose doctors sought to continue operating privately but were told they would be in breach of their contract if they did so. In all, thousands of my constituents have lost access to their GPs in just a few months and thousands more are unable to get appointments with doctors in their areas. The system is simply not working. While I accept these corporate health enterprises must satisfy their shareholders, there are bigger issues at stake. It is simply unacceptable that patients, some of whom have attended the same surgery for more than 30 years and are now in their eighties, are told with only a few days notice that they will no longer have access to their doctors. It is simply unacceptable that people are being told that their local surgeries are overloaded and that no new patients will be accepted for the foreseeable future. Medical centres are commercial enterprises but they are also public services, and with that comes an obligation to the community. It is bad enough that these clinics are being closed and that those which remain are so overwhelmed by demand that they are unable to meet community need. But to then discover that doctors at the corporate practices are contractually barred from setting up new surgeries in the same area for some years is abhorrent. When will this government act? When will this government care? Kingston Electorate: Hallett Cove Preschool Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (4.03 pm)-I am very pleased to rise today to wish a very happy birthday to the Hallett Cove Preschool, which I visited on 22 September when they held their 20th birthday celebration. It was very nice to see a lot of people there who in fact had attended that kindergarten and whose children were now attending that kindergarten. It was a very special day. I had the pleasure of unveiling a beautiful mural, which was created by the enthusiastic children under the leadership of John Whitney. DECS officials were also there. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
153,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 4 Pm.,"I wanted to talk a bit about the Hallett Cove Preschool, because there is a unique and special element to the school: they have an incredibly strong environmental focus and have long been considered leaders in this area. They have a great motto, which is ‘Reducing, reusing and recycling’. This strong environmental focus has encouraged all the children there to engage in activities that develop ecologically sustainable practices, skills and ideas. The preschool’s environmental focus is evident through their environmental policy: they have set a target to become carbon neutral by 2011. The environment has been a key focus of the director and staff at the Hallett Cove Preschool since its opening in 1989. Awareness was established by planting waterwise native plants, particularly those native to the local area of Hallett Cove. In addition, they have been encouraging children to take care of their preschool’s private vegetable garden, the produce from which is sold to the local community. The Hallett Cove Preschool is an ecologically sustainable site, storing and using sunshine and rain. The rainwater is collected and saved in a 22,000-litre tank and is used to water the vegie patch and surrounding lawns. Power is generated by the 24 solar panels on the roof and is used to provide electricity for the centre, and remaining power is fed back into the grid. It is great to see that the children attending the Hallett Cove Preschool are learning some very important environmental values at such an early age. I am sure that these children, as we have often seen previously, will take some of these environmentally friendly ideas back home and teach their mums and dads a few handy tips. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the director, Heather, all the staff, the board of management and all the parents and children. It was a wonderful day. McMillan Electorate: Medicare whether you are a frontbencher, a minister, a Prime Minister or a Deputy Speaker of the House, we are all backbenchers reliant on our constituents’ support. Those that hold leadership in this place are backbenchers with a job. Even former Prime Minister John Howard was still seeing constituents regularly in the position of Prime Minister. That is why for me the Moe and District Residents Association’s plea for a Medicare office in Moe has to be heeded by us and this government. For a long time since the removal of the Medicare office in Moe, 13 or more years ago, they have been pleading for its return. I would like to table two documents where this association and its secretary have written to the chief executive officer of Medicare, in Tuggeranong, and asked a range of questions so that they can set themselves up properly to ask again for the reinstatement of a Medicare office in Moe. There have been major constituent calls to me, and I made application to the previous federal government on this issue. They have not given up now that there is a new government in place. As a community that is large, resourceful and responsible they would like to think that they would be rewarded with a Medicare office in their area. They do not even mind if it is joined with another agency. They do not mind if they have other federal agencies come in and share it. They talk to me about wanting better post office facilities. They talk to me about wanting access to other facilities that are given to people in Morwell and to people in Pakenham but not to people in Moe. It is only reasonable that as a community of 17,000 people they have the same facilities that we offer people in the cities or in other areas. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Constituency Statements
154,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (4.06 Pm),"One thing we remember in this place is that,All of you know about the difficulties of public transport in regional areas; I could talk to you about that for hours. But the most important thing here is that it is a $40 round trip for people to come from Yallourn North to Moe or up to Morwell to go to the Medicare office there. So it is not an unreasonable request. They have not had a response to their correspondence and they have written again to the chief executive officer of Medicare. I would like to table these two documents and offer my respects to the Moe and District Residents Association for their genuine requests for a Medicare office. Solomon Electorate: Housing been engaged in in the last four weeks. While doorknocking in my electorate of Solomon, focusing on the satellite city of Palmerston outside Darwin, one of the issues that was raised a lot with me was about affordable accommodation and rental prices within my electorate and how the cost of housing in the Darwin and Palmerston areas will hinder our future prospects in the north, with Inpex and other major projects coming online. That was one of the issues that were coming up a lot on the doorsteps. I held a housing forum and I had great support from the local industry with the major stakeholders that came along and spoke. There were a raft of different ideas that came up, from the Northern Territory government continuing to roll out more land to greater access to cheaper land for people who want to buy into the market. Certainly the federal government’s incentive for first home owners has been very popular in the Northern Territory, with some 1,100 of those options taken up. Also, the federal government has committed $60 million to crisis accommodation in my electorate, as well as 185 houses to the Defence Housing Authority in the suburbs of Lyons and Muirhead which will take some of the Defence Force people out of the private rental market and free that up a little bit for other people. It is opportune that, at a time when we have a shortage of skilled tradesmen in Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister has announced $100 million funding to help get more apprentices. It was really disturbing to see a 20 per cent drop in traditional trades over the past 12 months. Not having tradesmen to work on houses puts extra costs on the industry and extra costs on building a home, and these costs are obviously passed on to the consumer. So it is really important that over the remainder of this year incentives are put in place so that businesses can go ahead and put on apprentices. The rebate has basically been tripled. It used to be around $1,500. The bonus is now almost $5,000; it has gone up to $4,850. This is about stimulating the apprenticeship industry-21,000 additional apprentices. That can only be a good thing. I would like to commend the Deputy Prime Minister for the contribution that she has made. It is very important. It is certainly very important to the building industry and it is very important to the consumers in my electorate of Solomon.

157,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.12 Pm),"Tomorrow marks the beginning of the final schoolmost important gift in a child’s life, as it provides them with a greater opportunity to make informed decisions, and this knowledge can never be taken away from them. As the parent of a child who is one of the many thousands of students set to commence exams tomorrow, I would like to share with the House the same advice I gave to my son, Robbie, and his friends: the importance of the Higher School Certificate cannot, and should not, be understated. However, the exams are not the be-all and end-all. For some, the results of the exams will provide the pathway to university, college or TAFE; for others it will mark the conclusion of their formal education. However, whatever the result of the exams, nothing is set in stone; there is always the opportunity to forge new paths and engage in further learning. Some of my greatest learning experiences are a result of the circumstances that I found myself in during day-to-day life events and in conversations I have had with many people I have come across. I encourage all students to remember this as they prepare to embark on a new chapter of their lives, post exams, as they never know in what direction life might lead them. I left school when I was 15 and, as such, never had the opportunity to complete the Higher School Certificate. While I would love the opportunity to continue my schooling, my personal circumstances have made it difficult to do so. However, I never did let this get in the way of what I wanted to achieve later in life. I feel very privileged in my role as the federal member for Paterson. It is a true honour to represent the constituents in the electorate of Paterson. Many people would probably assume that to become a politician you need a degree or a diploma, and it is true that most politicians have such qualifications. However, I want to remind all students that they can do whatever they put their minds to. My message to the students is this: believe in yourselves with the same faith that you place in your friends and families because you are just as worthy of your own love and encouragement. My best wishes to the students of the St Philip’s Christian College, Medowie Christian School, Hunter Valley Grammar School, Maitland Christian School, Bulahdelah Central School, Tomaree High School, Hunter River High School, Dungog High School, Gloucester High School, Maitland High School, Irrawang High School, St Mary’s Maitland, Maitland Grossman High School and Great Lakes College Tuncurry senior campus-and to all students completing their final exams. Lastly, as you prepare for the Higher School Certificate exams and for the next chapter of your lives, remember to commit to achieving your own personal best, not someone else’s, and to be content in knowing that you gave it your all. It is all that can be asked or expected of you. Adelaide Electorate: Northfield Primary School Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport) (4.14 pm)-I rise today to draw to the attention of the Main Committee of the House, and indeed to pass on my congratulations, to a wonderful school within the electorate of Adelaide that has recently been given an invitation for two of its year 7 students as well as one of its teachers to represent Australia as the only representatives from Australia to attend an international youth conference in Italy. Earlier this month I was fortunate enough to meet with the two year 7 student representatives from Northfield Primary School, Cassandra Marin and Mira Abushama, who will travel to Italy to attend the Europe and Beyond: Talks about Frontiers conference. This is a five-day conference focused on building intercultural dialogue amongst students from around the globe who will share their ideas and share their work towards action on a whole range of issues, from animal rights and cliMAIN COMMITTEE mate change to education perspectives and a whole lot of the issues which are important to these amazing young people. We know that conferences such as this are vital in shaping our future leaders to have unique perspectives, useful insights and important opinions. Particularly for these two young girls, but also for their teacher Jennifer Rossiter, this will be a lifechanging experience. They will meet young leaders from around the world who I am sure they will build contacts with and stay in touch with for many years to come. This is a tremendous tribute to Northfield Primary School. It is a school that flies the United Nations flag as a United Nations Global Peace School. It is an achievement that through this conference some of the school’s key values will be taken to the international stage. I have had the opportunity to work with this amazing primary school on a range of issues, including when I have previously informed the House of the campaign that their students ran to use sports, in this case soccer, to raise both funds and awareness of the plight of victims of natural disasters in our region. The kids themselves put on charity soccer games to raise money to send overseas. The relationship that Northfield Primary School has had with many of these issues is part of an online friendship with a school in Italy that was built some years ago. It is important that we recognise as a parliament just how far these collaborations between our local primary schools, local students and those on the other side of the planet can have towards breaking down cultural barriers and uniting individuals with a common vision. I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Northfield Primary School students all the very best in their travels as they fly the Australian flag for us at the conference, and I commend the school for another fantastic achievement. Swan Electorate: Southcare I rise to talk about Southcare, a community based organisation in my electorate of Swan which provides caring services. Last TuesdayI attended Southcare’s AGM and was pleased to hear about the progress being made on a project that I feel privileged to have played a part in-the construction of a new building to help Southcare expand its services to frail and Indigenous people. Members may recall that in Labor’s first budget in 2008 it revoked $273,000 worth of funding which had been allocated to Southcare by the Howard government under the Regional Partnerships scheme. At the time Southcare was informed via a letter in the post that they would have to do without the funding. That was after they had purchased the land for $640,000 from fundraising and donations, had $490,000 committed from Lotterywest and had out laid $20,000 themselves in architect fees, planning approvals and project proposals. I immediately wrote to Minister Albanese to express my concern and lobbied extensively Gary Gray, the member for Brand, for funding to be reinstated. A couple of months later the lobbying paid off, with Mr Albanese announcing that Southcare would be provided with funding for its project. At Tuesday’s AGM we saw in the annual report the sound financial position of Southcare and the state of the construction project as a result of this funding. Last financial year $75,000 was provided to Southcare by the Department of Transport and Regional Services, and the project: … has completed up to the installation of footings, concrete slabs for office and garden stores and the completion of brickwork for ground floor to plate height.

158,Mr Irons (Swan) (4.18 Pm),"At the beginning of Carers Week 2009 it seems fitting thatAt the request of Southcare, asking which government member they should have at the AGM, I suggested they invite the member for Brand, Gary Gray, to be the guest speaker for the AGM. The member for Brand had been influential in getting the funding. I suggested the member for Brand so he could see for himself the results of the funding and the good work that it will do in the local community. The member for Brand, to his credit, recognised the worthiness of the project and congratulated the Howard government for initially providing the funding. The member even gave me credit for getting the funding reinstated. His honest and non-partisan speech was refreshing and appreciated by the audience and I would like to publicly thank him today for attending. The member also reminded us of all the hit songs from 27 years ago when Southcare was first formed. Thankfully, the member only spoke about them and did not actually sing them! I would also like to acknowledge the presence of Inge Dahners, who I nominated for a senior’s award last year for her outstanding work as a director of aged-care programs. She was recognised as a runner-up in her category. It was good to see Vice Chairman Kevin Trent, CEO Graham Hope, Volunteer Coordinator Vicki McBeth and Chief Financial Officer Gordon Chong also in attendance. I will continue to support Southcare as I believe it is important to support the organisations that care for our older people, particularly in the midst of an agedcare crisis in Western Australia. Corio Electorate: Heritage Listings Last week, some of Geelong’s most treasured heritage buildings were extended a lifeline by the Rudd government when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, visited our city and announced funding for conservation projects from the $650 million jobs fund. This is great news for Geelong. We are a city with remarkable early heritage, but it is often overshadowed by our development as a city of industry. Because of that, we do not regard ourselves as a heritage city in quite the same ways that some other cities do, but in my opinion we have just as much and, in some ways, even more to be proud of. Geelong has the best collection of heritage buildings adjacent to Port Phillip Bay. Many of our buildings are unique to our city and to the settlement of the colony. In our Botanic Gardens, a small Gothic style weatherboard building was Geelong’s first customs house. It was prefabricated and shipped from Sydney in 1838, and it is now considered to be the oldest authenticated building in existence in Victoria. A more substantial customs house, dating from 1856, is one of the few examples of the colonial Georgian style to have survived in Victoria. Our old telegraph station is another colonial gem and one of the first buildings in Victoria to be built of barrable free stone. We have Victoria’s oldest church in continuous use. Our town hall is one of the oldest centres of local government and our train station is one of the largest from its era. The list goes on. Sadly, our failure to value heritage at times has seen us lose some significant buildings over the decades. This has led some of us to believe that our city is not beautiful, and that is a real shame because our city is exceptionally beautiful. Some think that we do not have the boom time boulevards to compare with Bendigo or Ballarat, but I believe that ours could be even better, and I am bold enough to say it in the presence of the member for Ballarat. To look at the buildings that lie in Ryrie Street between Yarra and Gheringhap streets is to see a treasure MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Constituency Statements

There are heritage buildings that can show us the way forward. The Fletcher Jones building in Moorabool Street is a great example of a retail building that celebrates its character. We think of Corio Bay as our best asset, but our city’s built heritage is potentially our greatest tourist attraction. It tells the story of Geelong better than any history book, but it just needs some care and attention, and that requires effort. We need a whole-of-city commitment, and today I call upon the owners of our city centre’s buildings and the council to work together to meet this challenge of restoring our city’s heritage. Our city forefathers had a vision; the city streets that sweep down toward the bay were built for a reason; they show pride in a town that quickly established its credentials as a major commercial centre. Herbert Electorate: Police and Community Youth Clubs the best tropical university in the world which, as you know, is James Cook University. This afternoon I want to refer to the Townsville Police Citizens Youth Welfare Association, affectionately known as PCYC. It is the best PCYC in Queensland, and I think there is universal recognition of that through the police service and also through the community. It is wonderful to be able to report that to the parliament this afternoon. Under the very capable leadership of Sergeant Gil Napper, the organisation has just blossomed. In 2008 the branch had a 37 per cent growth in membership, but it has doubled again in the last year and there are now 2½ thousand members. And it is wonderful to see all the programs. PCYCs are often seen as entities that look after young Australians, but the Townsville PCYC in Wellington Street in Aitkenvale has the whole gamut, from the youngest to the oldest. Seniors enjoy it as much as youngsters do. It has a family feeling. Everybody knows one another by their first name, and that is wonderful thing. The PCYC have introduced some key programs. For example, the successful Support and Strengthening Program looks at youth from nine to 14 years of age who are at risk of disengaging, or have disengaged, from learning or are experiencing significant behavioural issues. Through sport and recreational platforms, the program helps these youth to re-engage. It rescues them. Gil and his team have achieved a success rate of 88 per cent, which is wonderful. The PCYC welcomes these young people, whom nobody else wants to know about-the education system does not want to know about them and the police force and the community have trouble with them-with open arms. The kids have a wonderful time re-engaging and gaining life experience. Thank you, too, to the Chairperson of the Branch Management Committee, Christine Alderson. She has been doing a wonderful job leading the committee and supporting the police officers. The family atmosphere that has developed there, with mothers, fathers, grandparents and children regularly spending time at the branch, is a wonderful outcome. Other community organisations are also involved, like the Smith Family, the Gambling Community Benefit Fund, Perpetual Funding, the Townsville City Council, Community Renewal Townsville, the Australian Federal Attorney-General’s Department, the Queensland government, the North Queensland Fury Football Club, the Townsville Basketball AssociaMAIN COMMITTEE",174,Constituency Statements

Ballarat Electorate: Health Reform Consultation Ms KING (Ballarat) (4.27 pm)-Last TuesdayI had the opportunity to discuss the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission’s final report with the local branch of the Australian Medical Association in Ballarat. In attendance were local GPs, surgeons, cancer specialists, obstetricians and emergency department physicians. I want to thank them for their engagement and interest in what has been the most significant set of reform proposals that I have seen in the time that I have been involved in the health sector. The purpose of the discussion was, firstly, to go through the key recommendations of the commission’s report and, secondly, to gain a local perspective on how they may or may not work on the ground. The report focuses on tackling the major access and equity issues that affect people now; redesigning our health system to meet emerging challenges; and creating an agile, responsive and self-improving health system for future generations. Not all 123 recommendations were discussed by the local AMA branch, but the issues raised included the challenge emergency departments face as they become increasingly busy. Continued concerns about managing workforce shortages were raised. Members looked at how we may tackle the increasing demand for elective surgery and the growing numbers of public dental waiting list patients. We recognised the lack of scope in terms of preventive health strategies. The discussion was broad and dynamic. The group agreed on many points and disagreed on others. In particular, there were a range of perspectives on the practicalities of separating out emergency and elective surgeries in a regional setting. Whilst emergency physicians felt that this would be a sensible option to ensure beds for emergency patients, others were concerned about surgeons losing the capacity to work across elective and emergency cases and the potential dangers if elective lists were shifted to larger metropolitan centres. I have undertaken to pass these concerns on to the Prime Minister in the Minister for Health and Ageing’s consultation process. The 123 recommendations contained in the report represent a significant challenge, particularly as we consider the costs of reform and the options that may be available to offset these costs. There are an enormous amount of vested interests and politics in health, and it has been important that the discussions around the proposals have been occurring in community settings with a wide diversity of health professionals. I commend the Prime Minister and the minister for health on the level of consultation they are personally undertaking, with some 58 consultations undertaken so far. I am pleased that my community has been able to contribute in a small way. The reform of our nation’s health system is important and we are determined to get it right. The conversation in health is happening across the country and it is particularly important that health professionals and consumers contribute. I want to encourage those who have an interest and who have not yet done so to have a good look at the report, to jump on the website www.yourhealth.gov.au and contribute their views to this important health reform. time for members’ statements has concluded. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Constituency Statements
161,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"In accordance with standing order 193, theSecond Reading Debate resumed from 10 September, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time. tralian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 are intended to alleviate pressure on hospitals and the health system-a health system this government said it would have fixed by mid this year. Kevin Rudd’s supposed miracle cure for the hospital system has turned out to be nothing short of snake oil-not that this Prime Minister seems to care. A central plank to his election win was his takeover carrot, and now he is setting himself up to repackage it at the next election. Rather than having fixed the system as promised, it is now almost unanimously accepted that Australia’s health system is under unprecedented pressure. Our state public hospitals are at capacity and in many cases nearing breaking point. The most recent public hospital report card of the AMA claims that major metropolitan teaching hospitals operate with a bed occupancy rate of 95 per cent or above-a long way from being fixed. Notwithstanding additional expenditure the report states: Waiting times are still increasing and waiting lists are still too long. This is evidence of the Prime Minister pouring money into a system he knows is broken yet refuses to fix. The Prime Minister’s six months of consultation on the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission review is not going to reveal anything different and is clearly just a stalling tactic. Ms Hall-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I understand that members can talk on things other than the legislation, but we are actually talking about the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill and the member has made absolutely no reference to it. menced his remarks and I will allow him to continue, but he will draw himself back to the bill or I am sure the member for Shortland will do it for us. ways hand-wringing and never has anything positive to say. have to be relevant to the bill. measures to alleviate pressure on the public hospital system is rightly supported by both sides of politics. However, it is the policy measures employed where stark differences arise. There is a fine line for government in such a debate. Informing people of risks associated with certain lifestyle choices can easily drift into telling people how to live their lives and attempting to socially engineer a homogenous lifestyle for the latest government citizenry. The Minister for Health and Ageing penned an article in the Punch recently by the title of ‘I’m no nanny, it’s about saving lives and the system’ and, in doing so, acknowledged the Orwellian-like concerns associated with government going down this path. The issue is complex. As unpalatable as it may be, the taxpayers should pick up the bill through the health system for someone who lives their life with reckless disregard for the health consequences.

166,Mr Dutton,"Certainly, Madam Deputy Speaker. The objective of preventative healthGovernment intrusion into an individual’s life and lifestyle should always be closely scrutinised. This bill states the functions of the agency through the CEO will include the following: first, advise and make recommendations to the minister, ministerial council and various governments on matters relating to preventive health; second, gather, analyse and disseminate information; third, conduct awareness campaigns; fourth, make financial assistance grants on behalf of the Commonwealth; fifth, develop national standards and codes of practice; sixth, manage schemes and provide awards; and, finally, any other function as determined by the minister. Quite a wide scope. So, whilst we have been given an initial indication of the reach of the agency, it is by no means an exhaustive list. The statistics on the impact of obesity, tobacco and alcohol on quality of life and on our health system are confronting. With 32 per cent of Australia’s burden of disease attributable to modifiable risk factors, there is capacity to alleviate pressures on hospitals and the health budget. Preventative health measures which deliver tangible health outcomes assist in ensuring the viability of the health system as we move forward. I was surprised to hear the minister state in her second reading speech: In the past the prevention effort was neglected. I would strongly disagree with that statement as, I suspect, would other members on both sides of the House. I would suggest to the minister that we are fortunate in Australia that the objective of preventative health, fundamentally the reduction of premature illness and death, is generally supported by both sides of parliament. If we look objectively at the efforts of previous governments, improvements have been made by both sides through changes in tobacco excise, education and awareness campaigns, immunisation, bowel cancer screening and breast and cervical cancer screening to name just a few. Significant gains have been made. From 1996 to 2007 the coalition government also invested $1.8 billion in immunisations; a further $704 million in 2006 for the HPV and rotavirus vaccination program; $211 million from 1999 to 2007 to fight HIV-AIDS, hepatitis C and sexually transmitted infections; and $18.5 million in 2006 for the nation’s first national skin cancer awareness and education campaigns. The previous coalition government commenced funding of the Bowel Cancer Screening Pilot Program in 2000. Following the pilot, as part of the 2005-06 budget initiative Strengthening Cancer Care, the coalition provided $43.4 million for the phasing in of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. I acknowledge and give credit where it is due to the current government for continuing this important Howard government initiative, which reduces morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer. With respect to tobacco, the final death knell for tobacco advertising in this country-a complete ban on all international sport and cultural events-was announced by the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge of the Liberal government, on 2 November 2000. Interestingly also, this government refused the coalition’s proposal this year to increase the tobacco excise by 12.5 per cent to fund the proposed cuts to the private health insurance rebates. Instead, the minister pushed ahead with her attack which would have led to insurance downgrades and higher premiums and pushed people into the public system, hardly helping to build a sustainable health system. MAIN COMMITTEE Preventative measures cannot work in isolation. The health system needs to support early interventions in order to avoid disease progression. It is of little use spending $102 million in social marketing over four years, as proposed by this bill, if the government’s other policies increase the burden on public hospitals. The $102 million for social marketing that is proposed in this measure dwarfs the mere $16 million over four years the minister was trying to save by capping the Medicare safety net for injections into the eye. The minister boasts about her supposed efforts in preventative health-the new preventive health agency and its huge taxpayer investment in advertising. However, if you look at the tangible action that this minister has taken in this area, the reality quickly deflates all her embellished rhetoric. This minister has proceeded against all sensible advice and reasoning to halve the Medicare rebate for cataract surgery. Whilst the minister likes to silence any scrutiny of her ideological crusade, it is important, in the context of this bill, that we scrutinise this government’s record on preventative health. There are over 200,000 cataract operations annually in Australia and cataracts are currently the leading cause of blindness in the world. As elected representatives, we need to question whether it is right that this government spends an additional $102 million on marketing and $17 million on additional administration under this agency when they claim they cannot afford to continue providing mostly older Australians with a full rebate for this very important preventative procedure. The minister stated on 25 August 2009: If we are to embark on a next stage of health reform-to improve the health system for all of us-we will need to find further savings and efficiencies to fund our priorities. It should be very concerning to the Australian public that this minister believes areas to be targeted for savings should include vital life-changing-and in some cases life-saving-and preventative surgery, with those funds now to be used to fund advertising. Ms Hall-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I have been most patient. I have allowed the member for Dickson to talk at some length about an issue that has absolutely no relationship at all to this legislation. I would ask you to draw him back to the discussion on preventative health care. overpaid to justify changes. However, this minister only ever seems to quote the gross revenue of the top 10 per cent of medical practitioners. The minister does not elaborate on overheads, significant outgoings for technological upgrades and for equipment maintenance, staffing costs, the extensive training required and ongoing education for such specialties. Most importantly, this minister never acknowledges that the Medicare rebate is for patients, not for doctors. It is the patients who will be out of pocket, not the doctors. Not only does cataract surgery help prevent blindness; it endures any scrutiny that this government can apply in terms of the benefit to older Australians. These are people who are able to the bill.

I understood where you were going before with the analogy of prevention. I allowed it to continue and I did not allow the intervention from the member for Shortland. But I think you have strayed from the mark, going on to another bill, one that we have already debated in the parliament. I would call you back to the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill that is before the Main Committee at this point in time. way of clarification, the rebate which is proposed to be cut by half has not been the subject of a bill before the parliament.

On that basis, open-heart surgery would be preventative medicine. attempting to make to the member for Dickson is that the standing order requires relevance to the bill-the bill before us that we are debating at this point in time. I understand the point he is making, but he has to be relevant to the bill. posal to spend over $100 million on advertising, on social marketing. I am suggesting to the House that as people who are responsible for the administration of the taxpayer funds that are proposed to be spent under this bill we should question whether or not that is an appropriate expenditure of money compared to other measures which this government could spend money on in the health portfolio. That is the point that needs to be made today. This government is intent on building health bureaucracies. That is exactly what state Labor have done for the last 10 or 20 years. The difficulty for this government is that it has very great problems explaining to the Australian public why it is that it continues to bloat a health bureaucracy-not with people on the front line, not with doctors and not with nurses, not with people who are performing procedures that make life-changing events take place, such as cataract surgery for older Australians in particular-but by spending money on new agencies and putting money into advertising. That is what this bill proposes. For argument’s sake, this bill does not propose anywhere, on my reading of it, that they would abolish equivalent numbers of positions within the department. They do not propose that there would be an offset of a number of places within the department, many of which are already performing this same work. That is the difficulty that the government has in relation to this bill. There have been a number of recent comments which are relevant to this debate, and I think they are worth noting.

177,Mr Dutton,"In relation to the bill that is being debated at the moment, there is a proThe indiscriminate creation of new bodies, or the failure to adapt old bodies as their circumstances change, increases the risk of having inappropriate governance structures. This in turn jeopardises policy outcomes and poses financial risks to the taxpayer. The member went on to say: Incorporating a new function within a department is almost always the preferred option because of the difficulties a small body faces in meeting its own needs. Those opposite may be very interested-even the member for Shortland, with her limited understanding on this topic-to learn that those comments belong to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Hon. Lindsay Tanner, in a speech that he made to the Australian Institute of Company Directors on 14 October 2009. Quite obviously the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing in the Rudd government. It is quite extraordinary a week after the finance minister calls for a reduction of government agencies that the health minister creates another one. The finance minister is quite correct though. How can the establishment of another agency, the employment of more bureaucrats and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars for advertising be a priority when our hospitals are overflowing? The government cannot afford to provide cataract patients with a full rebate when they have tried to remove funding for macular degeneration patients. Will the agency, for argument’s sake, be assessed in terms of its contribution towards achieving the targets and benchmarks of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, or is this funding unconditional? Reviews, agencies and more bureaucrats should not be your priority, Minister. Patients should be. We learned that the advisory council of the agency will consist of up to 11 members, one member representing the Commonwealth government, one or two members representing state and territory governments and between five and eight members with expertise in preventative health, as nominated by health ministers or their delegates. Whilst the EM alludes to business and industry inclusion, it certainly is not specified. It is important that industry and business is very much a part of this process and that they are engaged. One of the most challenging aspects of preventative health is reaching a consensus on policy that will actually drive change. For policy to work in this area, it is important that engagement in the process is broad and inclusive. It will not succeed if a polarising us-and-them approach develops between academia, industry and business. TodayI have highlighted a number of reservations the coalition has with this bill. Firstly, there is the future reach of this agency-how far will it intrude into individuals’ rights to make their own lifestyle choices? Secondly, there is the duplicity of generating savings by cutting rebates for things such as cataract surgery and trying to remove assistance for people being treated for macular degeneration and then spending $102 million on lifestyle advertising and marketing. There is the lack of reasoning for another layer of bureaucracy. What savings will be made in the Department of Health and Ageing if preventative health is to be administered separately? Finally, there is the lack of engagement with industry to drive change. Clearly, from all of our consultation with stakeholders in this area, we can see that this is a government that refuses to consult. They do not consult because they do not like what people are saying. This is a government, now two years into its term, that has not lived up to its election promises in relation to health. This is a crucially important area, because for over a decMAIN COMMITTEE ade there has been a complete neglect and indeed in some cases trashing of the health system by state Labor governments. Preventative health is important-of course it is important. We all recognise that. But we do not need a government which is intent on building bureaucracies for the sake of doing it. We need tangible outcomes. We need for people to be engaged. We need there to be an idea of exactly how it is this group is going to engage with business and with industry and how it is that the Preventative Health Taskforce is going to deliver to the government the sorts of ideals that the government has not yet been able to enunciate. That is of course part of the problem with this government in relation to health. There is a lot of promise but very little delivery. Those are the concerns that the coalition expresses today in relation to this bill. We put the government on notice in relation to the areas that we will be looking at as we go forward. We would ask for the government to provide answers and responses to the legitimate questions that have so far been asked. to making the prevention of chronic disease a priority for our country’s health system. In opposition, the then leader of the opposition and now Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, spoke about the need for the Commonwealth government to invest a great deal more in prevention in order to ‘help deal with the rising incidence of chronic diseases’, ‘help prevent Australians from getting sick in the first place’ and reduce ‘their need to end up in hospital’. In the course of the election campaign in 2007, the Australian Labor Party outlined a number of promises, including making prevention a focus within the health system by developing a national preventive healthcare strategy and by broadening the focus of Australian healthcare agreements between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments so that they included a preventive healthcare partnership. In government, the Labor Party have acted on the commitments that we made from opposition and acted on the commitments that we made during the 2007 election campaign. In April 2008, the government commissioned an inquiry by the Preventative Health Taskforce, which reported on 30 June 2009, and preventive health care was the subject of an extensive agreement at the Council of Australian Governments in November 2008 to establish the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. The Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 establishes the preventive healthcare agency and, in doing so, it will establish an important component of the enabling infrastructure under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. The Commonwealth, as was outlined by the minister in her second reading speech, will provide funding of $133.2 million over four years for the agency, $102 million of which will be for a national-level social marketing campaign to reduce rates of obesity and smoking. There will be the opportunity for states to contribute financially to the agency’s operations. The agency will be headed by a chief executive officer who will advise and make recommendations to the minister for health and, as the legislation makes clear, there is to be an advisory council, which is to provide advice but not direct the chief executive officer on preventive health. It will be charged with developing a triennial strategic plan and it is one part of a much broader framework for a national approach to preventive health. This legislation has the support of a number of interest groups and bodies in the health field, including the Heart Foundation, which has indicated its direct support for this bill, sayMAIN COMMITTEE",180,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
178,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (4.50 Pm),"The Australian Labor Party committed, in opposition,ing that it ‘heralds an important and proactive focus for preventative health care, especially in the major health risk areas of tobacco and obesity, that could potentially shift the significant burden of cost that accompanies chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease’. And there has been direct support offered for this legislation by the Public Health Association of Australia and by the Royal Australian College of Physicians. It is a fact that the increased rate of chronic illness in the Australian community has a significant and detrimental impact on the quality and span of life for individual Australians. Chronic illness places an enormous burden on our health system and other government services and it diminishes economic productivity by reducing participation rates in the workforce. The shift of focus to preventive health will play an important role in reducing the disease burden that is experienced by individual Australians and their families and will reduce the costs of health care in an ageing community, which as we know is coming in Australia. The shift of focus to preventive health should also, as I said, improve labour market participation. The shift of focus is a vital recognition that, as well as a health system which provides excellent acute care, we need to focus on the ongoing well-being of all Australians. It is regrettable that the opposition spokesman for health, the member for Dickson, who spoke immediately preceding me, seems to have no understanding of the difference between acute care, which would be the category that cataract surgery comes under, and preventive health or a focus on ongoing well-being. There is a distinction to be made. Acute health encompasses matters like cataract surgery or, as I said in my intervention, open heart surgery. We need to keep the two concepts very much separated because it is impossible to conduct an intelligible debate about the future of the heath system if we are going to get basic concepts like that mixed up, as the opposition spokesman for health seems to have done. The initial focus of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will be on three significant risk factors-obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption-and, as I have indicated, this bill to establish the agency follows on from the task force report that was delivered on 30 June 2009. This task force report outlined the most comprehensive plan yet devised in Australia to advance a prevention agenda. The report makes numerous recommendations about prevention, focusing particularly on obesity, tobacco and alcohol use, which is why it is appropriate that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency adopt those particular focuses as well. The task force outlined four ambitious prevention targets which are aligned with previous interim targets that had been set by the Council of Australian Governments in November 2008. One of the task force’s recommendations was to establish the national prevention agency that is the subject of this legislation. It is a notion that was also foreshadowed in the national partnership agreement. The task force report is something that the members of the task force should be commended for. The task force was headed by Professor Rob Moodie, with Professor Mike Daube as deputy chair, and had as its members Kate Carnell AO, Dr Christine Connors, Dr Shaun Larkin, Dr Lyn Roberts AM, Professor Leonie Segal, Dr Linda Selvey and Professor Paul Zimmet AO, who is a noted expert in a range of preventive health areas-notably in diabetes, an area in which I have had some personal contact with him. I do have a particular interest in diabetes and I will return to that later. In its report, the task force indicated very directly the appropriateness of setting some ambitious targets. The task force identified the following targets, and I am quoting now from the overview of the task force report: MAIN COMMITTEE Halt and reverse the rise in overweight and obesity Reduce the prevalence of daily smoking to 10% or less Reduce the proportion of Australians who drink at short-term risky/high-risk levels to 14%; and the proportion of Australians who drink at long-term risky/high-risk levels to 7% … The task force went on to point out what current trends in Australian health statistics will deliver for us if action is not taken in this preventive area to reverse or at least lessen those trends. They point out in their overview: Recent trends predict that the life expectancy for Australian children alive today will fall two years by the time they are 20 years old, representing life expectancy levels seen for males in 2001 and for females in 1997. It is unacceptable that we as a nation are leaving this legacy to our children and grandchildren. If these health threats are left unchecked, our health systems will find it increasingly difficult to cope. They go on to give a number of examples-the effect of the prevalence of obesity, the effect of ongoing smoking in the numbers that we are seeing and the effect of harmful consumption of alcohol. To sum up, we are going backwards if we continue at these trends, particularly bearing in mind the ageing of our population. What we do know-contrary to, I think it is fair to say, the veiled mockery that was contained in the speech we just heard from the opposition’s spokesman on health and contrary to what he said-is that large-scale public health campaigns work. That has been demonstrated by the enormous success that our country has had in reducing rates of smoking and the success that we have had in limiting the spread of HIV-AIDS. We have had a much better experience than quite a number of other developed countries, without even mentioning the enormous challenges that are now being faced by a range of developing countries, where the kinds of large-scale public health campaigns that Australia has been able to mount have not been mounted. We have had a very good experience of this kind of campaign. As I said, HIV-AIDS is a very good example. Another area where there has been a very good experience of large-scale public health campaigns is in relation to reducing the road toll. Those of us who are old enough can remember, as I do, the horrific road tolls that we experienced in all states of Australia in the 1960s and 1970s. We have produced a reduction in the road toll, not merely by introducing laws like compulsory seatbelt laws or the wearing of helmets for cyclists but also through large-scale public health campaigns or public education campaigns, which do produce results. As I indicated earlier, I have a particular interest in diabetes. When I became a member of this HouseI joined-at the invitation of the member for Pearce, who is with us here in the chamber and who is the chair-the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. Diabetes is, of course, a great concern throughout Australia and is particularly a concern in my electorate and throughout south-east Melbourne. Just some of the stark facts about diabetes-and this is something that the Preventative Health Taskforce deals with at length in its report-are that, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, type 2 diabetes is expected to become the leading cause of disease among Australian men and the second leading cause of disease for Australian women within 15 years; and annual healthcare costs relating to diabetes will increase from $1.3 billion in 2002-03 to $8 billion by 2032. The driving factor in this alarming increase is the expected growth in the prevalence of obesity. MAIN COMMITTEE One can look at the facts we already know about diabetes, including the fact that in 2003, six years ago, diabetes and its complications were responsible for around eight per cent of the total burden of disease in Australia. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes more than doubled between 1990 and 2005. There are severe complications associated with diabetes. There is a great risk of cardiovascular, eye and kidney diseases. Someone with diabetes is twice as likely to have had a heart attack, three times as likely to have had a stroke and twice as likely to have had cataracts or glaucoma. That brings me back to the opposition spokesman on health. Preventing cataracts is something that preventative health is directed at-things like preventing people from getting diabetes. Surgery for cataracts is acute treatment at the other end, when the debilitating condition has already arisen. To return to a few more of these stark facts, diabetes has an even greater impact on Indigenous Australians. The prevalence of diabetes in Indigenous Australians is three times that in non-Indigenous Australians. Diabetes hospitalisation rates for Indigenous Australians are 11 times that for non-Indigenous Australians and the death rate from diabetes for Indigenous Australians is 12 times that for non-Indigenous Australians. Diabetes prevalence and deaths due to diabetes among people in the fifth of the population with the lowest socioeconomic position is nearly twice as high as it is for those in the top fifth. Those are the stark facts. The reason I am going on at such length about diabetes is that diabetes is largely preventable. Control of modifiable risk factors, such as being overweight and obese, and encouraging physical activity are critical to controlling the rise in type 2 diabetes. If someone already has type 2 diabetes there are still benefits and advantages to be obtained from changes in lifestyle because it is possible to reduce the complications associated with diabetes by such changes. So, while we have had real successes in some other areas of public health promotion, we are experiencing a continuing increase in the rates of Australians being overweight and obese. There have been alarming increases in overweight and obesity rates in children over the last two decades. Among both boys and girls aged seven to 15, rates of obesity more than doubled between 1985 and 2007. It is because of measured changes in the Australian population, in the health of Australians, that there is such an important role for government in improving the health of all Australians through preventative strategies. There is no doubt that government can play a key role in better research and can play a key role in sharing information, and that is why the agency that is being established by this legislation can play an important role as a clearing house. There is no doubt that effective social marketing efforts-and that is what the $102 million that is earmarked in this legislation is directed to-can help in improving, through prevention, the future health of Australians, and governments can also play a very direct role in establishing programs that support healthy lifestyles. The actions required of governments, identified by the Preventative Health Taskforce, need to be, in their words, ‘progressive, staged and comprehensive’. I am looking forward to seeing this agency start up its operations. I am looking forward to the kinds of social marketing campaigns that this agency is going to be directed to oversee. I am confident that social marketing campaigns in the health area, as in other areas, can be useful. We know that social marketing campaigns help consumers make better choices because they give them better information in MAIN COMMITTEE imperfect markets. We know from past experience that in the health area this sort of campaign is likely to be able to achieve a change in behaviour. Just to finish off, I am hoping that the opposition spokesman for health, the member for Dickson, puts a bit more time and effort into studying the report of the Preventative Health Taskforce because it might explain to him the difference between acute care and preventive health campaigns. It is an important difference. The Rudd government is committed to improving preventive health measures throughout Australia. Isaacs. He is part of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group and I greatly appreciate the contribution he has made to that group since he was elected to parliament. I would also like to acknowledge as part of that group the member for Moore, the member for Lyons, Senator Barnett and, indeed, all the members and senators in this place who regularly contribute and take an interest in the problems and challenges that diabetes poses to us as a chronic health matter. We have worked very closely with Diabetes Australia, with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, with the Diabetes Educators Association and many other organisations. I think that on one occasion we had the department from the Canberra Hospital do a renal dialysis here to demonstrate to members one of the high risks of diabetes that goes undiagnosed and untreated. Sometimes, even with the best treatment, people still get severe renal complications requiring them to go onto dialysis. So we have greatly appreciated the contribution of many, many health professionals who have come to this place and who have given their time and expertise to speak. SoI am glad that the member for Isaacs raised this at the very outset of this debate. There are just too many people to mention individually, but they have been generous with their time, with keeping us informed and educating us more about the serious matter of diabetes within our community. Indeed there has been a rising incidence of chronic illness in Australia, diabetes among others, and we are now amongst the most obese nations in the world. In November 2008 there was a COAG agreement to establish an agency dedicated to preventative health. In principle, I have to say that I personally welcome that move. I think that it is a very important step forward. This agency is to coordinate multilevel government measures to prevent chronic disease, and in the second reading speech the Minister for Health and Ageing commented: This agreement funded by the government as $872 million provides the largest single investment in health promotion in Australia’s history. This figure refers to the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health and the amount will come from a total commitment over four years of $133.2 million. The Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 establishes the Australian National Preventive Health Agency made up of a chief executive officer and staff who will be directly accountable to the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing. This bill also establishes the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Advisory Council to provide advice to the chief executive officer. It will consist of a member representing the Commonwealth, one member for each state and between five and eight members with expertise in preventative health. The functions of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will be to support the Australian health minister to prevent chronic disease including the following: providing evidence based advice to health ministers on key national level preventative health issues; proMAIN COMMITTEE",182,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
179,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (5.09 Pm),"From the outset can I acknowledge the member forviding national leadership and stewardship of surveillance and data on preventative chronic disease and their lifestyle related risk factors in order to improve the availability and comparability of evidence; collating evidence available from a range of sources in order to assess and report biennially on the state of preventative health in Australia; supporting behavioural change through education, promotion of community awareness programs relating to preventative health; providing grants of financial assistance to state and territory persons for a variety of purposes pursuant to preventative health including research grants in aid of population level interventions or grants paid as sponsorship to organisations. It is to support and facilitate partnerships with relevant groups, industry, non-government, community sectors and to encourage cooperative action leading to preventative health gains, promulgating national standards and codes to guide preventative health initiatives, interventions and activities. And finally in that list it is to manage schemes and reward best practice in preventative health interventions and activities. Of the $133.2 million allocated to the ANPHA, $17.6 million will be spent establishing and maintaining the organisation, $102 million has been allocated for national level social marketing campaigns targeting obesity and smoking with a further $13.1 million having been allocated for a preventative health research fund focusing on translational research to support policy development. The shadow minister for health, the member for Dickson, has outlined some of the coalition’s concerns. I think these concerns should be taken seriously, because it is a lot of money and we want to get the very best outcome. In essence, as I said earlier, I totally support the general direction of this measure. I think it is a very important health measure, as the member for Isaacs quite rightly pointed out. It has precedence in the road toll program, which has drastically reduced death and injury from road accidents. There are many other programs that I could talk about but will not because time does not permit. I think it is a very important program and the issues that the shadow minister has raised are also very important. One concern is that the agency and advisory council are adding yet another layer of bureaucracy that could be incorporated into the existing health department at a lower cost. I think that needs to be looked at fairly closely. When I am out there engaging with my constituents, the complaint I constantly get is that so much of the money is taken up in the administration of programs-whether they be health programs, environmental programs or mental health programs-that they never get the shovel in the ground, so to speak. That means they never get to actually deliver a level of service that is acceptable to the public. I think an issue that is worth bearing in mind is to always make sure that the expenditure of money that we allocate in this place is as effective as it can be and is not just setting up another layer in a bureaucratic process that gobbles up the dollars before the benefits can be delivered-and sometimes they are never delivered-to the public. That is my concern also, and the shadow minister and the coalition have raised a valid point. The ANPHA also will need to report to the minister and will be accountable for its performance against agreed triennial, strategic and annual operational plans. That is what it says. Nevertheless, there are still concerns that there are no assurances of outcomes for expenditures. Again, this goes to the heart of the problem that concerns me that there are measurable public outcomes from the money that is being expended in this place. It is not money that belongs to us. It is not money that belongs to the bureaucrats, as good as they often are, who are MAIN COMMITTEE charged with administering. It is the money of the Australian people, and I think they deserve to know that there are accountability measures in the way that money is expended in producing better public health outcomes. In addition, the other concern that has been raised by the coalition is that the government is yet to respond to the Preventative Health Taskforce. The member for Isaacs mentioned this and how important it is for us to read and understand the report of that task force. A lot of time and money has been expended on it. I agree with the member for Isaacs that it is an important document that we should be drawing from. We have not yet seen a response to that task force by the government, yet we are prepared to commit a very large sum of money to a preventative health agency before that process has taken place. I think it is fair to ask the question: can we be sure that the government has a coherent game plan for tackling preventative health if it is not yet in a position to respond to that report? I think it is a valid question, and I think the government members and the minister have to be able to answer it. Apart from my concerns about the government’s approach, I am personally very committed to dealing with the issue of chronic disease. The Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group puts out an activity report, which goes through the history and outlines why the group was established. In that first publication, I wrote: … the greatest health-care challenge of the 21st Century… is the management of CHRONIC Medical science has found ways of preventing a multitude of childhood diseases that in previous decades stole the lives of so many children. In the catalogue of CHRONIC ILLNESS no condition is more needful than the world-wide scourge of diabetes. Its management and prevention is a responsibility of the whole of society. The catalogue of chronic disease was the subject of the National Public Health Partnership’s paper ‘Preventing Chronic Disease: A Strategic Framework’. That paper identified 12 of the most significant chronic diseases in Australia. I will not read out the whole list or I will run out of time. If you look at that list, you will see that, almost without exception, those diseases are brought on or exacerbated because somebody has diabetes that has remained undiagnosed, untreated or unsatisfactorily treated. We should not lose sight of the fact that diabetes is a very serious disease which leads to some of these other chronic illnesses in our community. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that more than half of all potentially preventable hospitalisations are from selected chronic conditions. In 2007-08, 19.24 per cent of hospitalisations per 1,000 separations-and I am not quite sure what that meanswere for chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. I was glad to hear the member for Isaacs mention Indigenous health, particularly diabetes, because the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found: Indigenous Australians experience higher levels of certain chronic conditions than non-Indigenous Australians. In 2004-05, more Indigenous Australians experienced hypertensive disease, other diseases of the heart and circulatory system, asthma, diabetes, arthritis and kidney disease. Again, I say that many of those other conditions experienced by Indigenous people come about from untreated, undiagnosed or poorly treated diabetes. MAIN COMMITTEE Diabetes left undiagnosed and untreated dramatically affects quality of life and certainly shortens life span. Its malevolent cause may lead to heart disease, renal failure, limb amputation and blindness, just to name a few of the complications. It is estimated that every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone has a limb amputated due to diabetes. Furthermore, unless national governments act to deliver comprehensive policies, the implications for health budgets will be calamitous. Prevention and effective policymaking are essential to confront the diabetes pandemic. The cost of dealing with chronic illness will become a major drain on health budgets unless there is a serious effort made to prevent chronic illnesses. In a speech I gave in Rome, Italy, at the European symposium on diabetes, I made the point that, well before this century reaches its half term, the global affliction of diabetes will have seriously challenged the health and the budgets of all nations. Diabetes is not just a matter of concern to health professionals; it will have wrought incalculable harm to the quality of life of individuals, with consequences for the social fabric of this nation and of all nations. There sometimes exists a gulf, as I mentioned in Rome-and I am not making a point about any particular government-between the government’s grand action plan and action itself. It goes to the heart of the point I made at the beginning of this speech about the need to make sure that the money is spent wisely. For many years, for example, representations were made to successive governments in this place about the need for subsidised insulin pump consumables-the devices that are used with the pump to deliver insulin-for children. That fell on deaf ears. Diabetes was made a national health priority back in the nineties by our government and the Labor government, but delivering best-practice medicine to children with diabetes did not seem to be a huge budget priority. That gave rise to the establishment of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. It was started because we were not delivering best-practice health care to children. We were successful in getting the government to allocate money for insulin pump consumables. People have to understand that if diabetes goes unsatisfactorily treated then other chronic health conditions prevail. So it is enormously important that children particularly get the benefit of the best technology and best practice-medicine. Their whole quality of life is affected. It is not just a cost issue; it is a quality of life issue. Following our success with insulin pump consumables, we approached the government about subsidising insulin pumps for children, because many families cannot afford them. These devices are around $8,000. We have written to the health minister, the member for Isaacs and other members on a bipartisan basis. What we want to see is effective policy. The fact is that, although the government allocated money to that program-we welcome that progress; it is a beginning point-there are more than 11,000 Australians under 18 with type 1 diabetes, which is not easily preventable. It is not something that can be fixed with diet and exercise. There are 1,000 new cases each year. These are young kids whose lives are inexorably impacted by diabetes. We have seen them in this House through the Kids in the House program. The program that was implemented is not really working as effectively as it might. The current government allocated $5.3 million over four years to provide a subsidy of between $500 and $2,500 to offset the cost of an insulin pump. We understand that, since that program started in November 2008, the government has received about 2,000 hits on its website, which MAIN COMMITTEE is fantastic. There have been 200 subsidy inquiries. As at February this year, 65 applications had been made and I think fewer than 10 families-that would be generous-had actually taken advantage of the subsidy. Because it is means tested, families that are eligible for the subsidy are simply earning such a low income that they cannot afford the device, even with the subsidy. Others just kick over that threshold. Certainly for those under the income threshold the device is still unaffordable. There are other matters like that that I could talk about, but in conclusion can I just say that when I was in Tonga my good friend Dr Viliami Puloka said: … if we do not act decisively and act now, we may well be the first generation for several decades where parents will bury their children. It is a sobering message, but it will come true unless we can deal effectively with this chronic illness. In that respect, I support these initiatives but ask that the government consider the coalition’s recommendations to ensure that the measures in this bill are effective and that the money that we allocate is used to best effect. It is, as I said, a very sobering message, and each of us has a responsibility to make a difference. (Time expired) Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (5.30 pm)-I rise to support this very important bill, the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. I think one of the key facts that came out of the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission’s review recently is that only two per cent of the federal health budget is spent on preventative health care. The consequence of this is a toll not only on our health but also on the long-term budget of the nation. With the cost of health care for preventable diseases almost $6 billion per year and the loss of productivity of approximately $13 billion, the burden of disease is too great for us not to take action. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing for starting a conversation about preventative health care in Australia and also for starting real preventative health care solutions. The actions of this government in all areas, whether they are education, workplace relations, agriculture, the arts, the economy or communications are to incorporate three themes: (1) building a stronger Australia, (2) building a fairer Australia, and (3) preparing Australia for the future. In health it is no different. The government is determined to make Australia healthier, making Australia fairer by addressing socioeconomic differences in health problems and preparing Australia for the future by tackling preventative health problems. The bill before us creates the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, which will lead Australian health ministers to implement feasible, preventative health care measures. It will place preventative care at the forefront of health policy, planning and spending. This proactive approach will have a significant effect on our health budget: by spending more on preventative health measures we will have to spend less on health problems down the track. More important than fiscal management is the fact that focusing on preventative health care will make Australians healthier in the long term. The agency that is to be created by this bill is the primary outcome of the task force into preventative health for Australia that was commissioned by this government. The discussion paper entitled Australia: the healthiest country by 2020 begins by stating that the goals of preventative health are aligned with the values of Australia. It states that our universal value of fairness will guide our commitment to preventative health because the people who are most at risk of basic health problems are those at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. By prioritising preventative health we are tackling the ineMAIN COMMITTEE quality between those with money and those without. Health care should not be unaffordable or exclusive. Any opportunity to prevent health issues before they become long-term problems should be fully embraced by governments. The task force has set a series of ambitious goals to make Australia the healthiest country by 2020. The turnaround required in our nation’s health in just over 10 years will require serious commitments by government and health professionals and the task force report points a way forward to achieving these goals. The creation of the agency picks up on the key recommendation of the task force and will continue the work of promoting preventative health. The task force picked up also on the work already achieved by federal, state and territory governments informing a significant partnership agreement on preventative health. In November last year, the Council of Australian Governments made a national agreement on health problem prevention, which allocates funding to improve the health of all Australians. The initial agreement set the policy parameters of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments as well as agreeing to the funding levels of the required programs. COAG committed itself to finding means to increase the proportion of healthy adults and children and to reduce the high rate of obesity. That meeting also set funding to increase the access to services for children, to increase their physical activity, to improve nutrition, to improve the quality of community awareness campaigns, and to fund the National Preventive Health Agency. The COAG agreement shows a willingness of governments of this country to reverse the inertia of the previous federal government. This government knows that it has a duty to make every effort to provide access to quality health care to Australians, not only to those who can afford it but also to those in need. The bill is concerned with creating an agency, as I have mentioned before, which will give advice on preventative health care. In supporting this bill I also support the work objectives of this agency. A large part of preventative health is addressing chronic disease. The previous member spoke very passionately about the prevention of diabetes, which is one of the key chronic diseases. In tackling chronic disease, we also need to tackle some of the causes of that chronic disease. Therefore, issues such as obesity, smoking and alcohol, as well as that of mental health, are core issues that we need to address in the preventative healthcare space. With obesity, smoking and alcohol being in the top percentile of risk factors contributing to disease, taking action to reduce the impact of those factors is essential business for government. The Rudd Labor government understands that responsibility and holds work in this area to be very important. Recently, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I am a member, conducted a wide-ranging inquiry into obesity. There was also a separate inquiry into the issues of overweight and obesity. One of the key messages coming out of these inquiries was that obesity is increasing in prevalence in Australia. Between 1990 and 2005 there has been an increase of 2.8 million obese adults. In total, 60 per cent of our nation’s adults and one in four of Australia’s children are considered overweight. These figures are quite staggering. Further, the impact of obesity in our Indigenous communities is higher than in nonindigenous communities, with Indigenous Australians being three times more likely to be morbidly obese than non-indigenous peers. It became clear in our inquiry that this issue is very complex. There are many factors, some at the societal level, some relating to understandMAIN COMMITTEE ing by individuals and some just arising from the complexity of our lifestyles. There are many factors affecting this area of obesity, but we must acknowledge that it does pose a serious risk to our health. It can shorten life expectancy through chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Other impacts include severe muscle, bone and joint problems in the form of osteoarthritis, not to mention the mental repercussions and social stigma that come along with obesity. These diseases are serious, with over 242,000 Australians suffering from type 2 diabetes and 644,800 Australians from cardiovascular disease. This is a serious issue. The total economic cost of obesity and associated diseases in 2008 was estimated to be $58.2 billion, and that does not include the quality of life cost to sufferers. This is an obvious place to start when it comes to attacking and trying to prevent disease. Tobacco use, once again, has been known for a long time now to have very harmful effects on one’s health, yet people still smoke and people still die from smoking. It is an addictive epidemic which, within the next decade, will have killed one million Australians. For long term smokers, death in middle age is common and middle age is often the time when their families rely on them the most, when they are most productive to our country and when they are in fact in the prime of their lives. Smoking also has an impact on the household budget. Lung cancer still tops the list as one of the biggest killers of Australian men and women. I think we really do need to shift our focus to prevention, so we need to look for ways to deal with this problem. By following the recommendations of the task force report, the agency created by this bill will be able to work towards cutting smoking to a prevalence of only nine per cent of the population by 2020. This decline will see smoking fall to a level which would remove it from contributing to the greatest preventable diseases and make it controllable for health professionals. This type of dramatic target and action is needed to cut through to a real reduction in smoking levels. The other area that is addressed is one to which many Australians are exposed on almost a daily basis, and that is alcohol. In Australia, alcohol consumption is trending upwards and the level of alcohol consumption places us in the top 30 consuming nations of the world. Up to 40 per cent of the population aged over 14 years are likely to drink on a weekly basis. What is worrying is the dangerous levels of drinking amongst Australians. One in five people drink at risky levels on a monthly basis, with a high prevalence amongst adults aged between 20 and 29 years. These are worrying figures and we have seen some of the health consequences of excessive alcohol usage. Whilst the short-term effects of binge drinking are visible pretty quickly, the ongoing effects of alcohol, including long-term disease and illness, are often overlooked. The social cost of alcohol, whether it be damage to the community or the more serious effects that a heavy-drinking family member will have on the rest of their family, cannot be measured. Living with a problem drinker can have significant effects on the general health of the family and this will continue to have an effect throughout their lives. I think these are definitely determinants that can affect chronic disease and are preventable. These are things that are critical for the health prevention agency to address. I have also spoken regularly in this place about the important role of supporting and treating mental health issues. Mental health is in a continuum between healthy and unhealthy. There is not a moment when suddenly an individual becomes mentally ill overnight. It is a process in which an individual slides along a continuum and there is a lot that health profesMAIN COMMITTEE sionals and governments can do through the investment of money to prevent people from being at their most unwell at the lower end of the spectrum. We heard about the effect of uncontrolled diabetes and the many other health factors that can come into play. That is certainly the case when you have an acutely sick person with mental health difficulties and there are many health and disease issues that come into play. So keeping people suffering from mental health issues as well as possible is incredibly important. Therefore, preventing acute sickness is really critical, not only in its impact on the person suffering from mental health issues but also in its impact on their families and health budgets in general. We need to be able to maintain people so that they do not need to be hospitalised but are able to function well in the community. Taking some preventative health measures and early intervention measures can work hand in hand and is critically important. When it comes to mental health, we cannot stand by and allow a system that encourages only last-minute action in acute situations where people have deteriorated because they have not been able to access early intervention. That will play a big role. There are certain investments and awareness campaigns that can enable people to access some help in these areas early on and stop it from spiralling out of control. I have outlined the problems of preventative health illness and disease in detail and, in looking at these figures, it is important that we do act to be able to achieve these goals. This bill will allow for the most significant shift in our approach to health care in decades. It will place emphasis onto the health care system, individuals and the government to act in the short term for long-term interests. We will be able to make Australia healthier, more productive through preventative health measures. I commend the government for looking into this. Preventative health did come up in the government’s independent root and branch review of the health and hospital system that the government has commissioned. Preventative health is only one facet. I thank both the prime minister and the health minister for visiting one of the major hospitals that service my electorate to begin this conversation about how we can reform our health care system. I would also thank all the health care professionals that came to my own health and hospital forum that was held at Noarlunga hospital. They have been a significant part of talking about where we might go into the future to make Australia healthier. In addition, the government has not just opened this conversation to those who work in the area of health but is engaging the nation through the website yourhealth.gov.au. This is a site where people can put their ideas, inputs, suggestions and experience, and I know many people in my electorate have put submissions onto the site. The feedback that I received at Noarlunga hospital will be put into that process. Finally, turning to the detail of the legislation and how the agency will work, the new agency will be governed by a chief executive officer who will be appointed by the minister for health in consultation with the Australian Health Ministers Conference. It will be the responsibility of the CEO to provide national leadership on the data of preventative health solutions as well as developing the body of research around preventative care. The team under the CEO will be Public Service staff focused on areas of population health, health promotion, health economics, social marketing and general corporate support units. The staff will work at the direction of the CEO to perform the research and corporate work required by the agency. Further, the agency will have an advisory council comprised of Commonwealth and state government representatives, as well as preventative health experts, to be part of the agency’s MAIN COMMITTEE overall approach to guiding and advising preventative health policy. The bill sets out provisions for the selection and appointment of these members. Thus, in accordance with government policy, the candidates will be selected on meritorious and transparent assessment processes, with consultation by the minister with the cabinet. The bill also establishes the funding provisions for the agency. The Commonwealth will be dedicating $133.2 million over four years to this agency. These funds will go towards the establishment and maintenance of the agency, its research, social marketing and support for preventative health research, particularly research with practical applications. A further $692 million of COAG agreed funding will support intervention programs for Australians to modify their lifestyles. This will be a statutory authority under the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act and will support the previous COAG agreements on preventative health to give advice to the health ministers. As mentioned, the initial focus of the agency will be in providing leadership, coordination and monitoring needed to support and implement many of these initiatives. In addition, this agency will support health ministers to meet the challenges of preventable chronic conditions and other lifestyle-caused risks. The framework of the bill is designed for the agency to have the best possible resources to support the highest level of policy and research input to Australian health ministers. The agency will be invaluable in supporting a shift to preventative health solutions for the nation’s future. The Rudd Labor government takes the task of addressing Australia’s long-term heath care needs with great seriousness. We have decided to make historical reforms to the healthcare system and to get it working for all of us again. It means making tough decisions, working progressively through the issues and consulting with the country to bring them along with us. I therefore commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) Agency Bill 2009 establishes the Australian National Preventive Health Agency to support Australian health ministers in tackling the complex and growing challenge of preventable chronic disease. The bill specifies the functions, governance and structure of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, including the interaction with the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing and the Australian Health Ministers Conference. In reaching the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health in November 2008, COAG recognised that supporting or enabling infrastructure, such as the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, and research and surveillance capacity was required to support the Commonwealth and the states in their attempt to tackle the complex challenges associated with preventable chronic conditions. It is in this context that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency is being established in order to support Australian health ministers as they attempt to achieve outcomes specified in the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. Through the prevention NP, the Commonwealth government is providing $872.1 million over six years for a range of initiatives targeting the lifestyle risk factors of chronic disease, including settings based interventions in preschools, schools, workplaces and communities to support behavioural change in the social context of everyday lives and focusing on poor nutrition, physical inactivity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption including binge drinking; social marketing aimed at obesity and tobacco; and enabling infrastructure to monitor and evaluate progress made by these interventions, including the ANPHA. MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
180,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (5.50 Pm),"The Australian National Preventive HealthA key initial role of the ANPHA will be to provide the leadership, coordination and monitoring required to support the successful implementation of initiatives funded through the prevention NP, including $692 million provided for interventions to help Australians to modify their lifestyles. Beyond this, the ANPHA will more broadly support Australian health ministers in meeting the challenges posed by preventable chronic conditions and lifestyle related risk factors. The ANPHA will have an advisory council which will be appointed by the minister and which will consist of state, territory and Commonwealth government representatives and individuals with expertise related to preventative health. Under the prevention NP, the Commonwealth will provide funding of $133.2 million over four years for the ANPHA. Of this, $17.6 million will be provided for the establishment and maintenance of the ANPHA. As this body is a COAG mandated body and has a function of supporting all Australian health ministers, the minister will be required to consult with the Australian Health Ministers Conference when considering candidates for the CEO’s role and for membership of the advisory council and to seek the agreement of the AHMC when setting the ANPHA’s strategic directions and operational plans. Historically, federal governments have established inquiries to reconfigure our health systems with the aim of placing larger emphasis on preventative health. We know, though, that only two per cent of the national health budget is actually spent on preventative health. In 1973, the Whitlam government established the National Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The Fraser government initiated the Davidson inquiry into health promotion in 1979 and the Hawke government created the Better Health Commission in 1985. Despite these repeated attempts, disease prevention and health promotion have never gained the same priority as acute healthcare services in Australia. Poor health affects the quality of life of Australians and their families and can have significant economic effects by reducing their ability to participate in the workforce and through lost productivity and higher costs of business. Our health system is struggling to deal with the longer term pressures of an ageing population, the increasing cost of pharmaceuticals and new technologies, the rise of chronic disease in our community and the increased expectations of access to high-quality health services in the community. Improving preventative health services and chronic disease management will deliver better health outcomes for Australians and their families and help contain growth in demand for hospital services in the future. It will also promote greater workplace participation and productivity. Too many people who, with coordinated and preventative health care, need not be admitted to hospital end up there. Too many older Australians who have been admitted but assessed as requiring aged care or transitional care remain in acute hospital wards waiting for a more appropriate bed and denying another person a place. One of the other issues with preventative care is making sure that there is adequate access to care. Primary care and the role that GPs play in our community are vitally important. I would like to acknowledge here the good work that Dr Godden and Mr Bill Parker of the Central Coast Division of General Practice do in my community in preventative care and working with the government as closely as possible in terms of that particular agenda. There has also been an issue in my electorate with access to GPs. That problem has exacerbated the situation with chronic disease and early identification of disease. MAIN COMMITTEE One of this government’s election promises was the implementation of a GP Superclinic to be located in the fast-growing area of Warnervale in the north of my electorate. The tender has been let for that. It was my pleasure a little over a month ago to attend the opening of the temporary GP Superclinic, which will be in use while the final super GP clinic is being constructed. This GP Superclinic has a team of professionals which currently run the Toukley medical practice and another practice at Tuggerah. They will operate the new Superclinic, which will be known as the North Central Coast GP Superclinic. The government’s agreement with the Warnervale medical service sees an already operating interim clinic in Wongarra while preparations are made for the permanent state-of-the-art clinic in Warnervale city, which will be up and running by 2011. The North Central Coast GP Superclinic will bring together additional GPs, specialists, allied health professionals and pharmacists, together with radiology, pathology, rehabilitation, dental, physiotherapy and psychology services, all in one convenient location, with many of these services being bulk-billed. As well as providing families and people with chronic diseases access to affordable care by general practitioners and health professionals, the new GP Superclinic will relieve pressure on the Wyong accident and emergency department, which is now the fourth busiest accident and emergency department in New South Wales. It is this access to care that has led to the hospital at Wyong becoming so busy. Issues of access have also led to Wyong Hospital being the second busiest for child admissions, after the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. So the issue of access in terms of preventable disease is very important and the GP Superclinic at Warnervale will go some way to helping improve that access and helping to deal with some of the preventative issues that we need to deal with. One of the issues that I wanted to raise relating to chronic disease is obesity and the increasing trend for obesity to be a problem for children. This bill sets up an agency, one of the main tasks of which is to tackle that particular issue. To highlight one of the ways in which it can operate, I was recently at Killarney Vale Public School attending a Commonwealth funded program of after-school activities and talking to the kids and asking them what they enjoyed about this particular program. One of them said, ‘WhatI really enjoy about this program is that I am actually out doing things and enjoying the activity and that makes me healthier.’ I said, ‘What would you be doing if you weren’t doing this?’ He said, ‘I would be sitting at home watching TV or playing on the computer.’ One can see the pressures of the lifestyle that we lead nowadays, particularly for kids, that makes it more difficult to get the exercise that is needed to prevent obesity. That was an example that really brought it home to me that programs are needed to be put into place that address this issue of childhood obesity. Without that, our children are going to be left to the devices of our modern society that do not lend themselves to exercise but do lead to obesity and the problems it causes in terms of chronic disease. Hospitals are, of course, the most visible face of the health system, and it is no secret that many of our public hospitals-and I have spoken about Wyong Hospital-are under severe pressure as our population ages and the burden of chronic disease takes hold, without us addressing this issue of preventable disease. The Rudd government recognised this increased pressure on hospitals and took action at COAG last November. The 2009-10 budget implements that historic agreement. It includes the biggest ever funding bill for our public hospital MAIN COMMITTEE system-$64 billion over five years. This is nearly $20 billion more than the previous healthcare agreement-a massive increase of nearly 50 per cent in funding for our public hospitals. These reforms are about improving health systems-not just about money, important though that is after years of neglect by the previous government. We have already seen the results from our $600 million blitz on elective surgery waiting lists, with an extra 41,000 procedures last year, which is 16,000 procedures above the target. However, the problem that we have is that, no matter what amount of money we continue to pour into the acute sector, while we do not tackle preventive health, these numbers are going to continue. The percentage of cost to the economy in relation to maintaining quality health services is something that all state governments are struggling with in their health systems and it can only be addressed by putting in place the types of programs that this legislation looks to do in terms of preventive health strategies, by making sure that those who are more vulnerable to particular chronic diseases are given the incentives and programs that will mean that those chronic diseases do not eventuate and end up in our public hospital system. This legislation has the dual benefit of making sure that there is a better quality of life for those who are susceptible to chronic disease and may suffer chronic disease, but it also has the economic benefit in terms of both productivity in the workplace, as I have already mentioned, and in taking the stress and increasing cost burdens off our public hospital system as it struggles under the increasing weight of chronic disease that could have been prevented from attending at public hospital emergency departments. I would like to briefly talk about a particular issue with health on the Central Coast, an issue that is probably unique to the Central Coast and which looks at the difference between the way in which the acute sector is organised on the Central Coast and the primary sector. While the Central Coast has over 300,000 people, we have an acute system that is organised in such a way that we are part of the northern Sydney-Central Coast area health system. I have been part of a campaign, called ‘I Love the Central Coast’, which looks at all of our institutions on the Central Coast and how they can be better arranged to provide better service for those of us who live on the Central Coast. In terms of primary care, the division of general practice is organised on the Central Coast and has been providing first-class service to residents who live there, but unfortunately the area health service, by being organised in such a way that we are part of northern Sydney, is providing problems for us. I have called on the state government to look at addressing this issue and changing it so that, as part of the ‘I Love the Central Coast’ campaign, we can have an area health service that addresses the acute needs of the area, rather than an acute health system that is based out of north Sydney and the Royal North Shore Hospital. Chronic diseases already account for almost $34 billion each year and nearly 70 per cent of allocated health expenditure. Left unchecked, this figure is expected to increase to 80 per cent of allocated health expenditure by 2020. Reducing avoidable hospitalisations by investing in robust primary health services, focused on preventative health care and improved management of chronic disease by working to reduce non-urgent accident and emergency presentations by providing families with high-quality after hours alternatives; reducing readmissions by providing proper discharge planning and post acute care; and striving to reduce waiting times for such services, we can address some of these issues that are putting pressure on our health system. This piece of legislation is part of that jigsaw puzzle in setting up a structure MAIN COMMITTEE that focuses on preventative health care. By putting resources into that, this government has acknowledged that this is a problem that we cannot just talk about and make good speeches about; it is a problem that we have to tackle head-on if we are to address the issues that are not only affecting the health and lifestyle of Australians all over the country but also putting pressure on our acute care hospital system. Access Economics has undertaken a number of studies which seek to quantify the cost of individual diseases and conditions. These studies are significant in that they reveal that chronic, preventable diseases carry a substantial health cost and are having an increasing impact on productivity and participation. These studies demonstrate that the costs of not addressing the pressures on the health system caused by the growing burden of chronic disease extend well beyond the health system itself, because the burden of chronic diseases takes a huge toll on our economy and national productivity. For example, Access Economics has estimated that the annual financial cost of cardiovascular disease in Australia is $14.2 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP. This figure includes lost productivity costs of $3.6 billion caused by lower employment rates and premature mortality. In addition to the financial costs, Access Economics estimates the value of suffering and premature death from cardiovascular disease alone is a staggering $94 billion. The total cost of obesity in Australia in 2005 was $21 billion. This includes productivity losses of $1.7 billion as a result of absenteeism, lost management productivity, long-term lower employment rates and premature death, as well as the cost to the health system of obesity related illnesses and a range of indirect costs, such as lost well-being. The member for Isaacs and the member for Pearce made particular reference to diabetes and its effect on the Australian health system. The total cost of diabetes is around $21 billion. This figure includes lost productivity, health and carer costs, taxation revenue forgone, and welfare and other payments. People with type 2 diabetes have significantly lower productivity in the workplace and lower workforce participation rates and are more likely to suffer from heart disease. The government are getting on with the job of fixing our health system to make it sustainable for future generations. While those opposite have to hold a four-hour meeting to give their leader permission to speak to the government, the Rudd government are getting on with the job of nation building and fixing our decaying health system. This bill is an important piece of legislation that places the emphasis on preventative health care and it should be supported. I commend the bill to the House. tional Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. The rate of growth in the cost of health in Australia is significant and exponential. Every year in real terms we spend more and more money on health. As the technology and expertise grows, so do the costs, but a significant contributor to the cost of health is the lifestyle choices that we as individuals and as a community make. It seems to me that it does not take much insight to know that this sort of exponential growth in health costs will be unsustainable in the long term. Prevention of ill health and disease is the best way of tackling the ever-increasing health costs in Australia. In Australia, one-third of the burden on our health system relates to the health behaviour and lifestyle factors of individuals. These behaviours and factors can be modified. When we MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Illness It Is The New Frontier
181,Mr Symon (Deakin) (6.08 Pm),"I rise tonight to speak in support of the Australian Naencourage individuals to make different choices about their health habits and their behaviour, we start to make inroads on the costs of health as well as making for a healthier and happier community. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has identified the seven risk factors that contribute the most to the burden of disease. They are tobacco, high blood pressure, obesity, lack of physical activity, cholesterol, alcohol and the low intake of fruit and vegetables. It is difficult to overstate the risks that these factors pose to the level of ill health in our community. Obesity and tobacco alone, at seven per cent each, constitute 14 per cent of the contribution to the burden of disease, while lack of physical activity contributes 6.6 per cent. The financial cost that these factors pose to our health system is significant, while the cost to our community in terms of mortality and morbidity is considerable. For instance, in the 2004-05 financial year, the health costs associated with tobacco were estimated at $31 billion. We know that we spent $1.9 billion on health in relation to the harmful consumption of alcohol in 2004-05. Also associated with the overconsumption of alcohol is the loss of workplace productivity, estimated to be worth $3.5 billion, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. While there have been significant reductions in tobacco usage in Australia, we know that it is still too high and far too many people are still smoking. The message has not got through as well as we would like. We know that we can and should do more to prevent young men and women taking up the habit of smoking, as well as to help existing smokers quit. The National Heart Foundation has conducted studies in the last few years and has found a clear upward trend towards greater obesity. We know that obesity is already a significant health issue in our community, and it is only set to grow if we do not do something about it now. Earlier this year, the OECD predicted that in the next decade almost two-thirds of our population would be either overweight or obese, while the World Health Organisation has labelled obesity a worldwide epidemic. In 2006 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that half of all adults in Australia are not undertaking enough physical activity. This issue, combined with our inadequate consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables, makes for a very serious problem. The National Preventative Health Strategy: the roadmap for action says that by 2032 the leading cause of disease for males and the second leading cause of disease for females will be type 2 diabetes. This will result in an increase in direct healthcare costs for type 2 diabetes to $8 billion annually from the current $1.3 billion. As we just heard the member for Dobell describe, these costs are magnified many times when you take into account the effects on other sections of the community. The rise in diabetes rates is mainly because of the significant increase in rates of obesity in our community-again, mostly related to poor nutrition and lack of physical activity. I know that at Monash Medical Centre, located in the south-east of Melbourne, the Nutrition and Dietetics Unit are seeing children as young as 10 and 12 who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This is a very disturbing anecdote about what is a lifelong disease. Similarly, there are particular workplaces where type 2 diabetes is prevalent. The one that springs to my mind in particular is the construction industry, where workers on building sites quite often make very poor choices of meals and consequently have a higher rate of type 2 diabetes. We need to MAIN COMMITTEE make healthier choices easier for people to make, not have available only junk food but have healthy food that is good for you today and helps you to live a longer and healthier life. There is good reason to do so. We know that prevention works and we know that prevention makes sense socially and economically. Deaths from cardiovascular disease have dropped dramatically since the 1960s and 1970s because as a community we are more aware of the harmful effects of high blood cholesterol and poor nutrition. The incidence of HIV-AIDS has decreased in regions-mostly western, to the great detriment of poorer communities around the globe-where prevention programs have been conducted. The rate of immunisation has increased over the last few decades, resulting in a decrease in the incidence of preventable illnesses such as measles, mumps, polio and tetanus. Reports estimate that we prevented 400,000 deaths and saved $8.4 billion due to the 30 per cent decline in tobacco consumption between 1975 and 2005. Tellingly, studies in the United States indicate that the return on investment is $5.60 for every dollar spent on community based disease prevention, including things such as encouraging a better diet and increasing physical activity. The establishment of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency is a recommendation of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. Its main aim will be to provide national leadership on health promotion as well as conduct relevant research in these vital areas. A key role of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, as has already been outlined by the Minister for Health and Ageing, will be to provide the leadership and coordination required to support the implementation of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, an agreement with the Council of Australian Governments. This agreement between the state, territory and federal governments recognises that greater coordination is required in our efforts to tackle preventable chronic conditions. Initially, the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will focus its efforts on social marketing campaigns to reduce the risks posed by tobacco consumption, alcohol consumption and obesity. The Rudd government are committing $102 million to those campaigns. We are also committing $13 million for a preventative health research fund. Overall we are funding this new agency to the tune of $133 million over four years, a clear indication that the Rudd government are serious about tackling the risk factors of preventable chronic illness and disease in our community. Given that the evidence shows the role that lifestyle and behavioural factors play in individual health outcomes and it has been known for some time now, the question that could well be asked is why previous governments have not done anything about it. When you think about it, it is a wise investment: spend now to prevent greater expenditure in the future. But that was not a goal of previous governments. In contrast, the Rudd Labor government are in the business of taking action on preventative health. We will listen to the experts like the people involved in the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and like the practitioners on the ground, and we will look seriously at the recommendations given to us. We will take the necessary action to bring about change in our community. We all have stories of someone known to us or close to us who has suffered the effects of a chronic illness that might have otherwise been prevented. I am sure that we all know someone who might benefit from preventative health measures in our local communities. Sometimes that person may even be us. Health choices should be easy choices. While it is never the role of government to make decisions for people, it is the role of government to facilitate the opportunity for the decision MAIN COMMITTEE to be made. We need to make the healthy choice the easy choice. It is my hope that the leadership that will be provided by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will help maximise the opportunities we have in our local communities to make healthy decisions and that not only the young but also those of us who are older will all benefit from these ventures. I commend this bill to the House. tional Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. This bill establishes the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, the ANPHA, to tackle the challenges of preventing chronic disease. The ANPHA is planned to support the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference and the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, in preventing chronic disease. Many of the chronic diseases common in our society can often be prevented. Prevention makes sense. As a society, we want our friends and family to live long and productive lives-free from unnecessary suffering-and as taxpayers we do not want unnecessary costs imposed on our expensive health systems if they can be otherwise avoided. Through the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, the Rudd government is putting $872 million over six years into initiatives targeting chronic disease. These initiatives include programs focusing on poor nutrition, physical activity, smoking and alcohol. There will be social marketing aimed at obesity and tobacco, and infrastructure to support these interventions. When the last two speakers were discussing their issues about this bill and mentioned obesity they looked long and hard at me, so I was a bit concerned! Maybe we all have to take a little bit of care in terms of our own preventative health measures. Other measures proposed in the bill amount to $133 million over four years. This is comprised of four main components: $17.6 million for the creation and ongoing costs of ANPHA; $102 million for a national campaign targeting the important preventative health issues of obesity and smoking; $13.1 million towards a preventative health research fund; and $500,000 to auspice current preventative health arrangements to address gaps and avoid duplication. I would like to particularly note the importance of funding for preventative health research. Despite the knowledge of lifestyle choices and their health consequences, many people still make poor choices-including smoking, drinking excessively and consuming a poor diet. These are problems broadly acknowledged by governments of all notions but are challenging to resolve. While many of us speculate on the best messages to put forward and the various carrot-and-stick approaches, there is no perfect solution. Research is therefore important for us to determine and deliver the best approaches for preventative health. We need to be able to review and conduct research to support the best possible policy development. The ANPHA will complement our strong health treatment systems. In my electorate of Forde, the Logan Hospital, which is a major regional hospital, is facing increasing pressure from population growth in Logan and the northern Gold Coast regions. This makes investment in these vital services more important than ever. Logan Hospital recently received $44 million from the federal government to expand the emergency department. For this announcement, I was honoured to be joined locally by Minister Roxon, the Minister for Health and Ageing, by the Queensland Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, Paul Lucas. Health care and affordable health care is an issue of importance for the people of Forde. MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Illness It Is The New Frontier
182,Mr Raguse (Forde) (6.19 Pm),"I rise today to speak in support of the Australian NaEvery day in my electorate the office deals with situations of individuals who are badly afflicted with preventable chronic diseases. It is a problem that not only negatively affects these people but has an economic impact as well, through reduced capacity to work. If not addressed, many individuals will end up incapacitated-on the Disability Support Pension-due to diseases that could have been prevented. Many people in this situation also experience depression and other mental illnesses, which is a reminder that preventative health must have both a physical and a mental component. To give some examples, both historic and current, we can look at vaccination-a very simple yet effective preventative health measure in Australia. Decisions on vaccination need to be based on solid science. Valid scientific work, research or ideas, amongst other characteristics, should be replicable. Any scientific tests or analyses must be able to be repeated by other experts in the field. They should also face a peer review process in which other experts in the field closely examine the work. Unfortunately, what often passes as research in the popular media and on second-rate internet sites is not valid research. One of the results is that there remain popular movements that oppose vaccination in our society. Recently my office received large quantities of emails entitled ‘Stop mandatory swine flu vaccination’. The content is extraordinary in a number of ways. Not least is the fact that they refer to the tamiflu vaccine when tamiflu, oseltamivir, is not a vaccine but an antiviral drug. The vaccine history provided is an exercise in the selective reproduction of information that would even make most members of the House blush. This could be amusing if it was not being taken seriously and not about such a fundamentally serious issue. One random reported fact from the email-an interesting fact-states that: In 1977, Dr Jonas Salk who developed the first polio vaccine, testified along with other scientists, that mass inoculation against polio was the cause of most polio cases throughout the USA since 1961. The vaccines for polio were developed by Jonas Salk in 1952 and Albert Sabin in 1954. In 1952 there were some 57,600 reported cases of polio in the US with over 3,145 deaths and 21,269 people left with a form of paralysis. The actual number of cases would have been far higher as most polio infections cause no symptoms at all. However, by the year 1961, there were only 161 cases that year in the US. There are now less polio cases in the entire world each year than there were US deaths in 1952. The misleading statement in the standard email suggests that, rather than preventing polio, the vaccine creates it. Yet the statistics speak for themselves. Polio levels, along with related paralysis and death levels, have collapsed around the world because of vaccination. The interesting thing is that we do know that vaccination is about an exposure to a threat, but certainly not in the terms suggested by this email-that is, all vaccinations are bad. In the minds of most people, polio is not a threat. This is largely correct, if only due to effective immunisation programs. Worryingly, the lack of a visible threat appears to breed complacency. For some, the risk of something going wrong during immunisation becomes more real than the disease itself. It is important to remember that polio is real. There are many people in Australia who still suffer from the affects of polio today. There are people who were born before the mass immunisations in the late 1950s. It is not uncommon to be approached by wheelchair-bound constituents in Forde who are still suffering from the consequences of polio. This is not a virus that we want back in Australia and complacency about serious diseases must not take precedence over solid science. MAIN COMMITTEE Further to that, there are issues about hepatitis C-again, unknown some years ago-and the importance of research when we look at any medical application. I have personally been involved in the case of Mr Graham Crust, a constituent who suffers from hepatitis C, which is an infectious disease of the liver. Mr Crust appears to have been infected through a blood transfusion after a work accident in a time when very little information was known about the disease we now know as hep C. This was as late as the early 1980s. The conditions Mr Crust experiences from hep C are severe and impact on every aspect of his life. His conditions include macronodular cirrhosis, hypertension and gout. His capacity to work was substantially compromised and his condition poorly understood by the community. Twenty five years after Mr Crust contracted hep C, we are fortunate to know a lot more about it. We know how people contract hep C, such as through sharing needles and through blood, and in the case of Mr Crust, through a blood transfusion that went horribly wrong. So people do have to endure this dreadful disease and, once again, research into areas like hep C and polio is important. That is why our legislation looks at preventative medicine and health and also the research that goes with it. I have my own experiences with preventative health care. In fact, 25 years ago my father died very suddenly at home. It was quite surprising and, you know, the terrible situation that occurs around an untimely death. It took an autopsy to reveal what had actually happened to him. These severe consequences were caused by lifestyle choices. He was a man who was not necessarily overweight, but certain lifestyle choices, including smoking, were part of the problem. Unfortunately little was known then about the full contributing factors of smoking on cardiac health. It is something that we understand very well these days, but in those days smoking and smoking advertising were still very much a part of our everyday culture. Men in the 1980s were even less aware or motivated than they are today about prevention or lifestyle diseases. I can say that my own experience with my father’s untimely death was something that gave me a wakeup call in my early 20s about the sorts of decisions we need to make. I thought of myself as a well educated person, but I did not know the consequences of high cholesterol and all the other effects. Twenty-five years on, I am much more informed and so is the community. That is a good example of prevention and preventative health. It is so important, and we heard the other speakers today talking not only about the need for an understanding of prevention, but also about the necessary research that should go with that. I am sure my story about unnecessary deaths due to a missing piece of information or a lack of understanding in our community at the time can be repeated tens of thousands of times in this country. In conclusion, preventative health is important for the well-being of the Australian people. This bill establishes the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, the ANPHA, which will coordinate actions tackling preventative health in cooperation with states and territories. Important programs will be delivered, including coordinating research and tackling obesity and smoking. I commend this bill to the House. Ms NEAL (Robertson) (6.30 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. It is high time that Australia strengthened its framework for delivering better health outcomes for our people. In particular, Australia needs a fresh strategy to tackle the problems caused by the increasing incidence of chronic illnesses in our society, many of which are preventable. That is why I am particularly pleased to support the MAIN COMMITTEE government’s present initiative to establish the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, which will coordinate preventative health measures across the country. The Council of Australian Governments agreed to establish the agency in November 2008 as part of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, also known as the prevention NP. The creation of a national preventative health agency was also recommended in the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission’s report released in July 2009, with the National Preventive Health Strategy submitted to government on 30 June 2009. As part of agreements forged under the prevention NP, the Commonwealth government committed to provide $872.1 million in funding for six years for a range of preventative health activities, including the establishment of a national body to oversee preventative health. The government also commissioned three major inquiries into the health system: the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, the Preventative Health Taskforce and, through the Department of Health and Ageing, the National Primary Health Care Strategy External Reference Group. All three reports reinforce the view that more vigorous efforts in the field of prevention are needed. The Preventative Health Taskforce made numerous recommendations on prevention, focusing particularly on obesity, and tobacco and alcohol use. One of the task force’s main recommendations was to establish a national prevention agency. The bill before us outlines the broad approach to the challenges posed by preventable chronic disease. It also sets out the functions, governance and structure of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency-I do not know if we can call it ANPHA, but I am sure someone will along the way. ANPHA will play a key role in delivering the new national approach that this country needs. Under the prevention NP, the government will invest $133.2 million over four years to establish the agency. This includes $17.6 million to set up and maintain the agency itself; another $102 million will be allocated to national social marketing campaigns, targeting obesity and smoking; $13.1 million will be invested in a preventative health research fund which will focus on the translation of research into practice; and a further $500,000 will be used to audit the preventative health workforce and to address any identified gaps. A key initial role of ANPHA will be to provide the leadership, coordination and monitoring required to support the successful implementation of initiatives funded through the prevention NP. This will include $692 million to provide for interventions to help Australians to modify their lifestyles. The agency will support Australian health ministers in tackling the complex and growing challenges of preventable chronic disease. ANPHA will be a statutory authority under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. A chief executive officer will manage ANPHA and will be directly accountable to the minister for its financial management. The CEO will also be responsible to the Australian Health Ministers Conference, via the minister, for the agency’s performance against agreed strategic objectives and operational plans. ventative health expertise in a variety of disciplines and from a variety of sectors. The agency will supply evidence based advice to health ministers on key national-level preventative health issues. It will also provide national leadership and stewardship of surveillance and data on preventable chronic diseases and their lifestyle related risk factors in order to improve the availability and comparability of the evidence. Evidence available from a MAIN COMMITTEE range of sources will be collated to assess and report biannually on the state of preventative health in Australia. The agency will support behavioural changes through education, promotional and community awareness programs relating to preventive health. Financial assistance to third parties will help support the development and evolution of evidence around preventable health interventions and will achieve preventive health gains-for example, through grants supporting research. Partnerships will be formed with relevant groups, including industry and the nongovernment and community sectors, to encourage cooperative action leading to preventive health gains. The agency will promulgate national guidelines, standards, codes, charters and other frameworks to guide preventive health initiatives, interventions and activities. It will also manage schemes for awarding best practice preventive health interventions and activities. The agency staff will consist of people with a wide range of professional skills and will also deal with health promotion, health economics, social marketing and corporate support. The health challenges that are facing Australia are particularly daunting at this time. We have an ageing population combined with problems caused by obesity, smoking, alcohol and unhealthy eating. These are posing serious problems for the health of Australians. Australia currently spends less than two per cent of its health budget on preventative health. This is very much an indication of some of the pressures that are placed on our primary healthcare system. The time to act on this particular problem is now. Any action to address the challenges presented by preventable health conditions must be done in a coordinated way through a national body. The ageing of the Australian population is perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing this nation in the coming decades. By 2050 the number of people aged 70 years and over will triple to more than six million. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, where my electorate is situated, there are currently 43,000 people aged 70 years and over, representing 13 per cent of the region’s population. In New South Wales the proportion of people aged 70 and over is approximately 10 per cent, so it is clear that the measures contained in this bill will be of vital interest to my constituents. That is why I am particularly concerned that this bill receives the full support of all members of this House and that it is passed quickly so that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will begin its important work on 1 January 2010, as is planned. The challenges posed to all governments by the long-term demographic change in Australia’s population will be enormous. The costs associated with this trend will also be enormous. If we fail to act now to put in place appropriate policy settings to account for our ageing population, the costs will be far greater down the track. Smoking and obesity are major lifestyle factors that will be a focus for the new agency. Both smoking and obesity are preventable health risks that continue to burden our people both in human cost to people’s health and in lost productivity. Between 1950 and 2008, an estimated 90,000 Australians died of smoking related diseases. Today, approximately three million Australians continue to smoke despite endless evidence of the health risks that are associated with it and the other stresses and strains it causes our lives. I do not wish to suggest anything here. Lung cancer remains the biggest killer of any cancer affecting our society today. Approximately 25 per cent of cancer deaths are attributable to tobacco and alcohol use. The Preventative Health Taskforce has called for a target of reducing smoking rates to less than 10 per cent MAIN COMMITTEE of the population. This would mean one million fewer smokers in Australia and would result in 300,000 fewer premature deaths. While smoking rates have fallen over time, uptake rates among young Australians are still too high. I am constantly amazed, when meeting my young son’s friends, how many of them still smoke and how horrified I am by that. Tobacco remains the single biggest preventable cause of death and disease among Australians. This is a societal impediment to improving the nation’s health that must be tackled. Alcohol consumption in Australia is still high by world standards. About 10 per cent of people in Australia drink at levels which put them at risk of long-term harm. According to the Preventative Health Taskforce, obesity trends in Australia are also alarming. If left unchecked, the life expectancy of Australia’s children living today will fall by two years by the time they turn 20. Constructive steps must be taken to ensure that this retrograde legacy is not visited upon future generations. The Rudd government is determined to meet this challenge. cordance with standing order 192.

Gippsland Electorate: Princes Highway Road Toll Princes Highway east of Sale and the need for additional funding to improve the safety of the road environment. Since 2004, there have been 24 fatalities and countless accidents and serious injuries on the highway stretching from Sale to the New South Wales border. The safely of local residents and visitors to East Gippsland is being compromised by the condition of the highway. I am not the only person to hold this view. The RACV has repeatedly called on state and federal governments to increase funding for upgrading the highway, given its current two-star and three-star ranking under the AusRAP-the Australian Road Assessment Program. The star ratings highlight the failure to improve safety on this stretch of highway and, as AusRAP has indicated in previous reports, safer roads have the potential to save as many lives as safer vehicles and improved driver behaviour combined. There is widespread concern within the East Gippsland community that funding for the Princes Highway has been diminished as a result of a strategy to upgrade an alternative route between Bairnsdale and Nowa Nowa. The concerns have been exacerbated by a number of serious accidents, particularly on the approaches to Lakes Entrance from both directions. In particular, there are concerns with the alignment of sweeping bends, the placement of overtaking lanes and the road surface itself. There are sections of the highway, particularly east of Orbost, where there are no shoulders on the sides of the road and the road surface is in an appalling condition. Too many people are losing loved ones on East Gippsland’s roads. I repeat my appeal to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to work with my community to have the highway listed as a Road of National Importance to help secure additional funding for much-needed road safety upgrades.

Deaths in Custody Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.41 pm)-On 27 January 2008, a much-loved and respected Aboriginal elder from the Warburton community in WA, Mr Ward, died while being transported 360 kilometres from Laverton to Kalgoorlie by the government contractor GSL Custodial Services, now known as G4S. Mr Ward, who had been locked in the back of a prisoner transport vehicle with broken air conditioning for three hours and 45 minutes on a day when the outside temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius, died from heatstroke. The state coroner noted deep burns on Mr Ward’s abdomen from contact with the boiling metal of the van’s floor and found that Mr Ward had ‘suffered a terrible death while in custody which was wholly unnecessary and avoidable’. The appalling circumstances of Mr Ward’s death remind us that we must do all we can to protect human rights and human dignity. I offer condolences to Mr Ward’s family and encouragement and thanks to those in the community who are dedicated to ensuring that deaths in custody become a salutary lesson in history instead of something for which we as a community continue to bear the immense present shame. TodayI received from the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee of WA a petition of some 3,500 signatures calling for the federal parliament to ensure our criminal justice system meets our human rights treaty obligations, for the Australian Human Rights Commission to inquire into the extreme overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in our justice system and for the government to work with the states and territories to ensure that all coronial and royal commission recommendations are promptly acted upon. I hereby present that petition. Standing Committee on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms to the standing orders Homelessness and Young People School and was handed a petition by the head boy and head girl of the school, Justin Micale and Ellen Collins. The petition was under the name of the principal, Joanne Harris, and signed by 170 members of the school community, including staff and students. I understand that the petition came about as a result of a study of poverty and the concerns that the students had about the need for permanent housing facilities for young people at risk of homelessness. I also understand that there are very few housing programs for those under 16. The Greenwood Senior High School petition makes mention of Horizon House in Wanneroo, also known as Bendat House. Jack and Eleanor Bendat donated $100,000 towards the operation of the house, although Jack has committed $2 million in total for the Horizon House concept in Western Australia. The Rotary Club of Matilda Bay has also been involved, as has the St John of God Foundation, which secured a grant from Lotterywest to furnish the home. Providing not only accommodation but also skills training as a Work for the Dole program has resulted in a very big horticultural upgrade to the front section of this immense property.

The Ipswich Motorway will soon celebrate its first completed section, that of the Ipswich-Logan motorway interchange. This section of the upgrade was the most complex part of the overall project and it has been done under full traffic conditions. It involved a major upgrade of the interchange and a 2.2-kilometre stretch of the Ipswich Motorway between Gailes and Goodna. The project is due to be completed by the end of the year. I put on record the great work that has been done by the project partners: Leightons as the contractors, Main Roads, the state government and Ipswich City Council. I make special mention of Leightons for their community engagement and the way in which they have worked very well with the local community during a very difficult period. RecentlyI attended a Legacy event where some 200 trees were planted as part of a Woogaroo Creek restoration project. This project was a way of thanking the local community for their patience and understanding during construction of this integral capital work. The Ipswich Motorway upgrade is technically difficult, it is geographically complex and it comes at a high cost in testing the patience of local community. I congratulate all the residents, all the people in the community along the motorway upgrade, for their patience and cooperation in dealing with the project. The Ipswich Motorway upgrade has spanned some 10 years since I began to lobby for its full upgrade, and it is finally being fulfilled under this government. (Time expired) Kangaroo Harvesting and Processing provide assistance to the kangaroo harvesting industry and processing sector, which has been virtually crippled by the Russian ban on roo meat imports. Russia’s imports accounted for around 70 per cent of the market and their ban has resulted in 2,500 jobs being lost across the nation and more than 10 kangaroo processing facilities being forced to close. The kangaroo meat industry is worth $270 million to regional Australian economies and if you take into account the multiplier effect the industry has a total value of in excess of a billion dollars. The proposed new regulations to improve hygiene standards are being discussed with harvesters, and they understand that for the industry to continue and for the Russian market and new markets to open, world’s best food hygiene standards will have to be implemented. These new changes will cost the industry more than $20 million. That is why I am taking this opportunity to request the minister to provide some assistance. MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Statements By Members

It is obviously an issue of great concern to constituents in Brisbane. More broadly, it is clearly of great concern to constituents around this country and elsewhere. The second petition is signed by 2,097 Australians and asks that the parliament retain the current restrictions on parallel importation of books.

Swan Electorate: Seniors Forum Homestay Village in my electorate of Swan. I am pleased to report that the forum attracted a lively and inquisitive audience of senior Australians and was supported by both the shadow minister for ageing, Margaret May, and WA Senator Chris Back. A number of issues were raised which I would like to mention briefly now. Many seniors were unaware of federal government money they are entitled to. However, finding out about these entitlements is only half the battle. Feedback from seniors attending the forum indicated that simply completing these bureaucrat designed forms is too difficult for some. A lot of the seniors said they had to get other people to help them fill out many forms. They have many pages and they are too difficult for them to complete. Some of the bureaucracy seniors have to deal with seems ludicrous. I know that the City of Canning offers services from time to time to assist seniors with their paperwork, but government also has a responsibility to make life easier and forms simpler. The mayor of the City of Canning, Mr Joe Delle Donne, came to the morning tea and also explained the services and facilities available from the city. I see Joe was re-elected on the weekend, and I congratulate him. Other issues raised included the aged care crisis, pensions, superannuation and changes to aircraft noise in my electorate. Five aircraft flew overhead during the morning tea. After the formal part of the forum, I enjoyed a cup of tea and good discussion with homestay residents Ruth, Brenda and Lorna. My thanks to the homestay village managers, Kevin and Gloria Stilling, for their hospitality. Northern Rivers Bushfires Ms SAFFIN (Page) (6.50 pm)-I would like to pay tribute in this House to firefighters from four agencies who have been working overtime to control bushfires in my federal electorate of Page, and the neighbouring electorates of Cowper and Richmond, since late last week. It is hard not to mention neighbouring electorates because the firefighters and the fires do not know the boundaries; they have been working over them all. Tragically, a retained Kingscliff fire brigade firefighter, Andrew ‘Packy’ Turnbull, died after battling a grass fire at Fingal Head last Friday night. Mr Turnbull leaves behind five children and two stepchildren. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and many friends in the Tweed shire. Firefighting crews from New South Wales Rural Fire Service, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Forest New South Wales and New South Wales Fire Brigades have been working long shifts to battle the Centre Road fire near Brooms Head village on the Clarence Coast.

The danger is far from over as little rain has fallen. (Time expired) North-South Perth Railway Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.52 pm)-Through the middle of my electorate runs the main north-south Perth freeway and railway, an impressive project at first glance. The problem is that the government’s state ALP cohorts, in designing this rail project, considered only superficialities and not such fundamental issues as where the passengers would park their cars before boarding trains. Now we have a situation where a high-speed rail line whisks commuters from the suburbs to the CBD, but many of those commuters are forced to remain in their cars because of a lack of parking. Transport authorities say they should use feeder buses from their homes to rail stations, but this is obviously impractical for many, particularly families whose routine before and after work includes dropping off and picking up children from schools and childcare centres. I am aware the new coalition state government is doing its best to remedy the problem, but where is the federal government’s much vaunted largess when it comes to fixing problems created by its own party colleagues? It is all very well to extend funding to a few feel-good projects, but when will they fix the critical flaws in existing projects created by their own party, which are causing massive inconvenience to tens of thousands of people every day? International Awards for Liveable Communities Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (6.53 pm)-The 2009 International Awards for Liveable Communities was recently held in the city of Pilsen in Czech Republic.

LivCom is the world’s only awards competition focusing on best practice regarding the management of the local environment. The objective of LivCom is to improve the quality of life of individual citizens through the creation of liveable communities. Last week my home region of Rockhampton was awarded bronze in category C, which is for communities of 75,000 to 200,000 people. The Rockhampton region consists of the wonderful communities of Gracemere, Mount Morgan, Rockhampton and the Capricorn Coast. To quote from the Rockhampton Regional Council’s submission: The region’s fundamental strengths, its people, its beautiful settings and depth of built heritage, its facilities and water reserves-will ensure a healthy future for generations to follow.

MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Statements By Members
192,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Kj Andrews),"Order! In accordance with standing orConsideration resumed from 16 September. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. The Clean Energy Security Bill 2009 deals with amendments to the renewable energy target legislation and seeks to add two very important components. The first is a restriction on the amount of certificates available to any special or separate form of renewable energy-that is, wind versus tidal versus hot rocks versus solar. This is designed to make sure that a single technology does not dominate the marketplace due to its maturity, for instance. Therefore, it will make sure that investment will be attracted to other more efficient, reliable and suitable technologies. The Kimberley tidal power region in Western Australia, on advice I received years ago from CSIRO, has the capacity to replace all of the energy, including energy of mobility, throughout Australia. What is more, that has been confirmed by the World Energy Council. That well-established international organisation highlighted just two inlets of the myriad inlets in that region that could produce 120 per cent more energy than is presently produced in Western Australia from the established technologies and the established generators. It could easily replace all of the energy consumed in Australia in times to come. The second schedule relates to the efficiencies and, therefore, the renewable characteristics of a transmission system. The world has discovered that shifting electricity over longer distances-anything over 500 kilometres-is more efficiently achieved using currently available high-voltage DC transmission. The Chinese, who are not investing or participating in an emissions trading scheme, have been boasting to Minister Wong, who is in the Senate, about their attempts to build a 2,000 kilometre high-voltage DC transmission system to shift their renewable energies, such as from the Three Gorges Dam and some wind farms in their western deserts, to the manufacturing sector on their east coast. We, of course, in Australia have such a wire now running between Tasmania and Victoria, which interconnects the available power in those two states. This is very important. The Europeans, with a highly qualified inquiry, have just established that they can shift from the Sahara solar generated power over 3,000 kilometres to Europe with only a 10 per cent line loss. They go on in that report to say that, if they attempted to do that with the established technology of Australia-high-voltage AC transmission-it would consume 45 per cent of the power generated. We should use this technology and recognise it as a virtual renewable resource because, if you can get twice as much electricity out of the other end of the pipeline, you have halved the relevant emissions associated with the generation of that power. It is, therefore, most important that this sort of technology be given the recognition it needs. It is not cheap. By the way, it can all be installed underground and give great advantage to Australia. It should be included as a renewable resource, notwithstanding that it does not generate electricity; it simply saves it. I recommend this bill to the House and to members of the government as a worthwhile improvement in the renewable energy sector. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (7.00 pm)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the member for O’Connor’s private member’s bill tonight. I can see MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Statements By Members
193,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (6.55 Pm),"I move:from his bill that he has given the proposed amendments to the renewable energy legislation a great deal of thought. While I do not support the proposals he has put forward, I know from hearing him speak at a number of events in this House over many years that his interest in and knowledge of various forms of renewable energy are very genuine and I can see that that is what has motivated the Clean Energy Security Bill 2009. The reason that I am not supporting these proposals is that these are matters that were given quite a bit of an airing during the consideration of the latest renewable energy bill, which was debated not so long ago in this House. That bill is designed to greatly expand the amount of renewable energy being generated in Australia. It increases the current mandatory renewable energy target by over four times, from the current 9,500 gigawatt hours to 45,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. The advice and the evidence received during the discussions and consultation over the new RET legislation show that this increase will pull through a whole range of technologies including wind, biomass, solar and geothermal energy. In answering the member for O’Connor, no doubt tidal energy will have its role to play as well. The question of banding, which is essentially what the private member’s bill seeks to achieve, carving out a proportion of the increased renewable energy target to provide a greater incentive for particular emerging technologies, was looked at in some detail by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee when they had an inquiry into the renewable energy legislation. After listening to the arguments for and against, the committee did not support that banding proposal. I will quote from the Clean Energy Council’s submission to the committee. The reason I picked this submission is that, if you look at the membership and sponsors of the Clean Energy Council, you see that they cross a broad range of industries and companies involved in the renewable and clean energy sector. SoI suppose the council is not really pushing any particular barrow. In relation to banding, the council says: The Council is aware of a number of representations to introduce banding to the RET to guarantee a share of the target to specific emerging technologies. Banding will undermine the integrity of the RET and seriously impede the deployment of least cost proven renewable energy technologies. Banding is a complex addition to the RET and may not help an emerging technology push faster through the costs and risks of development and commercialisation … Banding is little more than educated guesswork that will increase the cost of the RET without guaranteeing the success of emerging technologies. The council finishes up by saying: … there are significant issues being faced by emerging technologies that will not be solved by the RET alone. We think that this will require a separate policy measure to encourage these technologies to develop to a point when they are competitive. The government agrees with that point of view and that is why in the budget earlier this year we put forward a $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative. One of the measures within that is $465 million to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. One of the programs that the Centre for Renewable Energy is in charge of is the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, and I understand there will be announcements about the successful projects under that program. So the government is actively encouraging and promoting the development of these new technologies through those measures. We do not see the RET as being the vehicle that will do that. We have avoided picking winners in the RET legislation. The targets are there to MAIN COMMITTEE provide incentives. We do not want to pick winners within that but we are happy to consider proposals for new technologies under these other, separate government measures. There is great news on renewables in my electorate of Capricornia with Mackay Sugar proceeding with its very significant investment into burning bagasse to provide up to 30 per cent of Mackay’s electricity, which creates a great return and source of revenue for cane growers in central Queensland. pired.

National Schools Chaplaincy Program Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Randall: That the House: (1) notes that in 2007, the Coalition Government initiated the National Schools Chaplaincy Program (NSCP); (2) acknowledges the important role of school chaplains in supporting the personal, spiritual and emotional well-being of students at schools throughout Australia; (3) recognises that school chaplains provide essential services to students of all ages, staff and the wider school community, assisting them resolve emotional, social and everyday issues and build relationships; (4) notes that the Government’s failure to renew existing contracts awarded under the NSCP will impact student welfare, personal and academic development and place additional pressure on school resources; and (5) calls on the Government to: (a) extend the NSCP beyond the life of the existing contracts due to expire in 2010; (b) support an extension of the program to make chaplains available to more schools; and (c) acknowledge that failing to renew funding for this widely accessed service will disadvantage students. going to propose the motion that was on the Notice Paper in the name of the member for Canning. cently I was visited by a delegation of people in my electorate office to talk about school chaplains and ask me for my support to have the federal funding renewed and increased. I was told that there were 19 chaplains in schools within the electorate of Cowan. I appreciate that they came to see me, but they were already speaking to the converted because I see the excellent work that chaplains do in Cowan schools. AndI believe so much in their work that I am coordinating a chaplathon, or a walkathon, next month. YouthCARE runs the School Chaplains Program, and the chaplathon will involve a number of chaplain district councils gathering together at the Carine Open Space with supporters from throughout the northern suburbs.

Releaders that have been helping me organise this event: Peter Jackson, Fran Blamphey, Darrell Thatcher, Colin Zis, Zoe Clune, Joe Forde, Shirley Pyrc, Dianne Stephenson and Malcolm Rule. With regard to the chaplathon, local businesses have been donating food for the sausage sizzle, and the Encounter Church will be donating use of their bouncy castle. This is a community effort and will demonstrate the strong support that exists for the chaplains. It will, however, not raise a sum of money that will enable more chaplains to be employed or to greatly increase the capability of chaplains to assist school students. The continuation and expansion of federal government funding for school chaplains is required, and that is why this motion has been moved by the member for Canning. Funding chaplains in schools was commenced by the Howard government in 2007, an excellent decision. Although some elements objected and said funding should be for counsellors, the majority of this nation thought it was a good idea and embraced it. In preparing for today I asked for the views of school leaders across Cowan to see what they would say about the coalition’s move for continued and more funding. I can inform the House that support was overwhelming. I will begin with the cluster of schools comprising Ashdale Secondary College, Ashdale Primary School, Landsdale Primary and Madeley Primary School. These schools work closely together and have been acknowledged as independent state schools by the Barnett government in Western Australia. The schools have one chaplain between them, and I refer to Zoe Clune. Carol Strauss, the principal of Ashdale Secondary College, describes Zoe as, ‘an integral part of our student services team as she provides emotional support for students who may not feel comfortable talking about some of their issues with a teacher or school psychologist’. Carol Strauss finishes a substantial letter with: ‘I would strongly advise against a move to take away funding for this vital component of our school systems’-a point clearly made. I also thank Dr Tony Curry, the principal of Mercy College, for his letter. Mercy College is a Catholic school that offers an education from K to 12. The school is located in Koondoola, and that is a suburb of challenging socioeconomic circumstances-as are the nearby suburbs. Dr Curry told me that the SES rating is low at 94 and that 35 per cent of families are eligible for the Commonwealth’s healthcare card. Fifty-eight different nationalities are represented by the students. In these circumstances, complex and at times more severe problems face the students. Dr Curry says of his chaplain: We believe that we have a responsibility to “reach out” to such students (and their families) and the chaplaincy funding has enabled us to do this. The existence of a chaplain has meant undoubtedly that many social problems are either minimised or negated completely. I would also note in particular the strong support by Mr Noel Woodley, the principal of Girrawheen Senior High School, Dave Stevens of ALTA-1, as well as Gay Fortune, the principal, and Ian Maserai, the deputy, at Morley Senior High. I have for some years known Peter Jackson and Fran Blamphey, chaplains and supporters of young people. If we talk about long-term commitment to an area and the children of an area, it is easy to mention these names-and so many people know them as well. These are good people, committed to a better community and dedicated to giving children and young people the best possible future. I finish by saying that in CowanI have never heard a bad word said of the chaplains, only ever strong support. I have seen the way the chaplains work MAIN COMMITTEE and the way the children interact with them. This is an excellent program that adds great value, and I urge the government to commit to an expanded program immediately. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (7.10 pm)-I was in opposition for three years, as you know, and I have been on the government side now for a year and a half. Having been on both sides of the House, one of the things that I think would make governments even better would be if they did not have to actually make choices. It would be good if, every time we saw a program which a large number of people in our electorate liked or which we thought had some merit, we could just go with it and did not have to sometimes put one thing aside in order to support something else. I remember the epiphany I had within about four hours of us winning government when I realised that, when you are in government, there really are no excuses. If you do not do something, it is because you did not want to, as you really do have the power. Yet, when we are in government, we are continually looking at that infinite range of choices and deciding which of those options we will pursue and which we will set aside. Which choice we make on the National Schools Chaplaincy Program is not defined as yet. The review is still underway, yet I am very aware when I listen to the members of the opposition speak on this that there is considerable support for it, but we will, in time, have to consider whether it is a priority area or whether we have other priorities. The National Schools Chaplaincy Program was a three-year program initiated in 2007 by the Howard government and it allocated $165 million over three years for chaplaincy services in schools. Each school was able to apply for up to $20,000 per year for three years. It recognised that for some religious affiliations the word ‘chaplain’ may not be appropriate and it uses that word as a generic term, but it can equally apply to imams, rabbis, lay leaders or religious workers. There were two rounds of the program in 2007 and around 2,700 schools were funded. On election, the Rudd government undertook to honour those commitments and will fund the schools for the program through its three-year term to 2010. There have been some issues with implementation of the program and changes were made in early 2008. The main problem was that schools were able to apply for funding without having identified a chaplain, and a number of schools that had received funding reported difficulties with finding a chaplain. For this reason, the government decided to allow the successful schools to use an alternative worker if they could not locate a chaplain by July 2008. Such schools are able to use other suitable services such as appropriately qualified counsellors, youth workers and other secular support staff. I am aware that many schools are making use of the funding in areas that are much broader than the original chaplaincy stream. These include organising sporting events, working with children who suffer trauma from their times in refugee camps, and working with children with drug-affected parents or children with language needs. The immediate needs vary considerably and the alteration of the program due to the difficulty in finding chaplains, I believe, has made the program much more flexible to respond to the needs of the local community. I am aware that in some electorates-and the previous member referred to 19 schools in his electorate-the program has been widely adopted. In my electorate it is much more marginal as there are only four schools in the electorate of Parramatta that have taken up the chaplaincy program, although I do admit that there may be a couple of Catholic schools that I have missed because of the commonality of names such as St Pauls and the lack of addresses on the reports. But there appear to be only four schools in the program in my electorate, and I am MAIN COMMITTEE aware that those schools use those chaplaincy funds very well for the needs of their local community. We are of course extremely well served by religious institutions in Parramatta which has a very strong Catholic community and has one of the largest proportions of Catholics of any electorate. We have the largest Sikh temple to the north, the largest Hindu temple to the south, the largest Buddhist temple outside of Wollongong just on the border and there is a brand new mosque opening very soon. In terms of religious institutions it is an extremely well-served community. Money for education is not unlimited and the Rudd government, like all governments, will need to make choices. The process that leads to that choice is taking place now. The program will be reviewed and its effectiveness assessed. There is no plan for a further round at this time but the program will be reviewed and, as appropriate, the government will make a decision on whether the National Schools Chaplaincy Program delivers in a priority area and whether it is the most effective mechanism to deliver services to schools. Meanwhile, we can all acknowledge the hard work being undertaken in our communities by schools, chaplains and lay people who work with children, teachers and families in need. role that school chaplains play in schools across Australia. The program was the coalition’s initiative, fostered by the wide support of local communities. This support has seen the National Schools Chaplaincy Program become a fundamental service in many Australian schools. Chaplains offer students support, advice and guidance across a raft of issues and in many cases they fill a void. But the highly successful program is in jeopardy, with funding set to run out. Existing contracts end next year and there has been no commitment by the Rudd government to extend the program. We have had that largely confirmed tonight. I welcomed the coalition’s initial investment of $90 million to ensure that any Australian school that wanted a chaplain got one. That was $20,000 to every school. In fact, the program was so popular that $165 million was put into it. The success of the program speaks for itself. Since 2007, the number of school chaplains in Western Australia has tripled. The Rudd government must recognise that there are other means of nurturing students’ well-being. There is nothing wrong with values based education. Chaplains are men and women who come from a trained background and bring a strong value into often complicated lives. Schools back the program. It has been hugely successful in supporting not only students but teachers and the wider school community. I recently met with Stanley Jeyaraj, National School Chaplaincy Association convenor and Chief Executive Officer of YouthCARE, who could not speak highly enough about the results the program is delivering throughout the country. In Western Australia alone, more than 80,000 students have access to a chaplain and in 2008 more than 80,000 pastoral care appointments were made with YouthCARE chaplains. A report recently released by Edith Cowan University and the University of New England confirmed that the government should re-fund the program for at least another three years because ‘chaplains provide better pastoral care, support and guidance than school based staff’. A survey of 688 principals cannot be wrong. The study found that behaviour management, bullying, peer relationships, family relationships and self-esteem issues accounted for up to 90 per cent of the chaplains’ work. More than half also reported dealing with drug and alcohol MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Private Members Business
197,Mr Randall (Canning) (7.15 Pm),"I rise to speak today about the increasingly vitalabuse and mental health issues. Without chaplaincy there are limited resources to address these social issues. The flow-on effect this outlet has had on communities must be acknowledged. Youth unemployment and antisocial behaviour are among society’s top-ranking issues and the levels of youth depression are concerning. The impact a support base in school could have on curbing these problems cannot be underestimated. As a former school teacher, I have seen first hand that the earliest years of life have important implications for a child’s future. School communities are looking for support and certainty from the government on this issue. They have called for an investment of $300 million over three years. They also want to see criteria expanded to allow more schools to access the funding. More than 4,000 Canning families have access to a school chaplain, with 19 Canning schools having YouthCARE chaplains. A number of local schools secured funding under the program, including Serpentine Jarrahdale Grammar School, Carey Baptist College, Westfield Park Primary School, Kelmscott Primary School, Kelmscott Senior High School-and students from that school are here in Canberra today-Roleystone District High School, Halls Head Primary School and Armadale Senior High School. I recently met with Armadale Senior High School Principal Mary Griffiths and heard about the positive influence that chaplain David Karcheski has on the students. He is well respected, and students are comfortable speaking with someone outside the facility. At the Kelmscott Show this weekend I met Glenda Morgan, the school chaplain at Neerigen Brook Primary School, who loves her job. Glenda was appointed when the program commenced two years ago and she was telling me about the huge success the program is at the school. The additional emphasis the school places on pastoral care really ties in with her work. Glenda is paid two days a week under the program, but the school stumps up the extra money itself. Obviously her job will be under threat next year if it cannot be funded. She is fortunate that the school finds a way to pay for the additional two days that she does a week. Also at the show, it was great to see volunteers from the Anglican St Mary-in-the-Valley, Kelmscott Parish, manning a stall selling crafts, cakes and jams all to raise money for chaplaincy. These volunteers are to be commended on donating their time and effort to raise money to keep chaplains where they are needed-in the schools. If government funding is not continued, it will take some very successful cake stalls to raise the sums of money needed to keep chaplains in the schools. I commend this program. Pinjarra Senior High School in my electorate recently wrote to the Prime Minister, calling on him to find ongoing funding for the program. I do not have time to read out the letter from Beth Aitkin, the principal, but she certainly endorses this program. It really does make a great deal of difference to students, and $300 million is a small price for huge benefits. (Time expired) first announced in 2006, it was broadly supported by the Labor Party. I know that because I was one of the few who raised objections to the funding in the caucus. The then leader, Kim Beazley, was very supportive of the proposal and made the same point as the member for Canning: that the program was well received in the state of Western Australia, where it had been in place for some years. I must say that I have not changed my view of the National Schools Chaplaincy Program. As I said in 2006-and it applies even more today-there is a MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Private Members Business
198,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (7.20 Pm),"When the funding program for school chaplains wascrying need for a boost to school counselling services and family support measures and these should receive priority over a program which, as far as I can tell, is poorly targeted and does not address the needs of disadvantaged schools in my electorate of Fowler and other electorates throughout Australia. I have to say that in my 11 years in this parliament I have visited the full range of schools in my electorate. As members would be aware, visiting schools often leads to a wish list of resources and facilities that the schools desperately need. But in those 11 years I cannot recall one request-not one-for funding for a school chaplain. School staff are increasingly frustrated by the lack of response when mandatory notifications are made to the New South Wales Department of Community Services. It is clear that the crucial needs of so many students are not being met. While some may see value in chaplaincy services, it is easy to see where resources are most needed. ‘Praise the Lord and pass the Ritalin’ is no substitute for well-resourced and professional intervention where children face a home life often dominated by alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence and family tragedy. While such intervention is the responsibility of state governments, it makes no sense for any government to lavish funds on chaplaincy programs while denying children and families adequate support. In a similar way, personal support programs exist in every school but, again, in many cases a shortage of resources restricts the ability of these programs to fully meet the needs of the school community. It only remains for chaplaincy services to address the spiritual side of student welfare. This in itself is a contentious aspect of the chaplaincy program, with not all religious bodies being happy with school chaplaincy services being provided by another denomination or faith. At a time when we are to compare the performance of schools nationally, we acknowledge that all schools are not created equal. Study after study in Australia has found that the most significant indicator of a student’s performance is the home environment. Good teaching can only make a difference when students are receptive to learning, but in many schools in the Fowler electorate teachers can spend most of their time dealing with behaviour problems and only a small fraction of their time on teaching. It is the good students who miss out because of the loss of teaching time. We must admit that classroom teachers can only do so much to deliver the stable and caring environment in which learning can take place. Teachers must first of all be educators, not social workers. Without backup resources, our poorest performing schools cannot be expected to improve. So far, the proposed steps to follow the identification of poorly performing schools include little in the way of intervention which will improve the home and school environment, which is necessary to help students. While we talk of the cycle of poverty, as a nation we have done little to break that cycle. We know that education is the key to improving the lives of young Australians from disadvantaged backgrounds, but while ever we simply put the total responsibility on our schools and teachers we will never address the problem. We do not need school chaplains. We do need resources and professionals to improve the home, community and school environment to support our teachers to do what they should-and that is to teach. That would be a real education revolution. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (7.25 pm)-I rise to speak on the National Schools Chaplaincy Program motion moved by the member for Canning. As we know, the program began under the Liberal government in October 2007 and was funded for three years until late 2010. In MAIN COMMITTEE Western Australia, this program is implemented through YouthCARE, who provide pastoral care, Christian religious education, personal and professional development staff and volunteers and, most importantly, put chaplains in schools where they are needed. In my electorate of Forrest, 34 schools have YouthCARE chaplains servicing around 12,826 students and over 5,000 families. The NSCP provides assistance not only to schools but also to their communities. It has been estimated that the chaplaincy service in Collie, a town in my electorate, is supporting 50 to 70 per cent of the community. Recently two schools, Wilson Park in Collie and Busselton Senior High School, have been the target of arson and vandalism. In these circumstances, the chaplaincy program is a necessity to provide care and comfort to the students, teachers and parents. One school chaplain in my electorate named Adrianne has said: I see anything from 4 to 10 students per day for a range of issues mostly to do with family relationships, peer problems and behaviour management. Sometimes, I see pairs or small groups of students for mediation and often have a quiet smile on my face because kids will bring a friend when they think that friend needs some help. Adrianne also shared a story that I will share: A bright, attractive girl usually wearing a very big smile, Rebecca was given 2 minutes by the staff member to speak to me. After a brief chat, it quickly became clear that Rebecca was going to need more than a few minutes. I rescheduled her for the afternoon and spent an hour just chatting with her fairly informally. She disclosed that she was feeling sad all the time and was cutting herself on a regular basis. Rebecca has become a regular for me and as our relationship has developed, she has opened up even more, revealing some serious issues in her background. The good news is that I have been able to refer her to our School Psychologist and we are now working as a team in this case. Rebecca came to see me recently and very excitedly told me she hadn’t cut herself for over 2 weeks. She said she was feeling happier in general but of course we will continue to keep her engaged. A principal from one of the schools in my electorate who is part of the NSCP also shared a story: The parent of a student passed away suddenly in the most unfortunate circumstance. The young family was traumatised by the passing and got through with the support of family and friends until the funeral. However after this time the family went into an emotional decline. After the schools response plan was initiated the chaplain was able to: Approach the child at the school and establish a friendly rapport as a significant adult confidante Establish a safe place for the student to run when grief issues arose during the day and where they could talk and compose Arrange for counselling for the child in school and for the remaining family adults out of school Support the children in line with advice from these counsellors including liaising with teachers by offering advice Help the family adult approach Centrelink for system support a real issue here Arrange for a meal roster with other families and Arrange for the children to attend a local youth group one evening per week. The family are travelling as well as could be expected but the child has been present each day since intervention and is keeping up with their school work. MAIN COMMITTEE As you can see, the National Schools Chaplaincy Program recognises that schools play a key role in providing support and assistance for all students as they cope with the challenges and stresses of life. I recently met and discussed the significant impact chaplains are making with the NSCP Convenor and YouthCARE executive officers. Chaplains are particularly significant in regional and isolated areas, including in towns in my electorate, where chaplains are more likely to be living in the local community and are able to bring support within the school for community projects. A recent study found that approximately 53 per cent of chaplains are under the age of 30, meaning they are often more in touch with the issues and pressures facing students. To have access to a safe service that offers guidance and support for students is of immeasurable assistance. YouthCARE has requested an increase in funding from $165 million to $300 million for the program to provide for two days of chaplaincy per school per year throughout Australian schools. I strongly support YouthCARE and their request for an increase in funding for the National Schools Chaplaincy Program and urge the government to continue funding this program past 2010. The Collie Rotary Club places such importance on the chaplaincy program that we conduct that I assisted them with a ‘sleeping out with the homeless program’ to assist in funding the chaplaincy program in schools in Collie. That is the value that the local rotary club and community place on this particular program. Ms REA (Bonner) (7.30 pm)-I would like to inform the House about the very significant role that school chaplains play in the schools in Bonner in the bayside suburbs, particularly Wynnum and Manly. The school chaplains in the two key high schools in those areasWynnum State High School and Wynnum North State High School-have been there since the early 1990s. They are not there as a result of a program that was introduced by the previous government in 2007. In fact, there have been several school chaplains. Greg Deighton and Randall Gill, the current serving chaplains, are doing a wonderful job in supporting the students of those two high schools. They are doing that with the great support of the chaplaincy chairman for that area, Tom Andrews, who is a well-known character in the Wynnum-Manly area. He is a great supporter of the community. He has a very generous heart and he understands many problems through his own personal suffering and through his commitment to helping people whenever they are in need. The local bayside area significantly recognises and values the chaplains. Every year there is a fundraising breakfast held at the local leagues club to raise money for the school chaplaincy service provided at those two high schools. It has now expanded, as a result of the 2007 funding, into several primary schools at Tingalpa, Wynnum North, Darling Point Special School, Manly State Primary School and Lota State School, where Nyree Mannion, Bruce Gowlett, Chrissie O’Brien, Chris Allen and Aaron Bligh all play a very significant role in supporting the students in that local community. As we have already heard, the school chaplains play a very vital role, which is effectively a counselling role. They provide emotional support to students. They respond to crises. They attempt to prevent, and hopefully pick up early signs of, problems. They are able to work with the students, the school community and their families to try to deal with those issues. I wanted to speak to this motion because, having met the school chaplains in my area, in particular Tom and those who serve at the high schools, I am very aware of how important MAIN COMMITTEE those individuals are. It may well be because they are school chaplains or it could well be because of the commitment they have made to religious service, but I think it is also because of who they are as people and their dedication to supporting the children and the students in that local community. That is why I believe that this motion, to a certain extent, while it is expressing support for school chaplains, is a little misleading. I believe it is important that the government has committed three years of funding to next year, 2010, to this service. I also believe it is important that all schools and school chaplains acknowledge that they must be accountable for the money that is being funded to them through the government and the taxpayers of this country. Therefore, I believe a three-year time frame is an adequate period in order for the chaplains to provide an important service and to build up good relationships in the school. At the same time we must always acknowledge that taxpayer funding cannot simply be never ending. There must be a period of review and evaluation. If we acknowledge that the role that chaplains are playing is primarily an important and significant one because of the counselling that they do then I believe the government should look through its budget processes at ways in which it can provide a broader service that may not necessarily just be faith based. There could be other forms of counselling and other opportunities for a school community to provide that support to its students. WhilstI am very pleased to support the chaplains in my area and the work of the Scripture Union, particularly its CEO, Tim Mander, who is a great referee but primarily a person devoted to school chaplaincy-they have proved themselves to be very successful in the bayside-I acknowledge there are many other schools in Bonner and across the country. I look forward to the government reviewing this program that provides a very important support service to students and seeing a way in which funding can be flexible and address the needs of individual schools. pired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Rail Infrastructure Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Ripoll: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) a comprehensive and accessible rail transport system is an important link in the Australian transport chain that joins communities and strengthens industry; and (b) the Australian Government has invested an unprecedented $26.4 billion investment in road and rail infrastructure through the Nation Building Program over the six year period from 2008 09 to 2013 14; and (2) supports: (a) the Australian Government’s budget announcement of more than $25 billion for key road, rail and port projects; (b) fiscal strategies and major infrastructure projects that aim to create jobs and boost long term productivity; and (c) the continued encouragement of private involvement in delivering new infrastructure. MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Private Members Business
199,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),"The time allotted for this debate has exa critical and essential link in the Australian transport chain that joins communities and strengthens industry. The Rudd government in its last budget continued its commitment to rail infrastructure by delivering important priority rail projects and spending to support job creation in the short term, and economic growth and productivity in the longer term. As we will see a number of local rail projects from around the country, it is pleasing to see a broad range of members representing different states and, with them, different priorities and needs. TonightI want to focus on my home state of Queensland and the funding that was set aside for nation building from the Building Australia Fund. Firstly, it is important to note that the $668 million in this year’s budget for Queensland road and rail projects is 80 per cent higher than the 2008-09 funding, with $318 million provided immediately to keep key projects moving forward. Locally in South-East Queensland we saw initiatives such as $20 million for a Brisbane inner-city rail feasibility study and $365 million in equity investment in the Gold Coast light rail project. Work on the Brisbane innercity rail feasibility study continues, and will see two new rail tunnel corridors being identified to meet growing demand for rail services in Brisbane. As I said, the Rudd government has committed $20 million to make sure that that does take place, with the project due to begin in 2010. Work on the $850 million Gold Coast light rail project is expected to begin in 2011 and be completed by 2013. The planning and construction of the project is expected to support 2½ thousand jobs. The project will provide public transport to 20 per cent of the Gold Coast population, removing 40,000 cars from the road network and foster urban renewal and boost the local tourism industry. It is projected the Gold Coast light rail will cater for 80,000 trips a year, increasing public transport from four per cent of journeys to 10 per cent by 2026. Both of these are important nation-building projects and feature cooperation between all levels of government and the private sector for the good of South-East Queensland, one of the nation’s fastest growing regions. This leads me to a great example of where these partnerships truly do work in concert, and that is in the western corridor of South-East Queensland-particularly in my electorate of Oxley. We had the member for Blair here, who also mentioned that it particularly works well in the electorate of Blair. The Queensland government has been planning for the duplication of the Centenary Highway between the Ipswich motorway and Springfield, together with the extension of the passenger rail branching from the Ipswich line at Darra and then running along the Centenary Highway through to greater Springfield. The rail project is one of the priority projects in the Queensland government’s infrastructure plant, which supports the South-East Queensland regional plan and is designated as a vital piece of infrastructure for the western corridor. The project has now been broken up into stages, with stage 1 now progressing to completion. It will be part of the duplication of the Centenary Highway from the Ipswich motorway to the Logan motorway. As a result, we will see a new passenger rail line being built with 650-space commuter car parks. Stage1 is due for completion in 2012. Stage2 will also be part of the Queensland state government’s and the federal government’s commitment to the corridor. Further to that, the cost of a rail component as part of the project to Springfield in the South-East Queensland regional plan is projected at $872 million. If funding can be brought MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Private Members Business
200,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.35 Pm),"A comprehensive and accessible rail transport system isforward, then we will see the great possibilities of what rail transport can bring to that corridor. This will then allow both the road and rail projects to be delivered together, and of course that would mean greater efficiency and a greater effective corridor for the area. The original delivery was for 2012, but it has now been pushed out to 2015. But many thousands of jobs can be expected to be created and millions of people moved along the corridor. I believe that the western corridor will continue to drive strong residential growth for the next decade, with significant investment accompanying infrastructure needed to be delivered both in a public and a private manner. For South-East Queensland, we need environmentally sustainable transport environments of the future. In this place we often speak of better ways to find these sorts of projects; in the western corridor we are ready to deliver both through public funding and through private funding. What we need now is to bring forward these projects. All members of parliament support more effective transport systems that provide growth in a sustainable manner. Often the critical missing components that are the hold-up are the political will to achieve the desired outcomes and political cooperation. That is not the case in the western corridor. The three levels of government work together in a most constructive manner, as does the private sector, including developers in the corridor. They are all prepared to make these projects technically feasible, and I know they can work in a great partnership together. I commend the motion to the House and I encourage government at all levels to get more involved and provide the essential, critical environmentally sustainable transport systems for the future-and there is no better place to begin than in the western corridor of Queensland. (Time expired) take this opportunity to speak of the value that railways have added in Western Australia and the fact that our future economic development will continue to depend on railway infrastructure serving the commodity sector. As I will outline, the great Western Australian success story, the way in which the hard work and commitment of the private sector has paved the way for Australia, is very much a story that could not have been written without railways. Two of the major users of railways for the transport of iron ore are BHP Billiton and the Fortescue Metals Group, or FMG. They demonstrate the importance of private investment and of governments allowing these developments to take place. BHP Billiton’s iron ore has two railway lines and more than 120 locomotives. The Port Hedland to Newman line is 426 kilometres long, running out to the Mount Whaleback Mine but also with spurs to Mining Area C, known as the MAC iron ore mine; to Yandi1 and 2; and to the Jimblebar Mine. Twelve trains a day operate on that line, normally with 208 wagons per train. Each wagon can carry 125 tonnes of ore, or 26,000 tonnes per train. Duplication of the line to Newman is well advanced. The smaller line is just 208 kilometres long and runs from Finucane Island near Port Hedland to the Yarrie and Nimingarra mines. It has one train a day, with a mere 90 wagons attached. FMG is another example of private sector investment that has worked out very well. FMG operate a heavy-haul rail network between Anderson Point at Port Hedland and Cloud Break Mine. That is more than 250 kilometres of single standard-gauge railway line upon which MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Private Members Business
201,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.40 Pm),"Given that this motion is about rail infrastructure, Ithey operate as many as five trains a day, with up to 240 carriages per train. Each wagon can take around 40 tonnes of iron ore. AlthoughI have spoken about the successes and the future of private rail in support of commodities in Western Australia, this motion also made mention of the assistance provided by the Australian government toward rail. In 1997 the federal and state governments agreed to centralise control of the national interstate rail network. In 1998 the Australian government established the Australian Rail Track Corporation Ltd to manage and develop Australia’s interstate track infrastructure. The ARTC owners have long-term leases of the interstate track. The ARTC currently controls interstate track from Kalgoorlie to the New South WalesQueensland border, although its main focus is on the Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane rail corridor. The ARTC is a public company which is wholly owned by the Australian government. It is required under its charter to operate the interstate rail network on a commercial and sustainable basis. It does so through access fees to the track from commercial operators, proceeds from maintenance contracts, Australian government equity, commercial borrowings and direct funding from the federal government. It was through the ARTC and AusLink that the previous government provided $2.4 billion in rail infrastructure; $820 million was also provided to ARTC for the Melbourne-SydneyBrisbane rail corridor through untied grants. It should also be noted that the previous federal government helped with the second transnational railway line completed in 2004, with $191.4 billion contributed by the Howard government. That being said, the vast majority of the funding for the project was actually provided by private enterprise. Between 2004-05 and 200809, over $2 billion was allocated by the Howard government under AusLink. Between 1996 and 2007 an additional $1.3 billion was invested in rail from outside AusLink, which included the Commonwealth part of the funding for the Adelaide to Darwin railway. Infrastructure investment in 2007 amounted to $56 billion for rail, which is more than 2½ times what it was in 1996 when it was $15 billion. Against a backdrop of paying off $96 billion of debt, these figures suggest responsible and effective investment. The reality in rail investment is that it is important for government to be involved, but it is vital for governments to facilitate private investment to meet the needs of industry. Rail is part of the great success story of Western Australia, and that will continue to be the case, but a measure of a government is how well it can successfully leverage private sector investment whilst also not running up huge debt. The coalition under John Howard succeeded. Peter Costello was able to do this very successfully. by the member for Oxley, Mr Ripoll. I note that the member for Oxley has referred to both rail and road in his motion. The commitment of the Rudd Labor government to South-East Queensland in relation to the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and to the Gold Coast Rapid Transit rail is very welcome. The Brisbane future public transport network and the $20 million in funding that the federal government will commit for a feasibility planning study of the Brisbane inner city rail capacity upgrade-to be completed, it is estimated, in 2012-will make a big difference. If the federal government chooses to actually fund that inner city translink, that will be of great help not only to the people of Brisbane but also to people on the Gold Coast and in Ipswich. Like any city, Brisbane is a place where people come to work, for recreation, MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Private Members Business
202,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.45 Pm),"I am happy to speak in support of the motion movedto get together to see a film, to have friendship and fellowship and just to shop. So that feasibility study will be most welcome and I urge the government to look seriously at funding it. The Gold Coast Rapid Transit funding is particularly welcome not only for those people on the Gold Coast but also for other people in my area of Blair, in Ipswich and in the rural areas outside who use the Gold Coast regularly for recreation and holidays. Over the next four years, the federal government will invest $365 million on 13 kilometres of light rail and transit infrastructure from Griffith University to Broadbeach. That is very important not just for linkages for students but also for access to Broadbeach for recreation, shopping and the beach. The Ipswich Motorway upgrade is also critical and the federal government has put forward $1.95 million in funding for it over the next four years. It will spend $884 million in additional works between Dinmore and Goodna and you can see that happening right now. There is also a rail corridor, secured by the state government, which goes up from Springfield through to Ipswich, linking the University of Southern Queensland at Springfield to the Ipswich campus of the University of Queensland. That is an important infrastructure corridor and I would urge the federal government to look at that in the future. This government has put an enormous amount of money into South-East Queensland for rail and road, but these things are particularly important. The member for Oxley mentioned the western corridor, the area between Ipswich and the south-west suburbs of Brisbane through to Forest Lake and Springfield. In 20 years, about 85,000 people will live in Springfield and it is estimated that Ipswich will have a population of about 434,000. This is all part of the South-East Queensland regional development plan, so road and rail infrastructure is particularly vital. One in seven people in Australia lives in South-East Queensland. It is the area where the biggest regional councils are-big regional councils created through council amalgamations. Councils like Lockyer Valley, the Somerset Regional Council, the Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Ipswich City Council are large councils not only in the area they cover but also in population compared with some of the more rural and regional areas of our country. Local government plays an enormous role in this and the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors has played a strong advocacy role in getting South-East Queensland moving, but the federal government is strongly committed to road and rail infrastructure and the runs are on the board. The Ipswich Motorway should have been funded many years ago by the previous, Howard government. There were 11½ years of inertia, idleness and ignorance on the issue. The people of the western corridor, from south-west Brisbane through to Ipswich and the rural areas outside it, were frustrated all through that time. It is the Rudd government that has put the money into South-East Queensland in terms of Gold Coast rail, the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and so many other roads, whether they be the Cunningham Highway south of Ipswich or the Warrego Highway west of Ipswich. We are seeing resurfacing everywhere. It is all part of the Rudd government’s nation-building and stimulus strategy, sadly and regrettably opposed tooth and nail by those opposite, to their shame and discredit. I commend the member for Oxley for his motion. It is apt and appropriate. statements about infrastructure in Sydney. Coming from an electorate which has the highest rate of car ownership in the country-that is, the highest number of cars per household of any MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Private Members Business
203,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (7.50 Pm),"I welcome this opportunity to reject the brash Laborelectorate in Australia. I can attest to the fact that rail is a very important link with communities as a transport option. I can also attest that the New South Wales state Labor government has failed to deliver a rail line for the north-west of Sydney for 16 years. That is 16 years of failure in an area that has the highest car ownership rate in the entire country. My area, one of the fastest growing communities in Sydney, has been left behind by governments which refuse to allow either a government option or a private sector option in the delivery of rail. When you take into account the rhetoric that we hear from Labor members opposite about climate change and emissions and saving the planet, you would think that a rail line in north-west Sydney was one of the top priorities for a Labor government or indeed a Labor Party. In Sydney, the biggest city in Australia, with the highest rate of car ownership in the country, what did we get from the Rudd government? On7 October 2008 last year, a date that will live in infamy, that belies this motion, we heard, ‘No votes in north-west metro, Rudd tells Rees’. That is what the Prime Minister said to the Premier. There are no votes in delivering rail to the north-west of Sydney-that is what we are to believe from a cabinet meeting leak last year that was revealed to the public. The New South Wales state government was rejected for federal funding for infrastructure for the north-west of Sydney because there were no votes in it. When you look at the record of the state Labor government in New South Wales on infrastructure delivery to the outer suburbs of our major cities, you see that they have clearly failed them. They not only cancelled the north-west rail line; they cancelled the south-west rail line. In 2008, what we did not know when this story broke about the federal government’s refusal to build a much needed rail line in the biggest city in our country-because there were no votes in it-and what we do know now is that the federal government was planning to cut off Sydney completely from the infrastructure funding teat. There is plenty of money being spent on infrastructure in this country. That is absolutely right. I will be interested to hear what the member for Lowe has to say about this. But Sydney received virtually nothing in the infrastructure spend from the Rudd government. There are a number of possible reasons for this. Of course, we know that the incompetence of the New South Wales Labor government is absolutely breathtaking and that you would not give them a dollar to save themselves. That is an acceptable argument, something that we on this side are prepared to entertain. However, if you consider the vast need of the people of Sydney-it is our biggest city, it is one of our most poorly planned cities, it has a desperate need for better public transport infrastructurethe Rudd government failed to deliver anything but the smallest amount of money for a study for a metro line. I am sure the member for Lowe will endorse that, because the inner city metro line is proposed to run from the city to his electorate. There is already an existing heavy rail line that runs from his electorate to the city. There are bus transport alternatives, there are light rail alternatives and it is only a short transport time. But all those who live in the outer suburbs of our major cities, such as in my community in the south-west of Sydney, in Lindsay, Macarthur and Macquarie, have been left in the lurch by successive state and federal governments. They have been given grants of land, they have been allowed huge corridors of development, but public transport infrastructure has been completely and utterly unplanned. Before anybody on that side gets up here and tries to tell us that this was part of the Howard government’s failure, this was promised continually in the last 15 years by a New South Wales state Labor government-promised, promised, promised, promised. The people of New South Wales voted for it several times and it has not been delivered. Now it has been shelved. MAIN COMMITTEE Both the north-west and the south-west rail corridors in the biggest city of our country have been permanently shelved. It is to the shame of this Labor government that that has happened. It is a shame that it has spent no money on infrastructure in Sydney, and the voters of Sydney, the people of Sydney, the communities of Sydney, which are suffering from a lack of rail and transport options, should punish this Labor government for its absolute and utter mismanagement of rail infrastructure. (Time expired) colleague the member for Oxley and thoroughly reject the assertions and scurrilous claims made by the member for Mitchell. I ask the member for Mitchell to put a search engine through his conscience and have a look at what Premier Fahey or Premier Greiner did on the very issues he has raised here tonight. It is often said that the productivity of today is the prosperity of tomorrow. The Rudd government understand this, and that is why we are investing an unprecedented $26.4 billion over six years to ease the infrastructure capacity constraints by building road, rail and port projects as part of our national building program. This investment will drive our productivity by promoting the efficient movement of goods within and between our cities. The Rudd government also acknowledges that supporting our economy and tackling climate change are not conflicting policy objectives. For this reason, the 2009-10 Commonwealth budget includes $4.5 billion investment in the Clean Energy Initiative to assist Australia’s transition to a low-pollution economy and help us create green jobs. This includes $2 billion over nine years for carbon capture and storage, demonstration projects, $1.5 billion over six years for solar electricity generation projects and $465 million to establish Renewables Australia, an independent body set up to support leading-edge renewable energy technology research and development. My electorate of Lowe has been affected immensely by the government’s investment in infrastructure. Perhaps the member for Mitchell is listening to this. As part of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, the largest ever one-off federal investment in local infrastructure across Australia, local councils have received grants designed to improve social capital and support jobs by improving local infrastructure. For example, Canada Bay Council has received $5.3 million for the upgrade of the Drumoyne oval, and that was very warmly received. In addition, some of Sydney’s busiest roads are located in my electorate. The Rudd government’s infrastructure investments are targeting dangerous black spots on these roads to improve the passage of vehicles, which in turn enhances our local productivity. As a result, the government is spending $180,000 to upgrade Centenary Drive in Strathfield, Concord Road in Rhodes and Punchbowl Road in Belfield. It is not only my electorate that is benefiting. I know that in suburbs throughout Australia local infrastructure projects are being carried out that will drive up productivity and boost our future living standards. One very exciting project which I wish to draw to the attention of the House, particularly the member for Mitchell, is the $3.5 million investment for the University of Sydney’s Clinical Education Centre at Concord Hospital’s Clinical School, which was announced last week. Perhaps the member for Mitchell has not caught up with that. The funding is part of the Australian government’s $71.5 million Capital Development Pool Program. The Capital Development Pool Program provides funding for higher education institutions to build capital infrastructure. Concord Hospital’s Clinical Education Centre will provide clinical teaching for undergraduate and postgraduate specialist medical, nursing, allied services, MAIN COMMITTEE",226,Private Members Business
204,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (7.55 Pm),"I rise to support the motion moved by my friend andpharmacy and dentistry students. The $3.15 million in federal funding will assist the centre to develop world-class educational facilities in the field of medical science. I spoke on Friday to Professor Robert Lusby, Associate Dean of the University of Sydney’s medical school and Professor of Surgery at Concord Clinical School. I can assure the House that Professor Lusby and his colleagues at Concord Hospital and the University of Sydney are extremely excited about this infrastructure project which will improve the education experience provided to Australia’s future doctors and medical specialists. The $3.5 million is an excellent investment in our nation’s health infrastructure. A healthier nation boosts our productivity and prosperity, and that is what nation building is all about. The unprecedented level of infrastructure investment by the Rudd government stands in stark contrast to the indolence of the Howard government. The Howard government was idle when it came to our nation’s infrastructure. Rather than investing in our roads, ports, railroads, schools, universities and hospitals, the Howard government’s infrastructure policies constituted nothing other than bribery, as they spent millions of dollars on buying votes in marginal coalition seats whilst starving Labor seats of funds. The contrast between the policies of the Labor and Liberal parties could not be clearer, and I hope the member for Mitchell is listening. Labor is a party of nation building(Time expired) used to receiving from this government. I am surprised that the member for Oxley has decided not to hang around for the accolades that he suspected would come but he probably just presumed they would come-as is so much the case with this government with motions of selfcongratulation. But the truth about this matter, despite the arguments put forward by the government, is that Australia’s infrastructure challenge is massive: it is estimated at somewhere between $455 billion and $700 billion. This government seems to pretend to the Australian people that they can meet that all on their own. It is absolute arrant nonsense. They also claim to pretend that they invented the notion of infrastructure, that they invented the notion of bricks and mortar and that they invented the notion of engineering construction on 23 November 2007, which is also untrue. Prior to the last election the coalition pledged $31 billion on land transport infrastructure initiatives between 2007-08 and 2013-14. Labor is spending in response to that $26 billion. So they are still $5 billion short on what the Australian people would have got from the coalition government had they been re-elected. If we go and look at AusLink back to 2004, the coalition government would have spent $45 billion to improve our land transport infrastructure. In 1996 infrastructure investment in Australia accounted for only three per cent of GDP. That is what we inherited as a government and we left it at 5.6 per cent of GDP. That is from $15 billion to over $56 billion-so much for Labor’s rewriting of history in relation to infrastructure investment in this country. A considerable component of achieving this objective, and I think this is why Labor fail to acknowledge it, was through harnessing private sector investment both in capital and in delivery of projects. Private sector investment in infrastructure increased under the term of the coalition government from 36 per cent of the total to over two-thirds. There is a good reason why encouraging private investment in infrastructure is a good idea, and that is because the surveys show time and time again that private sector delivered projects deliver on time and on budget more frequently. In fact, a survey by Allen Consulting concluded that under the model of traditionally procured projects through the government sector-and remember this is the MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Private Members Business
205,Mr Morrison (Cook) (8.00 Pm),"This is a motion of self-congratulation that we aregovernment that says the government should be at the centre of the economy, not the private sector-23.5 per cent of the time they were behind time on delivery of their projects compared with privately procured and developed projects on average being 3.5 per cent ahead of time. So the idea of encouraging the private sector to invest in infrastructure under the coalition government proved to be a success. It harnessed massive investment of capital in Australia’s infrastructure task, which still remains great. The coalition does not pretend it is somehow solved as the government pretends it is solved. There is a massive task that is still to be completed at the hands of governments of all persuasions in the future. The other point I would make is that, to achieve this, we not only harnessed private sector investment in this massive task but we also managed to pay off $96 billion of Labor debt in the process-an extraordinary achievement. On the day that the former member for Higgins has departed this place, it is important to acknowledge his achievement in delivering this outcome. Of the $22 billion in infrastructure that is boasted about in this budget, only $1.7 billion is to be spent this year and only $8.5 billion of this $22 billion total is actually going to be on roads, rail and ports. The government are leading people to believe that they are out there building roads, rail and ports-well, they are not. They are building many other things but not too much of roads, rail and ports. The infrastructure challenge remains significant. TonightI want to draw quickly on one part of that challenge, and that is the freight challenge that we face as a nation. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia has produced an outstanding report called Meeting the 2050 freight challenge. I table the report. The report shows that the freight task, from current levels, will double by 2020 and triple by 2050. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics estimates a cost of $20 billion a year to our economy by 2020 if we do nothing, which is what this government is doing. Every one per cent increase in efficiency in this area will save $1.5 billion. The solutions to this are not just about bricks and mortar. The government likes to think only about bricks and mortar when it comes to these matters, but it is about planning, approvals, regulatory reform, partnering, pricing and competitive neutrality between modes. These are the reforms that would be part of a real infrastructure reform agenda-not parading around the country in hard hats and luminous vests pretending to solve a problem which will take many years to solve.

Constituents in the electorate of Pearce and in the wider Perth metropolitan area could be forgiven for thinking that they live in some autocratic polity devoid of representative democracy that upholds the right of the individual. In essence, this motion highlights a lack of process, which denies fundamental democratic rights to a fair and consultative approach by government via a Commonwealth agency. Airservices Australia holds within its power the ability to determine and change air-traffic routes without open and accountable public consultation, thus affecting the lives of people. Quality of life, health and well-being and property values are all denied consideration by an organisation that now has, it seems, unfettered power to make decisions to change air-traffic routes without considering the fundamental rights of citizens. As it stands, there is no remedy available to an aggrieved member of the public about decision-making processes. As Airservices Australia is a corporate entity, gaining its operating funds from industry, it seems that there is no separation of power. The public is left without recourse to a just hearing and without remedy. MAIN COMMITTEE",230,Private Members Business
207,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (8.06 Pm),"It is with great frustration and disappointment that IThis is why, along with the member for Canning and the member for Swan-whom I thank for participating in this debate-I am calling on the government to establish an inquiry into the current legislation and to establish an open and accountable public process that is nationally consistent. There must be some separation between a government agency with the power to make changes that so drastically affect people’s lives and the airline industry from which it derives its considerable financial benefit. Airservices Australia have made significant changes to the flight paths in Western Australia without providing adequate information, even to the Perth Airport Noise Management Consultative Committee-and I spoke on that in this place at another time. They have not extensively consulted the public either, but they have extensively consulted the airline industry, on their own admission. All efforts to obtain information to support the need for change, which we were told was based on safety, have been unsuccessful. It reminds me of the American linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky’s comment: The most effective way to restrict democracy is to transfer decision-making from the public arena to unaccountable institutions: kings and princes, priestly castes, military juntas, party dictatorships, or modern corporations. This certainly should not be the case in an Australian democracy, but it would seem that this statement fits perfectly this situation. It is incumbent on the government to re-examine the act governing Airservices Australia to ensure rigorous public accountability and to make provision for a more consistent approach to changes to air routes. It is a pity that time is so restricted for this debate, because I have had a huge amount of correspondence and phone calls coming from the electorate of Pearce. People’s lives have been dramatically impacted. There are people who have bought houses who checked to see where those air routes were and thought that they were buying free of aircraft noise up in the peaceful areas of Perth Hills. This is about people not being able to sleep. This is about people having to take time off work because they are sick because they have not slept. This is about people who bought five-star retreats in the hills area to find that they are faced with the prospect of having to sell. None of the public comments I have heard speak louder than those of one of my constituents who recorded 18 flights between 6.10 am and 7.10 am. She feels selling her house is the only option available to her. This is a very unsatisfactory situation. I think the public has a right to expect an open and accountable process. I call on the government to give serious consideration to the items incorporated in this motion before this House today. I would like to thank my colleague the member for Canning for seconding this motion and my colleagues for participating in this very important debate. (Time expired) motion, as I represent a seat that has the entire airport smack bang in the middle of a built-up residential area. Airport and aircraft noise and pollution and airport developments that are taking place all around Australia in major cities are affecting people’s lives on a constant basis. The whole idea is to come up with a good balance that protects people’s well-being and allows them to get a decent night’s sleep whilst ensuring the management of viable airports in Australia’s major cities. The seat of Hindmarsh has an airport right in the middle of the electorate that is surrounded by thousands of residential homes. We have estimated approximately 20,000 homes are affected by aircraft noise or aircraft landing and taking off. There is also the added burden of MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Private Members Business
208,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (8.11 Pm),"I am very pleased that I can speak on thisdevelopment that has sprung up all over the airport. Suburbs in my electorate, such as Brooklyn Park, Mile End, Richmond, Cowandilla, Lockleys and Glenelg North, constantly hear the movement of aircraft. Every plane that lands at Adelaide Airport takes off and lands in my electorate. I have lived under the flight path my entire life. In fact, you get quite used to it after a few years. I suppose when you grow up in that environment, you do not take too much notice of it. As years go by, more and more traffic movements are taking place. I recall that once upon a time many years ago we would get a couple of flights a day and we would all run out to the front yard at four o’clock to have a look at the flight that was coming over. This is now constant: every two minutes. I do understand what it is like and certainly feel for people who live around airports. In Adelaide we had some very active community groups and residential groups. We had the Adelaide Airport Action Group, which I was very pleased to chair many years ago before I was actively involved in politics. This was a group that campaigned and lobbied governments-in fact, it was a Labor government at the time-and continued to lobby into the Howard years for insulation, noise abatement and a curfew. At first the Howard government was not interested at all. We were told to go away and not worry about it. Through the strong actions of those residents, through their persistence and through their many protests and letters to the many transport ministers, they achieved both a curfew and insulation for houses that were affected by the noise. I am pleased with the government’s response at the moment. There are some good things happening. I am pleased to see the aviation white paper that has come out. It has many good things in it, particularly the proposed committee to deal with complaints and issues. The government is promoting and encouraging consultation between airports and local residents. I am very pleased that this consultation has been having good results in Adelaide, at least as far as I am aware. We have the Adelaide Airport consultative group which meets on a regular basis which includes all the players-airlines, residents groups and councils. We get together every couple of months to discuss the issues that are affecting residents. I regularly take issues up with the consultation committee on behalf of my residents. I must say that Phil Baker, the CEO, and his staff at Adelaide Airport do undertake and try to solve every issue that I raise. The way to go is through consultation ensuring that people’s voices are heard, because people do suffer under flight paths. As long as there is consultation where people’s voices are heard and there is an avenue to resolve those complaints, then I think we are on the right track. There is also the added burden of development occurring on airports, and another type of noise that is coming about.

209,Mr Randall (Canning) (8.16 Pm),"The changes to flight paths to and from the Perthinvolved went about these changes by stealth. It is the largest restructure of air traffic in Perth for 30 years, and no-one got to know about it. Airservices Australia cannot seem to make up its mind about the consultation process involved in implementing the changes. In a farcical July meeting with ASA government relations manager David Moore, Perth Airport executives and my colleagues Steve Irons and Judi Moylan, we were assured there was consultation. But unsurprisingly ASA failed to verify dates and attendees. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the consultation was a figment of Airservices’ imagination. In fact, it is a law unto itself. Airservices’ own website claims it consulted the Perth Airport Noise Management Committee about the changes. It is true that committee members knew the review had commenced but they were taken aback when the route changes were made unbeknown to them. Equally surprised were Canning residents in Roleystone, Bedfordale, Mt Nasura and Mt Richon and suburbs along the Darling Range when planes started bearing down on them. What were relatively peaceful neighbourhoods are now drowned out by northern arrival aircraft and runways 03 and 06 departures as planes fly so low my constituents tell me they can see people sitting in their seats through their kitchen windows. ‘Residents of the Hills areas paid premium prices for peace and tranquillity which it appears is about to be taken away without any discussion with the local community,’ one Roleystone resident emailed me recently. Almost certainly, a one-page press release in November 2008 boldly announcing the changes did not make it into the local Canning newspapers that affected constituents read. In another sidestep, a letter to the member for Pearce on 4 August said details of consultation could not be released without the minister’s approval and such information was so ‘highly technical in nature and not readily understood by non-aviation personnel’. These games are patronising and absurd. We are not looking for the launch codes; we just want a simple list of dates, times and attendees. It is perfectly clear that Airservices are trying to play affected residents and those representing them for fools. If these changes genuinely are for air safety purposes as recommended by ASA, people would have likely understood when a proper and detailed case was presented to them. Perth air traffic has increased by 60 per cent in the last five years and has already exceeded 2015 projections, so some re-routing could have been expected. But rightly what has people hot under the collar is that they were not given an opportunity to be heard, and now it seems those decision makers have washed their hands of the issue essentially telling the affected residents to like it or lump it. Perhaps unaware of Airservices’ line, I noted with interest the local newspaper The Armadale Examiner reported on 8 October that a spokesman for the transport minister, Mr Albanese, said consultation had been undertaken. I am still waiting for answers to questions on notice from the minister about this mysterious consultation process. My constituents want answers. They want the minister to show them the same respect and consideration he showed his constituents in Grayndler when they were not notified about runway changes in 2007. My colleague the member for Swan has called for a noise insulation program for Perth, similar to the one operated in Sydney and Adelaide. Minister Albanese led the charge on this scheme around Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and it is only fair that Perth residents get the same treatment. ASA maintains that there has been a marginal increase in flights over the local Canning area and, believe it or not, the member for Armadale, in a bizarre comment, labelled the deMAIN COMMITTEE gree of the problem only ‘small’ and that there were ‘limited alternatives’. Perhaps they need from Bedfordale who has constant interruption from low-flying aircraft. He says: They have done this without consulting anybody at all. This is simply outrageous. Our Commonwealth aviation regulations should not permit an airport operator to behave in such an arrogant and high handed manner. Or listen to a Roleystone resident who said: No consultation, no advertisement-apparently there was something in the paper but I wouldn’t have thought to going hunting for that type of information. To hear that we were consulted is appalling-it did not happen! People near the Perth Airport buy their homes in good faith. As the Roleystone constituents were not consulted, in my limited time. I would just like to say that the people of Perth deserved better. They deserved a better consultation process and Airservices Australia needs to come clean and tell the truth about their consultation process. (Time expired) Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (8.21 pm)-I can agree in some large part with the sentiments expressed in the resolution that has been put forward by the member for Pearce. I understand that the changes to aircraft routes are having an impact on some Hills residents due to an increase in traffic along those routes during the past few months. For many, particularly those who had experienced no aircraft noise, this is having a significant and deleterious impact on them and on their lifestyles. I also agree with some of the concerns that have been raised about the consultation process with residents prior to the implementation of the route review. I believe it was inadequate-a matter that I have raised with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government asking for improved consultation processes in the future. I have also written to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority concerning the details of how consultation should occur when there is any review of aircraft routes. In addition to that, a number of steps are being taken by the local Perth Airport Aircraft Noise Management Consultative Committee to address these concerns. It is clear that the consultation process was lacking, however unlike perhaps the member for Canning, I do accept that route amendments were required to deal with both congestion and with air safety concerns at Perth Airport. In the past five years there has been a 60 per cent increase in air traffic at Perth Airport. I was also informed, as a member of the Perth Airport Aircraft Noise Management Consultative Committee, that a situation had developed whereby aircraft were sharing two-way approach and departure routes, at times heading towards each other but at different heights. These conditions were clearly unsustainable and were a safety threat. It was to address these concerns that Airservices Australia was required to conduct a Western Australia Route Review Project, WARRP, which took place between 2006 and 2008. This resulted in the implementation of the route changes in November 2008. As a member of parliament elected in November 2007, I was invited to join the Perth Airport Aircraft Noise Management Consultative Committee early in 2008-a situation I suspect is similar to that of the member for Swan. This committee is made up of representatives from local, state and federal governments, along with representatives of Perth Airport, Airservices Australia and local community groups. This committee meets three to four times a year and it is the role of elected officials to represent the views of their constituents regarding aircraft MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Private Members Business

I have raised concerns similar to those that have been aired tonight in previous meetings and I will continue to do so. By the time. I joined the committee in 2008 the WARRP project was well under way. Unfortunately, the committee, in my opinion, had not been fully briefed about the impact of the review and certainly not in the three meetings that I attended. For example, we were given maps of where the new aircraft routes were likely to be but they did not include information regarding suburbs or the likely impact on noise levels. This is clearly unsatisfactory. I do want to point out, though, that the consultation process was established by the previous government. So it is a bit rich for members of the opposition to be so critical of both the current government and the bureaucracy. Indeed, I wonder where the member for Pearce and the member for Canning were when the previous Liberal government decided to establish brickworks in the middle of a residential area, on airport land, which to this day continues to upset my constituents who have to live with the pollution. I wonder where the Liberal Party was when those decisions were being made. This motion also ignores the current steps that have been taken by the government-in particular, the issues paper that was published early in April 2008, the substantial consultation that has taken place since then, the publication in December 2008 of the green paper on the future of the aviation industry in Australia and even greater community engagement and greater transparency in decision-making. I would urge them to become involved in that process because I think they can add value to that. In the meantime, it is important for both them and me to work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that our constituents and their concerns are appropriately regarded by the relevant agencies and authorities. ning for the opportunity to speak on this motion, and I also acknowledge the contributions of the members for Hasluck and Hindmarsh. I acknowledge the nine points in the member’s motion and support the member’s call to implement an inquiry and also to establish a nationally consistent approach to air traffic and changes to air flight paths with reference to noise abatement issues. From the feedback I have received from local residents, it is quite clear that there have been substantial changes to aircraft traffic and noise in my electorate of Swan since November 2008. The changes were introduced by Airservices Australia, a department that reports directly to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. There was little consultation with the local community on these flight path changes. The changes were made and signed off by the minister without my local community being aware of the extent of the changes. Given this, the flight path changes should have been stopped by the minister when they were on his desk. Section 10 of the Air Services Act clearly states that there is a requirement to consult. The changes could also have been stopped by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, under section 160 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. That section states that, before a Commonwealth agency authorises ‘the adoption or implementation of a plan for aviation airspace management involving aircraft operations that have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on the environment’, the plan must generally be referred to the environment minister for advice. However, neither minister has intervened and the result has been more frequent noise above households in my electorate of Swan. Residents continue to docuMAIN COMMITTEE",235,Private Members Business
211,Mr Irons (Swan) (8.26 Pm),"I thank the member for Pearce and the member for Canment noise changes in my aircraft noise survey, and I have seen figures from Airservices Australia that show dramatic yearly changes for a one month sample. However, almost one year on, despite all of this evidence, the minister has not done anything. He continues to talk about a white paper. Given that the government is sticking by these changes by the ASA, I have suggested that the Commonwealth compensate affected residents. As members will know, I have been advocating an airport noise insulation scheme for Perth, similar to the ones that operate in Adelaide and Sydney. Insulating affected residents’ properties would be a good start and it will not cost this government a cent. The Sydney and Adelaide schemes were funded by a landing charge on aircraft tickets. Yet Minister Albanese has seemingly ruled this out too, effectively saying that Perth does not qualify for assistance because the ANF noise contours do not reach the required levels. He also stated that I was playing politics in a report by Lara Hyams in the Southern Gazette. This misses the point. The fact is that significant changes have been made to aircraft flight paths without any community consultation. People who bought houses in areas where the noise was tolerable or where there was no aircraft noise now suddenly have to cope with more aircraft noise. This was before my time, but the previous member for Swan made the comment: While noise still remains an issue, one of the reasons concerns about noise are not quite as acute as they were is that the Labor Party has made commitments that homes dramatically affected by noise, such as those in Queens Road, would be eligible for assistance under a noise amelioration program such as that which operates in Sydney. What were these commitments, Mr Deputy Speaker, and why isn’t the government honouring them? Is it because they were made in opposition? Let us not forget that Minister Albanese is the same member of parliament who, when in opposition, was a tireless advocate on airport noise in the Sydney area. The passion he showed for his electorate is just what I am doing for my electorate. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed from 14 September. That grievances be noted. Broadband ate. It is an issue that is of some contention in Swan. In almost every corner of my electorate there are telecommunications problems, ranging from excruciatingly slow broadband to periodic outages. The problem affects thousands of families in the local area as well as businesses that are trying to survive in the modern economy. At the last election the Labor Party told the people of Australia that it would fix their broadband problems. I can say today that this has not happened in my electorate of Swan. Perhaps one of the worse broadband black spots in the area is around Perth Airport in the City of Belmont. I know from my conversations with local residents and business owners that the MAIN COMMITTEE",236,Private Members Business

214,Mr Irons (Swan) (8.30 Pm),"I want to speak about access to broadband in my electorlack of broadband in the area is a daily frustration and has serious implication for lifestyle and commerce. The Eastern Metropolitan Regional Council has done an excellent job investigating and reporting on this issue through its 2008 broadband black spot survey. In July, I had the pleasure of meeting with Rhonda Hardy of the EMRC, who was involved in the survey and was frustrated at the slow pace of change in the City of Belmont. The EMRC commissioned the survey after identifying that difficulties accessing affordable high-speed broadband acts as a barrier to growth for existing businesses and to the attraction of new business to Perth’s eastern region. As a small business man myself, I know there is nothing more frustrating than when telecommunications slow down. Where my business was located, we had a terrible time getting broadband connected. Eventually, after Telstra had upgraded the exchange, we managed to get a very slow form of broadband which would always go out during heavy rain periods. I know the frustration that businesses have to deal with in not being able to access broadband. Some of these businesses can lose hundreds if not thousands of dollars a day because of this problem. In an electorate with over 20,000 small businesses, I certainly agree with the EMRC on this one. I was pleased that a number of people in my electorate of Swan managed to make comments on the survey, and I want to take a moment now to read some of them out to give members an idea of the extent of the problem and of how valuable a good solution would be. Anne Davies from Ascot tries to use Skype to contact her family in Slovakia using wireless broadband. Janelle Edwards, who also lives in Ascot, and Helen Ainsworth of Cloverdale are part of the local small business community and expressed their frustration. Ian and Sandra Wallace of Cloverdale are frustrated at the lack of availability of ADSL broadband. John Wheldon of Cloverdale said: I am 76 years old and recently decided to update to broadband. I tried numerous servers including Telstra and they all told me ADSL was unavailable. Only last week, at the seniors’ forum I held in Queens Park, local seniors were encouraged to take part in computer classes as a way to avoid isolation and connect in old age. The Mayor, Joe Delle Donne, told seniors that classes were available at the Harold Hawthorne Centre. Poor broadband is just another barrier to connecting people in old age. Other Cloverdale residents also complained of the slow nature of dial-up access. The suburb of Kewdale, a hub of small business in my electorate of Swan, also reported problems. Mr Simon Hole said: I tried to organize broadband when I first bought the property but was told it was not available. I am thinking of starting up a home-based small business and am extremely concerned that my lack of broadband will impact upon my success. A local teacher said: I am a primary school teacher and require a broadband connection to access the EDWA website and Edward Dique of Kewdale was told by a provider that he was too far away from the exchange which is in Ascot. Ascot residents may be surprised to know that they are at the centre of the local broadband network! Redcliffe resident Amanda Ridge said: MAIN COMMITTEE IfI could get broadband I would be able to work from home and not be forced to put my baby into care. It is unfair that some in the area have access; in some cases it’s your neighbour but you can’t get it next door. We are being severely disadvantaged! I hope the above gives the House and the government some idea of the extent of the problem and the benefits that would be reaped from improving broadband within the city of Belmont area. Yet Belmont is not the only area suffering from poor broadband and telecommunications in general. A recent survey by the Wilson Residents and Ratepayers Association found that most residents have broadband internet access and that about 50 per cent of them had a wireless connection and the other 50 per cent had a cable connection. Telstra is the main provider for the residents, but many residents use a variety of other providers, including Optus, Westnet, iinet, AAPT and Amcom. The overwhelming majority-about 85 per centresponded that their connections were very reliable. A number of issues were also raised in the survey. Many wireless users said that they would prefer the cheaper option of cable connections but cable connections were just not available in their suburb. Many non-Telstra users commented that Telstra either had refused or were not able to provide a connection for their household, which is why they had gone to an alternative provider. Similarly, many respondents, particularly those living in the Cannington area of my electorate, commented that there was no ADSL2+ available to their household. I could go on, but I have given you an idea of the problems in my electorate of Swan. I now want to turn to how the government is responding to the problem. A recent incident south of Canning River in the suburb of Langford shows how the federal government response has been disappointing. A lady from Langford contacted my office. She lives in a broadband black spot area. She had received a flyer from the federal government telling her that she lived in a broadband black spot area and offering financial assistance. After some investigation, my constituent found out that she could get a better service provided at cheaper rates by a local business. This example tells me that the Labor government has not got to grips with the broadband problem facing my electorate of Swan. The government does not have its finger on the pulse. We have seen two years of confusion on the broadband issue that have culminated in a $43 billion pledge for a NBN. As we speak, the Labor Party are busy working out how to split up Telstra to make the National Broadband Network proposal work. I have received calls in my office from confused Telstra shareholders, of which there are 1.4 million Australia wide, uncertain about what will happen and what they should do. The main point is that we are still waiting for action. The people of Belmont are still waiting. The people of Wilson are still waiting. The people of Langford are still waiting. The coalition is waiting to find out how the NBN will be rolled out. I want Australia to have a 21st century broadband network, just like this government does, and I want the government to be successful in improving broadband for the local residents in my electorate of Swan. Australian federal governments are elected for a maximum of three years, and the Australian people have a right to expect progress on issues in this time. As members opposite are aware, this was a big issue when the government of today went to the election. I think people in Australia are expecting action and want to see something rolled out. There has been no progress. The government should be condemned for this. I implore them to improve on their performance. Let us get broadband out on a national basis. Our local communities need results MAIN COMMITTEE now. The government needs to quickly invest in areas like Belmont, Wilson and Langford in my electorate to bring them up to speed. What better way is there to spur economic recovery than to enable businesses to grow with greater workplace flexibility? The opposition will continue to scrutinise the government’s proposals. Let us get some action now and roll out broadband for all of Australia. Forde Electorate: Awards grieves me, my electorate and many other members: the lack of opportunity for the community to be recognised for some of their contributions. Whether it is in the media or other forms, this recognition is very important. Many members take the opportunities in this House to formally recognise people who have contributed to their communities. TonightI want to do that. There were four significant events in my electorate during the week. I have already spoken about one today. There were 10 winners in the inaugural youth lecture series. The local community bank recognised the talent of some of our young people and gave them awards. There are three other events I would like to mention. It has become quite customary in the seat of Forde to hold a number of annual award ceremonies, and Queensland this year celebrated its 150th anniversary. On6 June 1869, Queen Victoria signed the letters patent that formed the colony of Queensland, and Queenslanders generally celebrate around that date. But this year was a whole year of celebration, including the 150th anniversary award ceremonies that were held. So this week, although it was a little bit later in the year than usual, I held my Forde Queensland Day Awards. I would like to recognise the recipients of those awards very briefly, under a number of categories. I will start with the final and major award, our Forde Queenslander of the Year, which was given to John Robinson, who this year took the award for being a significant contributor to the community-and I will talk about John a little bit more in the context of some work that he was doing in the electorate. Our Forde Young Queenslander of the Year award went to Katie Johnston, a high-school captain who is also heavily involved in a junior chamber of commerce, doing a lot of work with people in the community. There were four awards under the Queensland Community Group category: the Lamington Natural History Association, the Beenleigh CWA, Vitae Ltd and Quota International of Beenleigh. Our Indigenous and multicultural awards went to Isabel Tarrago and Lucretia Suciu respectively. There were three winners under our community spirit award: Stacey Ross, Denis Rowlands and Donna Merriman. Our Forde Greats awards went to Max Noble and Roger Bell, and our Forde Community Recognition Award went to Paul Cowan. So that was one event. Later in the week we celebrated a major event that has been driven by the community radio station in Beaudesert, Beau FM, who have over the years provided community radio services to the region. They set out to encourage young people into the music industry in terms of songwriting and production and all the other aspects of performing arts. This week they had their Scenic Music awards ceremony and a whole lot of public events. John Robinson, who I mentioned was our Forde Queenslander of the Year, was one of the key people in making the award ceremony happen. SoI would like to again recognise John Robinson, and Michael Bassett, who is part of that organisation, and also the Scenic Rim Regional Council, who supported those awards. I will very briefly mention those award winners: Bernie Carson from MAIN COMMITTEE",237,Grievance Debate
215,Mr Raguse (Forde) (8.38 Pm),"I would like to speak today on something that certainlyHarrisville, Left of Center from Beaudesert, Kirk Lorange from Mount Tamborine, Jade Mellor from Beaudesert, Jackie McDonald from Beechmont, Tracey Davis and the Bushfire Band from Canungra, and the Beaudesert Country and Horse Festival. So that was another significant event. The final event I would like to mention was on the Friday night before that. I have previously mentioned in this chamber an invitation I received some months ago, which I think started out as a bit of a joke but became quite serious: I was honoured to be asked to be a guest performer at the Voices from Heaven concert which was held at St John’s Cathedral last Friday night. About a year ago, the Cantabile Choir, a renowned choir from Canterbury College-in fact, they won the gold medal at the 2008 World Choir Games in Austria-asked if I would at some stage sing with them and as a bit of a joke I said yes. Very recently it appeared on a program that I was one of the guest performers at the Voices from Heaven concert, singing with two well-known opera divas. It was one of the most challenging events of my life. It was certainly very similar to the feeling when we make our first speech in this House. It was a great night, a great event, and everyone tells me I should ditch the karaoke and go operatic! But I think I am going to hang up the sheet music. It was wonderful singing with the girls, and I want to recognise those very, very well-known opera stars Mia Daoud and Katie Stenzel, and Ritornello, the string orchestra that performed that night, directed by Belinda Williams. Very quickly, in the time. I have left, I do want to mention the girls who are part of Cantabile Choir. They do community fundraising, and at every performance they are exceptional in what they do. I was very honoured that they actually wanted me to sing a song with them. The director was Susan Gouchee and the choreographer Andrea Cooke. The accompanists were Yvonne Teo, Susan Gouchee and Norma Marschke. I will very quickly run through the girls: Natalie Renouf, Kelsey Martin, Jessica Bell, Kelsey McAlpine, Stacey Anderson, Monique Bowdler, Breanna Gerritson, Shannon Saunders, Clare Fotinos, Marina York, Ronja Markham, Natasha Hendey, Melanie Shulze, Lauren Steiner, Georgia Bell, Georgia Richardson, Jessica Taylor, Samantha Joyce, Emily Jones, Corinne McCulloch, Emma Simpson, Nicola Tedman, Tryphena Hunter, Ebony Rose and Kristie Chadwick. On the evening of this event these girls, who started performing at seven o’clock at night and supported all of the guest artists through the night, probably sang for 2½ or three hours. The range of songs, their expertise and their professionalism-these are high school students who have now not only walked the world stage but become winners of the 2008 World Choir Games-were just sensational. I was very humbled by the experience. As I said earlier, for me to have the opportunity-as you know, I am a bit of a hack singer-to sing with these girls was quite an amazing event. To come back to the initial grievance about the way that we publicly recognise people, we as members all get around our electorates and see so many amazing people and the community events that they are involved in. I would like to encourage the media to, where possible, be more understanding of the level and depth of what some of our community members are involved in. I would like to give recognition to all of these people tonight. There were four major events in the electorate in the previous week. The wonderful thing of course is that, through the involvement of other community organisations and me as a federal member, recognition ultimately comes to people who do such a wonderful job. MAIN COMMITTEE While Queensland celebrated its 150 years, the organisations and the people who are a part of all of these events this year are certainly proud Queenslanders. Their work with the community is well known and getting better known. For me as the member, the opportunity to get up here and speak about their successes and the sort of work they are doing for the community is very important. In closing, the Canterbury College Cantabile Choir is an exceptional group, as is the Beau FM community radio station and their work towards community through music and performing arts. We know about the Gympie Muster and a whole range of other musical events. I think the Beaudesert Bash might become the location for a music event. The efforts of the young performers within our community are amazing to see. I recognise those other community organisations that I have mentioned tonight. It is important that we as members of parliament recognise them. Again, my concern is that our community groups do not get the sort of recognition that they deserve. It is important on every occasion, as I know members do, to come into this chamber and speak about and highlight the people who do so many wonderful things in our community. Flinders Electorate: Mornington Peninsula tecting and enhancing the Mornington Peninsula. The Mornington Peninsula is one of the most beautiful areas in the country. It is a UNESCO biosphere, which means that it represents the combination of human activity and an extraordinary environment being conducted in a sustainable way. Against that background, there are three immediate threats to the long-term environmental sustainability of and quality of life on the Mornington Peninsula and a fourth powerful opportunity for improving and enhancing the interrelationship between people, the environment and quality of life. The first of those issues is a direct, clear and absolute opposition to the proposal by the Victorian government for a Crib Point bitumen plant. This bitumen plant was expressly and clearly ruled out by the state Labor government immediately prior to the last election. This was expressly and clearly done in a letter to all Crib Point residents. What we now see is that the election promise has been broken. A decision was taken by the Minister for Planning, Justin Madden, to overturn an independent panel’s view that this plant would not be acceptable. It said that the plant was on the edge of a Ramsar wetland, that the plant would run 24 hours a day, that there would be trucks running in and out of Crib Point and that the plant would lead to the reindustrialisation of a town which has become a residential community. Against that background, the minister, Mr Justin Madden, in express defiance of an absolutely clear election promise, overturned the independent panel’s decision to uphold the promise of the state Labor government in Victoria to block a Crib Point bitumen plant. Instead, what we are seeing is the election promise broken and the independent panel’s recommendations overturned, ignored and debunked. We have seen the absolutely clear and strong will of the people of Crib Point defied-and this I believe is most important. They do not want their town reindustrialised. They do not want trucks-in many cases B-doublesrunning through their town on a 24-hour basis. They do not want to experience the effects of odours on a Ramsar wetland, let alone on their own personal quality of life and the health of their children. SoI say today that the first pillar of protection for the Mornington Peninsula is for the state to uphold its promise and to reject the proposal for a bitumen plant at Crib Point, particularly MAIN COMMITTEE",240,Integris Essential For Lesson Planning And Preparation
216,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (8.48 Pm),"This evening I want to address a four-point plan for proas there is an alternative: the northern port at Hastings. There is near-universal acceptance of that option, so it is not a ‘not in our backyard’ situation. There is another option, an industrial area which does not affect residents, which does not affect the Ramsar wetland and which could easily be done. It would be located between the Esso and BlueScope plants, on reclaimed land. That, however, is not being accepted. It must be accepted, and I put it very clearly to the state that they must accept such an option. If they will not then Minister Garrett should step in and enforce the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which guarantees the protection of Ramsar wetlands. The second element in the protection of the Mornington Peninsula is in relation to the town of Baxter. Baxter is a lovely town. There are people who live in Baxter because they love the aspect of being not only near to Melbourne but also on the Mornington Peninsula. But they are about to see a large overpass cut right through the heart of the town. That overpass will destroy the amenity of the town. It will destroy the environment and it will cut the town in two forever. There is a simple alternative which is achievable, and that is for the state to insist that the project involve an underpass or tunnel so as not to divide the town. Land has been set aside for the freeway for many decades. Use of that land would allow the underpass to proceed so as not to cut Baxter in half. It could be done in a way which is sensitive to the locals and which does not expose them to excessive noise and heavy traffic. It would not represent a visual blight and would not make an impact on their lives every moment of every day, as would otherwise be the case. So there is a clear, preferable alternative. My view is that the overpass should be rejected. The tunnel or underpass must be mandated. The entire Peninsula Link freeway should come into the Moorooduc Highway just south of Baxter, rather than cutting through the heart of the Mornington Peninsula’s best farmland. Again, there is a clear, preferable alternative. I would not put up such opposition unless there was a clear, preferable alternative. The third area of protection is in relation to the town of Dromana. Dromana is a seaside town. Its demographic is a mixture of permanent residential and holiday homes. Progressively, more and more people are living there permanently. A proposal for a high-rise has been put forward which is out of character with the sensible work that the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council has approved. The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council has, again, had its decision overturned by a state panel, so the position here is part of a continuing theme. Our job now is to ensure that this area, which is an environmental service area for Melbourne, is protected. I call upon the state in all three cases to look to the 100-year future, to look to the next generation, to look to the next century in the decisions that they make, because to make poorquality decisions will echo through the generations. On each of these three items-the Crib Point bitumen plant, the Baxter overpass and the Dromana high-rise development-there are sensible, lower impact alternatives, and they can all be done in an economically sensible way. Those are three points about protection. The exciting opportunity is in relation to the Southern Peninsula Aquatic Centre at Rosebud. We have seen at Hastings the Pelican Park Aquatic Centre. We have seen the way in which an aquatic centre has transformed a waterfront and has transformed the ability of a town not just to exercise but to have a place of which they are proud and which has lifted up the entire town. The same thing is proposed for Rosebud to assist the people of Dromana, MAIN COMMITTEE McCrae, Rosebud, Rosebud West, Tootgarook, Rye, Blairgowrie and Sorrento, not to mention Boneo. All those towns will benefit from having an aquatic centre. We would have funded this aquatic centre in part under the Regional Partnerships program, which was abolished subsequent to the last election by the incoming Labor government at the federal level. I hope that funds will be found for what is a project which we would have funded under the Regional Partnerships program. Most importantly, I lend my support to the idea of having an aquatic centre for Rosebud. My personal preference is that it be in some way linked to the area between the highway and the back of the dunes. What we see there is an area which has been largely closed off to the public but which has nevertheless been turned over and used for buildings or previously for an aquatic centre. So it is not pristine land; it is land which has been entirely and completely compromised and disturbed. It must and should be used, in my view, for the best possible community outcome. That community outcome-in one of the oldest demographics in Australia, in the oldest demographic in Victoria-is for an aquatic centre with hydrotherapy for our seniors, with the capacity for sports training for our juniors and with family facilities. This is a project which will transform Rosebud, Rye and Dromana, and it represents the fourth part of the plan to protect and enhance the Mornington Peninsula. There is much work to be done, but at the end of the day we have to ensure that the Crib Point bitumen plant does not proceed, as was promised by the state government; we have an underpass or tunnel, not an overpass, in Baxter; Dromana is protected from high-rises; and we have the vision of an aquatic centre for Rosebud and the people of the Mornington Peninsula. (Time expired) Kingston Electorate: McLaren Vale Region Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (8.58 pm)-I rise today in this grievance debate to talk firstly about some of the strengths of the McLaren Vale region in my electorate but also about some of the challenges that this region faces and some of the areas in which it could really be helped. The area of McLaren Vale and associated areas of Willunga and Blewitt Springs are going from strength to strength. McLaren Vale is the gateway to the Fleurieu Peninsula and is home to some fantastic wines and foods and a spectacular coastline. I am always happy to boast about the success of the wines produced in the McLaren Vale region and sold at 76 local cellar doors dotted throughout the region. In fact, McLaren Vale is home to 9.8 per cent of the nation’s grape and wine output. This is a significant contribution to both the nation and our local state of South Australia’s economy. The area does not just produce a quantity of wine, though; it produces wine of significant quality, with many small family owned vineyards making world-class, world-renowned wine that punches above its weight. In addition to this there are many boutique wines. I was very pleased to attend recently the Vale Cru Expo, which showcased a lot of small-batch, high-quality winemakers. A great day was had by all. A high quality of wine was on display here, but other wine in the region is also renowned. The region is not just thinking about what they do well in the present, they are also talking about what they can do in the future. I was very pleased a few weeks ago to represent the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, to launch the McLaren Vale generational farming sustainability project, which aims to build on the region’s reputation for sustainable environmental practice. The launch was held at Oliver’s Taranga Vineyard, which is an example of real generational farming having had five generations that have participated in the vineyard. MAIN COMMITTEE Already this region has been struck by drought. However, with the assistance of both state and federal governments but most importantly the industry-they are not just complaining about drought; they are not just saying, ‘What can we do?’-they have moved to use recycled water from the Christies Beach wastewater treatment plant to ensure that their crops grow. The generational farming project that I launched will further this by encouraging sustainable wine-growing practices in the McLaren Vale region by implementing an environmental benchmarking system for wine production. I have been informed this is the first attempt to do this anywhere in Australia. It will allow wine growers to self-record and assess their environmental performances according to their management of pest and disease, soil and weeds, water, biodiversity, waste and carbon pollution as well as continuing education for farmers on this issue. The objective of the project is to encourage sustainable wine-growing practice that will allow for farmers to pass their vineyards on to the next generation in better condition. The community backed project is a good example of an industry-led initiative from the wine industry to address issues of sustainability, and it should be commended. I certainly add my voice to commending this. Furthermore, the project is in line with the government’s policy of working with industry to build its capacity to respond to current environmental and economic challenges. Not only is this a forward-looking project for improving the environment but it is also critical to carving out a niche for McLaren Vale in the world wine market. As consumers around the world become more conscious of the impact that their purchasing choice will have, being certified sustainable will be another defining feature-not just the good quality of the wine-of McLaren Vale wine. This is an important project that locals will reap the benefit from. McLaren Vale and the surrounding areas is not just known for its wine; it is also known for its great olive oil. We recently had the Prime Minister’s country task force meet down in McLaren Vale where we heard from olive growers first hand on the significant export markets that they send to. They also have their challenges but they are doing a particularly important job in the region. In addition, the Willunga farmers market has recently been awarded the most outstanding farmers market in the country in the 2009 Vogue Entertaining and Travel Produce Awards. The Willunga farmers market draws on local produce from around the area, everything fruit, vegies, flowers, cheese, olive oil, bread-and that is just the start. The market has recently celebrated its seventh birthday and is going from strength to strength. The region is also developing as a force in agri tourism. I was very pleased to visit with the minister for agriculture the Producers, which is one of these businesses in the electorate. This is a B and B that not only immerses visitors in the process of wine making-you can go there and make your own wine-but you can press your own olive oil; you can preserve fruits of the farm; you can learn how to bake and learn cheese making. This is an experience that connects people with the local area and the local food. We have an amazing area for wine, for food and for tourism. The region is going from strength to strength. There are some challenges, though, and as this is a grievance debate I will highlight them. McLaren Vale is very close to the metropolitan area. As Adelaide has grown, the metropolitan boundaries have come closer and closer. We need to ensure that this unique tourism and winegrowing area is protected and does not become part of the urban sprawl. It is very important that we protect the horticultural areas of McLaren Vale to ensure long-term sustainability. I have previously placed that on public record in this place, and I do so again to reiterate its MAIN COMMITTEE importance. I am pleased that the state government’s recent development plan for the region will examine ways to reinforce the long-term protection of this unique South Australian landscape. I would urge the state government to ensure that any solution especially protects this region, including the Bowering Hill site, from urban encroachment. Another issue that has been raised with me is the naming of the region. In the South Australia tourism brochures, the region of McLaren Vale and the Fleurieu Peninsula is called the Fleurieu Peninsula, as that describes the majority of the area. But the people in McLaren Vale are presenting the McLaren Vale brand to the country and the world in their wine, and they feel that there is a mismatch between the Fleurieu Peninsula, which is considered a tourism region, and McLaren Vale, which is considered a wine-growing region, when in fact they are one and the same area. So they have expressed their wish that we look at combining ‘McLaren Vale’ and ‘Fleurieu Peninsula’ in the name of the region. It has certainly been done in other wine regions in South Australia. For example, the Barossa Valley and the Clare Valley are both wine-growing region and tourism regions. McLaren Vale growers are looking at incorporating into the name of the region the brand that they present to the world. It certainly seems to me like a sensible idea, and I will continue to work with them to see whether we can achieve that. McLaren Vale and the associated areas of Willunga and Blewitt Springs are a beautiful part of the electorate. Although they do face some challenges, such as drought, urban encroachment and marketing themselves, this area will go from strength to strength. I would encourage members, staff and anyone else in this place to visit at any time. There will certainly be people welcoming them there. Emissions Trading Scheme global warming are derided as dinosaurs. Those who ask about alternative scientific viewpoints are dismissed, not with reasoned scientific detail but with abuse and condescension. The time of reasoned engagement on this issue is over and minds are closed in this place. That does not serve this nation well. It is not in the best interests of the people who look to this place for confidence and wider understanding of the issues. The majority of Australians believe that something should be done about global warming. Our children have been taught that man is responsible for global warming, and they have not been offered alternative viewpoints. It is hard to get past what has been ingrained for so long. I do not expect that this speech will change any minds but I do hope that it may open some. ‘ETS’ is a term that everybody seems to know, but nobody seems to know exactly what it involves. Reasonably, Australians may well turn to Google for a simple summary, and they would be disappointed. There are some business related summaries-pretty heavy stuff and not exactly as understandable as many Australians would desire. There is no Australian government website that lays out in a simple to understand format what impact an ETS would have on Australians. There is a website where you can find out how much money the government will give you, while the ETS costs and figures are very hard to find because it is a cost with little return. What a contrast that is. To make the point very clearly, it suits the Rudd government’s political interests to ensure that the information that is available on the ETS is heavy in technical detail and not easy to MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Integris Essential For Lesson Planning And Preparation
217,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.08 Pm),"Those who question the science of anthropogenicunderstand, because if it was easy to understand then the majority of Australians would say that this ETS will hurt Australians, will fail to achieve any benefits for global climate. I note in a recent report by the Australia Institute, a left-leaning think tank, that it has examined the ETS and found that emissions from black and brown fired coal electricity generation stations are estimated to be stable out to 2033, when Treasury has predicted clean coal technology will suddenly be discovered, at which point they will fall. Clearly this ETS is no panacea for CO2 reduction and its credibility is highly questionable. We know that the government’s ETS will lift prices. Flow through of this super revenue raising measure will add an estimated 12.5 per cent to the average cost of goods. The Victorian government estimates households will pay $7 a week more for their electricity. There have been other estimates that electricity bills will rise by 20 to 25 per cent. So every time one of my constituents walks into a shop and buys something, they will face that increase. The government should set up a website stating in detail the effects on everyday items. How much will a loaf of bread, a litre of milk and, of course, a birthday cake rise in price? Access Economics estimates that an ETS will cost 13,000 jobs in Western Australia, with losses from industries concerning black coal, oil and gas, petroleum, chemical rubber and plastics, iron steel and metals, electricity and gas distribution. The reality is that an ETS is not pain-free. It will cost in terms of prices to households, jobs for those households and will cost in terms of reduced business competitiveness, particularly if we adopt an ETS and our regional trading partners and neighbours do not. If we burden this country, its businesses and employers with increased costs, while China, India and others do not, then we risk business closures and those businesses taking jobs offshore, where the lack of controls on emissions and the lower wages make other countries more attractive. Yet the increased costs may be considered acceptable by Australian families if it achieves less CO2 and reduces global temperatures. To take up the issue of the threat of carbon, with all the talk of human-produced carbondriven climate change, many people would imagine that carbon dioxide is an increasing proportion of the atmosphere. What would Australians say? Would you find someone on the street who would save five per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent and climbing? Surely it must be a big percentage. The reality is that the greenhouse gases in total make up just one per cent of the atmosphere. That is an interesting point, and when I searched HansardI could not find any mention of that fact. To go further, of that one per cent of the atmosphere that is greenhouse gases, 95 per cent of that is water vapour. So when we talk of carbon dioxide, it represents just 3.6 per cent of that one per cent of the total atmosphere. But that is not the end of it, because human produced carbon dioxide represents just 3.4 per cent of that figure, and Australia produces 1.4 per cent of that figure. So if my calculations are correct, the carbon dioxide produced by Australians, or within this nation, represents 0.00000017136 per cent of the atmosphere, and that is what the Rudd government’s ETS is trying to reduce-13,000 jobs in WA and price rises of 12.5 per cent on average to reduce that 0.00000017136 per cent by five per cent. So the question is: why would we want to pay that price for so little return? A central theme to the way this debate is controlled by the government is to always harp back to the IPCC stating, ‘2,500 scientists say the science is settled, so it is settled’. Yet, when you look at the figures, only 600 actually looked at the carbon dioxide science, and then only MAIN COMMITTEE 308 were part of the second review. In probably the most telling of all the figures, only 62 of the 308 reviewed the last chapter which attributed the cause of climate change. And when you take those with vested interests away, only seven could be described as independent, and two of those seven disagreed with the final statement that carbon dioxide was 90 per cent certain to be the cause of climate change. Well at least there were five independent scientists who agreed out of the 2,500. There has also been a persistent line which derides scientists who disagree with the man made global warming view. They are often said to be in the pay of big oil or fossil fuel corporations. I wonder whether that is so different to those on the opposite side of the argument that occupy professorial chairs in climate change or whose research is climate change related, and consequently funded, and who would themselves feel vulnerable if a majority of politicians had not just agreed with one side of the argument. I make the point that 31,000 independent US scientists disputed the findings of the IPCC, and that is worthy of our consideration. We are limited in this place, with very few scientific degrees amongst our number. It is therefore bad judgment to dismiss the views of those that are scientists and stop asking questions in this debate. Another point to do with science is the matter of sea level. The IPCC predicts that by 2100 sea levels will rise by 59 centimetres. There have been suggestions that rises could be as much as six metres. They are based on modelling. What should be considered is that there is scientific disagreement on this. Swedish physicist and geologist Nils-Axel Morner was a former chair of the INQUA international commission on sea level change. Morner debates the modelling on sea level changes and in 2003 he wrote: The late 20th century lacks any sign of acceleration. Satellite altimetry indicates virtually no changes in the last decade … The INQUA Maldives research project has revealed that there, on a regional scale, are absolutely no signs what so ever of any on-going flooding of the Maldives… In conclusions, there are firm observationally based reasons to free the world from the condemnation to become extensively flooded in the 21st century AD. I would say that Morner’s view has been questioned. However, Professor Cliff Ollier of the University of Western Australia also reports that sea levels in the south-west Pacific have been stable for about 10 years, and this is a highly concerning contrast to IPCC modelling when the primary data debates and contradicts the modelling. It is known that in the last 150 years of the use of fossil fuels it was only between 1975 and 1998 that fossil fuel use and global temperatures rose at the same time. No correlation existed before, as temperatures had risen and fallen in periods during increased use of fossil fuels. Yet it is the link to carbon dioxide that is the basis for the human induced global warming theory. It is known that since 1998 carbon dioxide has risen in the atmosphere from 365 to 385 parts per million. However, in the same period, the global temperatures, as measured by the Hadley CRUT3v surface temperature measurements and the MSU satellite lower troposphere measurements, have actually been shown to be declining. How, then, can anyone insist that the science is settled, that the argument is over, when there is no correlation between carbon dioxide and global temperatures, as demonstrated by those two measurements? MAIN COMMITTEE The science of man-made global warming is not settled. Questions must still be asked. The Rudd ETS will be bad for Australians, and the cost involved to reduce minute amounts of CO2 to fractionally smaller amounts only requires more questions and not blind obedience. Blair Electorate: Roads of the Howard government in relation to road infrastructure in my area. Over 11½ long years they showed complete inertia, ignorance and idleness with respect to the Ipswich Motorway, the Warrego Highway and the Cunningham Highway-vital national roads in South-East Queensland. I speak now because I did not have enough time this afternoon when I spoke in relation to the member for Oxley’s motion. He correctly pointed out that the Rudd Labor government had invested an unprecedented $26.4 billion in road and rail infrastructure through the nation-building program over a six-year period, from 2008-09 through to 2013-14. The Rudd government’s budget announcement contained more than $25 billion for key road, rail and port projects. These are creating jobs, they are improving traffic flow, they are improving safety on our roads, they are making it easier for farmers to take their produce to the markets in Brisbane and they are improving the reliability of travel times for commuters between Ipswich and Brisbane and the rural areas outside. It is important that we are improving the long-term productivity of our businesses, whether on farms, in small business or in big establishments like Bradken Engineering in Ipswich or JB Swift meat works at Dinmore or the aerospace industry associated with the RAAF base at Amberley or the RAAF base at Amberley generally. I am aggrieved that we had to put up with the absolute apathy of the Howard coalition government for such a long time and that we are now playing catch-up. My constituents talk to me all the time about the fact that they were so frustrated for such a long period of time under the previous government. We are now seeing significant improvements on our roads such as the Cunningham Highway between Aratula and Ipswich. The state of that highway was an absolute disgrace. Constituents spoke to me at shows and at mobile offices at Kalbar and Boonah and other places in the Fassifern. It was appalling what we saw under the Howard government. I had a look at the road many times because I drove upon it when I was doorknocking and campaigning for the 2007 election. I doorknocked businesses all through the Fassifern area around Aratula and spoke to the business operators there. Fortunately the Rudd Labor government has come up with the millions of dollars that we need to fix that road. We have also seen that almost nothing was done in relation to the Warrego Highway under the Howard government except the Laidley overpass. But the Rudd Labor government is putting tens of millions of dollars into resurfacing that highway and recently we have seen some work in relation to the Haigslea-Amberley intersection. My predecessor was completely ignorant about that intersection for a long time. The Rudd Labor government came along and has put $1.9 million on the table to fix that intersection. The new slip lane as you drive west along the Warrego Highway improves the safety of all the people who travel from Walloon and Rosewood and from the RAAF base at Amberley and who want to go on the Warrego Highway. They live at places like Hatton Vale and Glenore Grove, or up the Brisbane Valley or through Ipswich at Pine Mountain and North Ipswich and Karalee and places like that. They use that intersection all the time. About 50,000 vehicles a day use that part of the Warrego MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Integris Essential For Lesson Planning And Preparation
218,Mr Neumann (Blair) (9.17 Pm),"I speak tonight because I am aggrieved at the failureHighway as it goes towards Ipswich near that intersection. It took the Rudd government, after 11½ years of apathy from the previous government, for that intersection to be fixed. We are also seeing the resurfacing of the Warrego Highway and I commend the state government for the work they are doing there. You can see the difference it makes to the safety and reliability of traffic flow in the area. You can also see what is happening in terms of our local roads-$1.75 billion for the nation’s local roads-with the Roads to Recovery program. Black spot funding of $5.153 million was provided in my electorate to, for example, the Ipswich City Council, the Lockyer Valley Regional Council and the Scenic Rim Council by 30 June this year under the nation-building funding. We are seeing record amounts of money being put into the work. I will give you an illustration, Madam Deputy Speaker, of the black spot funding and why it is so important: $800,000 was given to improve the sightlines and signage as well as upgrade line-markings and extend the intersection of the Warrego Highway with Tallegalla Road and Lowood Minden Road at Minden. For years and years and years people have been complaining about that intersection. Almost nothing was done by the previous government in relation to it and it took a Rudd Labor government to do something. That particular intersection happens to currently be in the federal seat of Dickson. The member for Dickson did nothing about that intersection during his tenure and the people are so frustrated about that particular intersection. It took a Rudd Labor government to actually put $800,000 into that intersection to see it improved. I am pleased to say that that part of the Warrego Highway and the whole of the Somerset Regional Council will be in my seat in the next federal election now the redistribution has been finalised. Sadly the Fassifern Valley and the Lockyer Valley are no longer in my seat, but the Somerset region has been added to about 70 per cent of the City of Ipswich and it is now in my seat. I am pleased that the Rudd government has taken the steps to fix that intersection. We have seen an enormous amount of money put into the Ipswich Motorway. There is the Ipswich-Logan interchange-$255 million, fully funded by the Australian government. The Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway-$1.95 billion-is being undertaken. Then there is the Ipswich Motorway upgrade from Wacol to Darra-$700 million. You can see all the work that is being done at the intersection of the Centenary Highway to improve the connectivity and the reliability of traffic flow. For the people who live on the south-west side of Brisbane, through Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley, the Scenic Rim and the Somerset region, it is simply a matter of safety and health. About an extra 1.2 million more people will live in that region of South-East Queensland in the next 20 years. That is an enormous number of people, and the Rudd government is putting an enormous sum of money into that particular area. We are seeing a huge amount of money being put into the 18 kilometres of new road from Springfield to Yamanto-an extension of the Centenary Highway-by the state Labor government. We are seeing better local roads and nine new bridges. I commend the state Labor government for the Centenary Highway extension. I look forward to additional funding which might eventually make the Cunningham Highway four lanes to the RAAF base at Amberley. There are other road projects in South-East Queensland, of course. We need to look at the intersection at Blacksoil. I am working hard in relation to that issue, along with the state member for Ipswich West, Wayne Wendt. We are working with local councils in Ipswich and the Somerset region to lobby for more funding there. MAIN COMMITTEE The Ipswich Motorway upgrade is perhaps the greatest demonstration of the failure of the Howard government and a demonstration of the commitment of the Rudd Labor government to the people of the western corridor. It is creating in excess of 4,000 jobs. That is 4,000 people who have jobs, pay taxes, feed their families, consume goods and services and make a contribution. The Origin Alliance has been involved in the Dinmore to Goodna section. A number of companies are involved in that project and it started in the middle of this year. The project is due to be completed in 2012. In relation to the Wacol to Darra section of the motorway, it is the SAFElink Alliance who have been involved. Very complex traffic changes are being undertaken on this road, but they are so important because up to 100,000 vehicles a day use this motorway at its peak. It is unbelievable that the previous government and its local representative opposed the upgrade of that motorway. I commend the Rudd government for showing its commitment to the people of Ipswich and the rural areas outside by providing road infrastructure. bate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Main Committee adjourned at 9.28 pm MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Integris Essential For Lesson Planning And Preparation
219,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"There being no further grievances, the deGovernor-General: Africa (Question No. 654) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 18 March 2009: (1) How many AusAID staff are assigned to Australia’s aid program for Africa.

(3) On what date/s did the Governor General receive invitations from each African nation on the itinerary for the Governor General’s trip. (4) What is the estimated cost of the Governor General’s trip to Africa. (5) What is the estimated cost of the Government’s bid for a temporary seat on the United Nations (UN) Security Council; and does this estimate include any or all of the estimated cost of the Governor General’s trip to Africa; if so, what is the amount. (6) How many staff are travelling with the Governor General on her trip to Africa; and of these, how many are from (a) AusAID; and (b) his department. (7) In respect of the Government’s request that the Governor General undertake lobbying on its behalf to support its bid for a temporary seat on the UN Security Council: (a) on what date was this request made to the Governor General; (b) how was this request made to the Governor General; (c) what instructions were provided to the Governor General; and (d) what restrictions, if any, were placed on the Governor General for making commitments on behalf of the Government. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Eleven staff at Post (3 x Australian-based, 8 x locally engaged) are assigned to Australia’s aid program for Africa. An additional officer is on short term mission to Pretoria to assist with aid program development and visits (January-June 2009). Six staff in Canberra. (2) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Middle East and Africa Branch coordinated DFAT’s support for the Governor General’s visit to Africa, with one EL2 employee dedicated to work on the visit from 27 January to 9 April; while AusAID’s Africa Section provided briefing and coordination support for program components related to development. Four posts in Africa supported the Governor General’s visit: Harare, Nairobi, Port Louis, and Pretoria. As is usual practice in supporting high-level visits, a number of the A-based and locally engaged employees at these posts were involved, including the AusAID staff posted in Nairobi and Pretoria. To support the resources of posts in handling a major visit of this type including to countries of non-resident accreditation the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assigned a number of staff on short-term missions as follows: Location Dates Harare 12.3.2009 24.3.2009 Pretoria 1.3.2009 31.3.2009 Tanzania 26.3.2009 1.4.2009 Tanzania 19.3.2009 1.4.2009 Ethiopia 15.3.2009 28.3.2009 Location Dates Ethiopia 22.3.2009 28.3.2009 Port Louis 1.3.2009 11.4.2009 To support the aid-related project visits, AusAID assigned staff from Pretoria and Nairobi posts to the following locations on dates as indicated: Location Dates Zambia, Mozambique, Kenya 21.2.2009 30.3.2009 Namibia 18.3.2009 20.3.2009 Namibia, Botswana, Ethiopia, Tanzania 4.3.2009 – 7.3.2009 and 20.3.2009 1.4.2009 Kenya 24.3.2009 29.3.2009 Kenya 25.3.2009 – 28.3.2009 Mozambique 25.2.2009 – 1.3.2009 and 21.3.2009 – 26.3.2009 Zambia 6.3.2009 12.3.2009 and 17.3.2009 – 23.3.2009 (3) The Governor General’s visit was agreed and welcomed by each nation on the itinerary during discussions through diplomatic channels in late 2008 and early 2009. (4) Estimated costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID for supporting the Governor General’s visit are $290,000. This was to support, amongst other things: airfares, salaries for employees on leave without pay who were recalled to duty, accommodation expenses, on ground travel and expenses. (5) The Government has allocated $1.927 million for the UN Security Council campaign for 2008-09, $5.416 million for 2009-10 and $5.735 million for 2010-11. Approximately $86,000 of the amount specified in (4) was drawn from this allocation. (6) The first part of this question is outside the portfolio responsibilities. (a) None (b) No Departmental officer accompanied the Governor General from Canberra. Two Heads of Mission (HOM), and in two cases a mission official, had a seat on the official aircraft between some locations in the program. (7) This question is outside the portfolio responsibilities. Productivity Places Program (Question No. 790) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 22 June 2009: In respect of the Productivity Places Program: (a) how many places have been allocated for apprenticeships in the financial years (i) 2008/2009, (ii) 2009/2010, (iii) 2010/2011, (iv) 2011/2012, (v) 2012/2013, (b) how many of these places have been accepted; (c) what is the estimated cost of the apprenticeship places for each financial year in part (a). Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) 85 000 places have been earmarked for Australian Apprentices under the Productivity Places Program, funded from April 2008 to June 2012. The Australian Government has been administering job seeker places from April 2008 until 30 June 2009. Under the National Partnership Agreement for the Productivity Places Program, states and territories are now administering the program, including funding to support the training of Australian Apprentices; (b) Within the job seeker allocation, as at 1 May, 154 participants have commenced training as Australian Apprentices; and (c) The Productivity Places Program administered by the Australian Government funded Registered Training Organisations up to $5000 per qualification at the Certificate III and IV levels. The Australian Government has funded state and territory governments $5000 per qualification at Certificate III and IV levels for job seekers to undertake training as Australian Apprentices. This amount will be indexed over the life of the National Partnership for the Productivity Places Program. Active After-School Communities Program (Question No. 797) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the Active After-school Communities program: in the 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 200708, and 2008-09 financial years, how many (a) primary school students participated in the program, (b) primary schools were participating in the program, (c) out of school hours care services sites were participating in the program, (d) schools were on the pending list for the program, and (e) outside school hours care providers were on the pending list for the program. Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) collects information concerning the number of primary school students participating in the Active After-school Communities program in a given term, rather than a cumulative total of students that have participated during the year. For comparative purposes, the number of students participating in the program in term 2 each year is: 2004-05 43,129 primary school students 2005-06 80,276 primary school students 2006-07 130,236 primary school students 2007-08 144,098 primary schools students In 2008-09, the ASC revised its data collection to a semester basis. Participation data for the latter half of the 2008-09 financial year will not be available until schools and out of school hours care service sites return program feedback forms in September-October 2009. However, during the first part of the 2008-09 financial year (semester 2 2008), 213,715 primary school students participated in the program. (b) The number of primary schools participating in the Active After-school Communities program in each of the financial years since the program commenced is: 2004-05 422 primary schools 2005-06 875 primary schools 2006-07 1555 primary schools 2007-08 2039 primary schools 2008-09 1970 primary schools (c) The number of out of schools hours care service sites participating in the Active After-school Communities program in each of the financial years is: 2004-05 491 out of school hours care service sites 2005-06 967 out of school hours care service sites 2006-07 1442 out of school hours care service sites 2007-08 1634 out of school hours care service sites 2008-09 1438 out of school hours care service sites (d) The pending list for the Active After-school Communities program is a current ‘point in time’ measure. Whilst the ASC is not able to accurately provide historical information concerning pending list information at a point of time in previous financial years, previous ASC ‘point in time’ records have shown a pending list of between 500 and 600 schools and out of school hours care providers in 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 and 2008-09. This information was not subdivided into schools and out of school hours care providers. As at 20 July 2009, 365 schools were on the pending list for the program. (e) The pending list for the Active After-school Communities program is a current ‘point in time’ measure. Whilst the ASC is not able to accurately provide historical information concerning pending list information at a point of time in previous financial years, previous ASC ‘point in time’ records have shown a pending list of between 500 and 600 schools and out of school hours care providers in 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 and 2008-09. This information was not subdivided into schools and out of school hours care providers. As at 20 July 2009, 320 outside school hours care providers were on the pending list for the program. Sport Funding (Question No. 798) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 25 June 2009: Further to her answer to question 538 (Hansard, 12 May 2009, page 3564), in respect of the 2008-09 Budget item Sport and Recreation facilities contribution to funding (Budget Paper 2, page 230): (1) Which of the 91 sporting clubs to be funded under this measure have: (a) received funding, and (i) what level of funding did each receive, and (ii) on what dates; and (b) not received funding, and (i) why, and (ii) are they still expected to receive funding under this 2008-09 Budget item. (2) Will any sporting clubs, other than the original 91, receive funding under this 2008-09 Budget item; if so, (a) how many; (b) in what suburbs and States or Territories are they located; (c) what will the funding be used for; (d) what level of funding will they receive; (e) on what date/s did they contact the Government for funding, and how; (f) on what date/s did the Government first announce these funding decisions; and (g) have these clubs received funding; if so, on what dates and what sum. Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) (i) and (ii) At1 September 2009, a total of 82 of the 91 projects to be funded under the Sport and Recreation facilities contribution to funding 2008-09 Budget Measure had received funding. A list of the projects with details of total commitment, payments and dates is provided at Attachment A. (b) (i) At1 September 2009, a total of 9 of the 91 projects to be funded under the Sport and Recreation facilities – contribution to funding 2008-09 Budget Measure had not received funding. A list of these projects with details of why funding has not been received is provided at Attachment B. (ii) Yes. (2) No other projects, other than the original 91, will receive funding from this Budget Measure.

25 June 2009: In respect of the Employment Services Purchasing Hotline of the department: what total number of (a) calls have been received (b) emails have been received, and (c) calls and emails have been referred or directed by (i) employees of the department, and (ii) the former and current Ministers for Employment Participation and their staff. Ms Gillard-The Minister for Employment Participation has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Employment Services Purchasing Hotline received, between 29 September 2008 and 3 July 2009 (a) 7,130 calls (b) 8,317 emails. Nation Building and Jobs Plan (Question No. 813) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Housing, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of ScheduleC of the National Partnership Agreement (NPA) on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan: (a) is she aware that her department receives monthly reports from the States and Territories in respect of progress under this NPA; if not, why not; (b) has she received the May 2009 report (due 23 June 2009) from all of the States and Territories; if not, which States and Territories are yet to submit their May 2009 reports; and (c) what is the total number of new social housing dwellings that have commenced construction under all elements of this plan as at 31 May 2009. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) There were 439 as at 31 May 2009. Youth Allowance and Abstudy (Question No. 816) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: In respect of the Government’s changes announced in the 2009–10 Budget-For student Income Support and Youth Allowance Workforce Participation criteria: how many of the 30,700 students, as referred to in her department’s 2009–10 Budget fact sheet, will be affected by the tightening of the workforce participation criteria for independence (under Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY) classified under the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Structure as from: (a) Major Cities of Australia; (b) Inner Regional of Australia; (c) Outer Regional of Australia; (d) Remote Australia; and (e) very remote Australia. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: On 26 August 2009 the Australian Government announced transition arrangements for commencement of the proposed changes to the workforce independence criterion in January 2010. These arrangements will assist approximately 4,700 gap year youth, taking the number of young people affected by changes to the workforce participation criterion to around 26,000 in 2010. It should also be noted that many of the remaining 26,000 young people affected by this change will be automatically eligible for Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY as dependants under the changes to the Parental Income Test (PIT). Analysis of Centrelink administrative data based on the home addresses recorded for young people who established their independence under the workforce participation criterion and were granted Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY from the period April 2008 to April 2009 suggests that approximately 77 per cent come from families living in major cities. The remaining 23 per cent are estimated to come from families living outside the major cities. Of the non-metropolitan group, around 18 per cent come from families living in inner regional areas, about 5 per cent come from outer regional areas and less than 1 per cent from remote and very remote areas of Australia. These data take account of the impact of the transitional arrangements announced on 26 August 2009. The table below applies this geographic breakdown to the estimated number of young people in 2010 who will not qualify as independent for Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY under the proposed changes to the workforce participation independence criterion (as indicated above, many will qualify as dependent students instead under the PIT). Region* No. Students^ (a) Major Cities of Australia 19,900 (b) Inner Regional of Australia 4,640 (c) Outer Regional of Australia 1,340 (d) and (e) Remote and Very Remote Australia# 120 Total 26,000 * Note: The home address provided by young people on Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY who gained independence through the current workforce participation criterion is classified according to the ABS Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) classification. The ARIA index measures the remoteness of a point based on the physical road distance to the nearest urban centre in each of five size classes-major city, inner regional, outer regional, remote and very remote. When interpreting the geographic breakdown it is necessary to consider that the home address provided by an independent Youth Allowance recipient may not indicate their parents’ address in all cases. ^ Some numbers are rounded. # Remote and very remote categories are presented together given the low number of people from very remote locations. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: Programs (Question No. 823) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 25 June 2009: 1. What are the names of all of the programs administered by her department? 2. What is each program about and what is the policy objective of each program? 3. What are the projected overspends and underspends in each program for the financial year; (a) 2007-08; and (b) 2008-09 including where appropriate details elements or components of each program where over or underspends has occurred or will occur and the reasons for each? 4. What is the total expenditure for each program to 30 June 2009, including details elements or components of each program where over or under spending has occurred or will occur and the reasons for each? 5. In respect of programs where funding is provided to individual recipients (e.g. schools, schools systems, universities) has any over funding been recovered or is any expected to be recovered by 30 June 2009; if so, what sum (a) has been overpaid; (b) will be recovered; or (c) is expected to be recovered? 6. Is each program ongoing, if not on what date is each program due to expire? 7. What is the funding in each financial year of the forward estimates for each program including; (a) a break-down of administered and departmental expenses; (b) the sum of allocated funding; and (c) the sum of funding committed? 8. For each program has an evaluation of the programs effectiveness been conducted; if so when was the most recent one conducted; what were the conclusions and recommendations; if not, when will an evaluation be conducted and if one will not be conducted, why not? Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (2) From the 2009-10 Budget, all agencies were required to change their reporting framework to report financial outlays on a program basis.

Climate Change: Resources and Energy (Question No. 836) Mr Ian Macfarlane asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on 25 June 2009: (1) When will the retirement of Australia’s existing fleet of coal-fired power stations commence. (2) What will be the impact of the retirement of coal-fired power stations on electricity generation. (3) Is it a fact that, as stated in Powering Australia: The business of electricity supply (Focus Publishing, 2007, page 19), the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that energy consumption will increase by 2.3 per cent per annum until 2020 and it is thought that about 1,000 megawatts of generation capacity will need to be added to the National Electricity Market annually over the next ten years to meet demand . (4) What is the nominal indicator of commercialisation for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. (5) How many commercial scale CCS projects, under the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships initiative, does the Government intend to see in operation by 2015. (6) What system/s is/are in place to ensure all emerging renewable technologies are considered for assistance under the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. (7) What is the current situation of the revised ZeroGen project in Queensland. (8) What are the expansion prospects for Australia’s aluminium production facilities. (9) What modelling has been done on the impact of the introduction of the Government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on aluminium smelters. Mr Martin Ferguson-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Retirement of coal-fired power stations is a commercial decision to be undertaken by owners. (2) The impact of the retirement of coal-fired power stations will depend on the timing of the retirement and the general supply/demand conditions existing in the electricity market. (3) The report Powering Australia: The business of electricity supply (Focus Publishing, 2007, page 19) referred to work from the Energy Supply Association of Australia citing the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts. The ABARE forecast was released prior to the announcement of the Government’s climate change policies and other factors, such as the current global economic conditions, which would have impacts on the investment environment and demand for electricity. (4) The Australian Government has not adopted a universal nominal indicator on the scale of demonstration projects that is needed to support the commercialisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. A case by case approach will be taken in assessing the appropriate scale of proposals for industrial scale projects under the Government’s $2 billion CCS Flagships program. There will be requirements that projects will be at a size that can be rapidly and effectively escalated to commercial deployment in Australia; and be of a scale that will result in original equipment manufacturers, engineering procurement construction contractors and storage service providers having sufficient confidence in their technologies to offer performance and process guarantees to industry customers for fully-commercial plants. (5) The CCS Flagship program is expected to support at least two and possibly up to four industrial scale CCS projects to be commissioned from 2015. (6) The Australian Government has announced that it will establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. The details of how ACRE will function will be developed in 2009-10. (7) Questions about the status of the ZeroGen project should be referred to the ZeroGen partners. (8) World aluminium prices averaged US$1360 per tonne in the March quarter of 2009, the lowest since September 2002. Aluminium prices more than halved between September 2008 and February 2009 as the global economic downturn reduced consumption of consumer durables and motor vehicles, which are both significant drivers of aluminium demand. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects there to be no major additions to aluminium smelting capacity in Australia in the medium term given continued low prices and the decline in the global demand for aluminium. tonnes and exports to decline by 5 percent to 1.63 million tonnes in 2009-10. (9) As part of the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Australian Treasury modelled a number of greenhouse emission target scenarios to help gauge the impact on emissions intensive trade exposed industries, including aluminium. The results are detailed on page 166 and in Box 6.7 of The Treasury report, Australia’s Low Pollution Future: the Economics of Climate Change Mitigation.

(34) No. (35) No. (36) The Government does not accept that increased unemployment levels will arise from award modernisation. (37) In addition to matters answered in questions (3), (5), (9), (11), (12), (14), (15), (17), (18), (20), (21), (23), on 2 May 2009, I varied my award modernisation request to provide that the Commission should include conditions in modern awards that, as far as possible, allow the continuation of roster arrangements presently in practice for work performed in remote locations. The variation also made clear that where a modern award covers remote work, the Commission may include terms providing that an employer may reasonably require employees who work on a roster to take annual leave in a manner that fits with the roster. Where employees in remote areas work even-time rostering arrangements which include annual leave, the Commission should facilitate the retention of these arrangements. The2 May 2009 variation further clarified that the intention of award modernisation is that where specific exemptions apply (i.e. relating to the National Employment Standards – redundancy), that these are permitted where the Commission considers appropriate. For this reason the Fair Work Bill 2008 was amended to allow a modern award to create an exemption to the redundancy NES. In a submission to the Commission of 10 October 2008, the Government proposed that the Commission commence a process to determine transitional provisions for modern awards, immediately following publication of stage 2 awards to ensure that parties have sufficient time to become familiar with the content of modern awards and recognising that businesses require certainty regarding their costs. The Government also made submissions on 10 October 2008 expressing its concern that all draft priority awards developed by the Commission include a model redundancy clause that provides redundancy entitlements for employees of small business employers. The inclusion of these clauses involves extending this benefit beyond those areas where it is currently provided for in awards and had consulted extensively with small business on the development of its substantive workplace relations reforms. The Government acknowledged that small business can face particular challenges when managing employee engagement and dismissal. The Government supported a case by case approach to the inclusion of redundancy pay entitlements in modern awards. Where this has previously been a common entitlement in a particular industry for small business employees, the Government supported its inclusion in the modern industry award. In a submission to the Commission of 13 February 2009, the Government encouraged the Commission to make use of transitional provisions in developing final modern awards, noting they may be appropriate in relation to significant remuneration-related entitlements, such as wages, casual loadings or superannuation. The Government also encouraged the Commission in its submission of 13 February 2009 to pay careful attention to previous long standing arrangements and to the requirement of the award modernisation request that the making of a modern award should not increase costs for employers when determining the final shape of ordinary hours for each sector in the Pastoral Industry Award 2010. Also in the 13 February 2009 submission, with respect to the Contract Cleaning Award 2010 and paragraph 61 of the Commission’s Statement of 23 January 2009, the Government advised that it was giving consideration to the issues raised and will advise the Commission of the outcome of these considerations. Paragraph 61 states: “[61] The major parties proposed that the award make provision for an outgoing contractor to be exempt from making severance payments provided for by the NES under certain circumstances. We are of the view that such a provision would be contrary to the terms of the consolidated request, in particular cl.30, and we have therefore not included it in the exposure draft.” The outcome of the Government’s considerations was contained in the award modernisation request variation of 2 May 2009. In a submission of 29 May 2009 to the Commission regarding transitional provisions in modern awards, the Government urged the Commission to ensure transitional arrangements in individual awards best meet the requirements of the particular industry or occupation covered by the relevant modern award, having regard to the views of the parties affected by the changes. With respect to the aged care industry, the Government encouraged the Commission to use the full 5 year transition period available to allow the industry to absorb any changes in labour costs. In another submission to the Commission regarding transitional arrangements on 1 July 2009, the Government encouraged the Commission to have regard to funding and contractual arrangements that employers may have entered into which would impact on their ability to implement cost increases or decreases in a manner which is efficient for their business and fair to their employees. (38) Yes. On1 April 2008, I met with Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) representatives Mr Tony Maher, General President of the Mining and Energy Division and Mr Peter Murray OAM, who is a CFMEU nominated director to the board of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation. On 20 May 2009, I met with: Mr Tony Maher, General President of the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division Mr Andrew Vickers, General Secretary of the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division Mr Alex Bukarica, National Legal Officer of the CFMEU Mr Kieran Turner, Director, Coal Services Pty Ltd Mr Martin Aitken, Director Human Resources, New South Wales Minerals Council Mr John Whale, Industrial Relations Consultant and Mr Graeme Gillespie, Director and Principal, Gillespie Consulting Services Pty Ltd (on behalf of the Queensland Resources Council). (39) The Government is currently considering the industry’s request for reform to the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation and its supporting legislation. Asia-Pacific Community (Question No. 856) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) What countries have expressed strong support for the Prime Minister’s idea of having a Europeanstyle Community in the Asia-Pacific. (2) How was the support of each country expressed. (3) On what dates was the support of each country expressed. (4) To 11 August 2009, what total sum of money was used by the Government for its lobbying and consultations on the ‘Asia-Pacific Community’. (5) Did Mr Richard Woolcott discuss the Prime Minister’s bid for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) during his consultations on the Asia-Pacific Community; if so, (a) with which countries, and (b) did Mr Woolcott initiate the discussions. (6) Was Mr Woolcott asked to raise the UNSC bid during consultations on the ‘Asia-Pacific Community’. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) A number of countries have expressed strong support for the Prime Minister’s Asia Pacific community initiative. Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments. The Asia Pacific community will not be modelled on the European Union. (2) Mr Rudd’s keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue on 29 May, attended by officials of many countries, outlined the Asia Pacific community initiative and was well received. Countries have expressed their support for the initiative in high level bilateral and multilateral meetings, including the EAS Foreign Ministers’ Consultation and the ASEAN-Australia Post Ministerial Conference. Countries have also expressed their support in consultations with Australia’s special envoy, Mr Richard Woolcott AO. (3) Mr Richard Woolcott’s regional consultations on the Asia Pacific community commenced on September 2008 and concluded in March 2009. The EAS Foreign Ministers’ Consultation and (4) The Government spent around $407,000 on advancing the Asia Pacific community initiative to 11 August 2009. This figure includes travel costs and Mr Richard Woolcott’s consultancy fees but does not include indirect costs, such as time spent on the initiative by departmental officers, as they are difficult to quantify. (5) Mr Richard Woolcott’s visits to 21 countries focused on the Asia Pacific community concept. Mr Woolcott represented Australia on the UN Security Council in 1985-86 and on several occasions the matter of Australia’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council was raised in conversation. He offered the reasons why Australia’s bid should be supported. (6) No. Sri Lanka (Question No. 863) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) What steps are the Australian Government taking to ensure the Tamils in Sri Lanka receive humane treatment. (2) Has the Australian Government made contact on this matter with the Sri Lankan Government; if so, (a) on what date/s was contact made; and (b) at what level. (3) Has the Australian Government formally requested with the Sri Lankan Government, that nongovernment organisations be granted access to refugee camps; if so, what was the Sri Lankan Government’s response. (4) Has the Australian Government contacted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding Sri Lanka’s request for a loan of $US1.9 billion; if so, (a) on what date/s, and (b) what was IMF’s response. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Government has responded to the humanitarian issues facing displaced persons in Sri Lanka through the provision of humanitarian assistance and by advocating action by the Sri Lankan Government to protect the welfare of civilians and to promote reconciliation. In 2008-09 Australia provided $24.5 million in humanitarian assistance to meet the critical needs of civilians adversely affected by the conflict (total assistance to Sri Lanka in 2008-09 amounted to $41 million). The humanitarian assistance included food aid, medical supplies, shelter, water and sanitation. It has been delivered through UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and a number of Australian NGOs. On 14 September 2009, I ( Mr Smith) announced a further $5 million contribution to support the resettlement of displaced people. This followed a $1.3 million contribution to NGOs for demining in June 2009 and a further $1 million through the International Organisation for Migration for demining efforts in August 2009. Demining of former conflict areas is a prerequisite for the revival of northern Sri Lanka. This financial year Australia will provide more than $35 million in assistance to Sri Lanka. The Australian Government has made repeated calls during the conflict and since the conclusion of military hostilities in May 2009 for the welfare and protection of civilians to be the absolute priority. The Government has done so directly to the Sri Lankan Government and publicly. Since the beginning of 2009, I ( Mr Smith) have delivered three statements to the House of Representatives on the situation in Sri Lanka. The latest statement, on 14 September 2009, called on the Sri Lankan Government to move quickly to create the conditions for civilians to rebuild their lives, including through voluntary resettlement. The statement noted that reconciliation would require sustained effort by Sri Lanka, its diaspora and the international community to overcome the grief, resentment and anger, and the lack of confidence and trust that was the inevitable consequence of decades of armed conflict. The statement also noted that the time is here for the Sri Lankan Government to win the peace and to forge an enduring political settlement for all Sri Lankans. (2) I ( Mr Smith) have spoken to Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister, the Hon Rohitha Bogollagama MP, about the need to ensure the protection of civilians and the need for reconciliation in Sri Lanka on six occasions in 2009, including over the phone and in the margins of multilateral meetings. In addition, in the margins of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Egypt in July, I ( Mr Smith) spoke to Sri Lanka’s President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister about the need to ensure the protection of civilians and the need for reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Australia’s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka has raised at a high-level in the Sri Lankan Government Australia’s concerns regarding the protection of the internally displaced persons in northern Sri Lanka, their freedom of movement and ultimate resettlement, and other matters of humanitarian and human rights concern, including with: the Minister of Human Rights and Disaster Management the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Secretary of the Presidential Secretariat the Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights the Senior Adviser to the President and Chair of the Taskforce responsible for the resettlement of internally displaced persons the Secretary of the Justice Ministry. Senior officials in Canberra have also made representations on these matters to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner on several occasions this year. (3) Yes, the Australian Government has regularly raised the issue of access of humanitarian organisations to internally displaced persons’ (IDP) camps. With a number of exceptions (in cases where negotiations between the organisation and the Sri Lankan Government are ongoing), the Sri Lankan Government is now allowing humanitarian organisations access to the camps for internally displaced persons. (4) DFAT sought information from IMF staff on Sri Lanka’s application for an IMF loan through the Department of Treasury and Australia’s representatives at the Fund on 14 May and 1 July 2009. Advice was received on 16 May, 2 July and 23 July 2009. On 24 July 2009, the IMF Executive Board approved Sri Lanka’s request for a stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 1.65 billion (around $US2.6 billion) to support the country’s economic reform program. The decision was supported by the IMF Executive Director representing the constituency of countries of which Australia is a member. Chifley Electorate: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 871) Mr Price asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Has she received a request for the provision of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine at Mt Druitt Hospital. (2) Has she identified any underutilised capacity of the MRI at Blacktown Hospital. (3) Does she anticipate that the benefits to patients of having an MRI machine at Mt Druitt Hospital would be comparable to those of the machine at Blacktown Hospital; if so, why; if not, why not. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I have received and replied to Mr Price’s letter of 1 June 2009 concerning Medicare eligibility for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit at Mr Druitt Hospital, but I have not received a request concerning the provision of an actual MRI unit. While the Government manages Medicare eligibility of MRI units, individual hospitals and other diagnostic imaging providers are responsible for the acquisition and operation of actual units. (2) The Government is not in a position to assess under-utilisation of MRI units such as the one at Blacktown Hospital. The Government does not have details of all scans performed on this MRI unit, nor whether there are significant waiting times, etc. (3) The Government appreciates that patients across Australia value access to affordable and convenient MRI services. The Government’s objective is to improve health outcomes within a sustainable budget. As noted in (1), while the Government manages Medicare eligibility of MRI units, individual hospitals and other diagnostic imaging providers are responsible for the acquisition and operation of actual units. Small Bowel Transplants (Question No. 883) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Since 24 November 2007, has the Government provided financial assistance to any patients to travel overseas for a small bowel transplant; if so, (a) how many patients, and (b) what total sum of money did this cost the Government. (2) What is required to (a) train professionals, and (b) equip a hospital in Australia, to perform small bowel transplants. (3) What is the estimated total: (a) cost of setting up a small bowel transplant facility in Australia; (b) sum of annual running costs for such a facility; and (c) number of patients in (i) Australia, and (ii) the wider region, that would benefit from this facility. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) Since 24 November 2007 the Australian Government has provided assistance under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program (MTOP) to one (1) patient to travel overseas for assessment for, and if suitable to undergo, a small bowel transplant. (b) As at 13 August 2009 the Commonwealth Government has expended $1,381,993.01 in relation to costs for the assessment of this patient prior to transplant. (2) (a) and (b) This information is not available to the Commonwealth Government, however I anticipate costs would be significant because of the level of training required to establish a transplant team, maintain relevant skills and the associated equipment costs. (3) (a) and (b) I am unable to provide this information as the Commonwealth Government has not costed the set up and annual running costs of a small bowel transplant facility. (c) (i) The Australia and New Zealand Organ Donation Registry (ANZODR) which is the authoritative source of data for organ donation and transplantation activity has advised that data on bowel transplantation waiting lists are not collected as this procedure has not yet been undertaken in Australia and there are no formal/reported waiting lists. (ii) The number of patients suitable for bowel transplantation in the wider region who may utilise an Australian facility is not known.
