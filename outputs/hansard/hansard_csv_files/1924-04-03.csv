If Parliament approves of this B ill the Government will give consideration to the appointment of the Commission. TheB ill provides for the appointment of officers by the Commission and also for the transfer of officers of the Home and Territories Department and the Works and Railways Department who are already employed in tlie Territory. Certain officers of both those Departments have for a number of years been wholly employed on departmental work in the Territory, and they have a f u l l knowledge of the local situation. It is proposed that such of these officers as the Ministers of the two Departments may. approve may be transferred to tbe control of the Commission. An y officer of the Public Service who is so' transferred shall retain his existing and accruing rights. of absence from the Public Service while he is in the employ of the Commission. the Commissioners is different. is proposed that if a public servant is appointed to the Commission he shall resign from the Service, but will be eligible for re-appointment. It would be a hardship to have to resign from the Service because of Territory, but the Commissioners will receive a substantial salary, and no such hardship would be inflicted upon them. Provision is made in the B ill for the services of officers of the Works and Railways Department to be utilized as far as possible in connection with constructional work in the Territory. This will make available the experience and skill of officers who have been connected for many years with Canberra work. It will also insure continuity of ideas and plans, and will save the Administration considerable expense. One of the most important parts of the B ill deals with financial matters. This Sub-clause 1, clause 17, reads as follows : TheB ill provides that if The revenue of the Commission shall consist of the following moneys :In (a) rates; (b) charges for services; (c) rents received from lands leased by tbe Commission, or under any Ordinance made under the iSeot o j Government (Administration) Act 1910; W ill Mr Griffin have (d) moneys received .in pursuance of any by-law made under this Act ; (e) fines recovered for any contravention of any by-law made under this Act ; I refuse to be drawn and (/) moneys borrowed by the Commission in pursuance of this Act; and (g) any other moneys received by the 1 Commission. Sub-clause 2 provides that all moneys received by the Commission shall be credited to a fund to be called the Seat of Government Fund. The purpose of that is to dissociate the Commission's financial operations from the ordinary financial affairs of the Government. The Commission will have independent funds, and it will be required to make the best use of the revenue and resources of the Territory. Pending thc floating of loans by the Commission it is proposed that the Treasurer shall be empowered to advance money to it , subject to early repayments with interest. That is necessary, because, if Parliament passes this He w ill be granted leave Bill and the Commission takes control of the Territory, say from 30th June next, it will be impossible for it to borrow The procedure respecting money immediately. Pending the raising It of the first loan, therefore, the Commonwealth Treasurer will advance money to it . All advances made under this provision must be recouped to the Treasurer from the first loan. The Commonwealth to the lower-paid officers Government guarantees repayment of moneys borrowed by the Commission, and being required in the Pederal any interest that may be due thereon. The Commission may only borrow moneys to such an amount, and in such manner, and on such terms as the Treasurer shall approve. That is an important provision. The Commission shall apply any surplus to the credit of the Seat of .Government Fund to the reduction of loans. It is quite obvious that in the initial stages of development, when the larger constructional works, such as the building of Parliament House and the administrative buildings, is proceeding, the Territory accounts w ill show a heavy accumulating deficit, but we are confident",21,Second Reading
74,Dr. Maloney,,22,Second Reading
75,Mr Stewart,"that this w ill be only temporary,, and that later on the revenue will; increase. We are optimistic enough to expect that ultimately the receipts will exceed the expenditure in the Territory. If in the first ten years the general liabilities of tha Â£10,000,000I mention that amount simply for the sake of illustration-and the receipts of the Commission in that period exceed that amount, the surplus must be paid into the Consolidated Re. venue Fund. The Government has endeavoured in this Bill to strike the happy mean. It has sought to give the Commission reasonably f u l l powers so that it may discharge its duties without being unduly hampered, and at the same time to retain sufficient authority to insure that the Commissioners shall, at all times, be under parliamentary control. Very onerous responsibilities are to be placed upon the Commission i u regard to its general management and control of the Territory. TheB ill provides that it shall be responsible for the appointment and control of its officers, and the control and management of Crown lands and other land placed in its control by the Governor General. That includes not only land within the city area, but all lands within the Territory. It shall levy and collect rates, and borrow money under the conditions which I have already mentioned. It shall construct, maintain, and operate tramways; construct, maintain, and control roads; provide gas, electricity, water, and sewerage; and, generally, have charge of public utilities and public works within its own territories. Its powers are set out in clause 14 of the Bill', which I invite honourable members to read. It takes over heavy Labilities in regard to expenditure in the Territory, and is given wide scope in the economic management of the finances of the Territory. future of the Territory, financially and otherwise, is really the responsibility of the Commission. TheB ill contains some restrictions powers. It must conserve and adhere to the' approved plan, and in undertaking works and bviildings it is subject to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-21. friend tell us whether he refers to the original plan of Mr Griffin, or to an amended plan?

However, the main scheme outlined by Mr Griffin is still being adhered to, and it is proposed to adhere to it subject tosuch modifications as the Commission may deem wise. Those modifications must be approved by the Minister and be laid before Parliament. The accounts of the receipts ancl expenditure of the Commission are to be subject to the Committee of Public AccountsA ct 1913-20. By-laws of the Commission may be disallowed within t h i r t y clays after having been laid before both Houses of Parliament. Books of accounts will be sub.iect to inspection and audit by theAuditorGeneral, and the annual report of the Commission on; its operations must be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The Commission's, powers are to be subject to amy Ordinance made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910.

The Governor General must approve< of all by-laws, and he may make regulations 1 moreaccurately defining the Commission's powers, aind imposing conditions and limitations n.pon the exercise of those powers. It may be asked what hold the Minister has upom the Commission. The Commission must submit annually to the Minister, for his approval, estimates of receipts and expenditure. No expendituremay be incurred without the Minister's approval. The Commission must furnish a report quarterly, Generally, the whole setting out the. approximate expenditure and receipts during the past quarter, the general condition of the works, and the appointments and removals of officers. upon the Commission's The Treasurer must determine the amount to be borrowed at any time, and the terms on which the transaction shall take place.

That will not work in the future, however satisfactorily it may have worked up to the present.

It is very difficult to convey to honourable members the atmosphere which reading of its proceedings in cold type is a very different thing from being present.

The Greeks really complained of Some of us believe that the Mussolini's action in taking coercive measures without first having recourse to the procedure which Italy, as a member of the League of Nations, had agreed to follow in such circumstances. The Counenveloped the meetings. The cil listened to the Italian representation, which insisted that the inatter should be left to the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors. They had two reasons for taking that stand:first, because the Italian Delegation was under the supervision, control, and protection of the Conference of Ambassadors; and, secondly, because they doubted whether they had the right to adjudicate under Articles of I received on hearing such Convention. There is something to supThat difference is port that latter view, because the interwhere there are reprepretation of the clause in the Covenant of forty-five or fifty nations .did not make it clear whether the League together with one .common had power to .deal w it h .the question.

An important matter that was dealt with was Article 10 of the Covenant..

The Assembly, being confident of made by the Council the importance of the interpretative resolution, and being in accord w i th it , decided to communicate the results of the by all the members of the voting to the Council. The Budget and finance matters dealt In my opinwith also were of great importance. A policy of strict but judicious retrenchment Committee of the Aswas followed. Reductions were made wherever possible, a distinction always being made between the essential features of the work of the League and other activities which, though important and dethat Article 10 shall sirable, were not, for the present, absomililutely necessary. The financial procedure and that the Assembly of the League is quite different from parliamentary or any other, of which I have knowledge. In 1922 it was would found necessary to constitute a committee of control. It is really a supervisory commilitary' mittee, and I quote the words of the There is no doubt that the president of the fourth committee apauthorities of each country pointed to deal with this matter in the 1922 AssemblyIn matters of finance the position of the I do not think that Secretary-General of the League of Nations is one of some difficulty. The peculiarities of his situation may best be illustrated by recalling the normal financial procedure in a Government Department. The responsible Minister at the head of a spending Department has to submit estimates for what he considers he will require if called upon by the to enable him to carry out his policy during thc next financial year to thc Finance Minis!-' who conducts a most careful scrutiny into the demands thus made upon the National exchequer, and only passes such demands as he is could not override the prepared and able to defend in Parliament.. _ In for some countries the estimates, in addition, undergo close examination by a Budget Committee before they are submitted to Parliament. Whatever the precise method employed, the principle is the same, namely, that proposals for expenditure shall, before submislevity. sion to Parliament, first ibe submitted to a careful scrutiny by some body capable of giving expert advice, and entirely independent of the body which framed the policy involving the expenditure in question. It cannot therefore be considered a most desirable procedure that the Secretary-General should submit his proThere may be other ways of posals for expenditure to the Council and the Assembly before they have been examined in The Assembly was detail by some such body as that indicated, which is capable of subjecting -them to expert and impartial criticism. It is necessary that the Assembly whicli has voted a Budget for certain definite purposes should be in a position to satisfy itself that the money has been applied to those purposes. To attain this end close co-operation between the Assembly and the persons appointed to carry out the audit is essential, in so far as, in default of such co-operation, thc audit too becomes a formal matter directed to ascertaining whether expenditure is ' supported by vouchers, rather than to inquiring whether any particular item of expenditure has been duly authorized, and whether the intentions of the Assembly have beeu properly interpreted'. It is particularly necessary that all cases in which a decision of the Finance Director may have been overruled by written directions from thc Secretary-General be examined. To achieve this it will be necessary that the Committee of Control have power to call upon officers of the Secretariat to appear before .them and explain the circumstances attending any exceptional or extraordinary expenditure. It goes without saying that control will at the same time extend to an investigation of the question whether or not all the rules and administrative or other principles formulated have been scrupulously observed. Thc Assembly approved the Budget of the League for 1924, amounting to 23,328,686 gold francs-ther e are twenty-two gold francs to the Â£1-as compared with 25,673,508 gold francs for 1923. From the approved expenditure must be deducted a sum of 95,050 gold francs, the surplus from previous financial periods, so that the actual reduction in the 1924 Budget from that of 1923 amounts to 2,439,872 gold francs. Of that amount only 12,298,449 gold francs is for the secretariat and special organizations of the League; 7,032,295 gold francs is for the International Labour Office; 1,920,168 gold francs is for the Permanent Court of International Justice; and 2,077,774 gold francs is for the working capital fund. Honourable members will see that, although the Supervisory Commission agreed to the expenditure, the Finance Committee, of which I was a member, was able with the approval of the Commission, to arrange a considerable reduction. The first draft of the Budget, which was approved by the Supervisory Commission, provided for an expenditure of 24,870,570 gold francs. The Assembly therefore made a net reduction of 1,541,884 gold franc3 -better had the provision been for an In spite of the constant increase of the activities of the League, the reduction has been made with the f u l l concurrence of the Secretary-General of the League and the Director of the International Labour Office. For reasons of economy IH] the Assembly decided to postpone for the present the building of a Conference Hall on the site offered for the purpose last year by the canton and city of Geneva. The allocation of expenses among the members pf the League again came up for discussion. The scale adopted by the Third Assemblyi n 19545} is to remain provisionally in force for 1924, except for certain modifications, of which the most important is a temporary reduction of twelve units in Japan's contribution in consideration of the terrible disaster which has overtaken that country. The Allocation Committee has, moreover, been requested to continue its task of perfecting the existing scale, in order to submit to the Fifth Assembly a definite and final scheme for the allocation of expenditure. The health organization of the League will, I believe, be of the greatest value for the collection of data, and in acting as an advisory body for thÂ© benefit of the world.. I do not propose to deal with the whole of the proceedings, in which I took a very active part, but they are fully outlined in the papers that will be laid upon the table. The International Labour Office, which involves an expenditure of 7,000,000 gold francs per annum, has proved its value by the work it has already done to improve labour conditions in different countries. It has an extraordinarily brilliant staff, and assembles complete data regarding every trade in the world. I remind honourable members that the constitution of this office was an essential part of the Treaty of Versailles, its object being to improve the conditions of labour in all lands. So far it has not been able to do anything for Australia, but that is understandable, because labour conditions in the Commonwealth are so far in advance of those existing elsewhere that they rather represent a model for the guidance of the International Labour Office. It has done something in eastern countries. India has ratified the Convention for a sixty-hour week. It would have been eight-hour day. We in Australia consider eight hours a reasonable time for a man to devote the best of his ability to labour. Labour conditions have also been improved in Japan and Middle Europe. ditions in India prior to the Convention?",26,League Of Nations

For instance an Indian girl, thirteen years of age would be, I suppose, on a physiological level with an Australian girl of, say, twenty-three years. comparing the conditions in what are known as black countries, we must take this fact into consideration. M.r. O'KEEFE -Has there been any alteration in the hours of labour in J apan ? do not know what tliey are. The information asked for by the honourable member is, I think, contained in the report, but I am not certain. In any case it could easily be obtained by asking for it , or by consulting the last report of the previous Labour Committee. An important matter, to businessmen, was the Arbitration Protocol. This Protocol, which was unanimously adopted by the Fourth Assembly of the League, is the result of continuous discussions and negotiations, which have lasted for over eighteen months. subject was originally brought before the Economic Committee of the League of Nations as the result of strong representations received by the Board of Trade, with regard to the difficulties thrown by the courts of certain foreign countries, i u the way of giving effect to clauses in commercial contracts by which the parties agree to settle differences arising under the contracts by arbitration. As is well known, the insertion of clauses to this effect is practically universal in many trades, and many thousands of arbitrations take place every year in London alone. Unfortunately, the law of some foreign countries-for example, France-doe s not recognise the validity of general arbitration clauses, and the French Courts would entertain an action brought by one of the parties in spite of the fact that they had agreed in a contract to settle the difference by arbitration. In other countries, which more or less recognise the validity of arbitration agreements, the Courts nevertheless set them The Convention increased aside from time to time, and the commercial community, which attaches great importance to this matter, have become thoroughly alarmed at the process of undermining the sanctity of these contracts which has recently been going on. The object in bringing the matter before the Economic Committee was to obtain an international agreement for the recognition of arbitration claiises in commercial contracts. The Economic Committee set up a special sub-Committee of Jurists and commercial experts, When which met in London under the chairmanship of MrF . D . MacKinnon, K . C . The report of this sub-Committee, whicli was strongly in favour of taking steps for the general recognition of arbitration clauses, was adopted by last year's Assembly, and circulated among the States that were members of the League. The next step was to draw up a Convention or Protocol to give effect to the recommendations. A f t e r a great deal of difficulty, arising from the different juridica l systems ancl ideas among the different States, a Protocol was drafted for the purpose, and circulated i u May last. A t the recent Assembly the Protocol came up for adoption. It was found, however, that in some points the language still needed amendment to make its intention clear, and the necessary revision was carried out by a special sub-Committee set up by The the Second Committee of the Assembly. The resulting text was unanimously adopted, and the Protocol now lies open for signature. The commercial world, as represented by such bodies as the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the International Chamber of Commerce, have pressed very strongly for the signature of the Protocol. Great Britain has already signed, and it is hoped that as many Dominions as possible will sign also. Legislation w ill be necessary in the United Kingdom to make a slight modification in section 4 of the Arbitration Act 1889, in order to give f u l l effect to the Protocol.

If I may be permitted, I should like to ask the right honourable the Prime Minister to give early attention to the constitution of the Australian delegation for the September meeting this year. I sincerely hope that he will be able to accept my recommendation, and that Australia will be represented by our High Commissioner, who has such an extensive knowledge of procedure, and is able to guide our representatives, especially those who go there for the first time, in matters of very great importance.

Again, in economic matters I had an adviser of marked ability in Mr Herbert Brookes, and in matters military .was helped greatly by the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D.

121,Mr D. Camebon (Brisbane) [3.22].,"I should like to refer more particularly to the work of the Third Committee, which dealt with disarmament. A t the outset, I strongly support my colleague's recommendation that the Australian delegation at the next meeting of the League Assembly should include a Minister of the Crown, also our High Commissioner ( Sir Joseph Cook), and, most decidedly, a member of the Opposition iu this Parliament. It was a privilege and a pleasure to work with my colleagues, Sir Joseph Cook, Sir Neville Howse, Mr member of the Australian Delegation to Herbert Brookes, and Miss Jessie Webb. Miss Webb was one of a group of six women, which included Dame Edith. Littleton, who bears an honoured name in the Old Country, and Mademoiselle Vacaresco, a Roumanian poetess, who was wonderfully eloquent, and delivered a number of important speeches on many subjects, particularly on behalf of the smaller nations of Central Europe. Geneva undoubtedly recognises that the women of the world, young and old, can help to move the purposes of men and policies of nations towards eunobling ends. Unfortunately, from my point of view, I was not able to attend many of the sittings of the Committee during the first week at Geneva. The Government of the French Republic had invited the nations which are members of the League, and also other nations, to be represented at a Conference at Geneva, under the auspices of the League, to deal with the circulation and traffic in obscene .Duplicamaintain that, as at present constituted, tions. Tlie Government of the Commonwealth accepted the invitation, and' appointed Mi'. Shepherd as Australia's representative; but, unfortunately, it became necessary for Mr Shepherd to return to'London, afid at Sir Joseph Cook's request I took his place. Convention laid down that-It shall be a punishable offence, for the purpose of or by way of trade or distribution or public exhibition, to make or produce or have in possession obscene writings, drawings, prints, paintings, printed matter, pictures, posters, emblems, photographs, cinewar, the relief of hundreds of thousands matograph films, or any other obscene objects. Those of the contracting parties signing the Convention whose legislation was not St the time adequate to give effect to it, undertook to take or propose to their respective Legislatures the measures necessary for this purpose. know very much about obscene publican tions, and I understood that the necessary legislation exists in Australia to deal Mr D. Cameron. with this matter. I think that is so. Asi t was not possible foy the Conferenceto come to> any decision as to the meaning, of the word "" obscene "" from an international ' stand-point, it was left to each State to decide in accordance with its own views what literature would be considered as obscene. With all due respect to the Conference, I do not think it achieved very much in that matter. I gladly accepted the Government's invitation to proceed to Geneva as. a the Fourth Assembly. I went somewhat doubtful as to what the great international organization could do towards maintenance of the world's peace, but I left Geneva feeling that whatever we can do to strengthen the position of the League we should do, butthat it would be a mistake to rely on thc League, as it is constituted at present, to preserve its from war. To me the most remarkable thing at Geneva was the confidence, faith, and reliance which' the small nations represented there very obviously had in the British Empire. As a race, we can claim to possess certain qualities which give people the feeling that we can be trusted. Such qualities, for instance, as a keen sense of justice, a rigid adherence to our plighted word, a real democratic practice of valuing a man for what he is, love of spiritual freedom, and a sense of political freedom. Tho League's worse enemies are those who it can keep peatfe throughout the world. The League's business is not to impose a settlement, even when a controversy is brought ""before it . It is to promote agreement, or, in the very words of the Preamble to the Covenant, "" to promote inThe ternational co-operation and to achieve international peace and security."" The League has carried out its duty in respect of international co-operation with remarkable success. The repatriation of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of of refugees, the organization of a defence against the epidemics from the East of Europe"", the efforts made to fight against opium, and to deal with the problem of traffic in women and children, which still remains one of the disgraces of our civiI did not lization, are only a few of its activities under this heading. Its economic work includes facilitating the increase of transport between nations. The work it has done to induce the nations to agree to a convention for the enforcement of .commercial arbitration is a thing of immense importance to the commercial interests all over the world. The financial rehabilitation of Austria was also undertaken hy the League and the remarkable success secured is one of its most outstanding achievements. Then of course, there was the Brussels Financial Conference, but that was referred to by the right honourable the Prime Ministei when, as Treasurer, he introduced his first Budget to this Parliament. When we come to its second and most important objectivethe achieving of international peace and security-it would appear that little has yet been done. Unrest still prevails in Europe, though the League has been in existence for four years. As a matter of fact, its fourth official birthday was January 10 last. It is very young, and while we know, as I have already remarked, that it cannot, as at present constituted, insure the peace -of the world, there is nothing to take its place. The League must be given .a fair chance. It i \ necessary to keep it going and to do everything to insure its continuing to function. Turning for a moment to reparations and the attendant problems, I must say that .so long as this great unsettled dispute weighs upon the economic life of the world, and embarrasses the relations between the nations, the work of the League must necessarily be enfeebled. Another limitation of the League's activities, results, 'of course, from the fact that itÂ« membership is not universal. The United States of America, Germany, .Russia, and some smaller countries still remain outside. The Third .Committee dealt with the reduction of armaments. It was my privilege to> sit ou the Committee with Mr immediate military support can be Herbert Brookes as Australia's representative. Article8 of the Covenant lays down that the members of the League are to proceed to a gradual and progressive reduction of armaments-and it also lays down a method by which that is to ""be accomplished. In conformity with the provisions of that Article the Council appointed the Permanent Advisory Commission and the 'Temporary Mixed Commission, whicli have been at work for the last few years. The Permanent Commission is constituted entirely of experts in naval, military, and air matters, but the Temporary Mixed Commission includes not only naval, military and air experts, but also civilian representatives and representatives of the Labour party in various countries. The Third Committee of the Fourth Assembly examined the reports of the Temporary Commission and Permanent Advisory Commission, and considered the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, which is the result of the work of these Commissions, and is also the principal work whicli the League has undertaken in order to give effect to Article8 of the Covenant. The Draft Treaty commences with a formal condemnation of aggression as an international crime, and a formal undertaking on the part of the contracting powers that they will not be guilty of that crime. There was considerable discussion about the exact meaning of aggression. The second principle contained in this treaty, and upon which the treaty is based, is that of mutual guarantee. It was maintained that no disarmament is practicable unless some guarantee is forthcoming for the States which are prepared to disarm, and unless that guarantee ii included in a general treaty. The Draft Treaty provides for the conclusion of complementary defensive agreements whicli are, in fact, purely defensive military alliances. In the ..case of these complementary agreements, States not party to them, are still required, on a decision of .tlie Council, to come to the aid .of the States concerned. .In the Treaty, the moral obligations imposed on a State are much more definite than those imposed in the Covenant. The real point of military interest in the Treaty is contained in these complementary .defensive agreements. As no forthcoming in other cases, it was decided, at tlie outset of the discussions of the Third Committee, that no delegate sho.uld in any way commit -his Government to any views that were expressed. Some of the delegates at Geneva were prepared to give expression to the views ;of their respective Governments concerning this Treaty, ;but others did not know what view .their Governments would take. It a-eally did not concern us -very much at the time, because the Treaty must be submitted to all -the Governments which are memhers of the League. Many delegations considered that the complementary treaties would constitute a grave risk; and, personally, I feel that I must agree with that view. They might cause -an atmosphere of ill-will and suspicion, which so often creates armaments, aud it -is quite possible that they might give rise -to the old spirit which existed in Europe when nations combined to form alliances and then other nations formed similar alliances. The Brussels Financial Conference brought to the world's attention the great need for a reduction of expenditure on armaments. 'inder consideration depend for their .idoption more upon the world's general -political situation than anything else. Mutual confidence and good-will must be re-established before there can be any betterment of the situation. The discuseussions of the Third Committee proceeded under a shadow. The trouble between Italy and Greece, following the Janiha murders, has been referred to by Sir Neville Howse. It hung like a dark cloud over Geneva throughout the period of the meetings of the Assembly. problem of disarmament is reduced to this: We cannot at present achieve disarmament, as is contemplated by the Covenant, because we are yet not sufficiently sure that our respective securities will be regarded as inviolablfe. States entering upon the obligations of this Treaty of Mutual Assistance will require to maintain elements of armed forces for use at the call of the League of Nations. commitments would be practically unlimited. be an increase rather thau a decrease of armaments for some States, for, if the assistance is to be effective, it implies the existence of forces surplus to the requirements of a State for its own protection. During the discussion on the Treaty, it became evident that many of the smaller Powers had no intention whatever of assuming the world-wide liabilities which ihe Treaty would impose to place armed forces at the disposal of the Coimcil for the enforcement of its decision on aggressor States. If this Treaty is accepted by Great Britain and the Dominions, the practically unlimited naval commitments it involves will' have to be borne almost entirely by the British Empire. Third Committee was of the opinion that, although it was impossible to recomWr. D. Cameron. mend to the Governments the immediate adoption of the text of the Treaty, it considered that the draft should be sent. in its present form, and that Governments should be requested to express their views on it as soon as possible. I understand that the Commonwealth Government have received a copy of the Treaty from Geneva. I appeal to honourable members, irrespective of party or politics, to assist the League by encouraging a keener interest in its work. Whether one is for or against the League, he should The proposals now ascertain what the organization has done, because only so can he formulate an intelligent opinion on world affairs during this critical period of its history. There is not much excitement about preventing a war. No system can possibly be devised which will stereotype the world into permanent peace. The question to be solved is: ' How are these international troubles and disputes to be met? The outstanding fact is that fiftyfour nations have agreed that they will not go to war without arbitration or conThe ciliation, and that they will work together for the general betterment of world relations. That is to say, for the first time in history, the world's nations have recognised a common moral responsibility for the perservation of peace, and have constituted an organization to make that responsibility effective. The League has become a centre of conference, cooperation, and conciliation amongst The sovereign States. Undoubtedly, its record has fallen short of its ambition. The result would be likely to No one can claim that this international organization will bring the millennium. The field for the critic is wide, but that does not help the world to progress. The League exists and functions, and it will continue to exist and function It is young, but it is the only real hope in today's troubled affairs. It depends for its progress on world public opinion. Some say that the League of Nations is a failure because it hesitated despotically to invoke the powers which it theoretically possesses to enforce its arbitrations upon reluctant or defiant potential belligerents. Had those rash counsels prevailed, the League, ere this, would have been a thing of the past, I am afraid. Between the The perilous rocks of Utopianism on the one hand, and of reality on the other, the League must try to steer a course whicn vvill bring it slowly but surely to the goal at which it aims. It would be entirely wrong to lull ourselves into a false sense of security by imagining that the League is at present a safeguard against any fresh war. The friends of the League must recognise the truth that the task of effectively organizing world opinion against war and Avar makers has still to be performed, and that it will be a difficult undertaking Avithout the help of the United States of America. Nevertheless, I believe that an effective instrument of world peace Avill, in the end, be built up from the beginning at Geneva. Downs-Attorney-General) [4.44] I am sure that honourable members would appreciate an opportunity of seeing this report in print before proceeding with the discussion. I shall, therefore, move the adjournment of the debate. But bofore doing so I Avish, with the permission of the House, to express to the delegates and sub-delegates our feelings of gratitude for the able way in Avhich they have represented Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nations. They attended most assiduously to the -duties that devolved upon them, and were present at not only the Assembly meetings, but alsothe meetings of the various Committees. Probably some of the most important work of thc League Avas done in the Committees. I trust I sneak on behalf of all honourable members in conveying to the representatives of Australia our sincere thanks for their representation of their country at the League of Nations. I ask lea\'e to continue my speech Avhen the debate is resumed.

That has led me to hope that the right honourable the Prime Minister will accept, the suggestion that the men who have attended the meetings of the League' as representatives of Australia should be formed into an Advisory Committee to assist whatever Ministry may occupy the Treasury bench to deal with the difficult questions that are frequently referred to Governments by the League of Nations. Such a Committee could give great help to the Government in power. 1.4.47] -(B y leave.)I have here two reports, one relating to migration, and the other to the Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis. I belieA-e that the report dealing Avith migrants Avill prove interesting to honourable members on both sides of the House. We all know that a number of statements haAc been made regardr ing the migrants Avhohave come to Australia. I have tried to look carefully at the matter from every aspect, and I have not attempted to hide anything. We can judge in only two ways the physical and mental condition of migrants Avho come to this country; first, by their condition Avhen they are examined in the ports of embarkation, and, secondly, by their condition Avhen they arrive at the ports of disembarkation. Are they fit for the Avork, to do which they Avish to come to this country ? Out of 55,000 migrants, only sixty-five have been returned. Of these, first in the scale are the mental deficients, of whom there were tAventy-one. ""Mental deficiency"" does not mean that their education Avas inferior to our standard. It is a nice name applied to persons Avhom one has been in thc habit of describing as lunatics. It is absolutely impossible by any medical examination here or in England to discover certain diseases without a perfectly clear history of the patient. Medical men are sometimes credited Avith being able to discover the disease from Those Avho which an individual is suffering, merely by looking' at him. It is true that oue can see those diseases Avhich are very near the brink, but certain mental diseases and epilepsy cannot be so discovered. We had the greatest difficulty Avith epilepsy during the war. The only possible way in which to discover it is by personal observation, or the observation of a seizure",32,League Of Nations

Having reviewed the matter very carefully, I do not believe that there is any justification for tlie alarming reports whicli have heen made in reference to the mental and physical second eye. condition of migrants coming to this country. Those migrants are not the sweepings of the streets; they are not the criminals of the United Kingdom. The immigration machinery prevents more than an isolated case of that class getting through. I admit that one often sees at disembarkation men, women, or children who are palpably unfit to do any work. When I was inspecting my first boat I was horrified to see coming up the gangway two or three migrants who, one could tell from only a casual glance, were totally unfitted to be citizens of any country. I had them put aside and sent to a hospital, so that I could go carefully into the matter to ascertain how that class could possibly get through. The Minister for Home and Territories has the right, if representations are made by any State, to grant special permission to a migrant to come in so long as he has not a disease communicable by association to people in Australia, on receiving a bond signed by the relatives of the nominated migrant that n claim w ill not be made against Australia for pension or* other .assistance.

I , therefore, consider that it is most important that we should deal with the question of its alleged cure and treatment quite dispassionately. In referring to Spahlinger, I want to be very careful to use his own I looked words. He has .spent over sixteen years in the study and treatment of tubercular disease. He is a very keen enthusiast of Swiss nationality, ancl is by profession a lawyer. I refer to his profession because I have to comment on it later. Most of the sixteen years has been devoted to bacteriological study of the disease, which means a study of thc lif e history of the causes of the disease. I want to briefly his intention and hope is.

130,Mr Mathews,"I understood the honHe injects twenty-two horses with certain toxins he jhas obtained from animals, and having produced in the bodies of the horses in a certain time twenty-two antitoxins, he blends these into one to make his complete vaccine. He asks for financial assistance to enable him to continue his research work until he is prepared to place before the public the f u ll details of his discovery. Still quoting Mr Spahlinger. Spahlinger, I may say that he is not prepared to sell his secrets for commercial exploitation, although he assured me on numerous occasions that he was offered Â£250,000 in cash for them. He purposes preparing a sufficient quantity of sera and vaccine to permit of distribution in the chief countries throughout the world, so that his cure may be exhaustively tested. It will take a period of not less than one or two years to prepare the partial sera and complete vaccine. He has spent all his available money, has hopelessly involved his father's finances, and has disposed of many animals. He says tliat he will require at least Â£40,000 to produce the partial sera. His friends, in an interview with them, assured me that not less than a minimum of Â£100,000 will be necessary. I may say that, subsequently, I heard Spahlinger address a meeting in London in October, in which he said that from Â£100,000 to Â£110,000 would bo sufficient to enable him to redeem his property, and continue his experimental researches. He is very keen that no persons should present themselves for treatment at Geneva, as he is not in a position to treat them, owing to the supply of sera and vaccine being exhausted. that the treatment by Spahlinger was commenced between 1912 and 1914, and during those years he treated a large number of cases, a certain number of which I had an. opportunity of examining in London. There is no doubt whatever that those cases do not show evidence of disease now, but there is no evidence that they suffered from the disease when they commenced the treatment. I ask honourable members to recognise that that is very important. The British Bed Cross, after exhaustive inquiries by their lay committee and. special bacteriologist, a man of repute, and with the sincere desire to assist, paid Â£10,000 to the credit of Spahlinger under an agreement which he accepted. I was informed of this by the chief of the British Eed Cross, ancl have no reason to doubt his statement. To this sum, Lord Cowdray offered to add Â£10,000, and the public of the United Kingdom a further sum of Â£10,000, making a total of Â£30,000. Unfortunately the work was not carried out, and the money deposited in the bank by the British Bed Cross was returned by The British Government have offered every inducement to Spahlinger to treat selected cases-under competent medical supervision Avithout asking for disclosures of the methods of his preparation of vaccine, but could obtain nobetter result. Spahlinger observes the very strictest secrecy as to his methods, ancl in consequence the members of the medical profession have A-ery little material on which to base any opinion as to the efficacy of his treatment. Every effort has been made by the public to induce the British Government to assist him financially, and honourable members are aware that similar efforts have been made in this country. The Public Health Department of the CommonAvealth has been in close touch with Spahlinger since April, 1921, as the files of the Department disclose. I directed attention to the profession of Mr Spahlinger because much is made of the fact that he is not a medical man. It is suggested by some that he has been "" crabbed"" by the medical profession, and some have described him as a charlatan. I ask honourable members to set aside both of these unworthy suggestions. Spahlinger is not a charlatan in any sense of the Avord. He is a man who has devoted years of study to this disease, I should like to say and has every reason to believe the statements he makes with reference to the progress he has made. As an illustration of the work of a non-medical man, I need only refer to Pasteur, the greatest bacteriologist the world has known, whose name is revered in every civilised country. He Avas not a medical man. He was a schoolmaster when he commenced to study bacteriology, and he advanced beyond any other man in the history of civilization. There Avas no effort to "" crab "" him, and all Avho have any knOAvledgc of the Avork he did must bow their heads when contemplating the marvellous results he achieved during his life. But everything he did, every step he advanced, every progress he made in dealing with disease, was placed before the Avorld Avithout delay. WhatI feel to he so difficult in Spahlinger's case is that he has never placed his cards on the table. Never at any time has he been able to say, "" I have got so far. Give me money to carry on."" That seems to me to be an extraordinary thing.. I think he would be well advised if he placed all his cards, on the table and admitted the scientific world to his confidence. If he took that course I have no hesitation in saying that he Avould have no difficulty in securing all the financial assistance he requires to continue his researches. I know that this matter hasaroused very considerable feeling, because of the amount of correspondence I have myself received since I returned. I have received more abusive correspondenceI mean, oE course, in reference to my profession-sinc e I returned than at any time in my life, and haA^e been begged to intervene on behalf of sufferers Avith the Government. As I have tried to show, it is impossible for me to recommend the Government to take actionin this matter. To continue my report, I may add that at the time of my departure from London, in November, nothing definite had been done to provide' the assistance which Spahlinger and his committee ask for. I have since been informed by the press that New Zealand is prepared to make a large donation to Spahlinger. I do not know Avhether that statement is true. I have been unable to confirm it. In revieAvihg this case it has appeared to me very strange tliat a man Avho has been studying this disease for eighteen years, and Avho claims to have cured so many advanced: oases, is unable to obtain recognition in his OAVU country, or in any country in Europe. Switzerland has not so treated other men AVIIO have claimed to be able to reduce human mortality. out honour, save in his OAVII country. carefully reviewed a great mass of evidencej and regret that I am unable to recommend this Government to spend any money in connection with tlie Spahlinger treatment of tuberculosis. I regret it the more because I can hold out nohope to the many sufferers from tuberculosis' of any recoA'cry by means of this professed cure. culosis is a disease which tends to cure itself.. The information obtained during the last few years reveals an enormous percentage of tubercular cases in which the patients have so completely recovered that no evidence of itspresence is found onexamination. In confirmation of that statement, there is the evidence, gathered at a large public hospital in Australia over a period of tAvo or three years, that in 60 percent, of cases in which there Avere traces of tuberculosis, post-mortem examination revealed that the lesion had healed. Further, in tracing the history of the cases so far as was possible, no evidence was found that any of the persons had Post a day's Avork, or had been under medical treatment for the malady. That statement is confirmed by statistics from Europe dealing Avith cases of persons whose death occurred suddenly, whether' by accident orotherwise. In 90' per cent, of the cases of men and women over foTty-five. years of age the pathologists found no trace of tuberculosis.. Sufferers from this disease will find consolation in the knoAvledge that it has a tendency to cure itself under certain conditions, most of which exist in Australia. That fact causes difficulty Avhen dealing with migrants-; they are so desirous of obtaining for themselves the benefits of the climate of Australia that in various ways they endeavour to avoid the medical examination. NeAv Zealand with respect to this matter ? mation I had obtained up to November last, supplemented by letters received subsequently, indicated that New Zealand had promised support; but I . have been unable to get later confirmation.

Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE -He is one of the illustrious colleagues to whom I have referred. I asked him if he had any hope of the success of his treatment. He said, ""Very little; but we may be one step forward in the history of the germ."" Coming to the subject of insulin, my opinion is that insulin is uot a curative agency for diabetes. tbe means of reducing the mortality in certain cases-wher e diabetic coma is present-is not denied. Diabetic coma is clue to sugar in the blood, and persons who get it simply fall down and die within a day or two. That condition has, for the time, been cured by the use of insulin. doubt that this material has an extraordinary effect, and is of very great value in reducing the quantity of sugar in the urine-. In the lower extremities of perthe j>ost-mortems sons suffering from diabetes, mortification sometimes sets in, and when a surgical operation is necessary to sever a limb or mable value, as it controls the quantity of sugar during the time required for the operation and convalescence from it. The difficulty is that once a person takes to insulin as a cure he must continue becauso of the disease. to use it. The action of this drug is still being inquired into by scientists, but up to the present their view is that it must be injected into the The blood, and not given by the mouth. Another difficulty attending its use is that it cannot be given generally, as it requires an examination of the blood by a skilled -bacteriologist at frequent intervals. A further question which must be considered is that of cost. Even as late as July last, insulin cost 4s. to 5s. a dose, ancl a dose is required once a day for many months, and possibly for many years. The price has since been reduced to about l f d . a Unit, the dose ueing 14 units, and it is hopedthat there will be a further reduction through the establishment of the Federal Government laboratory. ethics of the profession for the honourable member, with all the information he has obtained throughout the world, to give a prescription which would benefit persons suffering from tuberculosis? able member is asking too much. I .now pass on to the incidence of cancer. While this subject may not interest the younger members of this House, it is of considerable importance to all who are getting up iu years.

There is no question that it is on the increase, not only here; but in other countries of the world.

Sydney, probably out of loyalty to the nationality of the people concerned, are putting Italian lemons on the market and are not stocking the local lemon. ' sible to purchase local lemons during the last month or two. to be bought in the shops even when a large quantity is available. It has been suggested that the proper way in which to deal with this matter is by co-operation, with Government assistance. That is a very excellent idea. In no way would the Government be more justified in interfering than in helping any co-operative movement, but we must have a minimum of Government assistauce and a maximum of co-operation. glanced at this B ill when it was laid on the table of the House, and I saw that there was an opportunity to make quite a number of fine suggestions to the Government. perusal of the newspaper files, however, showed me that the measure refers to something that has already been donethe bounty has been paid, the f r u it has been canned, most of it . has been eaten, and the money has been spent. Yet the B ill is solemnly placed before the House, and we are asked to discuss and amend it . I siippose that cannot be helped. I have come to the conclusion that the Government brought it down because they had no other business. They expected us to discuss the Imperial Conference and the Imperial Economic Conference, at which nothing was accomplished, and they anticipated adjourning on Friday, after two weeks' discussion of that question, to enter upon a three weeks' holiday. I did not feel inclined, until this afternoon, to lend a hand to the Government. To-day I listened to a very fine speech delivered by the honourable member for Calare( Sir he refer to the Neville Howse). He told us that one person in every eight is due to contract some malignant trouble which willtake I am not sufficiently him from this world. One of my friends calculated that nine members of this Chamber were due to go. Having listened to the honourable member, and I think that one of the shivered in company with other honourable members, a feeling of brotherly love and kindness stole over me, and suggested that, for once in my life, I might help the GovernT h e retail trade in ment out of a difficulty. I had many pearls of wisdom which I was going to place before the Minister, but it is useless to do so now. I had much sage advice to offer. I might have suggested some It has not oeen posamendment to the definition clause of the B ill . That is the most illuminating clause I have ever seen in a B ill . We are told L o c a l lemons are not that "" canner "" means "" any person who cans f r u it ; "" that a cannery means a cannery, that f r u it means f r u it , and that the Comptroller-General means the Comptroller-General. TheB ill has given a wonderful scope to honourable members. I do not remember a debate initiated on such a simple proposition, which provided scope for so much discussion of such a wide range of subjects. I think that every subject which can be discussed on a motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply [8.22] I has been discussed. I heard the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) speak in glowing terms last night. He contemplated fields of apricots, peaches, and bananas, all in a flourishing condition. He viewed from Further inquiries and a the heights the glorious future of the f r u it industry, notwithstanding the present depression. I listened also to the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) . He descended to the depths of despair. There was no beautiful vision in his mind. According to h i m , the f r u it industry in Australia can be saved only by the importation of black-grown sugar for use in the canning of the f r u it , the abolition of all Arbitration Courtsi n Australia, cheap labour in the orchards, and Free Trade respecting everything excepting the article which he and his friends want to produce. This great industry was extended by putting into it returned soldiers, who were promised that they would return to a new world after the war and get all the good things that this country could offer. It is remarkable that the Government should have placed our returned soldiers i u an industry so awful and wretched that it can survive only with black-grown sugar, Free Trade, and cheap labour.",47,Groom Darling Is Being Carried On A Sheep S Back Because

156,Mr Scullin ( Y A R R A ),"That is the prospect held out by the honourable member for Echuca. When he was charged with those things last night lie rose in wrath to make a personal explanation. I thought that perhaps he had said something which he did not mean-that he did. not intend that we should l if t the sugar embargo which protects our white-grown sugar industry from the tries; he did not mean the adoption of abolition of Arbitration Courts. B ut no; the only explanation he had to make was . that not at any time, although he had worked upon the railways and was compelled to leave that employment because -of sweated conditions, had he belonged to a labour organization. My heart sank .further at the thought thab the Parliament of this country should have in it a man who could boast of his refusal to stand by his working mates while, on the contrary, as a representative of an agricultural industry, his whole advocacy was of black labour, cheap white labour, and Free Trade. If he were consistent one oould understand him. He supports this B ill . Is this a Free Trade measure ? It is a measure for bhe protection of a local industry. I do not go so far as to say that it sets out bo socialize the industry, but it is a step in that direction.

If there is one industry that ought to flourish in a country like this it is the f r u it industry, because in the growing of f r u it Australia compares favourably with any country in the world. bhat in such a young couaatry, in which we have .nob utilized our resources in the growing of. f r u it to anything like the extent that we ought, the iudustry even in its infancy is faced with ruin, the f r u it rotting on the ground because there is no market for it . I .say there is a market for it . There is a market for it among the teeming thousands of people in our big cities, who never see a bit of f r u it on their tables from one week's end to the other. I If we asked the head of a f a m i l y to . place upon his table sufficient fruit to. satisfy would cost him in a week as much as the rent of his house should be; and yet fruit is rotting in the orchards of Australia. Mr Scullin. with suggestions and proposals, they are -described as the socialization of production. They doi not mean the Government' stroke and Government -control of everything, but they do mean giving some social value to these things, and bhat, as a collective people, we should take an in terest in these industries. We are told that our proposals would only bring r u in black labour of other counto the industries of the country. Here is an industry that has not been intera Free Trade policy, or the fered with by any of the schemes or so-called "" R e d "" objectives of the Labour party, and yet in its in fancy it is already coming begging to this Parliament to do something to revive it . We are told that there is only one solution of this problem, and that ib lies in increasing the consumption of f r u it in Australia and establishing au overseas market. I used to believe that, and I still 'hope it is true, but I have very serious doubts ahout it when I read this B ill . I believe it is possible to increase the consumption of f r u it in Australia if there is co-operation with Government assistance and control. That has been advocated even from the anti-Socialist side. Their one idea was to do away with all Government control of every description, yet there is nob a session of this Parliament in which some-Bill is not brought down to provide for Government interference, assistance, and control to some extent. the growers of grapes to-day. Mr. SC Â¥ LLIN ^ T h ey ask for it every week in the year, though they have It amazes me to be told told us that they were determined to get r i d of it . As a preliminary step to getting r i d of it , they sold the most profitable Government undertaking we had in Australia. They sold that business because it was making a profit, and they sold it to their friends; but that is by the Way. I believe there is a solution of the problem in encouraging the consumption of f n i ib in Australia. There are only two ways in which that oa.n be done-on e is toi give the people more purchasing power. When I read the statements of honourable members opposite, who tell us, as one of their natural requirements, it them did last night, of the high wages ruling in Australia, I am amazed. The wages now paid may appear to be high as compared with pre-war wages, but for When we come along as a, party a man with a wife and family the wages",48,Groom Darling Is Being Carried On A Sheep S Back Because
157,Mr Mogkath,"They are asking it forKilling to-day are lower than they were before the war. talking about high wages when the purchasing diminished? .not by the action of trade unions or Labour parties in Australia, but by the action of the gangof people who, without let or hindrance, have been allowed to pile millions upon millions and profit upon profit. conditions due to the war to profiteer.. They have never let up on profiteering, and not a hand is lifted against them by Governments, with few exceptions, in any part of the world. The first solution of the problem of what to do with the firait that is rotting in the orchards of Australia is to increase the purchasing power of the people, and enable them to provide themselves with something more than bread and butter, or bread withotib. butter. I could take honourable members who talk of high wages into the industrial suburbsof any city of Australia, and particularly of Melbourne, and show them houses that are tumbling down, the rent of which a few years ago was 7s. 6d. per week and is to-day 25s. per week. Houses that were let for 10s. or l is . aweek a few years ago are now let for Â£ 1 a week. Government of the day tell us thai; the reason is the high wages which have to be paid to carpenters, bricklayers, and plumbers. The houses to which I refer were built before any living plumber or bricklayer was born. It used to be said at one time that the weekly rent of his house should equal about one day's wages of. a working man, but it is now equal to two and a half or three days' wages. A man's labour for nearly half the week goes in payment of his weekly rent. How much f r u it do honourable members think working men can give their wives and children under these conditions? If we proposed a F a ir Bents Court to deal with these landlord sharks, not a single honorahle member opposite would be found supporting tlie proposal. I listened today with interest to the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse). I pay the honourable member the tribute that hedid raise a voice above the jargon of money making and the sordid business of money grabbing; He raised a voice for humanity. He uttered some telling truths in informing the legislators of the country where they have failed with What is the good of regard to the people's health; but I tell h i m that, with all his splendid high power of wages has been ideals, he can never hope to succeed so It has been diminished, long as the Governments of the country represent the vested interests-thos e who own its slums and squalid dens. It is of no use to say that we have none of the conditions in Australia that in the Old World breed disease. We have them in They took advantage of Australia, and less than two miles from where I stand. If we improve the conditions of the people we will assist to solve the problem before us by securing the disposal of our f r u it i u our own country. The second necessity for local consumption is that the f r u it shall be brought from grower to consumer without being handled by so many middlemen. It has been said a dozen times, and every one knows it,,, that, although the grower cannot get I d . per lb., for his f r u it at his orchard, the consumer cannot buy it for less than 6d. per lb. in the streets of a city a few miles away from the orchard. There is a. great lack of organization in the industry. We want organization, but we are told that the purpose of organization is to bring everything to a dead level. Co-operation is called for on the other side. I am a believer in , and an advocate Writers who support the of, co-operation, but I believe that there, may be au extension of the principle of co-operation to include the whole of the' people of the State. I believe that by proper organization of society we may have the socialization of the means of production and distribution, and that would be a solution of our problem. An other solution of the problem is said to be the establishment of overseas markets. I cannot pin my f a it h to that, and the provisions of the B ill , it seems to me, j u s t if y a doubt as to its efficacy. W h y is it that the teeming millions on the other side of the world cannot eat our f r u it ? We are told that it is because of the distance it has to be shipped, and because the costs of production here are greater than the costs in other countries, and we cannot compete with the producers in other countries on level terms. That contention seems to disappear when we read the provisions of this measure. What does it propose ? It proposes that a bounty for local consumption shall be given to the .canners of this country. To encourage a certain proportion, of export, and to enable the exporters to compete with rivals in the markets of the world there is a very much higher exportbounty proposed. I find that one of the conditions for the payment of the bounty is that the canner shall pay a certain price to the grower for his f r u it . I take one item, that of ding-stone peaches. 1 find that under the B ill , the canner must pay Â£ 9 a ton to the grower for peaches. If he takes these peaches and cans them for export he will receive a bounty of Â£ 1 2 8s. per ton. That means that before this industry can be carried on for export, the canner3 of this country must have the f r u it given to them for nothing and Â£ 3 8s. per ton given to them to pay half the freight for transporting the f r u it to the other side of the world. It is an awful state of affairs if we have not in this country a canning industry so well established that it cannot purchase our f r u it , put it into tins, and send it across the seas to compete with canners in other countries unless it is made a present of the f r u it , and is paid half the freight on its exports. I suggest to the Government that if this is only a stop-gap expedient, and they promise that they will do nothing more of this kind, we should be told what is to happen next year to the f r u it industry. ""What are we to do next year if this bounty is not to be continued, and if today canners ""must be presented w it h the f r u it they can, and half the cost of its freight overseas must be refunded to them. for M a r t in ( Mr Pratten) says that that is not so. ber cannot say that, because under the B ill the canners are given for export a bounty of Â£ 1 2 8s. per ton, and they have to pay only Â£ 9 per ton to the f r u it grower. That leaves them with Â£ 3 8s., which is about half the cost of freight. This is what is demanded by those captains of iudustry, Sir Henry Jones, Taylor Bros., and the others who tell us that they can manage business affairs better than any Labour men could manage them. [ say to our friends of the Country party who talk about cheap labour and bringing down the worker's conditions, that they will rue the day if they lower bhe conditions of workers in this country. If there is to be one satisfactory market for our f r u it it will be found in the home market, if the wages paid our people are such as wil l enable them to buy f r u it . I have every sympathy with the men who toil upon the land. I know them, I have lived w it h them, and have represented them, and I know that the men who talk of cheap labour and black-grown siigar do not voice the opinion of the best men on the lands of this country. The solution of the problem is to be found in raising the standard of comfort of our people and enabling them to pay for the f r u it grown in the orchards of Australia. This measure does not require any more than formal assent because the money is paid, the f r u it has been canned and some of it has been eaten. Probably the Government could not help that, but although this is only a stop-gap proposal, it should have afforded the Government an opportunity to tell us what it proposes to do to provide a permanent remedy for the evils which by this B ill it proposes temporarily to meet. adjourned. ter aud Minister for External Affairs) [8.45] -(B y leave.)I move That the Treaty of Peace with Turkey and other instruments* signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923; and the Convention between the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, and Roumania, relative to the assessment and reparation of damage suffered in Turkey by the nationals, of the contracting Powers, signed at Paris 23rd November, 1923, be printed.

Immediately on my arrival in Great BritainI was again approached in the matter, but, unfortunately, the whole situation soon <manged. and the British Parliament did not again meet last year, with the result Treaty was delayed. was it approved by the House of Lords, while this week it is to receive consideration by the House of Commons. A f t e r the new Government came into power in Great BritainI interviewed Mr Ramsay Macdonald, who stressed the urgency for the ratification of this Treaty, so that peace could be re-established between the British Empire and Turkey, and I agreed to -submit the question to this Parliament immediately on my return to Australia. I visited Gallipoli on my way back from England, and saw the necessity for the action I am now proposing to this House. I spoke to several Turks concerning thedesirability of peace being again established between Turkey and the B r it i sh Empire, and they all expressed their regret at the delay. Thc Turkish authorities treated mc with the greatest courtesy, aud sent two omcers In this partito the frontier to meet me, and to accompany mo to Constantinople, and a British cruiser was permitted, for the first time since the outbreak of the war, to pass through the Straits to Constantinople to convey me on my way. The Turks have the greatest admiration and respect for Australians, because of the important part they played in the war at the Dardanelles, and it w ill tend to the establishment of better relations between Turkey ancl Great Britain, and between Until the Turkey nnd ourselves, if the state of war between these countries is terminated. Soon after my return to Australia. I received a cablegram from the British Prime Minister, asking whether I could assure him that Australia would approve of the Treaty being ratified. I replied that I would avail myself of the earliest opporLast tunity to place thc matter before Parliament, aud assured him that assent would be given. A few days ago I received a further cable, to the effect that the Houso of Commons would deal with the question this week, and asking for definite action on the part of Australia was Australia. I again replied that there was no doubt that the Treaty would he ratified, and that I would submit a motion to Parliament this week. The original Treaty of Sevres between the allied and associated powers and An election took piace, Turkey was, unfortunately, never ratified.

The Nationalists established tlieir capital at Angora, and were 'at war with Greece in Asia Minor. In the early part of that war the Greeks gained a considerable measure of success, but later they were subjected to overwhelming reverses by the 'Turks, who drove them out of Asia Minor, ancl destroyed Smyrna. Thc overthrow of the Greeks led to the downfall of K in g Constantine and the establishment of a new regime in Greece. The Turks, having overcome the Greeks, and being imbued with a new national spirit as a result of the success of Kemal Pasha, pressed on to the Dardanelles and the Straits, and created one of thc most critical situations we have known since the war.

All cemeteries, graves, ossuaries, and memorials to soldiers and sailors are to be recognised and respected by the Turks,, who. undertake also to give all necessary facilities for the identification, registration, and maintenance of t h t cemeteries and tlie erection of memorials on their sites. The Turkish Government further grants to the other Governments in perpetuity land on. which graves-, cemeteries , ossuaries, or memorials are erected, and undertakes to give all facilities to any Graves Commission of any country to. inspect and generally maintain those sacred spots. That arrangement is most satisfactory to Australia, and we appreciate the action which the Turks have taken, particularly in granting to the Commonwealth in perpetuity the soil in which our soldiers are buried. I should like to add that at the present time the Turks are scrupulously observing that undertaking. I recently visited all the cemeteries on the Peninsula, and had a long conversation with the Turkish Governor of Gallipoli. He assured me that his people recognise the sanctity of the dead, and will do everything in their power to insure that Australian graves, cemeteries, and memorials shall be respected not only by the Turks; but by all other people upon the Peninsula. That must be very gratifying to the relatives and friends of men buried there.

The convention, if subscribed to, really point that concerns involves, a reciprocal exchange of most closely is the agreement favoured nation treatment, but Australia has very l it t l e trade with Turkey.

Therefore, we have declared that ""we do not desire it to apply to Australia or any of our mandated territories. jurisdiction over foreign nationals resident in Turkey? which such nationals will have free access. ratified the Treaty? have ratified this Treaty, and I understand that GreatB r it a in w ill do so this week. There is also a convention in regard to reparations between the UnitedK in gdom, France, Italy,, and Japan, with a protocol for signature by Roumania.

Under the Peace Treaty there is a mutual surrender of all rights to reparations, but in order to meet the circumstances of the nations which are parties to the convention, a certain amount is placed at the disposal of a. reparations assessment Commission, to which claims may be made.

We want peace. I say nothing against the ratification of any treaty for peace, but I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not one of those who stand for Australia having any voice in foreign affairs that do not affect the interests of the Commonwealth. AndI do not stand for the doctrine that Australia must necessarily be involved iu any war between Great Britain and other countries. Australia should retain the position she held right through her history, and up to 1914. Ever since we have enjoyed responsible government we have had the fullest right to decide this matter for ourselves. When Great Britain became involved in war with the South African Republics, no one claimed that Australia also was involved. We exercised our own judgment as to what part we should take in that conflict. And that was the position right up to 1914. When Great Britain went to war with Germany, the British Government appealed to the Australian Parliament to send men overseas. This Parliament consented That marked the change in our attitude. It marked, also, the difference between the right honourable the Prime Minister ancl his supporters and honourable members on this side of thc House. There is a spirit of Jingoismi n thc air to-day. No doubt the recent visit of the British Fleet was designed to encourage that spirit, with a view to a change in our relationship in Imperial affairs. It is time the people of Australia had an opportunity of declaring where they stand in connection with this policy. I am satisfied that, if their opinion were sought to-morrow, the great majority would be against Australia going any further than she has in the past; that we should preserve those rights which have enabled us todevelop along sound lines up to the present. I do not subscribe to the' view that whenever a Avar occurs being above-board. The Australia must necessarily' be involved. Nor does my party. I have nothing to say against the Treaty UOAV before the House. If Ave could have treaties to bring about a'Avorld peace, it would be a move in the right direction. The very peopio Avho talk so much about the League of Nations apparently forget that there is such a thing as a League AvheneA-er they is the truly are in trouble, because they do not appeal to it, or attempt to put its powers into' operation. We had evidence of this iu the trouble between Turkey and Greece, ancl that between Italy and Greece, and in tlie action taken by France in thc Ruhr. We cannot expect to bring about peace by our present attitude with regard to disarmament. Instead of the nations of the world travelling along the path of peace, they all appear to be looking for more armaments, and preparing for the next war. At a time when Ave might Aery well r expect them to be talking about further disarmament, almost every country is talking of the necessity of preparing for defence. Prior to the holding of thc Imperial Conference, I said that the first question on the agenda paper, should be further disarmament of the great PoAvers of the world.

There is no need to put forward what the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) calls legal fictions. I was pleased to hear pai'tiouiarly two things from the lips of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce). We were told by the right honourable gentleman that the original treaty w it h Turkey, .the Treaty of Sevres, was not ratified. The next thing he told us was that the Turkish people were prepared to honour the dead and respect the graves of the Australians. He accepted their word, and believed they would abide by it . My comment on those two statements is this: In this House, after we had ratified the Treaty of Versailles, aft6r we had listened to the Australian representative at Washington, and were told that Australia was to be at peace for at least ten years, suddenly there was flashed across the wires the [9.39] I news that a Near East crisis had developed. A Prime Minister who was tottering in his position in GreatB r itain cabled to another Prime Minister who was also tottering in his position in Australia.

We have heard much to-day from the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse) regarding the League of Nations. That honHonorable memorable member said he believed that the delegates to the League of Nations were earnest in their desire to promote peace.

There are some people, we are told, who are anxious lo cub the painter and sever our connection with Great Britain, but it is gentlemen -who talk, as the honorahle member for Kooyong has done, who are forcing Australian people to think on those lines. Are we to accept the policy that Australia, without -having a voice in the matter, must go to war when the Prime Minister of Great Britain makes a blunder or wants to fan the flames of jingoism so that he may throw a smoke screen over the peopje and keep in power, or because Prance or some other country is anxious to start a war not worth the firing of a shot or the spending of a shilling? If the honourable member for Kooyong and thc Prime Minister go to their electorates and promulgate those principles on the platform, bh&y will not come back again to this House. people of Australia would nob stand for such a policy. The proper sentiment of the people is interpreted by honourable members of the Labour party. I rose to put my position right because of a statement about a speech I made at Goulburn. WhatI have said here to-night, I said at Goulburn, and, if I have the breath, will repeat on many platforms in Australia before the next election. gah) [9.53] -The speeches of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), the lin), and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) have brought me to my feet. They have made it perfectly clear that they think if the British Empire is involved in war, our people may please themselves whether Australia takes part in it cr not. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) has properly shown thab when the British Empire is involved in war, Australia as a part of the Empire is legally at war. Of course, it rests with U3 to say what action we shall take, and to what extent, if any, we may participate in any conflict; bfit we cannot consider ourselves in or out of the war just as we please. When the Empire is ab war we are ab war. The honourable member for Werriwa says that we should not be brought in if the Prime Minister of blunder just as he may have done at the time Great Britain was nearly involved in a war with Turkey. What would have been the position of Australia if we had considered that the Prime Miuister of Greab Britain had made a stupid blunder in taking part in tbu last great war? Could we have taken no p a r t ) Had we stayed out of the conflict, the result might have been very different from what it was. Instead of being a victory for us it might have been a great disaster to the world. In all probability the 300,000 odd men who went from Australia had a great deal to do with turning that war into a victory instead of a disastrous defeat. The honourable member for Werriwa has challenged the Prime Minister and others on this side of the House to go upon the platform and pronounce such views as those uttered by the honourable member for Kooyong to-night. I am prepared to The do so. If the Empire is at w a r I do not care what the cause of the quarrel may be, or who created it-we , as an integral part of the British Empire, are at war, and must take our part in it . Despite the opinions of honourable members opposite, there are hundreds of thousands of splendid fellows in Australia who would rally to the banner when bhe bugle sounded, and help bo fight the Empire's battles, no matter where they were, or what the cause of the war might be. Great Britain has sons in distant parts of the Empire who will always rally to the standard when the Empire is at war. On the occasion when we were nearly involved with Turkey, the cablegrams appeared in the evening papers, and at 6 o'clock on the following morning there were scores of that young fellows at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, who came to the officer there and said, ""Digger, where do we enlist?"" Thc people of Australia are as. ready now as they were at the commencement of the last war to rally to the standard. It would be a terrible thing if we went back on"" those comrades of ours who during the Great War laid down bheir lives; but that is exactly what we should be doing if we were to desert the Empire for which they sacrificed their lives. We should be traitors to those men who did such magnificent service for the Empire and made a name for themselves that will never die in its history I am speaking of the men in the ranks. I am grateful to the AusGreat Britain makes a stupid tralian boys for the magnificent bravery they displayed and for their loyal cooperation with those in authority over",59,Treaty With Turkey

Tbe sands of the desert, the arid slopes of Gallipoli, and all the other theatres of war, were saturated with the blood of the men of Australia, and we should: be traitors to the 60,000 who laid down tlieir lives if now we said, "" Let the -That statement is not in order, and Empire go; what do we care about it ? If the Prime Minister inEngland makes a stupid mistake, we shall desert the Empire. We shall have nothing to clo with any Empire war."" I suppose honourable members would suggest that we are to have some sort of Monroe doctrine to prevent Australia from being embroiled in any war. Other people would have a say as to that. The fact that we might not be willing to take part in an Empire war would not. render us immune from attack. Those who would be warring against Great Britain would assail the Empire in its most vulnerable part, and if Australia was not in. a position to repel an attack it would be the place attacked. I do not wonder now that honourable members opposite remained silent when the Prime Minister asked them to declare themselves upon the Imnerial Conference resolutions. where they stood., but now we see that they really wish to be outside the Empire. They declare that.if the Empire goes to war they do not want to take part in it . As a matter of fact that was the attitude they assumed during the Great War, and if they had had their way no soldiers would have been sent from Australia, to help to defend the Empire. My proof for that assertion is to be found in the resolutions of the Perth Conference and the resolution carried at the Brisbane Conference, declaring that the Labour party were for peace. said, "" we are for peace. must go overseas; no one must fight for the Empire."" So long as we are under the protection of the British Empire and of the noblest Fleet that ever rode the ocean, we are secure; but once Ave get out of that Empire we are the prey to any hawk that may dart from the sky, and there are many of them ready to swoop down on Australia, the richest possession of the British Empire. Honourable members opposite have declared themselves. They are against the .Empire. We are for the Empire. I did not intend to speak on this matter to-night, but I must say something in reply to the honourable gentleman who has just addressed the House. he was talking. must be Avithdrawn. have just heard from the honourable member for Warringah Shire designation. must be referred to by the name of the electoral division which they represent. apologize to the honourable gentleman. There was no need for him to make the speech he has made, and to lecture honourable members on this side. This party was in power Avhen the Avar took place, and did not hesitate to take part in it. All the honourable gentleman's flowery talk about Avhat Ave stand for goes by the board Avhen Ave remember Avhat the Labour party did during the Avar. We Thev dared not declare were free then, as Ave desire to be free, if there is another Avar. I hope that another Avar will never take place, but if there is another war, it Avill be our duty to use our common sense in regard to it, and this Parliament must have the right to decide whether Australia Avill go into the Avar or not. According to tiie reasoning of the honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie), Ave haAe no say in the r matter. The honourable member talks of what is due to Australians Avho took part in the last Avar. I should like to know "" Yes,"" they what he thinks of the Prime Minister, Not a man and the action for Avhich he Avas responsible. The honourable gentleman did his duty in the war, and because he did, he was displaced from the Ministry for a man who never went overseas. The same thing occurred in the case of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks). As a gallant seaman, that honourable member went to sea to fight the battles of the Empire, and yet he was put out of this great composite loyal Cabinet, which professes to be ready to do everything to help the Empire. It did not recognise the Avar services of men who were in the last Cabinet, but replaced them by men Avho did nothing in the late war. The same kind of thing has occurred in",60,Treaty With Turkey

Do honourable members mean to say that if another war took place those men are going to run to the standard at ""six o'clock in the morning""? I can assure the honourable member for Warringah that if it were announced that there was going to be a dog fight, at 5 o'clock in the morntricity which has suddenly developed in ing, there would be crowds found running to see it. Because a few hundred men get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to do a certain thing, it does not follow that they represent the views of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. make no bones at all about saying that so far as I am concerned, as a representative of the people in this House, I shall insist that this Parliament has a right to say whether this country shall take ""part in any war. wealth is groaning under taxation due to thc last war, and what is the Government doing to lighten its burden? Every time a war loan has to be paid off, our taxation must be increased. patriotism of the men who lent us money when they will agree to renew their bonds only on the payment of an additional 1 per cent, interest? I dread to think what' the future of this country is going to be, in view of the heavy load of taxation upon the shoulders of our people. The honourable member for Warringah says thab, because Australia is part of the Empire, this Parliament is not to protect the taxpayers of the country, but must take part in a war in which Britain is engaged whether it be right or wrong. That is against common' sense. The public men of this country have a right to shoulder their responsibility should the occasion arise, and not leave our entry inbo a war to the decision of the British Parliament. The members of the Imperial Parliament have a right to protect their country; and let honourable members opposite make no mistake about the fact that we will protect this country. This party stands for the protection of every soul in the Commonwealth, and will be prepared to take the necessary steps for the purpose. We on this side, however, are not prepared to shut our eyes, and blindly to follow the dictates of another Parliament. I do not endorse the statement that if Britain is [15] at war we also are at war. If Britain is engaged in war for a just cause, we will be with her; but, if the cause is not a just one, we shall claim the right to say whether we will take part in the war or not. We have been living in such a placid atmosphere all bhe afternoon that I have been pained and surprised by the electhis. Chamber, during the consideration of a peace measure. I never would have thought, when listening to the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse),. that we were sosoon and so unexpectedly to hear the rattling of the sabre and the I faint echo of Prussianism which emanated from the honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) a few minutes ago. I did not intend to speak upon this peaceful matter. Everything seemed to be going so well. Our policy of masterly The Commonsilence was proceeding so successfully that it seemed to me that I could pursue it at least until the end of bhis period of the present session. I listened to the honourable member for Calare during his interWhere is the esting and pacific address. I listened to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) introducing this subject, in the tone of a curate* just about to pronounce the benediction. I was sinking pleasantly into a half-doze while all this was going on, when we were suddenly aroused and precipitated into an important debate on our Imperial relations, which I thought had been definitely settled by our silence last week. As this matter has been so precipitated upon us, I shall say about half-a-dozen words on the subject, unaccustomed as I am, after my long silence, to public speaking. The honourable member for Warringah has made a most unexpected and eloquent address about persons who got up at about the same time as he is accustomed to go to bed, and other matters. He has assured us that, whether on the field of battle, in the prize-ring, or anywhere else, if any one suggests "" sboush "" he will meeb him on terms of his own choosing and in a place of his own choosing. He says that if Britain declares war we are at war, because we are a part of the British Empire. I say that, if we are part of the British Empire, Britain is also a part of that Empire, and if we declare war Britain is, ipso facto, at war.

We should be recreant to our trust weakly submitted ourselves, against our better judgment, to the judgment and passions of unreasoning men, who are less than unworthy of the trust reposed in them by the people, or to other men inflamed with the jingo spirit, caught up by the mad and foolish passions which, in other days, urged the people to> further bloodshed. When I , in this House and elsewhere, have ventured to say a word or two expressing my opinions, so that I might not be a mere cipher at a critical time, men like the honourable member have sought to hound me from public life, and have accused me of insincerity and want of loyalty. Now we are told that Australia should have no voice in determining whether this tragedy should be repeated ; that we should listen to the voice from across the water, whether the voice of Macdonald, the pacifist, or of Lloyd George, the jingo and war-maker; that we should put our ear to the ground to find out what men are saying in the British Parliament. In matters of sentiment, iu the drinking of toasts aud the waving of flags, Ave are a nation, but in those things Avhich affect the very life-blood of the people, and which might save or damn the lives of the manhood of this country, we are to be speechless. We are to follow the honourable member for Warringah, whose one doctrine is, not only "" My country, right or Avrong,"" but also ""-Britain, right or wrong,"" and "" A British Prime Minister, whether fool or wise man, right or wrong."" The honourable member for Batman( Mr warned the people of Great Britain about Brennan) has been most eloquent, as usual, and Ave always listen to what he has to say. But to what does it all amount?

Arc we to lie in bed when the Empire is threatened? The Opposition are now discussing the position of Australia as an integral part of the Empire.

It does not matter to me one iota whether it is a legal fact or a legal fiction, as suggested by the honourable member for Batman, that Great Britain, being at war, every other part of the British Empire is at war. The honourable member for Batman knows that a legal fiction is very often an intensely real thing. The important fact affecting Australia is that' the country with which Great Britain is at war will regard Australia as beiug in it, too. deliberate war of aggression. We might meet here in the Federal Parliament and pass a dozen resolutions to the effect that Australia was not at war, yet I contend that the country with I am dealing with whom Great Britain was at war would say: ""A fig for your resolutions!

Let us suppose that some cause for quarrel emerged between Great Britain and Japan, and they were in a state of war. member want war? war were existing between those two countries, and we said, "" We do not Believe Great Britain is in the right in this matter, and we are going to stand out,"" what would be Japan's reply ? It would be this: "" It ' m a y suit you to stand out just now, but next time it may suit you to take part in the war, so we shall regard you as standing alongside of Great Britain and as part of the British Empire."" There is no escape from that position. Just as we accept every benefit and every privilege that accrues from our association with Great Britain, and with our sister Dominions that form the Empire, so we must face their responsibilities, and, if the Empire gets The honourable into trouble, take part in it as one of the obligations attaching to us. This position will always obtain >ntil we have, as it is contended we ought to have, some say in discussing Britain'. foreign policy, making it less possible for the British Prime Minister to make ""foolish mistakes.""

He has not only converted himself, but if the gallant general opposite ( Sir Granville Ryrie) had listened attentively he, too, would [16] have been converted. The honourable member for Fawkner, in his opening remarks, practically accused the honourable member for Batman of being a disloyalist, to an extreme degree, for advocating something which he himself advocated before resuming his seat. He so completely looped the loop during the discussion that he found himself in hearty agreement with the honourable member whom he accused of disloyalty. The honourable member for Fawkner agrees with the contention that has been repeatedly advanced by the members on this side of the House, that the doctrine of being "" all in a war, right or wrong,"" is an immoral one. He concluded his speech by practically saying that there was no difference between us. cause might be so immoral that we could not possibly stand by it . sure that if the debate lasts long enough, the honourable member will turn another That is the somersault, and I should not like that to happen.

I leave the conversion of the other side in the capable hands of the honourable member for Fawkner.

During the war the Labour party stood for peace by negotiation, and it was by negotiation that peace was ultimately brought about.

Why then does the Prime Minister keep this Treaty in his despatch box, and ask the House to be content with his statement of what the document contains ? I object to the confirmation of treaties of which we have not a complete knowledge. have said that Australia is not to have complete self-determination in regard to participation in wars. I suppose that applies also to wars precipitated by Canada or any other Dominion. If , for instance, Goneral Smuts involved South Africa in a war with the coloured races, would Australia be necessarily involved? That would be neither logical nor reasonable; indeed, it would be an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people. There is no more educated democracy in any part of the world than the people of Australia, and I , as a representative of the intelligent people of East Sydney, protest against their being deprived of the opportunity of exercising their independent judgment and displaying their loyalty, as they have done on other occasions. When a change of Government takes place, and that will happen very soon, honourable members will not be treated with the discourtesy which has been shown by the Government to-night. Nor will the people of Australia be treated as mere creatures who are not worthy of consideration. I take no notice of the Prime Minister's discourtesy to rae personally, but I represent 42,000 people in East Sydney, and he has no He ,also made right to ignore them. The seriousness of this Treaty has been emphasized by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), who said, in effect, that Australia would necessarily be involved in any war precipitated by any unprincipled creature who happened to be in power in Great Britain, and the honorHughes) seemed to appreciate that interpretation. The people of Australia will not thank those honourable members for such an unflattering declaration of Australia's position. I ask the Prime Minister to give members of the House an opportunity to peruse the Treaty. I refuse to vote in the dark on a matter that I have not had an opportunity to understand. Do honourable members forget that they hold in their hands the destiny of Australia? Is the subject not sufficiently serious to require that honourable members shall be informed of the contents of the' document? I asked the Prime Minister what penalty was provided for a violation of the Treaty. He would not even answer me. He treated mc with contempt. Some honourable members SurelyI have a right to ask that question, and to receive an answer. As long as I have breath in my body T shall stand here, as a representative of the people, and use all the privileges of this House to try and make the Prime Miuister and those who follow him realize their responsibilities. I shall not dwell upon the question whether we are, or are not, part of the Empire. I fought hard for Federation without fee or reward years ago. I spent many nights in that struggle when I ought to have been at home studying my health It did not do me much harm, I admit. I did that becauso I felt that the consummation of Federation would make me a proud man, and would improve the lot of my offspring and the grandchildren that would naturally follow.

That is why I asked the Prime Minister whether penalties we're provided for breaches of the Treaty. is Treaty has been before this Parliament, and we should delve into it and see what our responsibilities are under it . It may not but through their callous indifference to their responsibilities it may affect their offspring very seriously. The Treaty more closely concerns Australia than Canada or Africa, The Canadians will not have anything to do with it . I would move heaven and earth to piomotc peace, but I will not allow anything to pass this House without ascertaining what is in it . I do not see why my intelligence should be insulted because I protest against the Prime Minister not disclosing the contents of this Treaty. found it necessary to devote time to much smaller matters.

Notwithstanding its possibilities, honourable members are expected to ratify it without knowing anything about its provisions. As a Parliament we have been doing nothing for nearly eight months.

I am satisfied that the people of Australia w ill be in hearty accord with what I havo said to-night. Honourable members are not thoroughly conversant with the provisions of the Treaty. Tonight we had thc honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell) firing shots at each other. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham) also had something to Bay about the Empire. Apparently, they take the This House has view that we ought not to regard this matter of treaties too seriously. ' I do, and I take f u l l responsibility for all I have said.

With regard to the manner in which the Treaty has been presented to the Bouse, I think the honourable member for East Sydney is under a misapprehension. The Treaty was signed as long ago as July last, and its terms have been -well known for many months. Further, it was the subject of a very long explanation by the Foreign Secretary at the Imperial Conference. That explanation was published at the time. Therefore, the facts with regard to the Treaty arc well known. We are now only asking for its ratification by the adoption of a niotion for the printing of thc document. .

It is most important that the Treaty should be ratified unanimously by this House.
