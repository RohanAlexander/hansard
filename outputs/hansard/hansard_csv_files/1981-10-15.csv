There are the immediate needs of Australian sheep industry has developed to meet Kingsford-Smith Airport to meet the growing this trade. There has not been a transfer within traffic and, as the Major Airport Needs of Sydney the Australian community from live sheep to cold study indicated, there may be a need for a second killed sheep.
