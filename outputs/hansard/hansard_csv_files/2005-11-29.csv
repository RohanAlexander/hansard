Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Did the department or any agency under the Minister’s portfolio engage the services of a public relations, public affairs or media management consultancy in 2004; if so, what was the (a) purpose and (b) cost of each engagement. (2) What was the name and postal address of each company engaged for these purposes. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following information to the honourable member’s question: This information is published in Defence’s annual report. The first half of 2004 is published in the annual report for 2003-04 and the second half is published in the annual report for 2004-05. National Security (Question No. 2190) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) Is he aware of an incident at Adelaide Airport on 16 July 2005 in which passengers arriving from Singapore identified a suspicious suitcase left on the baggage turnstile and making an unusual noise. (2) Can he explain why it took security at Adelaide Airport more than half an hour to determine who was responsible for the suspicious suitcase and what should be done with it. (3) Are there security procedures in place for dealing with suspicious packages at Australian airports; if so, were they followed for this incident. (1) Yes. (2) I understand that correct procedures were followed, and that the response times were appropriate to the nature of this event. (3) Yes. Consultancy Services (Question No. 2214) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 5 September 2005: (1) Did the Department of Health and Ageing engage PSI Consulting to prepare and manage an open tender process to select a supplier of media monitoring and release distribution at a cost of $25,000; if so, why was it considered necessary to engage this consultant. (2) Why have departmental staff not received adequate training on preparing open tenders. (3) What services are being provided by PSI Consulting under the terms of this contract. (1) Yes. The purchasing of media monitoring and release distribution services is a high value and complex procurement. PSI Consulting is a specialist procurement and tender management consultancy. In the new procurement environment following the implementation of the revised Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs) the department engaged specialist services because the evaluation of the tenders was potentially a complex process. (2) The department provides a range of internal and external (including formally accredited) procurement training opportunities for staff. However, in cases where the procurement is high value (and therefore potentially high risk), the department can seek outside professional advice and assistance. (3) PSI Consulting is providing the following services under the terms of this contract: preparation and distribution of request for tender documentation to attract an eligible field of tenderers; assistance with initial review and shortlisting of responses; assistance with evaluation of shortlisted tenders; preparation of the final evaluation report, including recommendation of a preferred tenderer; preparation and distribution of correspondence to notify tenderers of the outcome; and maintenance of all correspondence related to the process, including notes and minutes of meetings and deliberations.",125,Business
237,Mr Truss,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,134,Questions In Writing
238,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Offshore Agents (Question No. 2229) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 5 September 2005: (1) Which Acts and Regulations apply to Offshore Agents issued with an Offshore Agent ID Number referred to in question 9 of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) Form 956, Appointment of a migration agent, and the information that accompanied this form. (2) Are Offshore Agents required to undertake at least 10 Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points per year in order to hold an Offshore Agent ID Number. (3) Are offshore Agents required to register with the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) as Offshore Agents. (4) What educational and other requirements must applicants meet in order to be granted an Offshore Agent ID Number, are these requirements the same as those prescribed for onshore registered migration agents and, if the requirements for onshore and offshore agents are not the same, what are the differences. (5) Are Offshore Migration Agents who hold an Offshore Agent ID Number required to warn prospective clients that the requirements that they must meet and the regulation of their services are different from those applying to registered migration agents in Australia; if not, why not. (6) Can a person who is the holder of an Offshore Agent ID Number give migration assistance and represent applicants for migration; if so, what powers does DIMIA have to regulate the quality of the work they undertake. (7) Are persons holding Offshore Agent ID’s subject to the MARA Code of Conduct; if so, how can the Minister be sure that Offshore Agents abide by the code. (8) Is the regulatory regime governing the conduct of Offshore Agents holding Offshore Agent ID’s the same as that for registered migration agents in Australia; if so, how is it enforced ; if not, why not. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Agents operating offshore, who are not also registered by the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA), are not currently subject to legislation-based regulatory arrangements. Offshore agents issued with offshore Agent ID numbers are mainly education agents whom DIMIA and Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) have been dealing with for many years. Providing these agents with an Agent ID number, logon and password enables them to more readily lodge Student visa applications over the Internet and for DIMIA to better monitor their activities. This initiative is strongly supported by Australia’s international education export industry, as it gives us a significant competitive edge. (2) Agents operating offshore who are not Australian citizens or holders of an Australian permanent visa are barred, at this stage, from being registered by the MARA, and consequently are not required to undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD) activities. They are, however, required to attend training run by DIMIA on a range of issues associated with Student visas. (3) No. Offshore agents are generally not eligible, at this stage, to register with the MARA as outlined above. (4) The requirements for registration with the MARA are different to the Department’s arrangements for allocating offshore agents an ID number to access eVisa facilities. Offshore agents given access to the Department’s online lodgement trial for AL2-4 Student visas are allocated a 7-digit Agent ID Number, as well as a Logon ID and password, to link the agent to the electronic applications which he or she lodges on behalf of a client. This helps to better identify, monitor and ensure the integrity of visa processing of applications from such agents. These agents are vetted by the Department when they seek eVisa access. They must also: comply with government regulations and registration requirements in the country of lodgement (for example, the Peoples’ Republic of China has its own agent registration requirements); have a sufficient volume of applications and a good record of lodging complete applications; sign access agreements that define acceptable standards of performance and conduct and sanctions for not abiding by these; and receive training prior to having their access granted. The Department is working closely with DEST to develop a training course for offshore agents specialising in Student visas. It is anticipated that the course will be piloted in both late 2005 and early 2006 and become available online around mid-2006. Access to the online course would be free, however, a fee would be charged for assessing whether the agent had met the requirements to pass the two modules. The course has been developed to meet the Australian Qualifications Framework standards. (5) Education agents overseas have been assisting potential overseas students to lodge Student visa applications since the late 1980s. While these agents may be subject to registration arrangements in their own countries, they are not subject to Australian legislation. Overseas agents given an ID number and access to the AL2-4 eVisa trial are, under the Code in their Agreement, required to act professionally, maintain a sound knowledge of Student visa eligibility and inform their clients of the eVisa application charge and the agent’s fee for services. They must also ensure that the fee for services is reasonable. Requiring these overseas agents to explain that they are not subject to regulation by the MARA, but are subject to an administrative agreement with DIMIA, would serve no useful purpose given that, at this stage, these agents cannot be compelled to be subject to MARA regulation. (6) Agents who give immigration assistance or advice offshore are generally not subject, at this stage, to regulation by the MARA. The only exceptions are MARA-registered agents who work overseas. (7) Only MARA-registered agents are subject to the MARA’s Code of Conduct. As very few MARAregistered agents work overseas, most offshore agents are not subject to the MARA Code. As a first step towards improving consumer protection from unscrupulous overseas agents, agents participating in the AL2-4 Student eVisa trial are required to abide by an administrative Code of Conduct in order to retain access to online lodgement. Governments in some countries also regulate agents. (8) See answer to part (7). Mr Irfan Yusuf (Question No. 2279) Mr Danby asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 6 September 2005: (1) Has he seen allegations by Mr Irfan Yusuf, a former Liberal Party federal election candidate, that Islamic organisations are distributing the notorious anti-Semitic forgery, The Protocols of the learned Elders of Zion, to Islamic youth in Sydney. (2) Has he seen further allegations by Mr Yusuf that copies of the Protocols are being supplied to Islamic organisations by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia. (3) What steps is he taking to ascertain the truth of these allegations and what steps will he take to prevent the importation or circulation of material such as the Protocols which is fraudulent, defamatory, inflammatory and designed to foment racial and religious hatred. (1) Yes. I am aware of Mr Yusuf’s statements to media outlets. AlthoughI note the allegations by Mr Yusuf relate to an incident in 1985 in which he claims that he and other attendees at an Islamic camp organised by the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils were provided with copies of ‘The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.’ (2) Yes. I have seen a statement made by Mr Yusuf to Radio National on 28 August 2005 that he received a copy of the book ‘The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion’. I am aware Mr Yusuf further alleged the book had a stamp of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils on the inside cover and that the book was a gift from the Saudi Embassy. I note this allegation also relates to activities in 1985. (3) The Australian Federal Police has not received any complaints or allegations regarding ‘The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion’ since 1997. A strong criminal legislative framework already exists at a federal level. Mr Danby would be aware that the Australian Government is introducing a range of measures to improve the national security framework, including a new offence against inciting violence. Inciting a person to commit any criminal offence is an offence in its own right under section 11.4 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In order to address situation in which statements aimed at the naïve and impressionable may incite criminal activity or terrorist acts, the Government has modernised the offence of sedition in sections 24A to 24F of the Crimes Act. These offences cover a person who engages in a ‘seditious enterprise’ with the intention of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance, or who writes, prints, utters or publishes any seditious words with the intention of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance. The new offence will address problems with those who incite directly against other groups within our community, including against Australia’s forces overseas and in support of Australia’s enemies. There is a good faith defence where the communication is merely about criticising government policy. In addition, ASIO has said publicly that it works closely with police services in relation to threats to Israeli and Jewish interest and maintains regular contact with representatives of the Jewish community. ASIO also maintains regular contact with the Muslim community leaders and works closely with police services in connection with threats to the Muslim community. Mr Danby would also be aware that the Australian Government is introducing a range of measures to improve the national security framework, including a new offence against inciting violence. Possible alternative measures available to deal with this material include prohibition as racial vilification under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, or the involvement of the Australian Federal Police where criminal conduct is alleged. An application for classification of a publication may be made for law enforcement purposes, under section 22A of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. I am advised that no application for classification has been made for this publication. Accordingly, no comment can be made on the appropriate classification of this book. If it were to be submitted, its classification would be a matter for the Classification Board. The Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975 prohibits racial vilification on the basis of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin (‘offensive behaviour based on racial hatred’). Racial vilification covers acts that offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a person or groups of people. The prohibition is subject to a number of exemptions which are intended to ensure that debate can occur freely in respect of matters of legitimate public interest. Complaints of racial vilification may be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Racial Discrimination Act",134,Questions In Writing
239,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:1975 does not cover criminal conduct. Any allegations of criminal conduct should be referred to the Australian Federal Police. Most importantly, it must be remembered that the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly are fundamental human rights that are enjoyed by all Australians. These rights are subject to limitations that are reasonable and necessary in a free and democratic society to achieve an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the protection of groups and individuals from offensive behaviour. Medicare Safety Net Threshold (Question No. 2321) Ms George asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 6 September 2005: (1) How many (a) individuals and (b) families in the electoral division of Throsby registered for the Medicare Safety Net in (i) 2003 and (ii) 2004. (2) How many (a) individuals and (b) families in the electoral division of Throsby reached the Medicare Safety Net threshold in (i) 2003 and (ii) 2004. The most recently published statistics on families registered for the Extended Medicare Safety Net, by electoral division are as at 29 August 2004. The most recently published statistics on individuals and families who have reached Extended Medicare Safety Net thresholds, by electoral division have regard to claims processed by Medicare Australia up to and including 31 July 2004. (1) (a) Individuals do not register for Medicare Safety Net purposes. If an individual is not part of a registered family for Safety Net purposes, Medicare Australia determines that person’s eligibility for Safety Net benefits on an on-going claim basis, having regard to the relevant threshold for a ‘single’. (b) The number of families that were registered for the Medicare Safety Net at 29 August 2004, in the electoral division of Throsby, was 21,856. (2) (a) The number of individuals who appear to have reached the Medicare Safety Net threshold (based on substantiated and unsubstantiated claims) up to 31 July 2004 in the electoral division of Throsby was 179. (b) The number of families who appear to have reached the Medicare Safety Net threshold (based on substantiated and unsubstantiated claims) up to 31 July 2004 in the electoral division of Throsby was 797. These families comprised 2,637 persons. --------Notes to the Data: The statistics were compiled from postcode level data (postcode of the head of the household, otherwise postcode of the oldest member of the family) and are based on 2001 electorate boundaries. Where a postcode overlapped electorate boundaries, statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags is excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance files. Where families and individuals do not pay the total fee charged by the doctor prior to submitting their account to Medicare for reimbursement through a pay doctor cheque, Medicare Australia is unable to verify that the total charge has been paid for safety net purposes. This is regarded as an unsubstantiated claim. Proof of payment of the full amount charged results in a substantiated claim. The statistics on",137,Questions In Writing

Australia is concerned about proposals for the premature implementation of a moratorium on bottom trawling without a robust legal framework, supporting science and compliance mechanisms; and without the commitment by all nations to its implementation. Australia co-sponsored in November 2004 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution on Fisheries calling for urgent action on a case by case and scientific basis, by States and responsible organisations to address impacts on vulnerable high seas ecosystems such as sea mounts from destructive practices like bottom trawling. Australia also co-sponsored the UNGA Resolution on Oceans and Law of the Sea in 2004, in which the UNGA resolved to set up an “UN Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction” with a major intergovernmental meeting planned for 2006. Australia intends to play an active role in this important working group and intergovernmental meeting.

A Schedule of Lettings including the organisations, accommodation categories and site locations is attached. (3) CSIRO’s facilities in many instances are specialised and comparable commercial rentals often do not exist. CSIRO Corporate Property negotiates rentals with proposed tenants and such rentals are based on comparable commercial rentals (where they exist); rental assessments by valuers and / or consultation with the property industry; return on value of facility; and awareness/evaluation of other lettings by other institutions. (4) CSIRO Corporate Property negotiates rentals with proposed tenants and such rentals are based on comparable commercial rentals (where they exist); rental assessments by valuers and / or consultation with the property industry; return on value of facility; and awareness/evaluation of other lettings by other institutions. The ongoing rentals are periodically reviewed. Short term agreements, (e.g. up to five years) will often contain a CPI or fixed percentage rental increase component. Longer term arrangements will have a market / negotiated rental review with the process involving a reassessment of the rental undertaken, consistent with the process of assessing the rental at the commencement of the agreement. (5) See answer to question (2). CSIRO Corporate Property has an agreement with each tenant and these agreements are under separate confidential contracts. (6) No commercial benchmarks apply to the letting of research facilities. The Australian Government has a property framework that sets various benchmarks by which CSIRO abides.

246,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Australian National Training Authority did not engage Writebusiness to edit the Authority’s annual report. However, the Department of Education Science and Training engaged the firm Writebusiness to work on the Australian National Training Authority’s Report on Operations 2004-05 and the Annual National Report 2004 at a total cost of $22,951. This work included 150 hours of editing and proofreading (three revisions of 233 pages), as well as the development of the Table of Contents and Indices for both reports, liaison with the designer, the printer, the auditors and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. The Department engaged an outside firm to undertake the work as this was the most cost-effective option. The principal of Writebusiness who undertook the project had extensive experience with this type of work and also had a thorough knowledge of the work of the Australian National Training Authority.

(2) How many courses of antiviral drugs will the Government be providing to the World Health Organization (WHO). (3) What is the rate of production of antiviral drugs in Australia. (4) What measures has the Government taken to increase the number of antiviral drug doses in the stockpile. (5) When will the Government distribute warnings to the Australian population about the risks of bird flu similar to those already sent out about drugs and terrorism. (1) The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is currently preparing a list of Australian technical experts who could be called upon to assist with communicable disease outbreaks such as avian influenza in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, Australia has proposed the establishment of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) regional register of technical experts and other health care workers who could be called upon to respond to avian influenza outbreaks and other health crises. This register would complement the existing register maintained by the World Health Organization as part of their Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which already includes a number of Australian experts in outbreak control. The register proposal was generally supported at the APEC Avian and Pandemic Influenza meeting recently held in Brisbane, and will be raised as an issue at the APEC Leaders meeting in Korea later this month. (2) The Australian Government has provided funding for a total of 50,000 courses of the antiviral medication, Tamiflu, in response to a recent WHO request for Indonesia to help combat avian influenza. The Government has not received any other formal requests from WHO for further antivirals. (3) The Australian Government is not aware of any production of antivirals currently occurring in Australia. However, GlaxoSmithKline Ltd. (GSK) has indicated they intend to resume production of Relenza at their Boronia factory in the near future. (4) The Australian Government has purchased 3.8 million courses of Tamiflu and some stocks of Relenza. Positive discussions are underway with GlaxoSmithKline to boost the stockpile supplies of Relenza (Zanamivir).

Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department, following an open tender process established a panel of external legal service providers comprising (a) Clayton Utz, (b) Mallesons Stephen Jaques, (c) Phillips Fox, (d) Minter Ellison, (e) the Australian Government Solicitor, and (f) Corrs Chambers Westgarth. Each firm has entered into a Deed of Standing Offer, which commenced on 25 July 2005 and continues in force for three years. The Department has the option of extending this Deed for an additional year. The new panel has no fixed value and the Department has made no commitment as to the amount of work (if any) that any panel firm will receive. (2) The nature of the Legal Services required by the entire Department covers the full range and areas of Departmental responsibility. (3) The services provided do not deal with the same or similar issues. The strong reporting requirements in the Deed of Standing Offer ensure that the Chief Legal Counsel (as manager of the Panel) is informed of all legal work undertaken by panel members. (4) Generally the Panel firms will work separately; however, they are required to work collaboratively with the Departments Legal Services Branch to ensure the service is delivered in a timely fashion, is customer focused, is of the highest quality and represents value for money. (5) The outcome of the tender process indicated 3 firms ranked highest with the 4th, 5th and 6th firms ranked equal. A panel of 3 Firms would not effectively deal with possible conflict of interest situations where a number of panel firms cannot act for the Department on a particular matter.
