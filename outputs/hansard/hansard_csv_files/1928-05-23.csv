0,"Platform On Which, The Ministerial Candi","dates were elected, and all honorahle members opposite should support it, because it is in the interests of the trade unionists. ""We have had the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition sighing and -sobbing in the House, and telling us that if the measure becomes law it will ring the death knell of the trade unions. Nothing is further from the thoughts of the Government and its supporters than to do them injury. I take it that the unions will certainly be stamped out of existence if their own members do not make a move in the direction of restoring the old system of control that obtained when the unions were first formed. Personally I have nothing but admiration for the Leader of the Opposition. I realize that he is a fighter. Honourable members on this side are sympathetic towards him with respect to his new oflice, and I notice that that feeling has been expressed by the Melbourne and Sydney press. His ability is undoubted; it has enabled him to work his way to the top. He is at least the nominal leader of his pairty, and in that capacity one would expect him to be an actual leader, instead of practically following the members of his party. Yeti f the views expressed by him with regard to this measure are his own, it is questionable whether he has sufficient authority .to lead his party. On the other hand, if they are not his honest views, it is still doubtful. ber for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that he made a fine speech. like his speeches in this Chamber on other occasions. One thing was lacking, and that was sincerity. Groom) -Order! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that expression. was speaking only in the political sense. unparliamentary, whether used in the political sense or in any other way. use, because I have no wish to hurt the feelings of the honourable member: but he certainly flogged himself into a temper and became red in the face. Eor the first time in my experience, tie losthis temper as the result of one or two interjections by me. This led to my making the remark that I have just been calledupon to withdraw. I do not know whether the honourable member's heart is in his work as leader of his party. He may find his duties hard to fulfil. Possibly when making his speech, he was worried as to who was to be his deputy. Maybe he was driven by outside forces; but it appeared to me, when listening to his remarks on this ""bill, he had not his heart in his task. We have had a succession of bleats and bites from the honourable member for Darling. He surely knows that the statements he made concerning the penalties imposed by this measure were absolutely wrong and consequently misleading. It is indeed pitiful to see a political party which for some years was held in such respect and was able to control unionism in every State at present so far lacking in generalship that there is no immediate hope of it directing those whom it is supposed to represent and lead. The speeches of honourable members opposite strongly suggest that they have the forthcoming general election in view, and in addition to making political capital out of this measure they are also engendering a feeling of bitterness that should not exist. They are trying to fan the flames of discontent and dissatisfaction, and to cause industrial turmoil which will eventually bring about their own downfall, compelling them to remain in the cold shades of opposition. This measure, although it may not be acceptable to a mlitant section of trade unionism, has been introduced for the good of the people as a whole. I believe it will be of advantage to trade unionism generally, and for that reason I intend to give it my hearty support. The big industrial strike at present in progress, which honourable members opposite have referred to as a lockout, is due to the action of a few marine cooks who have refused to work under the terms of an award of the Arbitration Court. Very little effort has been made by honourable members opposite to bring about a settlement of the dispute, which it was stated a few days ago has",20,Setup

Notwithstanding the disastrous effect of this industrial dispute, not only upon those engaged in maritime work, but upon the community generally, honourable members opposite have not made any attempt to bring about a settlement of it. It is the duty of honorexistence. Honourable members opposite able members opposite to tell the men responsible that they are making asses of themselves, and should get back to work. The trouble in this instance, as is the case in most industrial disputes, is that the rank and file are blindly duced the first wages board system into following the advice of their leaders; they seem afraid to speak, and their attitude on this occasion is likely to lead to an extension of the trouble. The ideals of trade unionism to-day are. not what they were at the beginning, or even what they were ten or fifteen years ago. A study of the history of not only Australia, but of England, will show that the workers were once oppressed by being compelled to work long hours for a miserable pittance. Trade unionism then came into existence, not as a result of the efforts of the Labour party, but because the people, becoming more enlightened, had a sympathetic desire to benefit those who were engaged in toil of all description. workers were oppressed; but they are not to-day; indeed the conditions which Australian workers enjoy are better than they are in any other civilized country. Our friends opposite are trying to bring back the conditions which existed in the dark ages. They speak as if they were responsible for all reform; they will not give honourable members on this side any credit. cords, however, will show that all the legislation that has been of benefit to the workers has been introduced by Liberal or National Governments. Was not a Liberal Government responsible for the introduction of the first Factories Act? The principle of an 8-hours day was introduced before the advent of the Labour party. Free education was also introduced before the Labour party came into existence. An extended franchise in the form of one man one vote and adult suffrage was not the work of a Labour Government. Invalid and old-age pensions, conciliation and arbitration legislation and every other reform of benefit to the workers was introduced by a Liberal Government, or at least before the Labour party came into should know that the right of free speech and a free press were established before the days of the Labour party. When the Premier of New South Wales, Sir George Wade, introthe State Parliament it was said that the unions would not register, and that the system was introduced to scotch trades unionism. The bill, however, was passed, and although at the outset only two or three unions registered, others eventually came into line. Notwithstanding this fact it has frequently been stated by members of the party opposite during electioneering campaigns, that the Labour party was responsible for the introduction of the wages board system. During the forthcoming election campaign, our friends opposite will doubtless say that they were responsible for the introduction of a measure providing for secret ballots, means to dispense with overlapping awards, and other improvements in our industrial legislation such as this bill provides. Comparing the wages and conditions which existed a few years ago with those now obtaining trade' unionists have very little for which to fight. Generally speaking workmen to-day are paid decent wages, their hours of work are fixed by the Arbitration Court, and their conditions are so favorable that they have little reason to complain. Trade unionists of days gone by who fought so strongly for an 8-hours day would almost turn in their graves Reference to the reif they knew that many men now worked only 44 hours a week. The principle upon which trade unionism was first established has been departed from, and the institution now exists largely for political purposes. I intend to quote shortly several statements made in America and elsewhere in connection with the relation of politics to trade unionism, and to show that in Australia we are working on",20,Setup
7,Mr Yates,Ho w were they treated?,21,Setup
8,Mr Perkins,"In those dayswrong lines. I Lave. already mentioned that the average worker in Australia to-day is so well paid that there is Australia, and where there is no political very little more for Australian trade unionists to do in endeavouring to improve their conditions. The total amount of wages paid in Australia, where we have approximately 2,500,000 wage earners, amounts to £450,000,000 annually. If that amount were divided equally it would give each £180 per annum. I know that some wage earners are not receiving that amount and some are unemployed, but many are receiving more than £180 per annum. These figures are not mere guesses; they are taken from the report of the Commonwealth Statistician. An increase of Is. per day to the 2,500,000 wage earners of Australia would involve an expenditure of £39,000,000. It must be apparent to everybody that we have reached the point at which our industries cannot afford to pay much higher wages. I do not disapprove of the policy of paying high wages. A country that pays low wages is, generally speaking, a poor country. Our wages should be as high as our industries can reasonably afford to pay. That is the general opinion of honourable members on this side of the chamber. ciency. believe that Australians are efficient workmen, although some do not work honestly. The country will always have to carry them. It is often said that before wages can be increased we must increase our production. During the last ten years the average output of the American workman has been increased by 22 per cent., while the increase in Australia has been only 2 per cent. In such circumstances increases in wages should not be expected. The contention of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) that wage increases which the workers have received during the last ten years have been of little use to them because the purchasing power of money has decreased so greatly is probably quite sound. It is deplorable that that is so. Buti t makes it more apparent than ever that we shall have to increase our output greatly before we can effectively increase wages. In the United States of America, where the trade union movement does not threaten the general public as it does in Labour party such as we have here, wages are higher than in Australia, and in many respects working hours and conditions are just as good. There can be no doubt that the trade unionists of Australia will have to be brought to their senses. I agree with honourable members opposite who have said that we have fewer strikes in Australia than they have in Great Britain, but our wages and working conditions are so much superior to those of Great Britain that our workers have no need to strike. The cooks' strike, which is at present dislocating our shipping industry, is a ridiculous affair, and the great bulk of our trade unionists are opposed to it. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite, who profess to represent the workers, do not openly condemn it during this debate that honourable members opposite represent more workers that we do. Why do they not stop the strike? best, but we have not captured the trade union movement like our friends opposite. It has been stated that more than I 800,000 trade unionists in Australia are out of sympathy with the present strike; yet the political Labour party appears to be afraid to condemn it. The engineers' strike, which occurred some time ago, was another extremely foolish attempt to dislocate industry. The engineers refused to accept the principle of payment by results. Yet the shearers of Australia have been working on that principle for. many years, and would strongly resist any attempt to abolish it. The shearers are members of one of the most important trade unions in Australia, and they are an intelligent body of men. The foolish conduct of many trade unions in Australia is bringing industrial arbitration into serious disfavour. Honourable members opposite, in the course of this debate, have quoted from a pamphlet issued by the Metal Trades Employers Association of New South Wales. I also intend to quote from it, but I shall go further than honourable",21,Setup

The following is an extract from the presidential address delivered to the metal trades conference by Mr John Heine, juniorAs our association has now decided to advocate the abolition of compulsory arbitration, we have no anxiety to see the Federal Government proceed any further in the manner suggested in the proposed amendment. our opinion this amending bill will only aggravate the strife, bitterness and troubles prevailing at the present time. It will be seen, therefore, that the metal trades employers are not only opposed to this bill, but also to the whole system of industrial arbitration. Dealing with the bill, Mr Heine, in ""the same address, saidIt is claimed for the bill that its penal clauses will have a correcting influence on union leaders, but we would point out that the court is already possessed of powers which it refuses to exercise, and one cannot, therefore, understand what benefit is likely to be obtained by additional powers. We are now opposed to the prosecution of employees for breaches of industrial awards. In the past we have instituted proceedings against individuals and unions for breaches of the award, for the reason that it was the only constitutional remedy that was available to u9. At the same time the practice was repugnant to us, and we are now reluctant to move any further in tliat direction. Wc were under the impression tliat the Government desired to protect and uphold its awards, and acting on that belief, we were compelled to initiate proceedings, with the honest conviction that we were acting as a bulwark between the revolutionary elements of the community and our Government. It has been made quite apparent that the court is reluctant to proceed with any prosecution against employees, and we join with them in that reluctance, for from past experience we are quite convinced that there is little hope of securing industrial peace by prosecutions. bers are opposed to industrial arbitration. any who have spoken during this debate say so; though I know that many employers in Australia are sick and tired of the system, for they realize that it has not done either them or their employees any good. Nevertheless I agree with the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that the system has been beneficial, and that many of the awards and agreements made under it have been honored by both sides. Although we have fewer strikes than other countries, we have too many of them. Wages and working conditions are so good in Australia that there is no justification for striking. At one time, the sympathy of the great majority of people was with the strikers, when only by ceasing work could they remedy injustices ; but to-day there is no excuse for In strikes in Australia. Honourable members opposite could do much to prevent strikes and to promote industrial peace; but, instead, they adopt a policy of silence. This bill is the outcome of many years' experience of arbitration legislation. If it fails, the whole system of arbitration fails with it. effect of a, charge of dynamite on industry. are some employers who desire to abolish arbitration as a means of settling industrial disputes, but among employers generally there is no great desire to abolish the system so long as the awards of the courts are faithfully obeyed. Industries which have found it difficult to carry on have been assisted by the Government in the direction of increased protective duties; but they cannot for ever expect to receive assistance from that .source. Some other remedy must be found. The industrial delegation which recently visited the United States of America reported on its return that .the American workers, although not better than the Australian workers, are assisted to a much greater extent by modern machinery and electric power. More could be done in that direction in Australia. Workers in the United States bf America receive more for their labour than do their fellow workers in Australia, because in that country piece-work rates apply in many industries, and they are free from political control. The result is that the standard of living in the United States of America is higher than it is in Australia, notwithstanding the boast of honourable members opposite that the trade union movement in this country has made the lot of the Australian worker better than that of the workers of any other country. This bill will prevent overlapping awards which cause so much trouble to-day. Surely honourable members",22,Setup

Contradictory awards cause a great deal of the trouble which exists in industry. Eor that trouble the system of arbitration is sometimes wrongly blamed. As the Government's referendum proposals which were recently submitted to the people were defeated, it can only introduce what the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) described as ""patch-work legislation."" No one likes legislation of that character, but to give even the measure of improvement contained in this bill is better than to allow things to remain as they are. The bill is an earnest of the Government's desire to do the best possible with its limited powers. ' Honourable members may be interested in the opinions of prominent men in different countries regarding the political control of trade unions. Mr To promote industrial peace, and by all Samuel Gompers, when president of the American Federation of Labour in 1918, saidThe faet is that an independent political Labour party becomes either radical, so called, or else revolutionary; but it is primarily devoted to one thing, and that is catching votes. ' The question of the conditions of labour, the question of the standards of labour, the questions of the struggles and the sacrifices oflabour to bring light into the lives and the work of the toilers-al l that is subordinated into the one consideration of votes for the party. Every sail is trimmed to the getting of votes. bill is the honourable member discussing? that in opposing this measure merely for party purposes the Labour party is pro'ceeding along wrong lines. non-party attitude the honourable member assumes! who succeeded Mr Samuel Gompers as president of the American Federation of Labour, saidBetween capital and labour there is an interdependence so fixed and irrevocable as to make complete success attainable only through understanding and co-operation. . . . To accept the doctrine that the establishment of right rela'tionship between employers and employees is impossible of attainment means that justice and righteousness have been dethroned, and that instead of refinement through education and the development of a keen, sense of justice and intellect, we still recognize the law of the primitive; the rule of force, where only might makes right. The report of the industrial delegation to the United States of America shows that many of the objects sought by the trade unions of that country have been accomplished. In this connection, the words of Mr Snowden, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Eamsay Macdonald Labour Government in England, are of interest. Mr Snowden saidThe best way to get high wages and high returns for all concerned in industry is to make industry more efficient, and the best results will be obtained only when employers and employees cease to be continually at war and get together for the general good. I agree with Mr Snowden that more has been accomplished by peaceful negotiation than by strikes. One of the rules of the British General Federation of Labour isamicable means, such as conciliation, mediation, references, or by the establishment of permanent boards, to prevent strikes or lockouts between employers and workmen, or disputes between trades or organizations. Where differences do occur to assist in their settlement by just and equitable methods. If a similar rule were adopted in this country the workers would be better off than they are to-day. There is a great contrast between the opinions of the men to whom I have referred and that credited to Mr Lang, the ex-Premier of New South Wales, in a recent issue of The Labour DailyNo economic improvement, so far as the workers are concerned, ever emanates from the employing section of the community. Article No. 1, section 8, of the constitution of the American Federation of Labour readsParty politics, whether they be democratic, republican, socialistic, populistic, prohibition, or any other, shall have no place in the conventions of the American Federation of Labour. All these authorities show that labour can gain more by peaceful negotiation than by direct action. It has been said that this Government arranged for the taking of a referendum at the last election because it required certain powers, which at that time were refused by the people, and that this bill has been introduced with the object of conferring those powers upon the Government..

In some cases hun-' dreds of persons have to be cited as respondents. been unnecessary and the anomalies remedied had the Government been granted the powers that it asked for at the last election. Clause 51 of the bill relates to the appointment of auditors to examine the accounts of trade unions. This provision has not been discussed to any extent, and I do not know whether it meets with the approval of the Opposition. Trade unions came into existence side by side w^th friendly societies. In New South Wales a publication is issued annually entitled ""Eeport of Friendly Societies and' Trades Unions of New South Wales."" Since the first report was issued, trade unions and friendly societies have drifted far apart. Under the law the accounts of friendly societies have to be strictly audited} and are open to the scrutiny of the department. Even the accounts of the individual lodges must be certified to by properly authorized auditors, and insurances must be taken out against embezzlement and defalcations. With trade unions there is a big loophole in the law, and there have been many deficiencies 'in funds during the last year or two. In one instance the funds of the New South Wales branch of the Federated Felt Hatting Employees' Union were embezzled to the extent of £650. In another instance that union suffered a loss of £923. The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners also missed £1,500 from its funds A few years ago the funds of the Seamen's Union were practically squandered, because in June, 1924, the cash in hand amounted to only £164 13s, appropriations among the friendly societies? security in their case in the form of insurance.

This procedure would have Boards have suffered greater losses than those. with the bill before the House. ber has referred to friendly societies. with friendly societies, but with trade unions.

Union suffered a loss of £400, and the offender Was sentenced to imprisonment. At a stormy meeting of the waterside workers held on the 23rd February of this year, the accounts were criticized and it was stated that three-quarters of the federation's income for the half-year had gone towards paying officials' salaries and expenses. Surely honourable' members opposite must admit that clause 51, if given effect, would be of benefit to the unions. It is strange that they see no good in the bill. It is probable that this provision will be improved at the committee stage, and thus give an additional guarantee of protection to the funds of the trade unions. In conclusion I wish to quote the statement of Mr W. A. Appletfon, Secretary of the British General Federation of Labour.

The movement may bo expected to bury the "" Red"" flag, and resuscitate the old formula of ""neither religion nor politics."" It will enlarge its outlook until this involves consideration of the whole community, and it will, if it realizes the lation with a mental outlook and hopes of its well-wishers, come back, after the suffering and loss and disillusionment of these Jatter days, to that conception of trade unionism set forth in the first rule of the General> Federation of Trade Unions. I commend the views of Mr Appleton to honourable members opposite as indicating a means whereby the conditions of trade unionism in this country may be i m proved. In any case the Labour party would do well to adopt an attitude entirely different from that which it has adopted towards this measure and, in fact, towards most measures that have been introduced by this Government. not my intention to discuss in detail the provisions of the b ill ; to do that comprehensively and thoroughly one would require weeks. No doubt, in view of the importance of the measure, the discussion of it w ill yet occupy many months! discussion is indisputable; the fact that the Attorney General has already number indicates that the bill had not been f u l l y considered and digested by the Government before it was presented to the House. Public opinion is just awakening to the significance of these proposals, and honourable members have received numerous communications regarding them from organizations, many of which are not connected in any way w i th the Labour movement. The honourable member for Eden Monaro the past to steal credit for the anti-Labour parties for all the social and political reforms that have been in troduced since the days of Noah.

Sufficei t to say that during the last 40 years the Labour party in politics has been the driving force and impulse beEnlightened by its hind every social advance. It has been the spear-head which has opened a way through the ranks of reaction and won for unionism the rights it now enjoys. Honourable members opposite in discussing this subject are apt to ignore the present day constitution of society, and the leavening forces that are at work in it , and to debate this legispsychology that might have been appropriate 30 or 40 years ago. The fact must be recognized that throughout the world organized labour is demanding more than it has hitherto enjoyed of the products of industry, and its rights are being universally recognized. What the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said about the refusal of American trade unionists to identify themselves with politics has nothing to do with the bill. There is a striking lack of unanimity amongst honourable members on the ministerial side in regard to the principle of industrial arbitration. Some have advocated, if not in actual words at least by implication, its complete abandonment. Others have expressed their firm adherence to it . Apparently upon this subject the Government parties are withIndeed, the need for f u l l out a concrete policy, and their spokesmen show a lack of understanding of trade unionism and its operations. Cergiven notice of a large tainly, the right honourable member for of important amendments North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who in earlier years was closely identified with industrial unionism and understands the psychology of the Labour movement better than does any other honourable member on his side of the House, warned the Government against the coercive features of the bill. One grave defect in the measure is its undoubtedly class character. It is directed solely against one section of the community. The trade unionists of Australia are to be regimented, disciplined and controlled ( Mr Perkins) groped in by the Government. They are to lose the dusty recesses of the dim ancient British privilege of free assembly and association, and are not to enjoy",25,Setup
29,Mr Coleman (Reid) [3.40],"It istlie rights that are extended to every other assembly or organization in modern civilized society. The Government does not propose to regiment and discipline aggregations of capital or combinations of employers with th& coercive and repressive severities that are prescribed in this bill. We are, therefore, justified in trying to arouse tlie public to an appreciation of the real purpose of the bill, and its attempted inroad upon the privileges accorded to unionism and for the last quarter of *a century enjoyed without challenge. I question the statement repeatedly made in the course of this debate that the Government has a mandate-oh , blessed word!-to introduce this measure. The Attorney-General cannot deny that the bill proposes revolutionary changes iu the industrial arbitration policy which were never foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his policy speech before the last general election. The Government may claim to have given the people notice of certain features of this legislation; but even in regard to them the people could hardly have given a mandate during an election which was won in a time of hysteria on issues which were calculated to excite the passions and fears of the electors, and prevent them from giving calm and unprejudiced consideration to the details of the Government's policy. Therefore, I maintain that these proposals for the control of unionism were not one of the prominent issues upon which the last general election was fought and won. In confirmalion of that statement, I remind the House that when the Government sought from the people, by way of referendum, a direct mandate to effect comprehensive alterations in the arbitration system, the people expressed their suspicion and distrust of the Government's industrial policy by rejecting the proposals by overwhelming majorities. Therefore, I ask, when and where did the Government get its mandate? Legislation such as is proposed may be challenged on tbe ground that no strong body of public opinion except that of a section of employers has demanded it : I have addressed public servants, school teachers, bank clerks, as well as manual workers in opposition to the bill, and have found them unanimously distrustful and hostile to this measure. Deputations have waited upon the Attorney-General, and directed his attention to what they regarded as the iniquitous features of the measure. Much though the Government supporters may prate about the bill being directed to the control of what they loosely term ""the red trade unions,"" I know that it is resisted by non-political unions of the so-called "" middle-class"" workers that are not affiliated with the labour movement. In other words, the bill meets with the solid opposition of all classes of organized labour in Australia. Ships' officers, captains, and engineers, the Merchants' Service Guild, and kindred organizations have expressed their keen opposition to the Government's proposal, and I remind honourable members that at the 1922 elections, the arbitration rights of the "" middle-class"" workers, which were threatened by certain negotiations between the then Prime Minister and the State Premiers, were a leading issue on the hustings, and committees and organizations were formed to resist the Government's proposals. The most important clauses-in regard to which the Government cannot claim to have a direct mandate from the people-ar e those which have been designed to hobble the arbitration court and destroy its independence. It would have been more courageous and honest for the Government to have prescribed a formula for the guidance of the Arbitration Court than to restrict its powers as it is proposed to do in this bill. The amendment to section 25 of the act is an invasion of the independence of the court. Section 25, in its' present form, reads as follows:In the hearing and determination of every industrial dispute, and in exercising any duties or powers under or by virtue of 'this act, the court, or the President, shall act according to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform its or his mind on any matter in such manner as it or he thinks just. That is the charter under which the court has functioned during the last twenty years.

The suggestion has been seriously made that the defalcations that take place in unions are of a very extensive nature.

Let me return to the proposed new secam not referring tion 25D which stipulates that the economic conditions of industry shall be.taken into consideration before an award is made. We hear much loose talk from honourable members opposite to the effect that the protective policy of Australia has tended to increase wages, whilst, on the other hand, the Tariff Board going to the Arbitration Court and asking for increased wages. I have stated previously, and I now re-affirm with emphasis, that the unions can obtain no more from the Arbitration Courts than the cost of living entitles them to receive. Wages are not responsible for the artificial conditions in which Australia is said to exist. Those conditions are due to the natural development of the country, arising from the consequences of the world war, and are bound up with the protective policy to which this Parliament gives overwhelming support. Those who declare that existing conditions are due to prevailing wages have failed to give the subject the consideration that it deserves.

43,Able Member For Eden,"Monaro( Mr Mr EENTON -Even Mr Marks,well known that although it is comparatively easy to increase wages, it is practically impossible to reduce them. In addition to the basic wage, Arbitration Courts also determine what is known as the ""secondary"" wage or ""margin for skill,"" which in the words of Mr Justice\ Higgins is denned asThe extra payment to be made for trained skill or for exceptional qualities necessary for an employee exercising the functions required. What is meant by the ""basic"" wage principle? The doctrine of a basic wage was first propounded as far back as 1890, by Sir Samuel Griffith, then Premier of Queensland, when he incorporated in a Parliamentary bill a clause to this effectThe natural and proper measure of wages is such a sum as is fair immediate recompense for the labour for which they are paid having regard to its character and duration; but it can never be taken at a less sum than such as is sufficient to maintain the labourer and his the fact that the mine is now poor and is befamily in a state of health and reasonable comfort. It is the duty of the State to make provision by positive law for securing the proper distribution of the net products of labour in acordance with the principles herein declared. The bill in question never became law, but the same principle was enunciated in the New South Wales Arbitration Court in somewhat similar terms by Mr Justice Heydon in 1905. In spite, however, of these pronouncements and the fact that wage-fixing tribunals had been in operation as early as 1896, in the State of Victoria, it was not until 1907 that the first basic wage, as such, was declared by a court in Australia. This declaration was made by His Honour Mr Justice Higgins, President of the Oommonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and is popularly known as the "" Harvester judgment"" on account of its having been determined in connection with H . V. McKay's Sunshine Harvester Works. The rate of wage declared in this case was.7s. per diem, or £2 2s. per week for Melbourne, the amount considered reasonable for ""a family of about five."" The constituent parts of this amount were £1 5s. 7d. for food, 7s. for rent, and 9s. 5d. for all other expenditure. This rate has since been varied in conformity with the rise in the cost of living, and now includes the sum of 3s. which was added in 1921 for the purpose of securing to the worker during a period of rising prices the f u l l equivalent of the ""Harvester "" standard. I am at a loss to to understand what is the motive of the Government in trying to destroy the principle of the basic wage, as is indicated by the wording of proposed new section 25n. In the early days of Federal arbitration, following on the Harvester judgment, there were calamity howlers among employers, who contended that industry would be ruined by the fixation of a living wage. The mine-owners of BrokenH i ll went before Mr Justice Higgins immediately after the Harvester judgment was made and stated that they could not afford to pay the living wage, owing to the economic condition of their industry. Mr\ Justice Higgins in his judgment on their application saidWhen the Proprietary Company asks me to fix award wages lower than are proper for the industry as a whole, and adduces as its reason coming poorer,'I cannot discern either justice or . expediency in the request. Ordinarily, if a mine has not payable ore, the owners cease to work it. First of all, is an employer who is poor to be ordered to pay as high wages as an employer who is rich? Now, without laying down a rule absolute and unconditional, under all circumstances, I s'trongly hold the view that, unless the circumstances are very exceptional, the needy employer should, under an award, pay at the same rate as his richer rival. It would not otherwise be possible to prevent the sweating of employees, the growth of parasitic enterprises, the spread of industrial unrestunrest which it is the function of the court to allay. If a man' cannot maintain his enterprise without cutting down the wages whicli are proper to be paid to his employees-a t all events the wages which are essential to their living-it would be better that he should abandon the enterprise. This is the view independently adopted by Mr Justice Gordon in Adelaide, and by Mr Justice Burnside, in Western Australia. The former said, in the brushmakers' case "" if any particular industry cannot keep going and pay its employees at least 7s. a day of eight hours, it must shut up."" In the Collie miners case, Mr Justice Burnside refused an application of the employers to lower the minimum, and said, "" If the industry cannot pay that price, it had better stop and let some other industry absorb the workers."" Fortwenty years, therefore, arbitration courts have refused to take into consideration the probable economic effect of their awards; they have laid down the sacred principle that the living or basic wage should be sacrosanct.

It appears to me that the Government is asking the Arbitration Court to do something which it should do itself. If it really thinks that the economic conditions in Australia require the abandonment, alteration, or restriction of the existing wage standard, it should have the courage to introduce legislation to deal with the matter, and should not throw the responsibility on a court which is removed from the influence of public opinion. On this subject there has been a complete absence of frankness on the part of the Attorney General. Another provision of the bill requires the court to consider the effect of agreements. It empowers the court to refuse to certify agreements. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have already dealt effectively with this provision, and I need say very little in regard to it. There is no justification for it. If employers are willing to enter into agreements with their employees to give them a larger margin of the profits earned by the industry, there is no justification for any interference by the Arbitration Court with such arrangements. bill kills conciliation. specious argument advanced by the Government that these arrangements might serve to increase prices will not stand examination, because there are other ways of dealing with employers and others who conspire to increase prices unduly than that of restricting these agreements. For instance, Parliament could pass legislation controlling profits and fixing prices. But those are means which this Government has never attempted to apply. The Government has approached the industrial problem from the wrong angle. The question has not received the consideration its importance warrants. If the Government had had any desire to keep the issue a non-party one, it should have had the fullest possible consultation with those who were likely to be affected by the legislation it was about to introduce. Ministers say very glibly that this bill is the result of consultation with the One of the sacred unions of Australia, but except in regard to one or two minor features there is no evidence in the bill itself of any such consultation. I make bold to say that the great majority of the proposals it contains are the outcome of consultation with organizations of employers, and are based upon the prejudices of the Attorney-General as a leading advocate for the employers before the Arbitration Court. ing. member may take it as such, but the inference to be drawn from the character of the legislation he has introduced can lead one to no other conclusion than that which I have mentioned. The Attorney' General claims that the representations of the unions have received adequate consideration, but the bill certainly does not indicate that those representations have received sympathetic consideration. The bill seeks to restrict the right of trade unions to approach the Federal Arbitration Court. Here again there is an attempt to interfere with the autonomy of the court. At present, by virtue of its own authority, it can refuse to hear claims that are made by various organizations; it can refer them back to State the tribunals. But the Attorney-General is now practically making it mandatory for the court to first determine whether it should hear such cases. When an application comes before the Arbitration Court it will be first required to decide whether it is expedient to hear it or whether the claim should go before a State tribunal. The Attorney-General said in his second-reading speechSection 38 of the present act enables the court to decline to deal with a dispute if it thinks it desirable that the matter should be dealt with by a State tribunal; but this clause imposes upon the court the obligation in every case to consider whether it is better for the court to deal with it or to refer it to a State authority. Further limitations are thus to be imposed on the authority of the Federal Arbitration Court. The first argument an organizationa State instrumentality for example-wil l have to meet when it goes before the Federal Court will be whether the. case in which it is concerned should be heard before the Federal Court or before a State tribunal.

58,Mr Coleman,"The honorablethere is no warranty for this interference with the freedom of the Aribtration Court. It is also doubtful .whether certain of the provisions of this bill are constitutional. For instance, under one provision the Federal Court can prevent a State authority from dealing with a dispute, or can declare that State laws or awards are invalid. Apart altogether from the constitutionality of this provision, I question whether it is in conformity with democratic principles. An overwhelming majority of electors in New South Wales may resolve to fix a higher basic wage, or limit the hours of labour, but under the amendment to clause 30 of this amending bill the Federal Arbitration Court, i if it can'go on strike; yet they will be liable to is called upon to make an award, may override all the industrial statutes passed by the New South Wales Parliament. It is preposterous that a court of three judges should overrule the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people of a State. In this case also I claim that there is no warranty for amending the act. It may be argued that it is part of the Government's policy to prevent the overlapping of awards, but there are more ways than one of dealing with that problem, and it could well be relegated to some future date, after there has been the fullest possible opportunity for consultation with those who are most concerned, and who are likely to be affected by the change. The Attorney-General has been trying to palliate the criticism which has been expressed from this side of the chamber of clause 7, dealing with declarations as to the existence of a lockout or strike. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr are not doing their work properly. Scullin) has most effectively exposed the fallacy of this proposed amendment, and has shown that in certain circumstances it legalizes lockouts. I dismiss the suggestion that it is to apply to strikes. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham), during his speech, said that that particular provision had been inserted to deal with a situation such as that which developed last year, when the engineers were engaged in an industrial dispute with their employers. In his concluding remarks the honourable gentleman exposed both himself and the Government to contempt, by suggesting that there is no way to deal with those situations other than to allow the employers to use direct action and to starve the workers into submission. The suggestion that a strike will be legalized under this pro^ vision is palpably absurd. A further example of the specious phraseology of the bill is found in the provision which relates to the taking of a ballot on the question of a strike. Here again, it would appear that a strike is legalized; but a further examination of the bill shows that that is not so. An overwhelming majority of workers in an industry can observe the requirements of the court and of this statute and vote for a strike; or during the existence of a lockout they various penalties, including a fine and the cancellation of the registration of the union. When one examines the bill from every angle one is convinced that it is directed against organized unionism. To my mind it has been carelessly drafted. The features that have been referred to so aptly and eloquently by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) clearly show that anomalies will be created if the bill is passed in its present form. The prescription of reduced penalties in the case of unions which expel officials and members who have participated in a strike betrays a peculiarly distorted mentality and a misunderstanding of trade unionism. The Attorney-General has attributed many strikes to union officials. I quote his own wordsIt is obvious in some cases that union officers are afraid that if they have not a dispute in progress it might be thought by someone who is anxious to get their job that they A little while ago the honourable gentleman interjected that one of my remarks was insulting. His covert sneer, in the quotation I have just made, at a law abiding body of citizens, the overwhelming majority of whom are striving night and day to preserve peace in industry not only out of a desire for peace, but also for their own contentment of mind and personal security, is to be deplored. His language, too, does not convey a correct idea of the real position. I was a union official for fourteen or fifteen years, during which I was associated first with the Seamen's Union of Australia and subsequently witb a clerical organization. Therefore, I am in a position to realize what a very bigpart union officials play in preserving industrial peace in industry. provisions of the Crimes Act. Certainly The expression of such an opinion proves how little the Attorney-General understands the problem with which he is confronted. Another provision that merits disapprobation is that whicli legalizes the expulsion of members who go on strike. If a union should expel any of its members for ""striking"" it will receive the benediction of the court and the Government, and be applauded for its act. That is the only instance of lawful expulsion that the measure contemplates. If , on the other hand, a union should expel any of its members for anti-union conduct, or for breaches of its rules in relation to any other question than that of a strike, it will incur the displeasure of the court and be liable to the penalties prescribed by the measure. It has been suggested .by various speakers from this side that the bill in reality converts the arbitration law into a new criminal code. The bill certainly has a very strong flavour of the criminal code, because it not only provides the alternative penalty of imprisonto ten men the power to upset the adment with hard labour for certain offences, but also sets out that the judge may insist upon a bond of upwards of £500 being lodged by a union as a guarantee that it will be of good behaviour during the currency of an award. struggling organization may not be in a position to give such a security, but that may not be regarded as an excuse. Should any union refuse to do so, the court may decline to make an award. Even if we were to admit that there are strikes and breaches of the law, such a requirement is an insult to the law abiding unions in Australia to-day. The Attorney-General down, as a result of the amount of public criticism which was directed against it, the provision which gave to the court the power to smash unions, following upon their deregistration for offences against the law; but he has substituted a clause which also will require explanation. An organization is still to have an existence, even after it has been deregistered by the Mr Coleman. court; but the question will arise whether the powers which were contemplated under the amendment orginally proposed cannot take effect under the no government that has introduced a bill providing for such a savage penalty as the absolute destruction of a union following upon its deregistration can claim to be friendly disposed towards trade unionism. The mere intent is sufficient to satisfy the unions of Australia' that there is no substance in the hypocritical profession that the Government is well disposed towards them. May I make a brief reference to the provisions that deal with the taking of secret ballots. They are palpably undemocratic. The provision which makes it possible for ten disgruntled individuals in an organization comprising 20,000 or 30,000 employees to demand a secret ballot has received the condemnation of every organization of wage and salary earners. It is preposterous to make it possible for a ballot to be demanded on every question. The Labour party is not opposed to the principle of a secret ballot. But whatever mandate the Government may claim to have to provide for secret ballots on general principles, it certainly has no justification for giving ministration of a large organization. Eeference has been made to the penal clauses, in their relation to persons who obstruct the taking of a ballot under the A asgis of the court. One of their worse features is that any man who counsels another not to vote is liable to a fine of £50 or imprisonment for six months. Even if that were recognized as an admissible offence the penalty is completely out of proportion to the gravity of the alleged offence. It is proposed to make a criminal of a man who, upon a political or induscertainly watered trial issue, exercises his right to freedom of speech and freedom of conscience by urging another to have nothing to do with a ballot. It is preposterous and outrageous to make such a man liable to imprisonment for six months. The Government may sneer at our attacks upon the coercive character of this bill, and the penalties it provides, but that clause in itself is sufficient to damn the measure. The provision which deals with the control of the internal administration of the unions can be dealt with more extensively in committee. The autonomy of unions is to be interfered with. It is proposed to control the admission of individuals to unions. The whole of the rules of a union are to be subject to the strict censorship of the court. members of the unions themselves will not have the right to govern their organizations. make the bill comparable in many respects with the new industrial code that is a feature of Fascism in Italy. ultimate outcome will be the removal of practically every union in Australia from the register of the Gommonwealth Arbitration Courti f the bill is enforced. There are also other absurd penalties. For example, there is the penalty of £20 for daring to criticize a judgment of the Arbitration Court at a meeting of a union. in the bill relating to criticism of a judgment of the Arbitration Court. section 86c providesAny person who, at any meeting of an organization, or of a branch of an organization, or of the committee of management of any organization, or of a branch of such committee, or at any public meeting, moves, seconds, or puts to tlie meeting any resolution the terms of which are abusive of, or inI read the Attorney-General's speech on sulting to, the court or any judge or officer tliereof, or which is in contempt of the court, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Twenty pounds. very different from what the honourable member said it was. there is any difference. The term "" abusive of the court"" could be construed so as to include almost anything. It certainly is a new principle in industrial law, to debar members of a union who are assembled to discuss the policy of their organization from criticizing a judge or the Arbitration Court, and, presumably a determination of the court, and to fix the absurdly high penalty of £20 for such an offence. It is monstrous. It will be seen that a novel and an entirely, new code is to be applied to trade unionism. There are to be special penalties, special forms of punishment, and a special procedure. regarded as quasi criminals. other provision relates to the publication of a resolution that may criticize the court. A newspaper that merely publishes the report of a meeting at which such a resolution was carried is liable to a fine of The £100. Would we be extravagant if we said that with the passage of this bill Australia would be returning to the dark These provisions certainly ages when the right of free discussion was denied? Under this proposal, freedom of speech with regard to industrial The matters is to become, in certain circumstances, a criminal, offence. If one considers the logical effect of the proposed penalties, one finds that it is not a matter of one penalty for one crime, because in certain instances-a fine of £100 or £500 as the case may be, does not expiate the conduct to which exception has been taken. The court may also de-register a union, and it may inflict penalties on the persons whose actions have led to the deregistration. This is all out of keeping with the ordinary principles of criminal and other legal procedure. Why is section 61 to be deleted? This readsDuring the pendency of any dispute or matter before the court, no resignation of or discharge from the membership of any organization shall have effect. the bill, and I believe he mentioned that he knew of one or two cases in which unions had "" unfairly "" refused to accept resignations. been challenged in 24 years. was put into the statute, after the most careful consideration, in order to prevent victimization.

These employees were intimidated; but this section has proved extremely valuable in protecting them. Simply because one or two cases of hardship have arisen, the Government proposes to delete the section, although the proper and honourable course would have been to amend it acording to the needs of the case.

In so far as the bill is designed to make perfect an imperfect system, I am not very enthusiastic about it, and in so far as it may be regarded as an attempt to unduly discipline the unions, I think that undue concern has been shown on the part of the Opposition. I believe, however, that the vide extended facilities for conciliation, and additional machinery to prevent overlapping, and to ensure control of the unions by the unionists themselves. After all, union regulations are in essence part of the laws of the land. In the main, these regulations confer punitive powers, and they have received legal recognition to the extent that power has been granted to It is the unions to enforce them. No body of men has a right to apply punitive rules for the conduct of its own affairs unless it has obtained legislative sanction. Personally, I see no objection to that on the principles of true unionism. But I am not concerned so much with that phase of the subject, because I believe that the central compulsory system exof arbitration-ou r federal system-is unsound. After 24 years of operation, and the exercised patience by the nation, it has failed the worker, the employer, and industry. It has failed all those who originally believed in it. It failed its founders as a great ideal for the settlement of industrial disputes, the betterment of the conditions of the workers and the improvement of industry.

78,Mr Rodgers,"I welcome thistheir wages than they had in 1922. It has failed completely to give the Australian worker any clear money. It has failed industry, in so far as the economic conditions were never more unsound than they are to-day. It has failed the nation that set up the great ideal of findof the States with a view to surrendering ing a peaceful solution of the problem of the world-wide discord between employer and employee. I was an interested observer of the work of a commission that the present Government recently sent to the United States of America to investigate the industrial and economic conditions there, and bring back a report in order that we might have a great national overhaul of the industrial life of Australia. In place of that overhaul I find this bill, a quite insufficient measure, in my judgment, to effect the fundamental change necessary for the national stocktaking that is long overdue. I give the Government credit for desiring to honour promises made to the electors, and, in so far as this bill represents the Government's fulfilment of election promises, I shall support it to the second reading stage; but, like other honourable members, I reserve to myself the right to deal with each clause on its merits in committee. The Government should also listen to the views of experienced leaders of the trade union movement. This Parliament should take its courage in its hands, and the Ministry should call a continent-wide conference on industrialism. We should invite the States and the leaders of industry on both sides-bu t particularly let us have the States-to confer and thus get a form of industrial inquiry such as we have never had before. Let us decide whether we made a national blunder in establishing a central compulsory arbitration system. The Commonwealth should take the first step towards curing the nationa] economic ills from which the nation is suffering by completely evacuattrial legislation, and each time the people ing the whole field of industrial control, except only so far as the members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and perhaps those employed in maritime occupations in our. territorial waters. Close examination will show that there is no difference in essence and reality between taking off the wool clip and the wheat harvest in the different 'States. One industry is no more federal in character than the other. In my opinion, the time has arrived when representatives of the Commonwealth should confer with representatives to the States complete and absolute control over all industries. After all, who could be more jealous custodians and guardians of the interests of the States and their workers than the State authorities themselves, which have a close and almost domestic knowledge of their industries and the requirements of their people. I am not one of those who believe in uniform industrial legislation for a continent such as Australia, because the conditions of the various States differ to a marked extent, and the industries of the States also differ. I do not consider that conditions"" made to apply to industries in the eastern States, or in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, should also be applied to similar industries in Tasmania or Western Australia, States whose population is smaller where development in a more backward state and the local market is also smaller. Industries in the smaller States now experience many handicaps, and owing to their distance from the eastern States, have not the same favorable local market. If we were only whole-hearted ih this matter we could, while conserving the interests of employers and employees, remould our industrial and'.economic conditions. Prior to the vote on the last referendum, I was taunted with being an extremist. It was said that there -were extremists on both sides of the referendum question, and that they were the only people who were in opposition to the Government's proposals. I emphasize, however, that on three different occasions an attempt has been made by different Governments to give the Commonwealth Parliament complete power in the matter of indushave refused. When the proposal to hold a referendum was last under consideration, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and myself were the only members in this chamber who adopted the unpopular attitude of opposing the Government's proposal. We were taunted by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) with being extremists. But what was the ""result of the vote on that occasion ? In four public opinion. Arbitration, as a world States the referendum was defeated, and in only two was it carried. The majority against the Government's proposal was 372,567. But what happened in the electorates? My own electorate was the only one in Victoria that supported its member. My majority at the last general election was 3,173; but the majority in my electorate against the referendumwhich I had opposed-wa s 14,721. The majority of the Prime Minister in Flinders at the last election was 13,425; but in regard to the referendum his minority was 7,791; he thus went to the bad to the extent of 21,216 vote3. ber must draw his own deduction. The Attorney-General had an election majority of 19,290 in Kooyong, but in regard to the referendum there was a minority there of S,523, so that he went to the bad to the extent of 27,823 votes. There must be a number of extremists in Kooyong. The present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr who are unemployed, and cannot particiScullin) had an election majority of 20,841 votes in the Yarra electorate, but oil the referendum a minority of 10,593, or an actual minority of 31,434. These figures will show that the leaders who taunted us with being extremists found that there were extremists in their own constituencies far out numbering their followers. What does a serious consideration of this question disclose? It shows that the, Australian people are awake to the fact that a central compulsory arbitration system is a vehicle which travels at a caterpillar rate, and arrives too late to be of service. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court frequently only commences to function long after a dispute occurs, and has to make retrospective awards to overcome its own shortcoming. Yet it is the instrument on which we rely to adjust the disputes which frequently arise in connection with wages and conditions. It is time we called a halt, and made a serious attempt to adopt modern methods. I have listened patiently to honourable really the first to introduce compulmembers on both sides of the chamber sory arbitration, but it must be rewho have presented the case for and membered, in considering any success against this bill, and have come to the which has followed in New Zealand, that conclusion that some members of Parliament are among the worse interpreters of system, has much to commend it. It is a system of give and take, after consultation. But there is a great difference between arbitration and compulsory arbitration. Under the system of central compulsory arbitration this nation's industries are held in shackles. At this moment, while we are considering a measure to improve our arbitration system, there is a good deal of unemployment in the land, notwithstanding that there is much work waiting to be done. There are many honest employers in this country who would provide emergency work of some kind to give employment in needy cases; but they are rigidly bound and tied by awards of the Arbitration Court, under which remuneration and industrial conditions are fixed. These prevent helpful assistance to unemployed except on the most rigid court terms. The fact that high wages are provided under industrial awards, and that certain social standards are to be observed, is of little benefit to thousands pate in them. Personally, I should like to see a change of heart in the community, and good faith substituted for compulsory arbitration. I should prefer in industrial disputes to allow some one like the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), representing the workers of Australia, and a reasonable man representing the employers, to decide what was fair and just for our workmen, to retaining the present costly litigious system. I have no faith in a system whicli elevates men, trained in the law, to an industrial tribunal, leaving them to determine industrial conditions of which they know but little, just as they know but little of the bitter struggles and trials through which the workers and employers have come. Yeti t is such men who make the awards which the whole nation has to obey. . ance with what is happening elsewhere throughout the world. New Zealand was",36,Setup

82,Mr Rodgers,"It is at total varithere are very few secondary industries there. New Zealand has commenced manufacturing. try, her industries are mainly rural, and are conducted principally by families who own the land they use. Therefore, the results of compulsory arbitration in New Zealand, and the fact that there are very few industrial disputes in the dominion, are not of much guidance to us. The worker is not always wrong. I do not always blame the worker. He sometimes has to contend with conditions that more than test his humanity. But while we are here endeavouring to improve this industrial legislation, certain unioniststhe marine cooks-ar e out on strike in contempt of the court, and are holding up our great coastal shipping trade. If the Commonwealth Parliament would drop its compulsory arbitration system it would be able to handle national questions, to develop Australia, and leave to the States the warring industrial interests of the community to settle as they think best. What judges are we, in this central Parliament at Canberra, of the industrial conditions best suited to, say, Western Australia or Tasmania? We frame laws here for governing a great continent, some of which are checking and stifling industry. I report presented Delegation which visited America. In their minority report, Mr Grayndler and Mr Mclnnes statesIn pur opinion the real cause of success in American manufactures is the efficiency of management and supervision, machinery and equipment, up-to-date organization of plant, material and men, combined with large and cheap supplies of power, and behind these factors stands "" scientific research,"" the whole being based on a market of 118,000,000 people. On the other hand the .report submitted by MrH . E. Guy statesIn regard to conciliation and arbitration, there is a consensus of opininon that any form of compulsory arbitration would not be tolerated in America. Employers and employees are equally emphatic in this regard. The prevailing idea is that nothing should be done to hamper freedom of intercourse between those engaged in industry, and that every means should be adopted to forward progress. Whatever may be said of compulsory arbitration it is certain that it 'does not encourage mutuality between employers and employees. The central idea is strife-the engendering of It is only of recent years that disputes so as to get to court-befor e nonpractical men. In America when a difference of opinion ocurs the parties refer the quesNew Zealand is a small countion to some one conversant with the industry. This ensures respect on both sides for tlie decision. Such a course of dealing between employer and employee is of course more possible where industry unions prevail. I have quoted ""one of the deductions drawn by Mr Grayndler and his colleague for which there is much to be said. In Australia, of course, we have a population of under 7,000,000 persons, and consequently our home market is limited. Having examined very closely existing rural conditions I have no hesitation in saying that there is a marked disproportion between the social, industrial, and economic conditions existing in primary and secondary industries. The primary industries are staggering under a load of economic inequality. . Our secondary industries enjoy artificial conditions which have not been provided for our primary industries and are placing a burden upon them which they are unable to stand. I do not specially seek to blame either the Government or the Opposition for our present troubles, but this Parliament is blameworthy for not finding a remedy for them. This bill is not a remedy for the economic ills from which the nation is suffering. Whether we like it or not, the truth is that owing have referred to the to false economic laws and excessive cost by the Industrial of production Australia cannot sell the products of her secondary industries, or of some of her primary industries, in the markets of the world. Wheat and wool, and to a lesser extent, meat, are the only Australian industries which can hold their heads up against our false economic conditions. None of our secondary industries and few of our primary industries are able to make progress under the conditions which have been prescribed by the Arbitration Court, even though some of our primary industries like fruit growing, wine making,' &c, receive a bounty in Australia and a preference in Great Britain. We talk a lot about our high social standards. Who enjoys them? Do our thousands of unemployed, our soldier settlers in outside rural areas, our dairy farmers, our potato and onion growers, or our orehardists? They do not. If we are to have high social standards they should be made possible of enjoyment by every class in the community. Such social advantages as we have to-day are maintained on borrowed money, and not because the nation is producing sufficient wealth to justify them. The Leader of the Opposition told us that the high wages which the worker enjoys to-day are worth 5 per cent, less to him than the wages he received in 1922. It is apparent, therefore, that these standards cannot be maintained under the present artificial conditions. The economic condition of the nation is, in my opinion, deplorable. Prior to 1914 the Commonwealth had no public debt. It owed £19,000,000 in respect of transferred properties and certain trust funds, but it had floated no loans. It now owes £366,611,000. The States in June, 1914, had a total public debt of £320,000,000, on which they paid interest at the rate of £3 12s. 6d. per cent. Since 1914 the State debts have increased to £677,121,000, and the rate of interest has gone up to £4 18s. 2d. per cent. In the last thirteen years, therefore, the States have borrowed the colossal sum of £356,866,000-mor e money than they borrowed in the previous 59 >years that followed the granting of responsible government. This is additional evidence that our industries cannot maintain the burdens piled on them or the present false standards. Courts or no courts, judges"" or no judges, we should face the fact that our economic position is unsound, and it is regrettable that this Parliament seems to be afraid to do so. Such measures as that we are now considering do not touch the "" root of our troubles. I suggest that the Commonwealth Government should call the State Governments into conference, with the object of considering ways and means of counteracting our economic drift. suggest also that we should allow each State to manage its own industrial affairs. the people, and he received it, for minisSuch a system would be more plastic than our present centralized, uniform and rigid method. I trust that I shall not be charged with making inflammatory speeches. I feel keenly that we have taken the wrong industrial road. I recognize that the Australian worker is entitled to fair and honest conditions. He is not the first man who should be penalized. What we Mr Rodgers. need more than anything else is a reduction of the cost of living and of production to such a point that we can place our industries upon a competitive basis. It is essential also that the interest rate on money should be reduced and that rents should be lowered. As things are to-day, our industries are shackled. It is impossible for a young Australian, with even a little capital-hi s savings-to set himself up in either primary or secondary industries, and it should not be so. While Parliament allows our present unsound economic position to continue, it stands condemned. We are standing idly by while Australia is drifting, and our economic clutch is slipping. course of the policy speech which the Prime Minister delivered prior to the last election, he invited the electors of the Commonwealth to compare the programme of the Government with that of the Opposition, and to vote conscientiously for what they believed to be the best interests of the community. He also stated that the supremacy of Parliament had been challenged by certain extremists who had captured the Labour organizations of Australia. He made it clear that in his opinion the majority of the working class of Australia entirely disapproved of the methods which were adopted by a few busy agitators, whose main business appeared to be to foment industrial strife, and to preach class hatred and direct industrial action. The right honourable gentleman made it quite clear that if his Government were returned to power, it would do its utmost to exterminate Soviet propagandists, who were spreading their nefarious doctrines throughout the Commonwealth. In order to enable the Government to do all that I it desired to do in this respect, the Prime Minister asked for a clear mandate from terial candidates were returned with an overwhelming majority. It stands to the credit of the Bruce Page Government that during the last two years no less than four attempts have been made to find a solution of our industrial troubles. The first administrative act of the Government was to set in motion certain",38,Setup
83,Mr Mackay (Lilley) [5.16],"In thelegislative machinery which had been enacted to combat the efforts of a few prominent agitators who had been directly or indirectly responsible for huge economic losses to Australia. It was discovered that certain amendments to the Constitution were necessary to enable the Government to do as it desired in that regard. Consequently, the people were asked by referendum in 1926 to clothe the Government with the additional power that it needed. Unfortunately, only two States favoured the proposals. It is significant, however, that these were New South Wales and Queensland, the two strongest Labour States of the Commonwealth. I Delieve that to-day a great many more electors in the other States would vote in favour of those proposals than did so in 1926. The Government was justified in expecting a favorable vote, and it is regrettable that it did not get it. The next effort which the Government made to find a solution of the economic ilia from which the nation was suffering was to send an industrial delegation to the United States of America to study industrial and economic conditions there. The personnel of that commission was above reproach, and adequately represented both the employers and employees. The delegation presented a comprehensive and an informative report to Parliament, but I regret to say that no practical results have followed. The third attempt of the Government to bring about a better understanding in industry was made just recently, when the Prime Minister issued invitations to the .various organizations of employers and employees in the Commonwealth to attend an industrial peace conference, with the object of exploring all possible means of conducting our industries in a more cooperative spirit. I believe that the Prime Minister was influenced in calling that conference by the excellent results which followed the holding of a similar conference in Great Britain. In his letter of invitation to the various organizations of employers and employees, the Prime Minopposite say ""hear, hear.""

It is proposed that the conference should be essentially industrial in character, and not political, and the invitations which I am extending are limited to those who are actually engaged in the industrial and productive activities of the Commonwealth, or who are directly concerned witb the organizations of employees and employers. It was most unfortunate that the industrial organizations refused to attend the conference, for I feel sure that a heartto-heart talk between accredited representative men on each side could have had excellent results. It is noteworthy that a similar conference was held last week in New Zealand, and the reports of it which have come to hand indicate that it was instrumental in removing a good deal of misunderstanding on both sides. It is true that before issuing invitations to the conference the Government had introduced the bill which we are now considering, but it is reasonable to assume that any recommendations which such a conference might have made would have been incorporated in the measure. The Government is now making its fourth effort to improve industrial relations by endeavouring to place this measure on the statute-book. I do not think that any one could honestly believe that the Government is hostile to trade unionists,""for it has tried in every way in its power to obtain peace in industry by voluntary means. It is now forced to proceed with this bill in order to fulfil the promises which it made prior to the last general election. It is absurd to deny that in Australia we have men who lose no opportunity of preaching industrial warfare and defiance of the system of arbitration.

There are many differences of opinion respecting the secret ballot, but surely we should not, at the second-reading stage, condemn the whole bill because it provides for that, or for the expulsion of individual members of unions if found guilty of fomenting strikes. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) clearly showed that it would be to the advantage of the unions to have an examination of their accounts made from time to time by a responsibleauditor. These are suitable subjects for deliberate debate, and if it can be shown that the provisions of the bill will, in their effect, be dangerous conclusions. In refusing the invitation or oppressive, they can easily be amended.

Every member of this Parliament is responsible to his constituents, and should do nothing to humiliate or weaken of this country. I believe the Government to be sincere in its attempt to place the control of unions in the hands of their members. Surely that is a democratic principle which we can support. Trade unionism is one of the most powerful forces in the national Surely it life of Australia, and any Government that mistakenly and needlessly attacks it deserves defeat at the hands of the people.' There are something like 149 unions in am prepared to admit that Australia, with a membership of 693,000. These unionists are working under arbitration awards and agreements, and the majority of them are contended. It cannot be denied that there is an extreme element in Australia, particularly among the transport unions, which has done, and is doing, much mischief, and is responsible for much of our unemployment. The Government cannot delay any longer in taking steps to deal with that element. As I have already said, the Government is deserving of credit foT its previous attempts to deal with the problem on a voluntary basis. The members of the various trade unions have had an opportunity of reading the report of the Industrial Commission, which body has undoubtedly come to some reasonable and convincing of the Prime Minister to attend the proposed peace conference, the unions have made a fatal mistake, which will rob them.

112,Mr Mackay,"If an audit is goodsuch other action as will restore the control of unions to its members. By reducing the number of strikes there will be an expansion of our trade, to the benefit of all classes of the community. The bill is of great importance, and that, I think, every honourable member realizes. But the best results will not be obtained if the members of the Opposition, as they have indicated, have made up their minds to fight every clause, whether its effect be beneficial or otherwise. I suggest that the provisions of the bill, with which both sides of the House agree, should be speedily dealt with. In regard to those about which there is a difference of opinion, I feel certain that, in the interests of this country, the Government will endeavour to meet the views of the Opposition as far as possible, consistent with adequate protection being guaranteed for the industrial progress of the Commonwealth. I agree with previous speakers about the. importance of the measure that we are now debating. Any legislation relating to the regulation of wages and conditions of employment must affect the economic and social life of the nation, and therefore places upon this Parliament a very great responsibility. I speak as a representative of a primary producing constituency, and I hope, before I resume my seat, to state the views, as I understand them, of the average producer, and certainly of the producers of my constituency, respecting arbitration and its effects. I , although a primary producer, can, if I may be pardoned for so doing, also view this subject from the angle of those engaged in the industrial world, because I was born and nurtured in an industrial constituency: I have, consequently, felt very keenly the remarks of honourable members about the hardships and sweated conditions of days gone by. I worked in a factory in this country during the early part of this century, and I have a keen and vivid recollection of the industrial conditions of those days. I hesitateto strike a personal note too strongly, but when a boy of thirteen or fourteen years my first job was at the Melbourne Glass Bottle Works, working night shift at 7s. a week. Not long ago I had the pleasure f again visiting those works, and I found a boy doing work similar to that I did some 24 or 25 years ago. I said to him, ""How much are you getting for this work V He replied, "" Thirty-five shillings a week, and the job is worth it."" I informed him that formerly I had done that work for 7s. a week, and his observation in reply perhaps would be rather disorderly if I attempted to repeat it. I mention that illustration as an indication of what trade unionism has done for this country, in spite of what has been said about it getting the workers nowhere. Actually the conditions of the average industrialist to-day in almost every industry are far better than those which obtained years ago. In discussing this subject, we are too prone to think that the problems affecting organized labour and capital are confined to Australia. Some honourable members in this Parliament would say, "" Do away with the Arbitration Court and the tariff; let us get back to the old days of individualism."" The day of individualism has gone, which is a good thing for this country, and if we cast our eyes to the other side of the world, we shall find that there, to a large extent, it has gone too. At present, we are living in a world of organization. Take, for instance, the trade unions. be careful when speaking on this subject, it is the honourable member.

115,Mr Stewart,"If any one shouldtesting the statesmanship of every other civilized country. We must see this matter in proper perspective. Opposed to the world-wide organizations of labour are the world-wide organizations of capital. There are huge combinations of capital, trusts and combines international in their scope, trade cartels, and so on. As an instance of the operations of these bodies I mention the Steel Rail Trust, which actually fixes the total output and rations the exportable surplus amongst the various producing countries. Numerous other illustrations could be given of the manner in which in ever-increasing degree labour and capital are organizing into groups, whose ramifications extend far beyond the boundaries of any one country. Out of this extensive organization and counter-organization class consciousness has developed. It is evident in this country, in this Parliament, in this debate. It exists in every part of the world. Not unnaturally this bill is viewed with grave suspicion by members of the Labour party. Any proposal to deal with the trade unions and the organized workers, coming from such a source as the Ministerial party, is bound to be suspected and distrusted by the members of the Opposition. Between .the combinations of capital and the massed battalions of the trade unionists there is almost incessant warfare, in as much as in the arbitration oourt or the industrial arena a fight of nome sort is in progress at all times. When the parties are not in actual conflict they are measuring each other with critical and suspicious eyes. A third partymore or less an onlooker at the fightconsists of the people engaged in the great primary industries. They are the least organized section of the community. The farmer by reason of temperament and environment is essentially an individualist. Because he is an individualist and is possessed of initiative and independence he left the comforts of the city and is pioneering in the outback, and because he is in the back blocks, almost entirely segregated from his fellows, he continues an individualist and is difficult to organize for collective effort. Men in the shearing shed, the forecastle, or the factory, together, and are accessible to trade union organizers and political speakers. Ifr. In similar manner the manufacturers and other employers foregather, and daily contact develops in them the herd instinct to come together for mutual protection and advantage. But the wheat growers, the dairymen, and the graziers who are scattered throughout the land in isolated units rarely meet' together, and in consequence have been and are the mo3t difficult class to organize politically or industrially. why the primary producer to-day is suffering. honourable member. Too often the primary producer is the innocent victim of the eternal conflict between organized labour and organized capital. For instance, when shipping is held up at a critical stage, involving the destruction of primary produce or delay in getting it to the market, the innocent victim who knows nothing of, and probably is not concerned in the quarrel, is the heaviest loser. Experiences of this kind have shaken the primary producers out of their lethargy. To-day there is a spirit of organization, a get-together instinct amongst them, which, although belated, is none the less resolute and effective. It will be increasingly manifest in the days to come, and it will be good, not only for the primary producer, but for the community generally. At any rate, whether or not the farmer believes in organization, whether he is an individualist or a collectivism he is driven by the force of circumstances to combine with his fellows for protection. Thus we have associations of dairymen, wheat growers, graziers, egg producers, and so on, which, originally intra-state, are now linking up federally. In short, we find that in the ranks of the primary producers the very same spirit of organization is growing up. We find them organizing politically to secure better representation in this Parliament and in the various' State Parliaments. The Country parties, both here and in the State Parliaments, have been charged by the producers work in company, lunch specifically with the safeguarding of their interests. With the advent of the Country parties, clamour has been Stewart. raised for embargoes, control boards,",45,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

117,Mr Stewart,"I agree with thebounties, compulsory pools, and tariff concessions. passed through this Parliament increasing the tariff on butter, and) a little while before that the tariff was increased on rice. Even though the majority of the primary producers are avowed lowtariffists, and while many of them disbelieve in tariffs altogether, they are forced by the fact that tariff burdens have been imposed on them by this and other Parliaments to seek such tariff amendments as w ill protect their own industries. When a new tariff schedule is before Parliament, we see the representatives of the organized workers, and the representatives of the manufacturers voting solidly together to impose fresh burdens on the primary producers. Honourable members behind the Government are apt to sneer at the word "" solidarity,"" but on tariff matters we see an excellent example of solidarity in the association of the manufacturing interests and the labour representatives. The primary producer to-day is asking, in a fiscal sense, for a hair of the dog that bit him. the vicious circle. ber for Riverina( Mr Killen) was very weak on maize, but very strong on rice. honourable member for Riverina, it must be admitted that the vicious circle of -rising tariffs has placed him, and other honourable members of the Country party, in a somewhat invidious position. ter for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) ? He said that he would wipe out tariffs altogether. placed in the position of being an apologist for the political sins of the Minister for Works and Railways. I make these observations in order to emphasize the fact that we are now living in a new age, and it is necessary to realize that, if we are to approach this matter from the proper angle. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Wannon Rodgers), who spoke forcibly on this measure. It is well for us to remember, when we speak about our high standard of living, that while the Arbitration Court and tariff walls can, for a time, Recently, a schedule was artificially raise the standard of living, there is a point beyond which that standard cannot go. If we analyze the position, we shall find that the high standard amongst the workers in the secondary industries is too often obtained at the expense of many of those engaged in the primary industries. We are a debtor nation. If we are to p a j the interest on our overseas debts it r is necessary that our exports should exceed our imports by £30,000,000 a year. Unless we have an export surplus of that value we must either repudiate our debts, or borrow more money with which to pay the interest on them. Ninety-six per cent, of our exports are composed of primary products which have to be sold at world parity prices. That is what I mean when I say that our much vaunted standard of living, and the burden of our national indebtedness, is being carried, to a very great extent, by the primary industries. We, as a nation, are in the very illogical position of continuing to borrow money overseas from countries with a lower standard of livin g than our own, in order to maintain in this country what are largely artificial conditions. The Tariff Board, in its report of the 30t.h of June, 1926, complained of the fact that many of the trade unions, In justice to the whose members are engaged in secondary industries, joined with the employers to go before the Tariff Board and appeal for increased duties. When their request was granted, they promptly went to the A r b i tration Court and asked for more wages, so that they might participate in the advantages which had been won by the employers. The report of the Tariff Board statedI should hate to be This action of the Textile Workers' Union seems to have been influenced by the judgment of Mr Justice Powers, wherein it was laid down that hie Court could take no cognizance of the capacity of an industry to pay certain wages, but would fix what wages it thought necessary, and the industry would then have recourse to the Tariff Board, which had heen created by the Federal Parliament to make recommendations for the granting of whatswaprotection was necessary. In this case ti.e various unions appeared before the ( Mr Tariff Board to assist the employers in obtaining the necessary increases in order to make it possible to work the mills at a profit, instead of at a loss, and then immediately approached the Arbitration Court for their share in these increases",46,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

I am coning back and forth between the Federal Arbitration Court and the Tariff Board for increvictions may be, we all desire to see a ments in wages and duties, which can only result in an ever increasing wage rate, and an ever ascending tariff. This course must ultimately defeat itself, and by continuously raising the cost of living, bring about an industrial paralysis. That was on the 30th of June, 1926, and the board, in its report of the following year, reiterated those observations after having had twelve months' further experience of the conditions referred to. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8.15. this bill, recognizes the points I have made with regard to the present position of organizations, of both capital and labour, and the newly awakened spirit of the primary producers, and seeks by it to institute a better system under which the Arbitration Court shall function. I listened with the closest attention to the speech of the Attorney General( Mr Latham), which I have since read. The honourable gentleman made a very reasoned, temperate and nonprovocative speech, in view of the contentious matter with which he was dealing. Although the Government has been credited by honourable members of the Opposition with being actuated by an ulterior motive in introducing this measure, I prefer, if there is any doubt as to whether the Government is actuated by good or bad intentions, to give it the benefit of the doubt. I shall discuss the bill in a dispassionate way and give my opinion upon what I consider will be its effects. The suggested industrial peace conference has been mentioned, and honourable members on the Government side have strongly deprecated the action of the organized trade unionists of Australia in refusing to be represented at that conference. In my opinion the Government made a great blunder by first introducing this bill and then inviting the trade unionists to attend a peace conference. Probably, had the Government first con. vened the conference and later introduced a bill, in which was incorporated the recommendations of the conference, all would have been well, and there would have been an opportunity to reach an fident that, whatever our political conbetter relationship between capital and labour. called the conference first there would have been a complaint that the bill was being rushed on the House. opinion that it would have been preferable first to convene the conference. The fact that the Government has had to introduce a sheaf of amendments, almost bewildering in their number, in an endeavour to mitigate to some degree the eifect of the penalty clauses that appear in the bill, suggests to me that it recognizes that it went too far in some of its original proposals. drafted a good while before any conference was mentioned? would have been better had the conference been called first and the bill introduced later. I consider that the clauses of the bill that deal with procedure are, generally, very desirable and will have n good effect. I have in mind the clause dealing with the formation of voluntary committees consisting of representatives of. the parties concerned and presided over either by the present conciliation commissioner or by one of the commissioners who will be appointed. Theoretically, that appears to be a very valuable step towards the prevention of disputes, which will be dealt with before they reach the court. under the old act, without applying to a judge, as has to be done under this bill. troduce procedure which will make for conciliation between employer and employee. Proposed new section 25A, which is covered by clause 22 of the bill, deals with the uniformity of hours, working conditions and holidays in an industry. That is very desirable. If the conditions of labour in any branch of industry are such as to make the work more than ordinarily arduous or dangerous, discrimination of treatment should be made by the payment of higher wages and not by",47,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

129,Mr Stewaet,"Thes e proposals inshortening the hours. The provision reads:The court shall, in making its awards, proprices, a bad drying season, general vide so iar as possible for uniformity in an industry in relation to hours of work, holidays and general conditions. I consider that proposed new section 25 (D) is a very important, but contentious one. It readsThe court shall, before making any award or certifying any agreement, and in proceedings for the variation or cancellation of an award or agreement, take into consideration the probable economic effect of the agreement or award in relation to the community in general, and the probable economic effect thereof upon the industry or industries concerned. That appears to me to be a very far-reaching provision, which will be exceedingly difficult of interpretation. Already arbitration judges have a sufficiently difficult task to adjudicate on the questions of hours, wages and conditions which are submitted to them, and which have to be based upon what is termed our standard living wage. This clause places upon those judges an exceedingly onerous and difficult task, and I fail to see how they will be able to discharge it. Take a suppositious case. Presume that the agricultural implement makers apply for an increase of wages and a decrease of hours, and that, so far as their evidence discloses, the judge considers that ,they are entitled to have their claim granted. Before that is done, however, the judge, under this new provision must ascertain what would be the economic effect of such an increase. He discovers, that the increase will have to be passed on to the primary producers in the form of increased prices for agricultural implements. That will raise the cost of production, of, say, butter and wheat. growers have organized, and they ask for assistance to enable them to decrease their costs. jThe judge will probably determine that an increase of wages to the agricultural implement m alters would, by increasing the cost of production, increase the cost of living, not merely in that trade, but in all other trades. In turn, the employees in other industries would seek higher wages, and so we should have the vicious circle again. I understand the reasons which actuated the Government when it introduced this provision. I shall give an illustration of my point. In 1924 the dried fruits industry was very badly hit through low financial depression, reduced land values and various other causes. The industry was in such a bad economic condition that it could not obtain advances from the financial institutions, and was practically down and out. In order to help it to carry on, the Government introduced the Dried Fruits Advances Act, which appropriated £200,000 for the purpose of assisting the dried fruit growers. In that very season, however, the Arbitration Court granted an increase in wage3 for pickers and others in the industry, I think from £4 6s. to £4 8s. a week. I am not certain as to the figures, and speak subject to correction. The Government must have had such an example in mind when it inserted this clause. cate the impossibility of fixing these things mechanically? cation of the ease with which one can point to the evils of the existing system, and of how difficult it is to suggest a remedy. I fail to see how the judges will be able to carry out the proposed new section. Clause 7, which amends section 7 of the principal act, provides that a sectional strike may be made an excuse for a general strike. It was described by the right honourable member for North. Sydney( Mr Hughes) in a picturesque and terse manner, as having the effect of starting a big fire in order to put out a small one. It makes strikes and lockAlready the wheatouts, in certain conditions, legal. We shall he in the rather extraordinary position of having a legal lockout or a strike which will, in effect, be sanctioned by the Arbitration Court. It is, to say the least of it, a novel provision. In moving the second reading of the bill, the Attorney-General said: "" Let us suppose the court does make such an order, declaring that there is a strike in an industry. Other employers in the industry will then be in a position to lockout their employees."" Does not that mean that if there is a strike in one portion of the works of a big manufacturer, and the manufacturer secures the necessary",48,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
130,Mr Maxwell,Does that not indi,49,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
131,Mr Stewart,"It is one more indideclaration from the court that there is a strike in the industry, he may lockout all his other employees, and every employer of labour in the same industry from one end of Australia to the other, may also lockout his employees in symi pathy with the employer originally affected? Or, alternatively, if there is a lockout in a section of one particular industry, and the union concerned gets the necessary declaration from the court that there is a lockout in the industry, does it not mean that all the unions in that particular industry throughout Australia may strike with the sanction of the court? If that is what it means, an extraordinary position may arise, and it is difficult to foresee what may happen. Clause 8, which imposes penalties on union officials, is a highly contentious provision, and, in my opinion, in operation is bound to fail, because in the end compulsion, .when applied to large bodies of men, is always bound to fail. If a union official is fined, or, in the alternative, is sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the punishment inflicted has no terrors for him; as a matter of fact, union officials glory in being given the opportunity to pose as martyrs. This is amply proved by history. Some years ago when certain British seamen in Melbourne were ordered to return to their ship or go to gaol, they did not cower in fear and trembling; they formed fours in the streets of Melbourne and, with heads up, marched to gaol. And when they returned to Great Britain they told the people there that they received better treatment in an Australian gaol than they could get on a British ship. If British ships are anything like what they were when I starved in the forecastle, they could say this with a good deal of truth. The most contentious, and if I may say it, the most absurd clause of the bill is clause 44, which proposes to enforce the taking of a secret ballot before a strike can be declared. I have a great deal of admiration for the logical mind of the Attorney-General; but I cannot understand how the honourable gentleman could bring himself to the point of drafting, or even approving, of a clause which aims at the impossible. I cannot see the utility of inserting a provision in a bill, making the others refuse to vote? it mandatory to do something which is absolutely impossible. Mr Stewart. how many thousand men there are in the Seamen's Union, but the number is large. Let us assume that a dispute has arisen, and that the union has refused to take a ballot; that under the powers conferred upon it by this bill, the court, insists on, and assumes control of, the taking of a ballot. I do not know whether it is in the bill itself or in the sheaf of amendments which the Attorney-General proposes to move, but there is a provision which gives the court discretion as to whether it will allow absent voting or not. I want to know how it will get a ballot-paper into the hands of every seaman on the coast, how long the ballot will take, and what will happen in the meantime? And, putting aside all these difficulties, and assuming, for the moment, that by some means or other the court finds a way of performing expeditiously the work of getting a ballot paper into the hands of every seaman on the coast, I want to know what then will happen. I have no desire to say anything that will suggest to the seamen, or any other body of men, what they ought to do in such circumstances; but unless there has been a change in the spirit of the seamen since I knew them, I am inclined to think they will tear up the ballot-papers and toss them out of the portholes. ""What will happen then ? It is an attractive ideal to give the unionists control over their own unionsI can quite understand the Prime Minister making the election promise which was repeated on a hundred platforms and published in. a thousand newspapers that the Government proposed to compel trade unions to take secret ballots -bu t it is an attempt to do something which is utterly impracticable. The provision that compels the taking of a secret ballot is the most contentious and one of the most impracticable in the bill. When the Attorney-General replies, I should like him to tell me what proportion of the ballot-papers issued must be returned to ensure a decision. If 10,000 ballot papers are sent out and but 500 are returned will the decision of the few who choose to vote be accepted? I do not know that aspect of the question, I am seeking",49,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
132,Mr Gullett,Why should it not be if,50,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
133,Mr Stewart,"I am not discussingsome information from the Attorney General. The honourable member who interjected must admit that this is one of the cardinal points of the bill. I am merely giving my opinion on it, and my opinion based upon some experience with large bodies of men, is that no matter how attractive it may be in theory, it will be utterly impracticable, and impossible to carry out. It is useless for us to aim at perfection, select committee.*' If a select committee or strive for a Utopia in which there shall be "" peace, perfect peace"" in every industry throughout Australia for all time. Under our present social system it is utterly impossible to prevent strikes and industrial upheavals. I was very glad, therefore, to hear the Attorney-General, in his excellent second-reading speech, deprecate the statement repeatedly made, particularly in the press, that Australia is a land of strikes and upheavals, and in this respect worse than any other country. achieve our ideal of industrial peace is to eliminate as far as possible all coercive measures, and try to appeal to the better nature of people and to the spirit of sweet reasonableness as between class and class, man and man, employer and employee. Honourable members may smile at that, but there is no other way to achieve our object. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) has asked me if 1 would abolish compulsory arbitration. the method suggested by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is the better one to adopt. His suggestion, as I understand it, is to have an industrial organization in each industry, and to have councils in each industry in each State, with a central Federal council. It is a moot point with me whether it would not be better to allow each industry to be separately organized, and, if necessary, to have all the machinery ready for State courts or a Federal court, to operate if both sides appealed for a decision. tory clauses of the bill will be productive of good. The point raised by the Attorney-General with regard to the policing of awards, while we have the court as it is at present constituted, is well worth trying. Theoretically, it is to be commended. I gather from the sheaf of amendments to which I have already referred-n o doubt there will be many more before the bill gets through committee-that we will not know the bill by the time it emerges from committee. If the second reading is agreed to, I propose to move"" That the bill be referred to a representative of all sections in this Parliament were to get to work and study the measure, I think it would be possible to make it a workable piece of legislation. At any rate, the experiment would be well worth trying. It would save time. To take the bill into committee after a rather acrimonious second-reading debate, would simply be to have the fight all over again; it would only lead to a prolonged debate, and I am sure the Attorney-General would not know his own The only way in which we can bill by the time it emerged from committee. So far as the primary producer is concerned, the present pastime of passing the burden on to him will not get this country anywhere. A proper system of organization among employers and employees, and particularly among the primary producers, is what I believe the future holds in store. That will be a big improvement upon the existing conditions. I may be accused of uttering platitudes, but I cannot refrain from I am inclined to think that saying that one of the principal necessities to-day is a reduction in the cost of distribution. On all sides one hears complaints regarding the disparity between the price which the primary producer receives for his product and that which is paid by the consumers of that product in the capita] cities. That disparity is altogether too great. If we look around us and study the facts that can be gleaned from our newspapers we find that a tremendous amount of money is spent in the advertisement of almost every industry. In every capital city one can see glaring blatant advertisements, the cost of which is tremendous. In addition, hordes of travellers are employed. It must be apparent to every one that that is a direction in which unanimity can be arrived at among organized workers and organized primary producers.",50,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

This Parliament should tackle the important question of eliminating foolish and wasteful methods of distributing our primary products, and bridging the gap between the producer and the consumer. I submit in all earnestness and with due deference to honourable members that that is a channel into which this House should divert its energies. The one thing certain is that constant increases in tariff duties and Arbitration Court awards must cease. We should call a halt immediately and'tackle the question of organizing upon an efficient basis both .primary and secondary industries. make this country progress. I rise to support the measure before the House, believing that it will assist us to attain the all important objectiveindustrial peace on a sound and . lasting basis. If I"" thought for one moment that the amendments of the principal act for which it provides would in any way affect injuriously trade unionists in Australia, it must be obvious to any honourable member that it would be an act of political suicide for me to support it, because it is my proud privilege to represent an important industrial constituency, which is comparable in that respect with those of some of my honourable friends who sit on this side and many honourable members who sit opposite. I am quite sure in my own mind that when it is placed upon the statute-book this bill will not have that effect. In fact, I believe that it will help to attain industrial peace and to improve the conditions of the workers generally in this country. I listened this afternoon with keen interest to the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), who delivered a most eloquent and impressive address. He stated quite definitely that he believed that the central compulsory arbitration system in Australia had utterly failed. the Arbitration Court had not succeeded in any way in securing industrial peace, and apparently agreed with those who have stated that the court has tended to promote the organization of conflicting parties and interests in opposite camps. Probably there are other honourable members who hold similar views, but they may not be prepared to state them so definitely. I remind the honourable member for Wannon, however, that it is 24 years since compulsory arbitration was established in this country. If we had had then all the knowledge that we now possess, probably we should have endeavoured to secure some other method of bringing about industrial peace. However, there are to-day tens of thousands of workers in Australia who are satisfied with the existing system, and are abiding by the awards of the court. After all, Only in that way can we only a few unions-importan t ones, undoubtedly-com e into conflict with those awards. I certainly think-and I am sure the honourable member for Wannon will agree with me-that a system which for the last 24 years has been working satisfactorily from the point of view of tens of thousands of workers must be continued, and that the main duty of those who believe in arbitration is to try to improve it wherever that can be done. I have no knowledge of the intentions of the Government, but I personally think that this should be regarded as the last attempt to place that system on a sound basis; and should it fail I do not think that any one would cavil at the Government if it endeavoured to find some other means of obtaining industrial peace in this country. Honourable members of all shades of political opinion agree that it is the duty of every man who plays a part, however humble, in the public life of this country, to strive by every means in his power to bring about satisfactory conditions and peace in industry. No one would be foolish enough to believe or to maintain that this bill is going to cure all the evils and troubles which at the present time are associated with our industrial system. It would be absurd to imagine that that is likely to be the result.

That there is an urgent need for amendment I do not think any honourable member has denied during the course of this debate. For a long time industry in this as well as in other countries has laboured under very difficult, almost intolerable, conditions. That has been due in Australia, I think, to the overlapping of Federal and State awards, and also in many instances to the incompatibility of the decisions of the court with economic realities, as well as to the irreIn other words, in some industries it is apsponsible activities of a few persons who, if they had set out to do it, could not. have had greater success in the direction of wrecking our ship of progress. Really the main object of this bill is to do something towards modifying those conditions, short of removing them altogether. I should like to refer briefly to that provision in the bill which aims at making the awards of the court recognise in some way the economic facts with which Australia is faced. I have listened very carefully to the speeches of honourable members who sit opposite, and it has appeared to me that that is the feature of the bill to which they take the strongest exception. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) strenuously opposed the provision. Apparently, he sees in it a sinister motive and a desire on the part of the Government to upset the principle of a basic wage. I entirely disagree with the honourable gentleman. I am quite sure that nothing is further from the mind of the Government. In fact the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has definitely made that statement. I do not believe that any honourable member on this side of the House would support any move in the direction of upsetting the principle of a basic wage in this country. sary implication? that it is. To me this is one of the most important provisions in the whole measure. Some persons believe that behind the shelter of our tariff protection we can go on piling up the costs of production. harmful to our progress than such a policy. The Tariff Board, in a report which it presented to Parliament last October, uttered a warning to which, I think, every person in this country must pay heed. It was of the utmost importance, and I take this opportunity of reminding honourable members of its purport. Said the board. There is a danger of the tariff being used to bolster up an ever-increasing cost of production, irrespective of any consideration as to the ever-widening gaps between the standard maintained within the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom. It is obvious that the increased duties imposed on certain industries have failed to afford any increased protection. parent that protection is failing to protect. Increased duties have largely failed to achieve their objective. Instead of expansion of manufacture the figures rather revealed stagnation, notwithstanding that stimulation of Australian industry was aimed at. The board went on to express its regret at being obliged to place on record its conclusion that there is in the Commonwealth a tendency to abuse the protective system, and by forcing the pace under disadvantageous conditions to endanger its efficiency. The board also expressed its profound conviction that if Australian industry is to be maintained and safeguarded it is essential that the leaders of our industrial life should recognize the serious menace of the rising costs of production. The situation was regarded by the board as being too critical to waste time on trumped up charges of bias. The serious attention of all parties to this matter was requested by the board, and it stated definitely that, if that is not given, we can look forward to nothing but disaster. Those remarks from an authority the impartiality of which I do not think any one has ever questioned must be regarded as a warning to us. We have been told that, if an industry cannot concede the hours and wages that are demanded in Australia it does not deserve to exist. I entirely agree with that contention. But if, when we refer to industry, we include in our observation only capital and management, we do not really speak of industry; for, after all, the duty of the employees in regard to advancing the interests and making a success of an industry is as great as that Nothing could be more of the employers. I say quite definitely that I am not one of those who would be",52,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

140,Mr D. Cameron,"I cannot seea party to lowering the standard of living of the wage-earner in Australia. That is the last thing I should like to see done. But it must be admitted that there is a vast difference between maintaining a reasonable standard of living and following a policy that must lead to the annihilation of industry in Australia. That, I think, is the choice which confronts the people of the Commonwealth to-day. We able comfort and a reasonable standard of living on the one hand, aud stagnation, unemployment aud impoverishment on the other. Obviously it is in the interests of the wage-earner, as much as anybody else, that Australia should make steady progress along the road to national greatness in wealth and power, built upon a ""vast network of flourishing industries. If this bill helps to bring about a realization that economic facts must be considered, it will justify its introduction on that, score alone. With the other provisions of the measure aiming at doing away with the tyranny sometimes exercised by union oflicials, the placing of responsibility for peace of the country, and for controlling the conduct of union oflicials directly on the organizations that they represent; and requiring the taking of secret ballots to enable the members of unions to control their own organizations, I am heartily in accord. Honourable members opposite cannot advance any definite reason why they should prove injurious to trade unionism or why the Government and its supporters would try to do injury to the trade unions or to the unionists themselves. A definite mandate was given by the people to the Prime Minister in November, 1925, to do all he could to suppress industrial disorder and unrest, aud the bill under discussion represents' as near an approach as possible to meeting the demands of the electors. Minister, in discussing the bill, stated that the Government was merely carrying out the pledge that it gave to the people at the last election. He explained that the Nationalist party asked the people for a definite mandate on certain matters, and he reminded tbe House what some of those matters were. He. ilr. D. Cameron. and I think every honourable .membfiwho sits behind him, promised to take definite action against that section of the community, few in number though they were, who were endeavouring t.o subvert constitutional institutions, and to hinder the external and internal commerce of the country. We also promised the people that we would take action against those who were endeavouring to must choose between reasonfoment industrial strife, class war, and direct action. We said further that we would do everything in our power to overcome the chaotic industrial conditions due to the overlapping and duplication of Commonwealth and State awards, and would give trade unionists full power to deal with their own affairs, conferring upon them the benefit of the secret ballot. Those were the definite assurances on which the Government and its supporters went to the country, and on them the Government was returned with an increased majority. There is no sinister motive whatever in the minds of the Government or its followers in introducing this bill. We believe that arbitration is an effective instrument for maintaining the industrial industrial conditions. The Leader of the Opposition, aud those who sit behind him, hold the same opinion; but it cannot be denied that some people-ad mittedly not a great number-openl y state that their objective is to smash arbitration. Surely those of us who believe in arbitration and conciliation, no matter on which side of the House we sit, should join forces in order to amend our legislation and make our arbitration laws as effective as possible in assisting to maintain industrial peace. I propose to read two pamphlets that have come into my possession. They were issued by the Central Executive of the Communist Party of Australia, and printed by the Proletarian Press, of 52 Tho Prime Trafalgar-street, Annandale. One of the pamphlets reads as followsKILL BRUCE'S BILL . A MOVE TO S.\iASn TRADE UNIONISM . The Communist Party's Call to Action. The entire hoss class of Australia is clamouring for a reduction in our living standard in order to satisfy its greed for greater profits. The British financiers, who are planning to make Australia a special field for the investment of their surplus wealth, are demanding "" economy"" in the State administration as a guarantee for tlieir dividends. This explains the retrenchment in the Government service. The Nationalist party is the mouthpiece of the exploiters. Legalizing the Bludgeon. The Federal Government now proposes by means of its Arbitration Amendment Bill to secure full control over the trade unions, making them mere appendages of the governmental machine. Every attempt at militant action can be legally suppressed under the penal clauses of the bill. Scabbery will be accorded full protection, and, by means of heavy fines for any ordinary act of trade union routine, our organizations can be "" legally "" outlawed. Parliament of No Use. The mock debates that will take place in Parliament will not avail in preventing the passage of the bill. The anti-Labour majority will be successful. Reliance on Labour politicians is futile, for did they not place on the statute-book compulsory training and the infamous War Precautions Act? The real struggles of tlie workers are not fought in Parliament, but on the industrial field by the militant action of the workers themselves. Take ActionNow! ! ! There is no time to be lost. Agitation and organization must be commenced ou an Australian-wide scale. Porce every trade union official and Labour politician into the campaign. Hold workshop meetings. Arrange mass meetings for Saturday mornings. Establish fighting councils of action on inleast imaginative among the people. dustrial lines (where none already exist) to organize a break with arbitration and militant opposition to the union-smashing measure. Brace's Bludgeon Must be Destroyed. Arbitration is completely discredited, and must be discarded. Only militant action can protect the workers. The other pamphlet issued by the Central Executive of the Communist Party of Australia is as followsDown with the Anti-Union Bill. Conscription during the last war was only defeated in Australia by the militancy of the Labour movement. For the Next War. The designs of the Imperialist Powers against Soviet Russia and the clash of interest between Great Britain and the D.S.A. are speedily tending towards another outbreak of war, which will centre around the Pacific Ocean countries. Conscription, both for war and industry, will inevitably be brought in by all countries involved. Bruce has already stated that "" When Britain is at war, Australia is automatically at war."" To Crush Militancy. It is in order to render the Australian Labour movement more docile and submissive, both to the economic demands and the warlike designs of Bruce and his imperialist masters, that this union-smashing bill is introduced. It is intended to crush the last ounce of militancy out of the trade unions, to so weaken the resisting power of the workers as to leave them mere productive machines and cannon fodder for the benefit of British Imperialism. Workers of Australia, tlie situation is critical. Bow the Workers will Win. Get together against the war-mongers! Fight every scheme to weaken militancy in the Labour movement! Kill these plans by killing Bruce's bill! Solidarity Spells Success. Move through your unions and Labour Councils for a mighty stop-work demonstration of all workers in the Commonwealth, the date to be fixed by the A.C.T.TJ. On to the Victory of the Worfoiuo; Class. That is the sort of poison that is spread throughout the country. As I have already said, those of us who believe in arbitration, irrespective of which side we take in politics, should join in an honest attempt to preserve and improve our present system. The need, too, for maintaining the safeguard of constitutional government must be patent to-day to the I shall now refer to one or tw,o of the objections that have been raised to the bill. In the first instance, it has been said repeatedly that the measure follows the lines of the British Trade UnionsB ill . As a matter of fact there is no resemblance between the two bills. The Round Table of June, 1927, gives, at page 566, a short account of the British measure. The Attorney-General, Sir Douglas Hogg, introduced it in the House of Commons, and, in explaining the Government's intentions, he declared them to be founded on four propositions1. That a general strike is illegal and no man shall be penalized for refusing to take part in it ; 2. That intimidation is illegal and no man shall be compelled by threat to abstain from work against his will: 3. That no man shall be compelled to subscribe to the funds of any political party unless he so desires; 4. Tliat any person entering the establislied terms of these propositions. Civil Service must give his undivided allegiance to the State. The Labour party opposed the b ill to the uttermost and some Liberals, including Mr Lloyd George, voted w it h Labour for its rejection. Sir John Simon was absent unpaired, having previously given his blessing to the objects of the bill, though he considered it needed amendment. He pointed out that the objections to the bill were of three kinds, and he saidWhen the Government of the day introduces a contentious bill and asks the support of the House for its principles on second reading, there are, I suppose, three kinds of grounds upon which the Government application may be rejected. We have had, in the course of the debate on the second reading of this bill indications that all three grounds are -taken. First, I suppose, it is possible in reference to tween employers and workmen, or between any bill, to challenge the avowed objects of the bill altogether, and to declare that the authors of the bill, when they describe what they are aiming at doing, are aiming at something which is wrong and bad. There arc some members of the House who will, I think, take up that attitude in regard to this bill. There is a second and quite distinct line of attack and one which it is very material to mention in connection with this bill, namely, the criticism that, whatever may be the avowed objects of the bill tlie method which it seeks to adopt and the language in which it seeks to express its objects are such as to make the bill worthy of rejection at this stage. There is the third and it seems to me a perfectly legitimate ground in a proper case, upon which a contentious bill may sometimes be resisted, and it is this: That even. if the avowed objects of the bill and even the methods and language of the bill are appropriate, none the less as a matter of high policy it is much better to leave things alone. In some cases all these grounds were taken by the same critic. George contended that what was wanted was not negative, but constructive posals in the direction of improving the machinery of conciliation. The third and fourth of the Government's dealing with subscriptions political parties and the allegiance of civil servants to the State, while strongly opposed, presented a plain issue. The first and second propositions dealing with the illegality of a general strike and intimidations were different. the main purpose of statutes existing at the time was to protect the right to strike, and measure was to limit it within ilr. J). Cameron. The first question raised was whether the clauses concerned with the general strike and intimidation were not so drawn as to go beyond the declared intention. There was a fear that they might even cripple the right to strike. The material part of the provision as it originally stood was as follows:It is hereby declared that any strike having any object besides the furtherance of a trade dispute within the trade or industry in which the strikers are engaged is an illegal strike, if it is a strike designed or calculated to coerce the Government or to intimidate the community or any substantial portion of the community, and that it is illegal to commence or continue, or to apply any sums in furtherance or support of any such illegal strike. For the purpose of the foregoing provision, a trade dispute shall not be deemed to be within a' trade or industry unless it is a dispute beworkmen and workmen in that trade or industry, which is connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions of labour of persons in that trade or industry. Provisions follow prescribing penalties for participating in illegal strikes, and safeguards against trades union workmen who refuse to take part in them. The advocates of the bil l claimed that it was necessary to protect, not only ordinary citizens, but trade unionists themselves. Labour claimed that the right to strike is the sole substance of collective bargaining of trade unionists, whose rights it contended would be unfairly limited by the bill. There are thousands of trade unionists who dislike class warfare. Mr Phillip Snowden, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Ramsay MacDonald GoMr Lloyd vernment, in January last said They recognized the existence of the class prowar, but he had always understood socialism to aim at the abolition of the class war. Referring to Mr Cook, of the Miners' propositions Federation, and those who, claiming to to funds of speak On behalf of a. section of the working class, deny that it is possible to improve the lot of the wage-earning class under the existing system, Mr. Snowden said: "" That was the sheerest nonsense,"" and he added, ""he welcomed It was claimed that the work upon which Mr Ben Turner and his colleagues were engaged, and hoped that it was evidence of a genuine and deep that the object of the"" new desire on the part of both sides to come the together to remove at least some of the obstacles which barred the way to progress."" Mr Ben. Tillett whose words and views still count for something with trade unionists speaking at a labour meeting in England in February last, saidThe Trade Union Council had definitely entered upon a national campaign for re-construction and re-organization. obstacles to 100 per cent, trade unionism were created by the flagrant and malignant elements of mischief in their midst. The work of the Trades Union Council was to educate and encourage the rank and file to realization of the sense of personal and individual responsibility. The most hopeful recent sign was tbe coming joint conference between the Trades Union General Council, and the miners' executive to consider the steps to be taken to defend trade union principles, and maintain the strength of the Miners' Federation. He hoped that this conference would result in file elimination of the "" mad mullah,"" element which has been too long runto bring about industrial peace and better ning amok. The most impressive speech delivered in the House of Commons in support of the Trades Union Bill was that of a miners' representative, Mr Spencer, who, after the breakaway from the policy of the Miners' Federation, last year, had begun in Nottinghamshire, took charge of and organized the breakaway. Mr Spencer has been ejected from the Labour party in the House of Commons. His personal testimony to the overbearing methods practised within the federation, and the diversion of industrial machinery to political ends, was unanswerable. It is clear that noisy, active political minorities tend to conduct industrial business of many trades unions. It has been said that owing to the defeat of the referendum in 1926 this bill is an effort on the part of the Government to save its face. A cir^ cular prepared by the Attorney-General's Department has been issued to honourable members clearly setting out the difference between the referendum proposals of 1926 and the provisions of the bill, which no doubt honourable members have closely studied. I listened with keen interest to the Speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), the Hansard report of which I have since read more than once, but I gave any definite reasons for his statement that the measure, if placed on the statute-book^ would destroy the faith of the workers of the Commonwealth in the principle of arbitration. Its real object is to control the activities of that tyrannical minority to which I have already referred-to make industrial unions stronger and safer, and in the hope of securing industrial peace and placing industry on a sounder basis much brighter. I sincerely trust that honourable members Most of the opposite, although strongly opposed to the bill in its present form, will do all they can during the committee stage to improve it in any possible way. I am sure that every proposal or suggestion they make will receive the most earnest consideration of the Government, I feel convinced that those who do believe in' arbitration will do all they can to improve the present system by assisting to pass this measure, since in doing so they will at least be making a definite attempt conditions in industry. [9.6] -The speech of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) will not, I think, convince even himself. He commenced by making the father amazing statement that this is the final attempt which this Government proposes to make to bring about industrial peace. thing of that kind. that this measure was intended to carry out the mandate given to the Government at the last general election. I do not wish to misrepresent the honourable member for Brisbane, and perhaps the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who is nearer to the honourable member than I am, heard his exact Words. If , however, I understood the honourable member for Brisbane aright, he said that if this bill were passed the Government would be able to say that it had done everything in its power to carry out the mandate given to it at the last election. thing of the sort. the honourable member should speak distinctly instead of reading his speech at such a rapid rate that it is difficult to cannot find where he understand what he is saying.

145,Mr Parker Moloney,"Thenhave been made by other honourable members on that side of the chamber. In bringing forward this bill the Government makes the amazing claim that it is giving effect to the promise it made to the people prior to the last general election. ( Mr Bruce) enunciated the Government's policy at the last election, and fortunately we have on record the statements of the right honourable gentlemen. TheseI propose to quote. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) and the honourable member for Brisbane words used by the Prime during the last election campaign, and endeavoured to make his utterances on that occasion coincide with the provisions of this bill. The honourable member for Brisbane read from a document containing statements made by certain persons known as communists, or wild extremists, and who are opposed to arbitration. Of course, I can quite understand honourable members opposite being anxious to quote from such documents; a number of them would not occupy seats in this chamber but for the utterances of these persons. This bill proves conclusively that there is an alliance between the extremists and the Government. munists say, quite definitely, that they are opposed to arbitration, and if honourable members will peruso the bill they will see that from beginning to end it strikes a blow at compulsory arbitration. honourable members will read clause 7 of the measure, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), they will see that such is the case. The honourable member for Brisbane congratulated the honourable member for Wannon upon the splendid speech he delivered; but the honourable member for Wannon summed up the measure in these words, "" This bill does not touch the fringe of our troubles."" If the honourable member for Brisbane will refer to clause 7 of the bill, he will find that if a section of an industry creates trouble or causes a strike, the emevery decent citizen was wildly cheered. ployers can approach the Arbitration Court, and if the court agrees that there is a strike in a section of the industry, a Mr Parker general lockout is automatically proclaimed pended. The Prime Minister Any honourable member who challenges that statement has not read the bill. Thai provision was illustrated by the right honourable member for North Sydney when he said that if a fire occurred in a corner of a paddock the remedy, according to the principle embodied in this measure, was not ( Mr D. Cameron) quoted to extinguish it, but to set fire to the whole Minister paddock. The right honourable member delivered an admirable speech, but spoilt it by saying that he intended to support the bill. His attitude reminded me of the doctor, employed by an assurance company, who, on examining a person who wished to assure his life, said that although his heart, lungs, kidney and liver were diseased he would pass him. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that, although everything in the bill was wrong, he intended to support it. It is regrettable to find that some honourable members opposite, who do not approve of the bill, intend to support it, merely, I suppose, because the party whip Comhas been cracked. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) and Jhe honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) have If told us that, at the last election, the Government received a mandate to introduce a bill of this description. But what was the mandate? The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) discussed this point in a speech which he delivered in the Sydney Town Hall on the Monday prior to the election. I quote the following paragraph from the report of that meeting which appeared in the Melbourne Age:Tlie audience listened seriously to his explanation as to how communists had got control of the Labour movement, and cheered wildly when he said they should be taken by the seat of the trousers and the scruff of the neck and thrown out. His statement that he would take the return of his Government as a definite mandate to maintain law and order was heartily welcomed, and his determination to put strife-mongers well out of the sight of I suppose that the right honourable gentleman said the same kind of thing in practically every speech that he delivered Moloney during that camTaai"""" TTP. used the name",57,Conscription Bsuce S Pla V Fob The Next War

147,Mr Parker Moloney,"Yes.of "" J o c k "" Garden and certain other names frequently. I daresay that he w ill repeat similar arguments during the next campaign. It cannot be denied that he gave the people the impression that, if the Government were returned to power, persons like "" Jock"" Garden would be included among those who, he said, would not. be allowed to continue to mingle with decent people. A t a pre-election meeting which he addressed at Mitcham, in Victoria, the right honourable gentleman saidWe have seen our industries held up, our laws defied, and suggestions made for the overthrow of constitutional government. We have no room for such doctrines here. . . . The Government, if returned to power-as it certainly would be-woul d get rid of those people who were spreading extreme doctrines, and take measures to bring about industrial peace. It is remarkable that two and a half years after the election the same bogies are being held up to frighten the community. I have no doubt that, during the next election campaign, the bolsheviks, the communists, and the particular individuals referred to by the Prime Minister in 1925 w ill be blamed for our industrial turmoil and that the Labour party w ill be held responsible for their presence in Australia. But w i ll such statements be accepted * by the general public? I hardly think so. Let me read to ""honourable members a paragraph from an article which appeared in a typical provincial newspaper, which circulates throughout the Riverina. it? Border MorningM a i l . This newspaper has probably as large a circulation as any New South Wales country journal. The article, which was written prior to the introduction of this bill, readsThe Federal Parliament resumed its session last Tuesday-the final session before it goes to the electors again. The session is bound to be of certain importance, because, if the Goveniment wishes to appear in the best light before the electors at the next elections, it will have to give serious thought to those things not done, which were promised to the people at the last election. It will be remembered that at the last elections the seamen's strike was a strong lever, used to the final dimension by the Nationalists, in their passage to victory, and the assurance of the Prime Minister and hi3 supporters that the Government, if returned to power, would bring about a drastic change in the matter of strikes, helped materially to secure that return. Nothing has been done to meet that promise. Only a shadowy effort to bring about a conference between labour and capital has been attempted. Unless the Federal Government docs something effective in the way of keeping the promises of its Ministers and members at the last election, the public will have some nasty questions for Nationalists and coalitionists at the hustings. Meanwhile, another hold-up of the shipping of the Commonwealth is well under way, and that will not be of much help to the Bruce-Page Ministry. It is gratifying to honourable members to find certain newspapers not hesitating to expose such political dishonesty and admitting the f u t i l it y of the Government trying to repeat, with any hope of success, the tactics that it used during the last campaign. Let honourable members compare the quotation which I have just read with the claims which have been made during this debate to the effect that the Government is now giving effect to the mandate which it received upon its last appeal to the people. The same newspaper published a very interesting article after this bill was submitted to Parliament. I quote the following from it : 'Che Government has failed in all its promises to bring abouff a state of greater peace and prosperity in the industrv of the country for the simple reason that political considerations were too strong for those few individuals who have found themselves in this foreign galley who wish to take the bull by the horns and to legislate from a common sense point of view. The Coalition Government will full again simply because it has not W h a t is the name of the courage to face political considerations. That which it is doing now is a mere tinkering with the question. We are again hearing Act and of some clauses which are being introduced to "" tighten up"" the bill. The biii cannot be tightened up; it is rotten from the first clause to the last because it is a truckling to votes and to the franchise of the electors. It has not one feeble motive to assure the country that it is true arbitration. For it is not. It is a farce, and, in adding to the scenes the Coalition Government, even if it succeeds in its intentions, will only be adding further farcical matter to it. The Border MorningM a i l does not support the Labour party, and has never clone so; but it rebounds to its credit that it is fearless enough to expose the Government's glaring breach of its election promises.",58,Conscription Bsuce S Pla V Fob The Next War

149,Mr Parker,"that the bill is uot sufficiently drastic. quite definitely that the bill is rotten from beginning to end, and is not capable of improvement. No one with any sense attempts to build upon a bad foundation. We were told prior to the last election that if the Government were returned it would hurl out of the Oommonwealth the extremists who, acording to the Prime Minister were disturbing our industrial activities. Many easily-led people were excited to a state of hysteria and said "" This is the Government for us. It will deal with these agitators."" It WPS upon the appeal to prejudice and passion lhat the Government won its majority at the last election. Buti t will not be able to repeat at the coming election the tactics it adopted upon the last occasion. were mentioned by the Prime Minister during that campaign have never been brought before a court. they never will be brought before one, for they are too useful to the Government and its supporters. They will be used during the coming election. But I sincerely trust that the people will see through such unworthy tactics, and will not allow their passions to be excited. Has any honourable member opposite the courage to say now, as the Prime Minister did during the 1925 campaign, that men like Jock Garden should be deported ? If not, let them be manly enough to refrain from tickling the ears of the electors with such threats at election tinie. Those old stalking horses will not be as effective in the next campaign as they have been previously. that Jock Garden has abjured communism and become a good reformer. of Tom Walsh. name of Jock Garden or Tom Walsh does uot serve the purpose of the Government during the next campaign, some other name will be found to do it. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr whole industry. It is clear that Mackay) spent a good deal of his time this afternoon in talking about a person"" who, he said, had been sent to Moscow recently as the representative of the Australian Labour party. Although his statement was corrected, the honourable member did not withdraw it. First he read a long statement which he attributed to the person he mentioned, and then he endeavoured to connect him with tin; Labour party. Such statements may be accepted without question at election meetings which the honourable member addresses in Queensland, or at a Sunday School tea meeting, but they will not be accepted here. The honourable member is unable to prove that there is one communist in the Labour movement. honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is so accustomed to issuing misleading statements in election pamphlets that he thinks they will not be disputed in this chamber.

168,Mr Parker Moloney,"Wil lthe country of the communists, who are held responsible for the disorder which exists in the community, now is the time to act. It should not wait until the next election. This party invites the Government to deal with these so-called disturbers of the peace as it indicated at the last election it would do. for Henty( Mr Gullett) said' that he would take the communists down Hobson's Bay in a vessel and tip them overboard. honourable member for Henty makes these wild statements at meetings of the National Women's League, but in this House he is very meek and mild. Probably during the next election campaign he will repeat the statements. I agree with the honourable member for many things in our midst which ought to be remedied will not be remedied by this legislation. Eeference has been made to the disabilities under which many of our primary producers labour. This bill will not improve their lot. One would think from the remarks pf those opposite that all their troubles were due to the high wages they have to pay to their employees; but there are in Australia hundreds of struggling farmers who only at harvest time employ a few men. Many of them employ no labour at all. Yet they suffer hardships. This bill will not alleviate their troubles. If the Government were to make an effort to remedy the evils spoken of by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Eodgers) it would extend the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, and render practical assistance to the primary producers. which is a typical country district, there are only two branches of the Commonwealth Bank. So far as financial assistance is concerned, the producers there are in as bad a way as they were before the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, owing to the faulty administration of that great institution. The difficulties which confront he man on the land + to-day because of alleged high wages are infinitesimal compared with those which arise from other causes. A farmer who desires to settle his sons on the land finds it extremely difficult to do so. with that matter ? plying to the statement made by honourable members opposite that the disabilities of the man on the land to-day are caused by trouble with his employees. That is not the cause of his present unsatisfactory position. The antiquated system of distribution -referred to by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) imposes a much heavier burden on the primary producer than do the wages he has to pay to those he employs. Nearly everything that he buys passes through a number of middlemen, each of whom wants his profit. The same is true of practically everything he sells. These are some of the real grievances of the farmer. My experience has been that the intelligent Wannon( Mr Eodgers) that farmer is wide-awake to the election bogies about wages, and knows well where his chief disadvantages come from. The Government knows that these are the read difficulties confronting the primary producers; but because their removal would offend its friends who contribute to its election funds, it does nothing. If the Government believes that it received from the electors a mandate to remedy the state of affairs existing in industry, why has it delayed the introduction of this bill for two and a half years? Once it had regained the Treasury bench the Government did not even call Parliament together for many weeks. To use a colloquialism, it sat back and laughed up its. sleeve at the joke it perpetrated, on the people. in January. little more than the swearing in of members was done. "" another joke "" of the same kind at the next election. the only way by which the Government will retain office. When the last appeal to the electors was made the Government knew that its record of achievements would not satisfy them. Its sins of omission and commission were so many that it knew that it stood condemned in the sight of the people. It , therefore,.",60,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes

Ho said that a few foreign individuals were throwing spanners into the industrial machinery, and were responsible for the industrial turmoil in Australia, and that if the Government were returned, it would rid this country of those extremists. Since then two and a half years have elapsed, and these individuals who were named by the Treasurer are still here. I suppose that the Treasurer will now make the last speech on the second reading of the bill in order to repeat his trite statements without any honourable member having an opportunity to reply to them. That action is typical of him/ The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) laughs, yet he admits that the Government has another "" joke"" ready for the next election. deny it. that it was only a joke that the Government put over the people at the last electralia, who, it contends, have for years tion. so. I have not the slightest doubt that the Treasurer will have the last say, as he did when we discussed tbe sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. He will use the arguments that he used at the last election. Let me tell him that he will then have to find another joke, to use the words of the honourable member for Warringah. I venture to say that the people of Australia, as a result of the last election, have been taught a lesson, and the Government will have to make careful preparations if it wishes to again clause 44 which provides for the taking deceive them. The provisions of this bill, if given effect, will not decrease, but rather increase strikes. No one would seriously contend that the object of the bill is to decrease strikes. That cannot be the interpretation of its provisions. Honourable members behind the Government contend that by providing for a secret ballot much of our industrial turmoil will cease. The Labour party has no objection to the secret ballot. for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) to-night said that the secret ballot would result in a farce, because the men could not be made to vote. Ballot-papers can be issued to them, but they need not be filled in. Let us concede that the men will accept the ballot-papers and vote on the merits of the dispute. What will happen if they vote for a strike ? If they vote in the affirmative their organization may be fined £1,000 and each individual member £100. to vote! so. If the men vote against a strike, all will be well as far as the Government is concerned. Yet honourable members say that this bill is to give effect to the great principle of arbitration, and to the secret ballot, in accordance with their promise to the people at the last elections. of the franchise? parently, in the opinion of the Government; yet it says that the bill has been introduced in the interests of the great majority of the trade unionists of Ausbeen looking for some effective means to save themselves from the extremists. That argument is so absurd and ridiculous that it is a wonder that the Attorney General has the effrontery to ask honourable members to consider seriously the acceptance of a measure that has such stupid and impractical provisions. Honourable members who say that the trade unionists are anxiously awaiting this measure know little of their views. clause is the honourable member referring ? of a secret ballot. Let us concede, for the sake of illustration, that the so-called extremists have been responsible for most of the industrial turmoil in Australia. If the guilt is sheeted home to these individuals, what does the Government intend to do? It proposes not to deal with them in the way suggested at the last election, but to give the employer permission to approach the Arbitration Court, and to ask it fo The honourable member declare that a strike exists in the industry.

I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), that there are faults in our arbitration system. It is by no means perfect, and nobody contends that it is. We should have in our system of arbitration more of the spirit of conciliation mainly by means of round-table conferences. The time has come for that. The bill will not get us anywhere, except to increase our troubles. We should endeavour to get down to basic facts by bringing both parties together in a spirit of conciliation. Unfortunately under this bill the Government proposes to use the big stick, and that will not be tolerated by the workers of this country. At the time of the last election there was a shipping strike on our coast. The then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), interviewed Sir William Clarkson, Chairman of the Commonwealth Shipping Board, and as a result the Commonwealth fleet continued its sailings. That practically had the effect of settling the dispute. that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was recently sold. lieve that there is something in that suggestion. When Sir William Clarkson refused to fall into line with the other ship-owners by tying up the Australian Prime Minister asked him for an explanation. quite properly reminded the Prime Minister Shipping Board was outside political control. It was a very effective answer. Sir William Clarkson entered into an arrangement to end the shipping dispute so far as the Australian Commonwealth Line was concerned, and he contended that he had a perfect right to do so. If another shipping strike occurs, the Shipping Board will not be in existence, and the Government will thus be able to get all the political capital it requires for election purposes. There should be in the relations between the seamen and the ship-owners more of that spirit of conciliation which brought to an end the shipping strike of 1925. This bill is an attempt to dragoon and bludgeon the workers into accepting the dictum of the Government. To settle industrial disputes we must have a greater measure of conciliation. should try it on the marine cook3. any provision in this bill which, if given effect, would end the cooks' strike? If there is, let the honourable member for Wakefield point to it. the strike would quickly end. doubt he will tell the electors of Wakefield what he would do to settle the strike, but this is the place where he should state his remedy. Honourable members opposite will say on the hustings, as they said before, that the extremists should be seized by the scruff of the neck aud hurled out of the country. A lot of people fall for that' sort of guff. The honourable member for Wakefield asks what we on this side of the House will do to settle the marine cooks' dispute. It was for that reason My reply is that we are not in power; the Government has a sufficient majority, and it promised the people at the last election to put an end to all industrial trouble. Yet it remain helpless and futile. What does it propose to do to settle this dispute? Commonwealth Line the this bill. any provision in the bill that will help that the Commonwealth to settle any trouble? member so afraid of the bill? honourable member misrepresents me? To consider the bill is a mere wasting of time. The Government claims that it received a mandate from the people to deal with industrial trouble. Such trouble has been more or less constant ever since the last general election, and the Government is as helpless as a child regarding it. Peace cau be established between grown men only in one way-no t by using the hobnailed boot, and the big stick, but by conciliation and reasonableness.

The honourable member for Brisbane said that this measure represents the final attempt to handle this problem, and that if it fails currents and heaving tides are unaffectedthe -Government will at least have done everything in its power. bound to f a i l; it will promote rather than prevent trouble, and therefore all persons who wish to see the right thing done should tell the Government frankly what they really think of the measure. If that were done the Government would cast these proposals to the four winds. propose to refer now to the details of the bill that have been discussed so freely in the course of this debate, but seem to me more appropriate for consideration in committee; I prefer to review the bill in its general relation to the legislation and government of the country. When compulsory arbitration was first introduced, many people shook their heads and doubted that it would effect the objects for which it was designed. Some thought that the very words "" compulsory arbitration"" were in themselves a contradiction of terms, inasmuch as compulsion was at variance with the spirit of conciliation, which should permeate arbitration. But those who had conscientious doubts had their voices drowned by the plaudits of those who thought that a considerable step was being taken towards the industrial millenium. However high the motives and ideals that prompted this new legislation, time alone could determine whether it would be beneficial or injurious to the country. At first it appeared to work well, and there was no cause to doubt that a great and beneficial reform had been introduced. After all, arbitration is a system of compromise. When employees demanded improvements in their conditions, they did not always get all they wanted; every settlement was a compromise, yet invariably they gained by their application to the court. No harm was seen in this process at the time, because the increased cost to industry was simply transferred by the employers to the public, and the public paid because it was persuaded that industrial peace was worth the extra price. The peace thus created was more apparent than real; it was rather a temporary quiescence such as follows the pouring of oil on troubled waters: the great underThe temporary alleviation of local The bill is troubles through the medium of the Arbitration Court had no real effect upon the great under-currents of human thought and desire. The use of the words "" industrial peace"" is an example of the widespread tendency nowadays for the public mind to be dominated by mere phrases, and I know of no subject in connection with which more high-sounding phrases are current than arbitration. We have heard in the course of this debate a great deal about the need for industrial peace. What is peace? Different people have different conceptions of it. A peace may be very destructive. Tacitus said, "" There are'those who would make a desert and call it peace."" A l though at first no difficulties arose out of arbitration-the new panacea for industrial ills-tim e and experience gradually revealed developments which had not been foreseen. We often hear scathing remarks about men whose one idea in business is to make profits. But profits are an essential part of business; without them business is impossible. They provide the funds which render possible the extension of existing industries 'and the establishment of new ones; therefore, if profits are eliminated from business, sooner or later industry will cease. At first the higher wages awarded by the arbitration courts had little noticeable effect; but with successive increases of the burdens on industry profits became less and less, and more precarious. It may be said that the Arbitration Court deals with many other things besides wages; but, as a matter of fact, everything it does affects the proportion of output which must be allocated to the wage fund. Its awards deal either with increases in pure wages, with reductions of hours, so that the same wage is paid for less work, or with alterations of conditions, every improvement of which is a further tax on the proceeds of industry. Wages is a sufficiently generic term to cover all these things. Presently, therefore, this ship of arbitration did not seem to be sailing very well.",63,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes
196,Mr Mann (Perth) [10.4],"I do notI t was uot keeping steadily on its course, and it was thought that an increased spread of canvas should be given to it to steady it upon the waves. The manufacturers, finding that their profits were being threatened by the awards of the Arbitration Court, and by competition from abroad, united with the employees to demand increased tariff protection, by means of which they could extract from the public that increased contribution, which alone could keep in existence the system which arbitration had established. In other words, the reduction of profits occasioned by increases in wages could only be made up by an increased protective tariff, under which an extra toll could be levied on the public. The public still paid the increased prices, and carried the burden of the tariff, because they had been persuaded that it was necessary, and because a dominance had been acquired over their minds by preaching to them all sorts of patriotic rubbish. By these means they were induced to take on burdens which they knew they should not have to bear. A big leak had developed in the ship, but it still continued to float. and the people are becoming tired of This demand on the people increased regularly, but it was found that it could not go on increasing indefinitely. The continual rise in wages, and the consequent increase in prices, began to tax the buying power of the people unduly, and now the situation has got beyond the limits of wealth production. For a further period economic difficulties which were pressing upon the community were staved off, and the system of tariffs, plus Arbitration Court, was maintained by borrowing from abroad. Presently, however, the effects of that became so obvious that a public outcry was raised against excessive borrowing, and there seems at last,to be a certain amount of determination on the part of the Government to curtail this mischievous practice. Now we have come to a very interesting, but very difficult period in the development of this system: The public are beginning to protest by refusing to buy. That is the most effective protest of all; the only really effective one which the public can make when their interests are being systematically sacrificed by both employers and employees. This feeling of exasperation on the part of the public is aggravated by the realization that this thing for which they have been asked to make such, sacrifices, this goal of industrial peace for which they have suffered so much financial loss, is notbeing attained. Strikes are continually taking place, causing dislocations of trade, and interrupting national services, while there is great and growing unemployment everywhere throughout the country. The poor old ship of compulsory arbitration is now almost dismantled. A last effort .is being made to save it, and this measure is by way of a jury mast to bring it into a safe haven. The bill is the natural and logical sequel to a whole series of past events. It is the natural development of policies which have been imposed on the people of Australia without any real regard to the deep, underlying economic effects which they would produce. There is a demand on the part of the public for a bill of this kind. They say that they have made sacrifices enough, and have not got that for which those sacrifices were made. Strikes still occur, them. Every day there is some fresh complaint, more absurd and more unreasonable than the last. This sort of thing should stop, and it is the duty ""of the Government to stop it. There is also a feeling amongst a large section of the community that the employers have had the thin end, and the employees the thick end of the stick, so far as arbitration awards are concerned. I am not concerned at the moment as to whether that is true or not. The very able speech of the Prime Minister-on e of the best I have heard from him in this Housedealt with that aspect of the matter, and showed how it has become necessary to supplement the Arbitration act by such compulsory measures as will make those who come before the court respectiful of its decisions and awards. Unfortunately, the Government has been placed in a difficult situation. It is really very much in the position of the foolish person who intervenes in a quarrel between a man and his wife. Both the combatants will be sure to unite and turn upon the peacemaker. That is what is being done now. From both the employers and employees we hear nothing but criticism of this bill: complaints of its inadequacy and insufficiency. We have heard during this debate the criticisms of Labour. I shall quote one or two statements that have been made showing that dissatisfaction seems to be as strong on the employers' side as on that of the Labour unions. Much has been said about a certain circular that was distributed by the Metal Trades Association, from which 1 shall quote the following paragraph:Industrial arbitration has abeautiful ideal, and a righteous one. It was originally evolved to protect the workers who are unable to economically protect themselves. so. It has overdone it . It has pampered them so that they have become bowelless tyrants and unmitigated ruffians towards the industries from which they draw their sustenance. Away with it , and let us get back to the clear, open, economic ring. The employees want to maintain the Arbitration Court, and to retain the right to strike or exercise job control, as they will. The employers want to abolish the Arbitration Court and to maintain the advantages of a protective tariff, and at the same time they want to preserve the monopoly given to them by the Navigation Act. Obviously, both parties are wrong. They cannot have it both ways. The statement from the Metal Trades Association is a very extraordinary one. I do not know whether it was written by the same gentleman who made a statement on behalf of that association a year or two ago. IfI remember rightly it was about three years ago that a representative official of the Metal Trades Association made a public statement which attracted a good deal of attention. At the time the employers were being hard pressed under arbitration awards, and many fresh applications were being lodged with the Tariff Board for increased duties. The statement intimated that if the Nationalist Government would not give the metal traders the increased duties that they demanded, their association would be forced to support the Labour party politically. They did not care one rap about public policy so long as they could maintain the protective duties that they demanded. were quite willing to throw themselves into the arms of the highest bidder. Now their representative considers that the Labour men, whom he was willing to Mr Mann. assist iu order to line his own pockets, are ""bowelless tyrants and unmitigated ruffians,"" and he demands that the Arbitration Courts shall be abolished. But, at the same time, he wants to preserve special tariff privileges. In an article which appeared in the Adelaide Register of the 14th May,, written by Mr A. A. Simpson, C.M.G.,. who, I understand, is a past president of the Adelaide Chamber of Manufactures, this bill is condemned, root and branch,. The employers like the motto ""HeadsI win, tails you lose "" just as much as the unions do. This is an extract from the It has done articleThe trut h is that since compulsory arbitration has' become the law of Australia, it is no good uttering sob stuff about "" friendship"" and appointing salaried "" conciliators"" to preside over a multitude of committees. We employers are sick of being cited to the Arbitration Court, and then, for the crime of being employers, being "" conciliated"" as well. We resent being prosecuted twice over for the same offence. We arc quite competent to settle our disputes in conference with employees, but we do not applaud the intervention of civil servants, whose pay and interest may depend upon the continuance of "" conciliation."" Besides the boards of reference, the bill contains otlier amendments tending to avoid the consequences of the last Constitutional referendum and to destroy the State industrial legislation. I believe that compulsory arbitration has failed through the very nature of its structure. I would abolish arbitration if I had the power, but not on the manufacturers' terms. The employers expect to maintain their tariff privileges, also those that they enjoy by the operation of the Navigation Act, which is one of the greatest impositions to which this country is subjected, and one of the primary causes of industrial trouble on our coast. Remove the restrictions of that act and half our maritime strikes would be permanently abolished. The shipping companies cannot be allowed to retain their privileges under that act, and at the same time have the system of arbitration abolished. Throughout their dealings with the seamen the shipping companies have been weak and vacillating, and have failed in their duty to the comThey munity because they have feared the repeal of this act. The public, is not yet ready to accept such a complete reform of public policy as is suggested. We must realize that we have been gradually building up our system of arbitration on high-sounding euphonious formulae without any sound economic basis, and having as its three principal props an increased tariff, compulsory arbitration and the Navigation Act. Until these three incubuses on the national life of Australia have been removed we shall continue to have economic disturbances and industrial unrest. I am sorry to say that public opinion does not yet appear to realize this, but it certainly is the duty of public men, whose principal business it is to study and endeavour to understand these questions, to voice their opinion on these matters in no uncertain tone, because it is only in that way that public opinion will be trained along the right lines This bill has been brought in because public opinion has still a certain pathetic faith in what has been done in the past, and still believes it worthwhile to make sacrifices for the ideals of the Arbitration Aet, the Tariff Act and the Navigation Act; it is still foolish enough to entertain those illusions, and cannot get to the point of realizing that despite all its sacrifices we still have faith should be reposed in the ultimate employer and employee quarrelling, and still have grave economic disturbances hindering and hampering the business life of the community. This bill is the logical completion of a system which has been built up in the past, and I am giving my support to the second reading because I cannot abolish the system which renders it necessary. abolish it in the sense I have described, not partially, not simply removing privileges -from one party and leaving them to another, but by putting all on an equal footing. But because I cannot do so, I am compelled to support the bill, although not optimistic as to its effects. I regard it as the last despairing attempt to keep going a system which, in my opinion, is quite impracticable, and economically unsound. At the same time. I think it is utterly foolish and unfair to accuse the Government of bringing it in deliberately to wreck the arbitration system. I believe the measure will prove futile, but at the same time. I believe it is necessary for the Government to demonstrate the failure of the present system before it can get the public to support it in a more radical and sensible reform. It must be tried; but I believe it will fail. There have been many admissions of this fear in the speeches to which we have listened. ""We have had a tremendous crop of beautiful phrases. We have heard a great deal about "" voluntary arbitration,"" "" conciliation,"" ""round-table conferences,"" and ""cooperation in industry;"" beautiful phrases which seem to suggest a rosy dawn creeping up over the horizon if only we contrive to keep our eyes fixed on these ideals. I give everybody credit for sincerity in the hope to which they have given expression that good may come of the utilization of the machinery generally associated with wages boards, boards of reference, and such like. When people speak of conciliation as opposed to arbitration, I am afraid they are not realizing clearly what they meanThey speak in general terms of bringing employers and employees together and letting them settle matters between themselves, but that is really the principle of the wages board. I have always repudiated any suggestion that result of wages boards, because I believe that these boards have contributed -equall y with the Arbitration Courtto the present economic position. The burden that has been placed on industry by wages boards has not been so obvious to the public, but it can easily be demonstrated by a reference to what happens. I would be the first to When the employees make a demand for certain wages, and the employers say ""We cannot give them to you,"" a wages board is formed for the industry. Representatives of the employers and employees meet with an independent chairman, and eventually a compromise is reached, which is, in the majority of cases, to the benefit of the men, as is the case in arbitration awards; and very often it is arrived at on the casting vote of the chairman. What is the difference in the effect on the community generally between a compromise arrived at by a wages board for the benefit of the workers, and one which is arrived at by means of an Arbitration Court? The increase in wages is passed on in just the same way to the industry and to the public. The only difference is that there is not the same amount of publicity given to the proceedings of a wages board as is given to a claim submitted to an Arbitration Oourt. A wages board decision is simply an agreement between the employers and the employees as to the amount of contribution which the public will have to make to keep their industry going. I have no faith in wages boards. From the public standpoint, the Arbitration Court has this advantage-that the judge is supposed to be looking after the interests of the public, whereas a wages board is simply a private meeting between employers and employees, with an independent chairman, to determine what toll they will make upon the public. To me, the one system is as bad as the other. Although the system of wages boards looks all right, it works out in just the same way as an Arbitration Court, and is contributing in just the same way as the latter to the increasing toll on industry which has led to the present economic position of Australia. The same remarks are true of conciliation as carried out by the gentleman referred to by the Attorney-General( Mr describes the process adopted by both Latham) in his speech as the Conciliation Commissioner. was good enough, as he promised in his speech, to make available to me the report of this Conciliation Commissioner. I glanced through it, and tried to ascertain the principles he had followed, or how he had arrived at the results which the Attorney-General said were so very satisfactory. I could find nothing in it to indicate the lines which the commissioner followed. All that the report contains is a series of cases with the words "" This was referred to me, and a settlement was arrived at."" long as you get a settlement, everything is well; but there is nothing in this report to indicate the lines on which any -ettlement was arrived at. You can always get a settlement with your enemy if you give him all he demands, and it is a very easy thing for a civil servant in a permanent position, unaffected to any marked extent by these awards, to effect conciliation between contending parties so long as the public is content to pay. member realize that all the conciliation able members who sit opposite. Mr Mann. settlements are settlements accepted by both parties, and that no award or determination is given by the Conciliation Commissioner ? of which I am complaining. I maintain that the proper way to view the matter is to regard both parties as the servants of the public. Industry has a right to exist only so long as it serves the public. When employees and employers combine, they can settle a difference of opinion upon any terms that may be mutually agreeable to them, without taking into consideration the interests of the public. That is the whole trouble. You can conciliate so long as you satisfy both of those who demand a portion of the carcass. The essential trouble caused by this system of conciliation is that it results in giving everybody what he wants, except the public who pay. has condemned the three forms; what does he suggest? The only illustration which adequately wages boards and arbitration courts is to The Attorney-General be found in old English history. It will be remembered that King Ethelred II . was greatly perturbed by the invasion of the Danes and the' devastation that they wrought among his people. He, therefore, conciliated them by making them payments of money. The Danes were given the Danegeld, and went away; but when they again wanted money they returned. How did King Ethelred find that money' He raised it by placing a tax upon the people.' instead of giving them the opportunity to repel the inOf course, as vaders.

202,Mr Mann,"I thank the honorablepublic consists of those who are supposed to be represented by honourable members opposite-the workers. I certainly admit that those whom we have been designating employees constitute a very large section of the public. One of the strongest complaints of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) against the existing arbitration system was that the .effective wage of the workers had been reduced by 5 per cent.; in other words, that the workers, who are supposed to benefit by the arbitration system, have, in common with the general mass of the public, suffered as a result of its operano person can foresee the economic effects tion.

The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has demonstrated very effectively this evening the difficulty that surrounds the adoption of such a course. Except in a general way, of an award. All that is apparent is that it will place an extra burden upon the industry concerned; but to what extent that burden can be borne by other industries cannot be determined.

208,Mr Mann,"Of course it might. Weto-day. I admit that compulsory arbitration has to choose some system upon which to base its awards. It has chosen the cost of living. I do not know of any other that it could have chosen. But, at the same time, it cannot frame its awards satisfactorily on that basis. Better results would accrue if awards could be framed according to production; but it is not within the power of any court to do that. Immediately the court makes an award that is based on the existing cost of living it increases the cost of living to the whole community and upsets the very basis upon which its own award was given. Consider the conception of economics embodied in the oft quoted dictum that an industry which cannot pay the wages awarded should not exist. The awards of the court are increasing wages in every industry, and making it almost impossible for some industries to continue at all. To overcome this difficulty, we give these industries, by way of stimulant, a dose of commercial strychnine in the form of protection ; but eventually there must be a crash. A crash has actually occurred in the case of some industries, and that is why we have so much unemployment in Australia to-day Until we face the realities of the situation, unemployment will increase. The compulsory system of arbitration will be accepted only so long as wages and prices are on the increase. That process has been in operation throughout the whole history of our Arbitration Court, and in that respect we have been fortunate: but once we reach the reverse position-and we are faced with it to-day-ther e must be a fall in prices and wages, or industries will go out of existence. When that happens the Arbitration Court cannot function. As soon as it reduces wages, its awards will be flouted more than ever, and it will become a logical absurdity. I admit it is easier to criticize than to help; but anybody who does not try to suggest a constructive policy shows want of thought on this important subject. I feel sure that the Government realizes the difficulties with which it is faced. If I am asked what constructive suggestion I can offer it is only fair to say that it is impossible to build on bad Ur. IIaim. foundations. Before we begin to erect a new building, we must clear away the structure that now encumbers the ground. Personally, I do not think that we can make progress with constructive, helpf ul criticism of any scheme for the removal of industrial unrest until we realize that the existing structure must be -scrapped. Once we do that, I believe that we shall open up a way for a better understanding between the parties to industry. I am afraid that the very existence of the compulsory Arbitration Act is the principle obstacle in the way of better relations between employers and employees. Honourable members, opposite talk about their adherence to arbitration; but I point out that in those countries where better industrial arrangements than those obtaining in Australia have been or are being brought about, there is no compulsory arbitration. In my opinion the goal at which we aim could be achieved without legislation. As soon as we seek to cure our industrial ills by legislation, we introduce compulsion and restriction. ""We cannot. have laws without restrictions, and it is impossible to have arbitration without sanctions. I remind honourable members who are so eager for international arbitration, that the difficulty in the international sphere has also arisen over the necessity for "" guarantees"" or "" sanctions."" It is just the same in the industrial sphere. Only by the removal of the compulsory arbitration laws can we have a chance of bringing about improved relations between the parties to industry. A great, deal has been heard about the Prime Minister's efforts to secure a conference on the subject of industrial peace. He was honourable and sincere in his efforts in that direction, and if he is to be blamed at all in connection with that matter it is because he ought to have known that his action would be turned to political account. I believe that the sole reason why the proposal was not successful, was that it emanated from a political leader. The right honourable gentleman might have committed an error of judgment, but the steps that he took were certainly not prompted by a sinister motive, as has been suggested. 1 believe the proposal would have succeeded if, instead of coming from a political welearn facts and truths.

That statement is characteristic of the attitude of honourable members opposite on the question of law generally. want protection under the law; but as soon as the law goes against them they say that the Government should intervene to protect them. clusion to be drawn from the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter. In stead of it being the Government's bounden duty to intervene in these cases, it is its bounden duty not to intervene. The duty of the Government is to maintain the law. The law does not provide that the Government shall intervene, but it does provide a proper means of intervention and control. It is the bounden duty of honourable members on both sides of the chamber to uphold the law instead of asking the Government to intervene. As an instance of what the honourable member for Hunter claims should be done, I may say that in Victoria, in connection with the wages board system to which I have referred, it was found that under an award a grave injustice was sometimes done. A court of industrial appeal was therefore specially appointed as a reference board to which an appeal could be made from a wages board award in order to correct anomalies or remedy grievances. The appeal board, which was constituted of representatives of employers and employees, with a presiding judge, did not function for a long time because, if those on one side did not want laws were framed as a result of the an appeal to be heard they did not appoint a representative. Eor a long time the board could not function, but the last Victorian Government introduced a measure under which if either side refused to to him as to what would be the appoint a representative the chairman could do so to enable the board to function. The board then sat and satisfactorily dealt with a number of appeals, but member could not reply to my question. because it is a tribunal which prevents one side gaining an unfair advantage over the other the present Labour Government has intervened and abolished it. Government considers that the law should be treated. It is of paramount importance that every government should maintain the law until it is amended, and it is not right for a government or its representatives to intervene to protect They demand law. They either side when acting in contravention of the law. On a measure of this nature, it is imperative that every honourable member should declare his position. It is true that one's time is limited, but one at least must indicate one's attitude in general terms. Honourable members wilt admit that what I have said in connection with this bill is consistent with my attitude on other questions which have come be-' fore this House. I hope that the debate will help to clarify the position in the minds of the public, and that these artificial props which we have erected and which are really only keeping each other standing will eventually be removed. We want freedom, liberty and a just relationship between the different sections of the community. It is only by this means that progress can be achieved. Justice and liberty are two fundamental essentials of organized society, and they can be obtained only when we remove those artificial supports, which are providing artificial conditions that cannot possibly last. honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), has declared that our arbitration system is artificial. He should have got down to fundamentals and quoted a law which is not artificial in one form or another. Laws are made to govern communities, and without them a state of anarchy would prevail.

I had no desire to dictate to the honourable member. merely wished to get a clear understanding of his views. The honourable member had something to say about ""clearing the debris,"" and observed that before a new structure could be erected the old one which cumbered the ground had to be removed. Unfortunately, he did not indicate the kind of new structure that he would erect. could not haye paidmuch attention to my speech.. member to be definite in order that he might make his meaning clear, not only to me, but to the general public. He did not do so. It is unfortunate for him that free trade is about the only plank in his political platform. He said that the Chamber of Manufactures of South Australia desired the abolition of the Arbitration Court, and condemned our system of arbitration root and branch. But how did we come to institute this method of controlling industry? It is the result of the influence of the Labour party in politics. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) told us that the first rule of the American Federation of Labour was ""No party politics."" His statement was approved by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster). But the Labour party is in politics in Australia because of suggestions made by our opponents during the great maritime strike of 1891. We were told then that if we were not satisfied with the conditions that existed we should enter political life with the object of altering them. That is how the political Labour party came into being. We realized that strikes involved our wives and children in a good deal of misery and suffering, and endeavored to find a better method of settling our disputes. Honourable members opposite who have spoken so glibly about the effectiveness of the wages board system do not seem to realize that compulsory arbitration is a development of it We have been told that the object of this bill is to make our arbitration machinery more effective. . I do not think that that is the intention of the Government. Its desire is to make the system so unworkable that it will have good grounds for asking that I it shall be scrapped. If one listened only to the speeches which honourable members opposite are in the habit of delivering, one might be led to believe that Labour is indebted to its political opponents for every advantage that it enjoys. The fact is that Labour representatives in Parliament, and in industry generally, have had to struggle for many years to place upon the statute-book the measures which we now enjoy. Labour governments have been in power at different times in all the States of the Commonwealth, and also in the federal sphere; but even when they have been in the minority, they have been able to force their opponents to grant concessions which have improved the standard of living. The wages board system of South Australia was granted grudgingly, and after much agitation. It was necessary that a. motion should be carried by both Houses of the State Parliament before a wages board could be appointed for an industry. Another evidence of the reluctance with which the Government of the day granted this measure of reform was that a provision was inserted in the act that wages boards could only be established for industries operating within a radius of 25 miles of Adelaide. That limit was fixed so that Gawler, which at the time was an important centre for the manufacture of locomotives, could not be granted wages boards. Yet honourable members opposite would have us believe that from the earliest days our opponents have been only too ready to set up wages boards to determine industrial conditions. It was a long time before the wages board system had general application. It took seventeen years for the system to apply to the industry in which I was engaged. AfterI left the factory in which I had been employed the employees went on strike for a week in order to obtain justice. At the end of that period the person who controlled the industry approached the Hon. R. P. Blundell, who at one time represented Adelaide in this",72,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes
220,Mr Mann,The honourable member,73,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes
221,Mr Yates,"I asked the honorableHouse, but was at that a time a memher of the South Australian House of Assembly, with a view to having the wages board system applied to that industry. From that time that industry has had a wages board, although recently the employees gained an award from the Arbitration Court. I mention these things! to show that what is asked for now has been tried. The arbitration i system has grown out of the conditions | that existed in industry in the past. The| honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) said that the workers are penalizing industry. Seeing that the awards of the Arbitration Court are made by judges, and based on sworn evidence, I cannot understand his statement. Under the wages board system a matter is sometimes determined by the casting vote of an individual who is biased. what I am talking about, because I have been a member of a wages board. sibility of intimidation. of wages boards who represent the employees are not free to express themselves as they would like. They cannot speak plainly in the presence of their employers without jeopardizing their interests. But in the Arbitration Court the representatives of the employers meet on equal terms with the representatives of the employees. The real cause of the objection of the employers to the arbitration system is that under it the employees are not so liable to victimization as they are under other systems. The South Australian legislation governing wages boards provided that representatives of employees must be actually engaged in the industry, and have been so employed at least three months prior to their appointment to a wages board. Fortunately, when I was a member of a wages board, I had lately left the active work associated with the industry, and was, therefore, free to express my opinions without fear of victimization. The sole purpose of the insertion of that provision was to intimidate the employees. The representatives of the employees in the Arbitration Court are usually men with actual experience in the industrynot men brought in from outside. If honourable members opposite are successful in their attempt to scrap the arbitration system, are they willing for it to be supplanted by direct action? We have made such progress in industry in this country that it is now too late to retrace our steps and go back to what some still describe as the "" good old days."" The Government's action in introducing this bill is in conflict with public opinion. The public generally believe that industry must be regulated, and that the worker has some rights. Do honourable members opposite say that the workers have taken more from industry than the employers have taken? It is not a question of whether industry can stand the strain which the payment of fair wages imposes upon it, but whether it can meet an inI know terest payment of £1,000,000 per week on the part of the Commonwealth. than that. earned by the workers. Of all the members who have spoken in support of this bill not one has suggested that there should be any investigation into the amount of profits earned by an industry. the limitation of profits. tem in South Australia precluded any investigation into the profits made by a business. Moreover, a wages board could not make an award which would place an industry in that State at a disadvantage compared with a similar industry in another State. There were all sorts of restrictions. But the Arbitration Court deals with questions in a different manner; its awards are made only after full evidence has been tendered by both sides. Do honourable members opposite contend that the awards of the Arbitration Court are made without a proper investigation? When a union submits a plaint to the Arbitration Court it gives reasons in support of its claim. Generally, the case of the workers is put to the court by men engaged in the industry, so that the exclusion of lawyers from the Arbitration Court would not affect the unions very much. their exclusion.",73,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes

After hearing the representations made on behalf of both parties to a dispute, the judge arrives at a decision. Will any honourable member go so far as to say that the employees in industry should not receive reasonable treatment ? The Government has now decided to attack the arbitration system. The workers have striven for arbitration, and they understand the system, but the Government has introduced the bill to restrict the operations of the court and to overload the act with amendments so as to make the present system inoperative, and, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) has suggested, to educate the public mind to the belief that there is only one thing for Australia, and that is to scrap the Arbitration Court. I do not know what may be in the mind of the Attorney General( Mr Latham), but if he expressed himself candidly he would say that that suggestion has a lot to do with the introduction of the bill. Honourable members behind . the Government have spoken of reducing the cost of living and the cost of production, but they have not explained how this can be brought about other than through the Arbitration Court awards. that the hours of labour should be increased, and that payment should be by results, which really means the survival of said-that the relations between employer the fittest in industry. The time has long passed, in Australia at least, for that system to be revived and made universal. It is not the custom nowadays to exact the last ounce of energy from a man for the least amount than can be paid to him. Some suggestion for reducing costs might well come from honourable members behind the Government. The majority of the workers to-day are on the basic wage. No one would suggest that there should not be a margin for skill. Honourable members opposite will not say straight out that the basic wage should be reduced; but the trend of their remarks is in that direction. At whose expense is the basic wage to be reduced? the provisions of this bill. [194] it be in the interests of Australia to reduce our standard of living? I , for one, as a representative of the workers, would certainly not vote for a decrease in ths basic wage, which' has been arrived at only after years of effort on the part of the workers. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said that he represented the workers, and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) insinuated that the Labour party had the interests of no other section of the community at heart. He endeavoured to place the Leader of the Opposition in a false position. We certainly represent the working class; but when measures of a non-party character are introduced which, in our opinion, make for the development of Australia, we are very pleased to support them. When the interests of those whom we represent are attacked, as they are being attacked to-day, we should not be worthy of our positions as the people's representatives in this chamber if we did not fight tooth and nail for them. The Prime Minister has gone to some pains to convince the House that this bill is not an attack upon trade unionists. It would be absurd to expect anything else from him, but his assurance has been discounted by the utterances of It has been suggested his supporters. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) well summed up the position when he and employee were ever-changing, and that an adjustment of the conditions between buyer and seller, whether of labour or of any . other commodity, would always be extremely difficult. He also stated that in the past the question of fixing prices and wages has always been one for the employers, and he made a partial reference to the tyranny which used to be practised by them in their unbridled strength. No thought was given for the employee except to get as much out of him for as little outlay as possible. His physical condition was no concern of theirs. It did not matter to them what hovels the workers were housed in, and oftentimes they had .barely room to work. It is not difficult to carry our minds back",74,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes

The workers have gained many advantages through Labour in politics. At one time an honourable member supporting the Government stated that all that the workers held that was worth having had been given to them by the Nationalists. referred particularly to our educational system. I remember ihe time the Hon. Thomas Price, then Labour Premier of South Australia, was endeavouring to make compulsory education more effective, and the Hon. John Darling, who was head of the Liberal party in that State, said boldly and without reservation, "" If you educate all the workers, who will do the dirty work?"" that before. found in the records of the South Australian Parliament, and it shows that the conservative element was not so desirous of giving increased advantages to the workers as honourable members opposite have claimed.

Nationalist. honourable member's crowd; he certainly was not a worker. Men of his class are never seen wearing bowyangs. A "" Sir"" is never seen at the business end of a shovel. The times are not long past when children slaved in factories under appalling conditions, and when all workers had inadequate space for their employment, and lived in dirty, ill lighted, and ill-ventilated hovels. To-day factory buildings compulsorily conform, to the requirements of modern hygiene; but I am afraid that the cost will be included in the economic effects which are to be considered by the court in making an award. governed by the Shops and Factories Act, and cannot be altered by any judge? ceeds of his industry, and this outlay will be considered amongst the economic effects of awards. At one period not many years ago the whole penalty of an accident or misadventure fell on the worker; the boss had no liability and no He concern in it beyond getting another man to take the place of the one who had been injured or killed. Presumably the provisions of the Workers Compensation Act will be taken into account as an "" economic effect."" Honourable members opposite may ridicule that suggestion, but I recollect that when the Prices Regulation Commission was taking evidence in New South Wales in 1915 one witness included in his production costs a donation of £250 to the War Chest Fund. Under cross-examination by the commission he said that other business men subscribed to the fund, and he, therefore, was obliged to do so; the obligation was one which would not have fallen on him if he had not been in business. The evidence I heard at that time convinced me that every item of expenditure, including taxation and all other charges upon the owner, is included in the cost of production, and will be covered by the term "" economic effects."" Thus the liabilities of the boss in respect of his employees under the Workers Compensation Act will be taken into account by the court when making its awards. Much has been said about extremists, and the trouble they cause, but the conditions that preceded the development of unionism are forgotten. I do not justify the actions of men who are never satisfied, and are always looking for grievances. Such persons are found in every section of society; no matter what conditions are prescribed some people will always be dissatisfied. whom we want to deal. so objectionable, if it dealt specifically",75,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes

239,,"Mr YATES -The bill might not bewith individuals; but it is so comprehensive in its scope that it will apply to the innocent and probably allow the guilty to escape. The bill should be made more specific, as to the persons whom it is proposed to prosecute. I suggest that in the trades unions the extremists do not, in the main, occupy official positions. MrM . CAMERON -Some of them are occupying official positions. two, but this is a drag-net measure which includes everybody, while not specifically mentioning any one. As to the employers, it would be the hardest thing in the world to prosecute any of the extremists in their ranks under this bill. MrM . CAMERON -It would be quite easy to do so. up to the present, and it will not be done under this measure. This bill is obviously directed against the workers' wages and conditions. That is evident from the remarks made by honourable members on the other side. Nothing is said about the enormous profits that have been made out of industry. My friend opposite cannot deny that such profits have been made, because if he did, he would deny the statistics prepared by the Commonwealth officials. Never was there so much accumulated wealth in the country as now, nor have there ever been such large bank deposits. ? MrM . CAMERON -The bank deposits are largely the savings of the workers. bank deposits, and the amounts deposited in the trading banks have gone up by more millions during the last few years than they increased by thousands during a similar period prior to 1915. MrM . CAMERON -But not out of proportion to the savings bank deposits. _ tion. But even if they had not, it would merely prove that industry has not lost as a result of the arbitration system, but is giving the workers something, as well as giving the bosses millions more than they ever received before. -Labour has no need to apologize for its conduct of industrial affairs. I have a very keen recollection of theearly industrial days in Australia. One honourable member on the other side who spoke against the bill never, I think, did a hard day's work in his life. When lie was speaking on some aspects of industry he showed a woeful lack of knowledge. I do not think that he ever worked for a wage, or that he was ever what is called a ""wage plug,"" such as those who worked year in year out on low wages and with no holidays. MrM . CAMERON -The honourable member surely does not suggest that any one wants to get back to those conditions. that this bill was fashioned with that end in view. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) said that he would wipe out the compulsory arbitration system altogether, and the Navigation Act as well. not propose to wipe out the arbitration system. impossible for the arbitration system to be carried on. The honourable member for Perth is anxious to wipe out the system, and that opinion is held, I think, by most members on the other side of the .House. MrM . CAMERON -The honourable member for Perth is the only one whe has said so. for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) said the same thing by implication. He said that our arbitration system was antediluvian, and should be brought up to date. He went further, and said that the compulsory arbitration system held this country in shackles, and asked what comfort it was to those who were unemployed to know that there was a high standard of living if they were not able to enjoy ft. New Zealand and Australia were the first two countries in the world to adopt this system, and later, he said, New Zealand was forced to scrap the arbitration system and go back to conciliation. Even with that he was not satisfied. Though very few Honourable members opposite are game to say that they are against the arbitration system, they recognize that this bill will, if passed, destroy it, and therefore they are in favour of the measure.

247,,"Mr YATES -The honourable memberthe House how impotent this bill would be to do the things claimed for it by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) said in regard to the British seamen's strike that the threat of gaol held no terrors for the workers when their economic existence was in danger. It is not possible to gaol men by the thousand; it is too big a proposition. If what is proposed in this bill is put into operation, there is a possibility that the general public will be stampeded into the belief that it really is arbitration which is bringing about unemployment and industrial unrest. evolved the bill were actuated, not by any desire for industrial peace, but rather by a desire to discipline the workers by means of the hob-nailed boot and the big stick, as suggested by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney). History shows us that it is not possible to dragoon the Avorkers and flog them into submission by the exercise of powers such as this bill would provide. honourable member for Barker says that no one wants to get back to the ""good old days'""' Mr John Brown, the coal baron, says straight out that he wants to get back to the good old days, and to the conditions which prevailed in 1914. He wants to return to' such conditions as will enable him to sell his coal for 8s. 6d. a ton. The honourable member for Barker( Mr been precipitated. When the public has M. Cameron) also knows very well that Sir Henry Barwell fought an election on the slogan ""Wages must go down,"" and "" We must get back to the good old days of the law of supply and demand, and of freedom of contract."" The honourable member for Darwin says, by interjection, that Sir Henry Barwell does not now count for much. I suggest that he counts to a considerable extent with the section which he represents. that was considered wrong with Sir Henry Barwell was that he spoke as he thought, which cannot be said of many people. The reply that he gave to the Chamber of Commerce which entertained him in 1922-and he would say the same thing to-day in similar circumstanceswasThe Arbitration Courts and the arbitration laws stand right in the way. By various Ur. Yates. awards the Arbitration Courts have said what shall be the basic wage for various industries and what marginal differences shall be paid, and those awards stand regardless whether or not the industries concerned can pay them. The industries have either got to pay them or to close down. For an employer to pay less is an offence: for an employee to take less is an offence. Bach case is subject to a heavy penalty. At that time there was a great deal of unemployment, and the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) had called what he termed a "" peace "" conference, just as the present Prime Minister is doing today. It was in discussing that proposal that Sir Henry Barwell made the stateI believe that those who ment I have just quoted. This bill is an attempt to make the Arbitration Court worse than uselessto make it anathema to the workers-so that it will merely stand in the way of a peaceable solution of existing difficulties. Let the Prime Minister take his courage in both hands and get down to the root of the trouble. The Government is introThe ducing clauses that will make the bill inoperative, and arbitration will have to be scrapped. Honourable members opposite want to get back to the "" good old days "" of the law of supply and demand, of the right to use the black list on the worker, of the right to have individual bargaining and to victimise men who endeavour to get out of the economic slough into which they have details of the general discussion that has taken place on this measure it will be convinced that the bill is a mere subterfuge, and an attack upon trade unionism. Industrial peace can be obtained only when the worker participates in the correct ratio in the profits of industry. I admit that the worker has reaped a wonderful advantage from the Arbitration Court, and I am prepared to stand for The main thing it as it is, but not as the Government propose to amend it.

254,Motion (By Dr. Eakue Page) Agreed,"surer) [12.13 a.m.] I move That the.House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity to amplify the reply I gave at the beginning of this sitting to a question asked by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), in order to prevent any misapprehension in regard to the regulation prescribing the rates of interest to apply to the total capital liability of the Eederal Capital Commission at the 1st January, 1925, the date at which the Federal Capital Commission became liable for all expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act. The regulation providing for interest at 2$ per cent, on the total capital liability of the Commission at the 1st January, 1925, roughly maintains a charge that was borne Dy the consolidated revenue fund in respect of services of the' debt incurred for Federal Capital Territory. The expenditure prior to 1st January, 1925, amounted in round figures to £2,966,000. A large prop'ortipn of that expenditure was provided from revenue, and the amount that was still a public debt charge at 31st December, 1924, was approximately £1,800,000. The Seat of? .Government (Administration) Act provided that the Commission should be liable for interest at rates to be prescribed. In considering the rate of interest, the fact that a large portion of *the capital liability had been provided from revenue was taken into account' and a composite rate of interest was charged on the total liability in such a way as to bring about a result approximately equal to the burden carried by the consolidated revenue fund. This rate was found to be 2£ per cent., and it was adopted accordingly. The total capital liability of the Commission at the 1st January, 1925, including capitalized interest, amounted to approximately £3,400,000. Interest at 2$ per cent on that sum will be £85,000 a year, which is approximately the charge that was borne by the consolidated revenue fund in respect of the services of the debt incurred for the Inderal Capital Territory. Question resolved in the affirmative. . HouBe adjourned at 12.18 a.m. (Thursday).",79,Moloney Th E Vague Threats Of Deportation Of The Crimes
