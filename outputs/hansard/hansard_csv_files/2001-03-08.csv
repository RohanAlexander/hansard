The guest speaker for the evening was Michelle Ferris, an elite world circuit cyclist who won a silver medal at the Sydney Olympics. Michelle proved to be a very popular personality and was besieged by the young people in attendance for details of her achievements and her autograph. I am pleased to advise the parliament that the winner of the Blacktown Sportsperson of the Year Award was Alicia Aberley, already internationally known as the winner of a number of medals at the Paralympic Games. Alicia won silver in the 100 metres freestyle and the 100 metres individual medley in the S14 category for athletes with an intellectual disability at the Sydney Paralympic Games.

Alicia now joins a list of previous winners of this prestigious sportsperson award which includes Debbie Sosimenko, Eddie Salas, Andrew Murtha, Mehmet Yagci and Kasey Giteau. Alicia was also awarded the Blacktown Young Citizen of the Year title on Australia Day, in recognition of her sporting triumphs and sense of community spirit.

To my mind, IWD is about two things: participation and recognition, because it is through participating in society and refusing to sit on the sidelines that women have arrived at the point we have reached today. But today is also a time to recognise how far women have come and, in many areas, how far women still have to go. My electorate of McPherson boasts many successful women in a diverse range of professions. One such woman is Josephine Tobias, the head of the Gold Coast Women at Work organisation. Josephine Tobias is an inspirational woman with seemingly endless energy, some of which she has used to coordinate an outstanding program of events to celebrate International Women’s Day this year. Josephine runs the women re-entry to work program, a training program to help women who have been out of the work force to re-establish their skills and return to the work force. Those who participate in the re-entry to work program are generally older women who have had successful careers but who have left the work force for a period",107,Notices

This program serves to reassure these women that their skills are still useful and it enables the Gold Coast to tap into a deep pool of talent that otherwise may be lost. For the past 17 weeks, 13 talented and dedicated women undertaking the re-entry to work program have been working full-time to put together the Gold Coast’s International Women’s Day Festival. The festival is a showcase of possibilities for both employed women and those trying to re-enter the work force. The Gold Coast IWD Festival is an inspiring example of how older women can join together to create an event that will empower the younger generation. The festival’s program includes 24 training seminars, canvassing topics as diverse as personal development, starting a business and how to manage money. The seminars are complemented by initiatives such as the ‘centre for celebration’, which will host a range of displays and exhibitions celebrating the achievements of local women. Amidst all of this, Josephine Tobias and her team have managed to put together an amazing line-up of speakers who are all luminaries in their chosen field-women such as celebrity relationships counsellor Sally Feelgood, federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Susan Halliday, fashion designer Charlie Brown, pioneer public speaker Joan Saxton and media personality Belinda Green. They will lead a panel discussion on leadership in the new millennium. All week, the Gold Coast has been buzzing with motivated women who are determined to forge the women’s movement forward into the 21st century. TodayI would like to put on the parliamentary record my appreciation and admiration for Women and Work and, more specifically, for Josephine Tobias, who has enough fire in her belly to light the way for the women of the Gold Coast for many years to come. Good Beginnings Program program in the Latrobe Valley and also to place on record my anger and disappointment that the federal government has seen fit to cut funding to this important program. The Good Beginnings program in the Latrobe Valley is very widely supported and receives a lot of support from our community. In fact, the staff at McDonald’s restaurants throughout the Latrobe Valley have raised no less than $5,000 over the last 12 months towards the work of this important program, which supports families. Some of the activities which the Good Beginnings program are involved in include family support services, home based therapy support, volunteer home visiting, hospital visiting, antenatal education for dads, the Hey Dad Support Group, antenatal reunions for dad, mum and baby groups, toddler groups, walking groups in Moe and Traralgon, maternal and child health services, a pre-admission service for Latrobe Regional Hospital, and a preschool participation reference group. They do a lot of different things in our community, all of which are extremely important for young families in the Latrobe Valley. In February alone, they helped more than 133 families in the Latrobe Valley. So it is a program which is very widely used and very strongly supported. There is not a lot of money wrapped up in this program in terms of federal government funds. In fact, all they are asking for is a measly $88,000 per year. For the number of people that they help, I think most people would agree that it is a very small amount of money. This program does a lot of good. It is led by some really great people in Kellie O’Callaghan and her team. There are a large number of volunteers who support this program. It is the type of program which I think provides a model for other services throughout Australia. Yesterday, I had a good talk with the Minister for Community Services, Larry Anthony, in relation to this matter. To his credit, he said that he would re-examine this issue. In the best bipartisan traditions of this place, I sincerely urge him to do so because there are a lot of people in need in the Latrobe Valley and we need programs like Good Beginnings to help us",108,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (9.46 A.m.),"I want to state my support for the Good Beginnings25520 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 through what is a difficult time for us. Elsie Amoruso had this to say about the Good Beginnings program: I haven’t been a person who’s had a great deal of confidence, and getting out and talking to other mums about parenting issues is really important. Sometimes after having a child you can fall into a depressed state, and I know what that’s like because it happened to me after my four-year old was born. I’m scared of the isolation. She went on to say: It would hurt a lot of people (if Good Beginnings closed) and a lot of women would be disadvantaged because we tend to fall into a rut of isolating ourselves. It is true that being a happier parent means having happier children. She is dead right, of course. Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not asking for a lot of money. It is a small amount of money but it makes a big difference in the lives of a lot of people in the Latrobe Valley. Once again, I urge the minister to please reconsider his decision in relation to funding for this important program. Queensland: Bus Accident bus flipped over after being hit by a truck at Gracemere, near Rockhampton. I rise today to extend my best wishes to the passengers and their families. Thankfully and mercifully, no-one was killed in the accident, but it was a near thing. I understand the bus was transporting 19 schoolchildren and 11 adults from Mount Morgan, which is in my electorate of Hinkler, to Rockhampton, along Gavial Road, when a truck clipped the bus on the rear left side, causing it to spin 180 degrees and turn over onto its roof. A 13-year-old girl and a 72-year-old woman were critically injured. They are currently in the Rockhampton Base Hospital. As of yesterday, they were in intensive care. I hope they are out of intensive care. I spoke to the medical superintendent this morning and he will update me with reports. Nine others were seriously injured and 20 received minor injuries. I would like to praise the efforts of emergency workers and residents on the scene, who arrived within minutes to provide assistance. I am sure that their help was greatly appreciated by the passengers. Apparently, this help was not without some personal danger, as there was the risk of fire. Anyone who participates in an exercise like that is a person of some courage. My state parliamentary colleague, the member for Fitzroy, was also there, and I thank him for his efforts on behalf of the passengers. The incident highlights the need to consider putting seatbelts on buses, particularly buses carrying schoolchildren. I understand that the Queensland government has established a task force to investigate bus safety standards. I recommend very sincerely to them that they look into every aspect of this. We all recognise that this is not going to be inexpensive, and so it needs to be worked through with some care. Studies and incidents of recent years have shown that people have a much better chance in any sort of vehicle, even buses, if there are restraints of some order. Honourable members will know my interest in those matters, as I have chaired the parliament’s transport committee where we have looked at things like alcohol, speed, vehicle design and, most recently, fatigue in transport. In closing today, my thoughts are not so much with the politics of this but with the very near thing that occurred in my electorate. I would like to reiterate my thoughts to my colleagues and pass on the best wishes of my colleagues on both sides of the House to the passengers and their families. I wish them all a very speedy recovery.",109,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.49 A.m.),"Yesterday morning, 31 people were injured when aThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25521 Partners of Veterans Association of New South Wales it is timely to acknowledge a wonderful group of women that I and a few of my parliamentary colleagues had the pleasure of meeting yesterday. The Partners of Veterans Association is a fledgling group that started in New South Wales a few years ago. It is fast becoming a national organisation, with membership in most states. From our conversation yesterday with representatives of the Partners of Veterans Association, it appears that these wonderful women are fulfilling a support role that has been denied by government and bureaucratic process for way too long. As was highlighted to us yesterday, women are the primary carers for our veterans and also the ones who keep the family together through the tough times. These women have been through some pretty tough times with their veteran husbands. Anecdotally, these women have borne the brunt of anger, frustration, disaffection and many other issues associated with our veteran community and the suffering that they have had for many years. A denial of problems over a long period of time has seen many women watch the men they love wrestle with the anguish that any person who has undertaken active duty in the armed forces would face and understand. With an extraordinary sense of courage and self-value, these women have managed to keep their marriages together while working and raising families. I commend the tenacity and strength of the members of the Partners of Veterans Association and wish them very well in their fight for, firstly, recognition and, secondly, a greater understanding of the needs of all veteran communities and veteran families. I look forward to meeting these women again and I will certainly be advising the veterans community in the electorate of Oxley of the Partners of Veterans Association. Ultimately, I would like Oxley to have the first Queensland branch of the Partners of Veterans Association. In Oxley, we have a very strong veteran community and support base. Most importantly, I think government has a huge role to play in this support process. It also has a role to play in terms of the programs and services that it provides. This is exactly why this group has come into being: there is a huge gap left by government that has to be filled. It is being filled in the best way possible by the women who have formed this association and who provide such a great service. What impresses me most about this group of women is the intelligence and tenacity with which they have addressed their issues. Even more outstanding is that the Partners of Veterans Association-and all other partners who support their veteran families in our community-is saving the government billions of dollars in care programs that would otherwise have to be out laid to do the work that they are currently doing. Their work should be recognised for the support they provide their own families and the community and for the sacrifice they make for others. I welcome them in my electorate and I would like to mention the president, Robyn Creswell; senior vice-president, Gail MacDonell; junior vice-president, Kay Pranevicius; secretary, Diane Barrett; minute secretary, Lee Hoinville; treasurer, Tineke Dalton; assistant treasurer, Michelle Harbourd; publicity officer, June Roe; and information coordinator, Leslie Minner. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Recreational Fishing hearts of many, especially in my electorate of Gilmore, although many others travel to Gilmore to share the delights of this pastime. I am talking about recreational fishing. Along our coastline, many shops do not sell fresh fish because they would go broke. They all sell bait and fishing gear instead and, believe me, they make a good living out of this. Any day or night of the week, you will find fisher people out on beaches, headlands, rocks, estuaries, river banks and in boats fishing for the big one or just fishing for dinner.",110,Representatives Main Committee

266,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.55 A.m.),"I rise this morning to speak on a subject dear to the25522 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 There has been a lot of talk about the relationship between commercial and recreational fishers and often there has been a lot of heat and recounting of anecdotes, real or exaggerated, in those discussions but not a lot of well-researched fact. Many recreational fishers have told me of the tourism dollars they bring to the area buying bait and hooks, using accommodation, feeding their families and keeping the kids occupied. Other recreational fishers have told me about how people only come to our area in the best times, overfish our resources and do damage to the habitat and species through ignorance or lack of long-term interest in our region. Still others have told me about commercial fishers who come along and take everything, damaging the environment on the way and leaving nothing for the locals or the tourists, who will go somewhere else the next time. Commercial fishers have told me about recreational fishers who trample the undergrowth along the shores and river banks, discard their rubbish thoughtlessly, and who do not know or who disregard the rules regarding fish sizes or bag limits. I have often heard that recreational fishers are a nuisance and a hazard to the environment but they buy bait. I have often heard that we should ban commercial fishers, yet people still want to buy fish and chips and commercial fishers supply the bait to recreational fishers. The issue seems a bit like some marriages: full of well-worn arguments hurled by both sides at one another without much regard for facts or possible solutions. Into this comes the work of one man, an environmental lawyer called Tom Young, who has looked at the economics of fishing in Queensland, both commercial and recreational. His analysis of the Queensland government’s own figures shows that for every $1 of fish caught by a commercial fisher, the industry returns $2.50 to the economy. For every $1 of fish caught by a recreational fisher, the industry returns over $8 to the economy. If this is true and no other benefits are being left out of this analysis, then the question has to be asked: why are we favouring commercial fishing over recreational? This government’s national indigenous fishing survey will give us some more data to work with. In Gilmore, I believe we should look at closing the lakes and estuaries to commercial fishing, especially St Georges Basin. Let us make sure our priorities are right before we destroy the natural heritage that we have. Let us work together to make sure that we get our facts right so that we can make good decisions based on those facts. Let us make sure that the money raised from our fishing licences goes to researching our own area and, if necessary, buying out our commercial licences. I thank Jim Harnwell of Yaffa Marine Group Publishing for the information and, of course, you as well, Simmo. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Defence 2000-Our Future Defence Force Debate resumed from 28 February, on motion by Mrs Worth: That the House take note of the paper. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.58 a.m.)-I appreciate this opportunity to speak about the defence white paper, Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force. I would like to direct my comments to what I see as a lost opportunity for Central Queensland in the government’s defence white paper. I have had to come back to this theme many times in speeches over the last couple of years in this House because I think it has been a recurring problem under this government. The missed opportunities in Central Queensland under this government are due to a lack of genuine understanding of what is going on in regional Queensland generally and in the specific area that I am concerned about-Central Queensland.",111,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,Thursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25523 I am very disappointed when I detect people taking a one-dimensional view of Central Queensland. It is quite easy for people from outside our region to think of Central Queensland as being dependent on only cattle and coal. These are very important industries to our region but there are many other dimensions to our current economic activity and these are going to provide the basis for our success in the future. For example, the Central Queensland University is expanding all the time and the IT industry is starting to take a much more high profile role in our region-in part due to the work of the Chamber of Commerce in Rockhampton in putting together the IT expo later this year. Other things include the high-tech light metals industry which is currently under development around Rockhampton at places like Marlborough and Stanwell, and the emerging tourism industry, which is taking on increasing importance to not only Rockhampton and the Capricorn coast but also the outback areas around the central west of my electorate. If there is one thing I want to do in this House, it is to constantly reinforce the message that Central Queensland’s potential should not be constrained by its traditional strengths because our ambitions certainly go much further. In the last couple of years, because of the lack of interest in and understanding of our capabilities and opportunities, there has been a lack of targeted support by this government for the work being done at a local level to identify opportunities for our region and develop strategies to capture those opportunities. For a number of years it has been clear that one of those opportunities lies in Rockhampton’s proximity to the Australian Defence Force’s training area at Shoalwater Bay. When I talk about the lack of targeted support by the government to underpin these sorts of opportunities that are identified at the local level, I think of things like a submission that is currently before Senator Ian Macdonald and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, under the Regional Solutions Program. That submission was put in by the Rockhampton Enterprise Ltd organisation, seeking funding for our region to develop a strategy to make our businesses and our community defence ready, so that we and our local businesses are in a position to provide appropriate logistical support to the defence training facility at Shoalwater Bay. On behalf of Rockhampton Enterprise LtdI spoke to Senator Macdonald at the end of last year about that submission, but I notice that at this stage it has not been picked up in the first round of Regional Solutions Program projects. I do hope that it is being considered very carefully, because it holds a lot of promise for our local businesses in Rockhampton and has great potential to provide employment into the future. The training facility at Shoalwater Bay is in almost constant use for training, and is the site for extensive joint exercises such as Crocodile 99, which was held with the Singaporean army, and Tandem Thrust, with the United States defence forces. We are coming up to another major exercise in May this year with the United States armed forces, as a result of which we are going to see again a major influx of people and a major influx of money into our local economy. The Singaporean armed forces are increasing their commitment to Shoalwater Bay and Central Queensland all the time. Last year it was announced that a number of local businesses were successful in tendering for contracts to provide support to the Singaporean armed forces in their use of Shoalwater Bay, and we have recently had a training exercise by the Singaporean armed forces during which those local businesses cemented their position as excellent providers of support to those armed forces. The government itself, in the budget expenditure for 1999-2000, has recognised the significance of Shoalwater Bay. Almost $10 million worth of work was committed to improving its road access, building a depot and a small-arms range, and other projects. So the Defence Force is well aware of the importance of Shoalwater Bay. But that brings me to the missed 25524 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 opportunity for Capricornia and Central Queensland. We can start with the announcement of the white paper, on 6 December last year, when the then Minister for Defence put out a press release saying, ‘White paper delivers for regional Australia.’ I read this with great excitement to see what I could glean from the white paper to tell my local community. Unfortunately, parts of regional Australia other than Darwin, Townsville, Oakey, Williamtown and Albury-Wodonga did not get a look in-and certainly not Rockhampton. That is a source of major disappointment to me and to our local businesses, which have been making such a great effort to be defence ready and to provide logistical support for even more use of Shoalwater Bay. This is all a great disappointment. On page 81 of the white paper, the government announced that a combat training centre was to be based in Townsville. It said: This facility will ensure that our combat units can be trained and tested to the highest level as quickly as possible. On current planning, this centre would begin operating around 2006. That is all the detail there is on the combat training centre. The fact that that statement says that it is going to be up and running in 2006 indicates that it is going to be a fairly significant and extensive operation. My question to the Minister for Defence is: what strategy was there for naming Townsville as the site for that combat training centre? What consideration was given to Shoalwater Bay as a site for the combat training centre, given the significance of Shoalwater Bay as the Australian Defence Force’s premier training facility? I would hate to be uncharitable to the Minister for Defence and the government and suggest that perhaps the needs of the electorate of Herbert got a bit higher priority than those of Central Queensland, given the marginality of that seat. I would like to know the actual strategic thinking that went into that decision and whether or not Shoalwater Bay, which is sitting there in Central Queensland performing a very important training task right now, was considered. It would seem logical to have that combat training centre located in Central Queensland, either in or very close to Shoalwater Bay. Rockhampton has already proved its ability to provide logistical support in these kinds of exercises for the defence forces of the Singaporean army and the Australian and United States defence forces, which use Shoalwater Bay so extensively. The white paper recognises the importance of defence to strengthening regional economies. On page 7 of the white paper there is a statement about the significant economic benefits from the defence presence enjoyed by a number of regional centres such as Darwin, Cairns and Townsville. I suggest the government has a good look at what is happening in Rockhampton; has a good look at the submission of the local business community of Rockhampton that is before Senator Macdonald, which seeks support to develop their defence-ready strategy; and has a look at what is already happening in terms of logistical support in Rockhampton for the armed forces that use Shoalwater Bay so extensively. We have the ability to do it. I invite the government to look very closely at its decision to base that combat training centre in Townsville as opposed to Central Queensland. Hopefully, we will get some more detail on that in the debate on the white paper and during the implementation of the white paper in the coming years. Again, I come back to this idea of lost opportunities for Central Queensland. We are identifying the opportunities locally. Businesses and the economic development organisations are working together very closely and we are identifying our opportunities, but we cannot do it by ourselves when decisions are made that undermine what we are doing at a local level to secure our economic future. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.09 a.m.)-The defence white paper-Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force-provides $23½ billion over the next 10 years. It will increase the armed forces by 3,500 to 54,000 by 2010; it provides for six Army battalions to be at battle readiness; and it provides planning for three new destroyers, the upgrade of the frigates, the upgrade of Collins submarines, four new AWACs, 100 aircraft to replace the FA18s and Thursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25525 F111s, 36 new helicopters, a $30 million boost for school cadets, and a greater military role for the reserves. The defence white paper is welcome and it is what is needed. It has established the basis for long-term funding well into the future. The defence white paper noted the fast growth of military capabilities in the region. It talked about strategy and how this operates as a force determinant. It looked at conceptualising strategy in terms of the defence of Australia and the direct approaches. It looked at the security of the immediate region, stability and cooperation in South-East Asia, and maintaining strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It looked at global security through an international community. All of those five things are important in terms of the Defence Force’s strategic planning. With respect to the defence of Australia, the stance is defined by self-reliance, a maritime strategy in the air and sea approaches, and also the ability to be proactive against hostile forces. In looking at the immediate neighbourhood, the Defence Force will be using forces developed for the defence of Australia to assist in evacuation, disaster relief and so on. The Defence Force also has to be able to take part in international coalitions and peacetime tasks within Australia. But the important point is that it is the defence of Australia and operations in the immediate neighbourhood which are the force determinants. Looking at the reserves-this is something that relates particularly to my electorate-the government is now changing the legislation to allow for easier call-out of the reserves and for better compensation. This is something that the reserve units at Warradale in my electorate and also in Keswick have been seeking. For the Air Force, the white paper plans to replace and upgrade the FA18s, introduce the AWACs, as I said, and replace the air-to-air refuelling capability. For the Navy, it will provide antiship missile defence for the ANZAC frigates and it will also improve the Collins by improving the platform and combat systems-all quite necessary. It will provide electronic warfare self-protection for the F111s, which is well overdue. The F111s will be replaced from 2015 to 2020, and funding will increase by three per cent per annum over the decade. If we think about the last five years of the Howard government, some of the important landmarks have been the defence efficiency review initiated by Minister McLachlan and the defence reform program. In 1997 we released a white paper on Australia’s strategic policy and, of course, there was the commitment of INTERFET troops to East Timor. Leading up to this defence white paper, there was extensive community consultation. I think that was a very valuable part of the defence white paper. The white paper recognises that decisions must balance security and fiscal responsibility. Paragraph 1.21 of the white paper makes this statement: Our armed forces are not simply a service provided by government. They are part of our national identity. The ADF reflects the kind of country we are, the role we seek to play in the world, and the way we see ourselves. Paragraph 1.22 notes the responsibilities that Defence has as an employer and a contributor to local and regional economies, and that is very important. In South Australia, we have the regulars at the RAAF base at Edinburgh, but we have nothing like the defence investment that can be seen in other states. That is something that, unfortunately, has not been addressed in the defence white paper, but I am pleased about the defence investment, which is very important to South Australia. I am also pleased that there has been a commitment to improving the submarines. Perhaps we will see, some time in the future, an announcement on rationalisation of shipyards. The white paper also talked about the way global politics have changed over the last 10 years. Intrastate conflict is now more common. Looking at the sorts of activities the Defence Force has performed, as well as being part of the Gulf War coalition of 1991, the ADF has 25526 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 sent personnel to Namibia, Somalia, Western Sahara, Rwanda, the Middle East, Cambodia, the Solomons, Papua New Guinea, Bougainville, Indonesia and East Timor as part of peacekeeping groups. The community consultation team found that most people believe the Australian Defence Force should be structured to maintain a war fighting capability for the defence of Australia. Even though peacekeeping operations are much more common, the force determinant should be a war fighting capability for the defence of Australia. Having been involved in the review of the Army through the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, that is my conclusion as well and it has been part of the evidence of many witnesses to that committee. The white paper also looked at some important issues for us in the review of coastal surveillance. This is an issue that the Defence Subcommittee looked at last year. It talked about improving surveillance and touched on new areas, including our counter-terrorist capabilities, but also a comprehensive approach to cyberattack. Looking at the global situation, the white paper said that globalisation and the primacy of the United States are the characteristics of the global situation. It went on to say that nation states remain the most important strategic actors despite nationalism, regionalism and the fragile threads of globalisation. Looking more closely at the Asia-Pacific, the major powers remain China, Japan, India, Russia and the United States. The US-China and the US-Japan relationships are very important to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Prior to the Asian economic crisis, the Asia-Pacific had witnessed the fastest growth of military capabilities. Various studies have said that this was not a threatening thing; it was more a catch-up. We now have a situation where nine countries in the region will have beyond visual range air combat forces by 2005. Some countries will be acquiring AEW&Cs. In navy we see a proliferation of antiship missiles, an expansion of the submarine fleet and also improvement in antisubmarine warfare capabilities. For the strike forces, improved strike capabilities and land forces will be more sophisticated. That is the situation with weapons of mass destruction. We have India and Pakistan in the Indian Ocean region as nuclear weapon states. Looking at strategic relationships, the most important one for Australia is the US alliance. give Australia access to United States military technology, including in critical and sensitive areas. The white paper stated that sustained US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is important to stability. That is how I feel. Community consultation found that there is strong support for the United States alliance in the Australian community in the context of self-reliance. Talking about South-East Asia, they said that overall probably no country has a greater range and depth of defence contact with the countries of South-East Asia than Australia. That was recognised by Colin Powell in his confirmation hearings before the United States Senate when he said that, in terms of their ally Australia, the United States appreciated the interest we had taken in Indonesia and liked what we had done in East Timor. They would be looking at working closely with us within South-East Asia. It is an area where our expertise has been recognised. Another important relationship is that with Singapore. Due to space constraints, Singapore undertakes extensive training in Australia at the helicopter base at Oakey with the RAAF in Western Australia. We still have an involvement in Butterworth in Malaysia. It is no longer an Australian base but Australian personnel are serving in Butterworth. The Five Power Defence Arrangements are now over 30 years old but they are still important in terms of our contacts in South-East Asia. We have important bilateral relations with the Philippines and Thailand. Tremendous support and leadership was shown by Thailand in East Timor in 1999-2000. Of course, we are participants in the ASEAN Regional Forum. Thursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25527 To look at strategy: the important things in defending Australia are self-reliance, a maritime strategy and proactive operations against hostile forces. In contributing to the security of the immediate neighbourhood, the Australian Defence Force needs to plan for several operations simultaneously, not only to resist aggression but also in relation to evacuations, disaster relief and peacekeeping. We have seen that demonstrated very effectively over recent years with drought relief in Papua New Guinea, relief after the tsunami and so on. In terms of supporting wider interests, it is to be expected that Australia will be part of international coalitions. However, it is most likely that these will be in the immediate region and the Asia-Pacific. Beyond the Asia-Pacific it is likely that there will only be a modest contribution from Australia. The principles which need to govern our force are to have operational flexibility, because you cannot predict the circumstances that the ADF will be engaged in in the future; an integrated capability; interoperability with other forces; a fully developed capability; a capability and knowledge edge, with innovation in doctrine, organisation and logistics; operational concurrency; sustainment; a technology focus-we need to learn the lessons from the Collins class submarines-and cost-effectiveness. On the white paper provisions for defence expenditure over the next 10 years: in 1998 the Defence Subcommittee released the report Funding Australia’s defence, which raised many of the issues which have now been addressed by the white paper. I welcome the provision for defence spending and the very thoughtful planning of our force over the next 10 to 20 years. This defence white paper presents a hard-headed view of our regional security. It is written in stronger language than before. I support the document. 2000: Our Future Defence Force. We believe that it should have come out about 18 months earlier, and that defence has been in a strategic vacuum for too long. Having said that, we welcome the white paper very much. Defence has enjoyed, in the main, bipartisan support in this parliament. That is a good thing. It is as it should be. Having been in parliament 18 years this week, I guess the last time there were serious divisions here on defence issues would have been during the Vietnam years, long before I came. That division was not so much on the defence forces or the troops themselves as on the political question of whether Australia should have been involved in that conflict. Since that time, there has been largely bipartisan support in parliament on defence issues. Obviously, the exercise in Timor during the last couple of years has also brought defence to the fore. I think that Australians, from the time when our involvement in that began, have been becoming much more aware of our defence forces and talking much more about defence, and much more has been written in the newspapers about defence than in preceding years. From a defence point of view, Timor has in many respects put Australia on the international map even more than before. This was brought home very starkly to me when, Mr Deputy Speaker, along with my colleague Senator Alan Ferguson, we were the parliamentary representatives to the last session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. My good colleague and friend is going to represent Australia ably there this year also. At that time in New York, we were often spoken to about Australia’s role in Timor and so forth. Given the arc of instability in our part of the world, a lot of people were looking at what was happening in Aceh and in the other parts of the Indonesian archipelago. Some went so far as to say that they had heard, and they knew, that Australia was going to take a lead role there.",112,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (10.22 A.m.),"Labor welcomes the white paper entitled Defence25528 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 I always said to people-and I always stressed that I was not a member of the governmentthat I would be very surprised if Australia ever took the lead role in that part of the world again, despite what Colin Powell and others might say. We would go in there in a support role, which is right. Timor had a special meaning to Australia, and Australia felt a responsibility towards Timor. I do not think it is too far fetched to say that it was a conscience issue for many Australians for many years. Rightly or wrongly, there was a certain feeling of guilt. It just happened to be a coincidence that, over many years, we had been moving the Army north. We even had the people mover in Darwin at that time. There were a whole lot of fortunate coincidences. When the troops went in, they did such a magnificent job. People sometimes talked about, and there were articles in the paper, whether or not the Australian forces went in too aggressively. The one thing that people should always bear in mind is that we had young Australian men and women of 18 or 19 years of age who had never been in a conflict situation before. When the first wave of troops went in, they had absolutely no idea what they were going to face in Timor. We were not talking about a village vicarage party; we were talking about an armed conflict situation where lives were on the line. Of course, they had to be prepared for all eventualities. They were magnificently led and they carried out that role in a magnificent way. The member for Boothby and I both serve on the Defence Subcommittee. One of the things he said-and I believe it as well-is that the Timor situation showed how well we trained our troops. A few years ago the Canadians decided that the big thing was going to be peacekeeping and peacemaking. They trained their forces in peacemaking. That was very good, but the Canadians learnt that that was not the way to go and they learnt that at a cost. It troubles me slightly that the New Zealanders are going the same way. That is the way they are looking at training their defence forces. I fundamentally believe that what you do is train your troops for combat situations and then, if they need to, they can adapt to the peacekeeping role. We have seen Australians do that in so many parts of the world. I believe it is very important that that happens. We have suddenly realised that, instead of living in this peaceful part of the world, we are living in a part of the world which is very unstable. You just have to look around. Who knows what might or might not happen in Fiji. Papua New Guinea is always a concern. Then there are the Solomon Islands and the whole of the Indonesian archipelago. I think that Australians are going to become more aware of what is happening in that area. The government had a community consultation process. Indeed, the honourable member for Cunningham and I set up a meeting in our area to consult with the community. We fed what happened in the Illawarra into this. I thought that was a good idea. I have one concern about it. At the very same time that community consultation process was going on, this parliament, through the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, also had an inquiry. The witnesses came before us and they were covered by parliamentary privilege. They were not in the other inquiry. I feel this often undermines the work of the parliament and the government-I do not care what political persuasion it is. The community consultation process was carried out. It was led ably by Andrew Peacock and assisted by Stephen Loosely, a former senator. They did a great job. In many respects, it was a job for the parliament. It was a job we should have done through our committees. We should have brought back a report, presented it to the parliament and debated it. That is something we should look at. The Labor Party have no fundamental disagreement with this white paper. We will quibble about certain aspects around the edges but we would claim that it basically reflects Labor’s policies on defence. There is a modest increase in spending over the next decade. There will be a lot of concern on how this increased spending is carried out. Every so often over the years, defence people criticise what happens in defence. I have been around the defence scene of this country for many years, not only as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on ForThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25529 eign Affairs, Defence and Trade but also being on the Public Works Committee. I do not think there is a defence base in Australia that I have not visited at least once. When Labor were in government, we put in an amount of money. I was very involved with APIN, the movement of the Australian forces to the north. I have a few reservations about that. I do not want to see all our forces in the north because I do not think the north is the best place in the world to live from the point of view of family relationships. There have been a few problems there. Despite the Defence Housing Authority and the provision of good accommodation in those areas, young people are often separated from their families when they go to the north, especially wives. If they have young children, they are usually looking for family support and they have not always got that in the north. Having said that, I very much support the movement of the defence forces to the north. I have always supported what we have been doing in Townsville and the arc of bases from Curtin to Tindal and Scherger. I take the fairly simplistic view that, if Australia is going to be attacked, it is not going to be from Antarctica. The areas to our north will give us the most trouble, so I support the movement of the forces to the north. But I also think we should build up some of those bases in the south. We must not let places like Puckapunyal, Singleton or Wagga decline, because they will continue to play a very important role. What is recommended in here is not a big increase in spending. There is a modest increase in spending. Another issue that we have to address in the defence forces is recruitment and whether we are going to get the projected extra numbers that it is claimed we need. We have a high separation rate within the defence forces and this costs Australian taxpayers considerable amounts of money. Maybe we should look at that. The other issue that I think should be addressed-and I know that the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham, has made speeches about this and has addressed it as an issue-is the partnership and support strategy needed for our defence industry. It is not really identified in this white paper-and the shadow minister has said this many times-but we have to ensure that the economic benefits of not millions but billions of dollars being spent on defence equipment flow through to the domestic economy. There are all sorts of benefits from defence spending. I do not see why all those benefits should go overseas. There are benefits not only from the actual expenditure of dollars but also from the very important role of research. We have to get some of our universities more involved in research so that the spin-offs go to Australia rather than always going overseas. We have also got to have effective intelligence. We have to know what is going on around Australian shores before we start talking about defence priorities and defending Australia. We have to know what is going on internationally. You cannot talk about defence policy in a vacuum; it is part of international diplomacy. It is very important that we not allow defence considerations to operate in a foreign policy vacuum. Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, I know that you have a great interest in defence issues with HMAS Albatross based in your electorate. Labor started spending a lot of money on the base-although others often claim it-and it is good that the government is continuing to put money in there. The opposition supports the main thrust of the defence white paper. We all take great pride in our defence forces. I have had the privilege of visiting Timor twice since our troops have been there. They are doing a magnificent job, which is a reflection of the high priority given to our defence forces both from the opposition when we were in government and from the current government. What we spend on defence is money well spent. I think that our defence forces do us proud in the way they represent us in so many parts of the world. Incidentally, a lot of people talk about where Australia’s peacekeeping forces are. What a lot of people do not realise is that in many other parts of the world we have one or two advisers. We are so highly respected, especially in the UN, that often Australia is called on-it 25530 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 might be one officer or one supervisor-to advise on a situation somewhere in the world. It rarely makes the media here, but it does have a big impact internationally and it is very important that that role is carried out by an Australian. Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force and the government’s response to it. The white paper is a function of government to arouse public discussion on an issue and to gain input and contributions from experts and the public alike. This has been a wide-ranging process by the team led by the Hon. Andrew Peacock, relying to a large extent upon the expertise within the defence forces of Australia but also consulting broadly with the public. The two main outcomes of the inquiry-and the government’s decision-have been a large funding increase and a commitment to long-term capacity improvement and a modest increase in people in uniform. This is one of the most successful defence processes ever undertaken by any government, and one that I have not seen undertaken before. It took into account not only the immediate defence needs but also a long-term vision of 10 years. It also built upon what I consider the exceptional work that has been done in our region and, more broadly, by our Foreign Minister. The team considered our multilateral relationships and our bilateral relationships, but the self reliance factor of Australian defence was given a broader consideration in that we continue to realise that self-reliance is not the complete answer-that is, we must have a mix of self reliance and strategic alliances. I want to compliment the former minister, John Moore, and the current Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, on their capacity to drive the reform and to move ahead. I felt that, during the Labor administration, while the current Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Defence, he had a liking for defence, but he was more interested in the esoterics on the one hand and the toys on the other. I do not think he had a particular commitment to defence in the way that was needed by Australia, because during the period when he led Defence there were consistent reductions in expenditure and a falling capacity. The self-defence aspect of the white paper means that the government wants an integrated and balanced joint force that is capable of serving Australia. That will mainly depend on a sea-air relationship. We need also to consider our role in the region. We need Australia to be secure in order to have a secure region. The involvement of Australia in a wider field than its immediate shores is seen by some as an outreach to assert some sort of superiority in the region. I do not see that as part of the Australian character or the implementation of foreign affairs or defence roles for Australia. However, a secure region does mean a secure Australia, and that must be a goal so that we can successfully promote peace and security in our region. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know that you, in particular, are aware of Australia’s specific involvements. Of course, during the last two years that involvement has risen to a peak not previously reached outside a direct confrontation or war situation. But there are several regions in which Australia needs to be involved. I refer to the South Pacific area, and we are active in that area. There is the area to our immediate north, Papua New Guinea and West Irian. I refer also to our South-East Asian responsibilities where, in cooperation with others, we have been called on to fill a strategic role. There is also a world role with the United Nations that Australia needs to acknowledge that we have, as a global citizen. The Australian reputation is high in that area. The rule of law and the respect for human rights are something that Australians hold dear. They are at the forefront. They do not like to see somebody crushing somebody who is weaker. They are quick to spring to the defence of somebody who is being abused. We cannot always take up causes that strike the heart of the Australian people. Whether it be in the Sudan or in areas of Indonesia, it is not always possible for us to take an active role.",117,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.37 A.m.),"The House is debating the defence white paperThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25531 The first aspect of a successful defence policy is to have an active foreign affairs policy, because the answer is not to go to arms in order to get a military resolution; we should try to prevent that where it appears it is going to happen. That is a matter of working through the global organisations, our aid programs, our advice programs, our assistance programs of all types. Our role in refugee settlement is not insignificant in that regard. When it comes to the bottom line, we have, I suspect, an ascending scale of involvement. It starts with disaster relief. That is an area in which the military can be involved. We have a role in the evacuation of Australian nationals where there is a threat to their safety. We have a role in unarmed peace monitoring processes. Of course, we have the full-scale involvement through the United Nations, where our defence personnel are requested to maintain a full peacekeeping requirement. Ultimately, I suppose, the recent test was East Timor. We are currently involved in East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. As a nation, we have conducted a surveillance and supporting role in things such as the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and, of course, the Olympic Games. Australia is also contributing personnel to UN operations around the world. Australia is a middle-ranking power. We have to rely on both self and others. Australians are not so self-interested or so puffed up with our own significance that we want to dominate our region, but we must adopt a balanced approach, so there must be alliances as well as self-reliance; there must be the defence of Australia as well as a regional commitment. We face the prospect of conventional war and non-combatant military operations. We have to deal with the current situation and we have to plan ahead. That is what this white paper does and that is the way the government has responded to it. An unpredictable future for our region means that the planning needs to be broad. The government has responded to the process of the white paper. The response involved consultation with a large number of people and went through a large number of processes. In particular, having made those broad comments about the paper, the government has sought to strengthen the air and maritime capacity in a sensible way. In regard to maritime capacity, I sound a note of warning to the government and to the House. I was a member of the parliamentary accounts committee that looked at the construction of the Tobruk. That was an absolute disaster. The Collins class submarines followed the same pattern to a large extent. We need to be vigilant in telling our maritime designers and our people making commitments in the maritime area that we have a requirement for them to be accurate in their forecasting and budgeting, and to deliver the goods that they promise on time and of a type that they have promised. I will not recount the difficulties with Tobruk, but it is my understanding that she can only beach in one area of Australia-and she was supposed to be a landing vessel. The construction is such that it does not meet the design requirements. The Collins submarines have had similar problems and a huge expense overrun. We have to be careful in these areas. It is no good when ministers or governments allow Defence to commit to something on a very low and somewhat ill-prepared cost basis with a view from Defence that, once they have captured our support in the budget, we must complete the project by paying whatever the cost may be. That is not the process that this government is looking for from the defence forces or from the Department of Defence and it is time that that culture changed. I hope it has changed. We do not want any more Collins; we do not want any more Tobruks. We need the equipment, we need the craft, but we need it to be done in a professional manner. The neglect of the Army has been largely remedied in the white paper and in the government’s decisions. The involvement of industry in Australia’s defence continues and will get increased emphasis. Here again, I want to sound a warning because I consider the outsourcing of much of Defence is something that needs to be watched. I can remember a time when the Navy could not gain access to its own vessels on Sydney Harbour because the painters and 25532 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 dockers union were holding them up and preventing them going on board. That should never happen in Australia-that cannot happen. We cannot have the prospect of an East Timor on our backs and not being able to move aircraft, military equipment or vessels because of an outsourcing process. A great deal of care is needed in outsourcing. It should not be outsourcing for the sake of outsourcing but outsourcing because the outcome is beneficial to the overall defence cause. The leadership role in Defence is mentioned in the white paper. The tension between civilian and military leadership is always present. I would like to see a real leadership role in Defence rather than a bureaucratic role. We have suffered from a bureaucratic role for too long. It goes back a long way. Our military people should never have good advice or proper decisions stifled by bureaucratic interference. They must feel free and confident to give advice to government in an unhampered way. I think that the leadership in Defence is now at about the right balance. The bureaucratic control of Defence and the huge number of bureaucratic members of Defence need to be constantly monitored. Another aspect of Defence which is of concern to me is defence property. I see a theory arising that the land value of, for instance, RAAF Base Richmond is so high that the land needs to be flogged off and some alternative air transport base established. I am completely opposed to that concept, because it neither has economic logic nor a rational defence basis. I do not know of any defence air transport company in Australia that would put its base in a remote location so that it has to send its trucks or aircraft to the source of its goods and then carry those goods where they are needed. Such companies usually base their depots alongside their source of supply or as close to them as they can get. That is why Richmond was chosen as an air transport site. It should remain as such, because there is an extremely logical reason. I would like to say a few words in regard to the reserve, because whilst the white paper deals with that only in part, the declining role of the reserve in Australia is a real concern to me. Its numbers are down. The Australian Labor Party fooled around with the Ready Reserve concept and that did not help too much. The reserve numbers started to decline and have continued to decline. The government’s decisions will revive the reserve but the reserve urgently needs to be rebuilt and nurtured. Timor illustrated the significance of the reserve. If we neglect the expertise that can be drawn from our civilian community, then we are foolish. This is an enlightened step forward in defence and is something that every Australian should support. bate on the defence white paper, Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force. It seems so long ago that the white paper was tabled in the parliament but I realised when I read through some speeches this morning that it was in fact tabled quite recently-in December. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then, hasn’t it? In my view, not the least of the problems we have experienced since then is the government’s continued failure in the defence area. I will address that issue shortly. I note that in his contribution to this debate on 6 December our leader, Kim Beazley, posited what I think is a very good overview of the strategic matters we need to deal with in a contemporary environment and the Defence Force structure we should have. I am sure that it is clear to all of us that the concept of self-reliance is fundamental. This was the case when Labor was in government but I am afraid the present government has, since it came to office, reduced Australia’s capacity for self-reliance in defence matters. The strategy of self-reliance should be based on a policy that names self-reliance as a specific strategy target: a realistic alliance strategy of security links with the US and a diplomatic strategy of engagement with Asia that is neither aggressive nor isolationist. I would think that the bulk of the Australian community would say that that is a very rational approach to the way things should be.",120,Representatives Main Committee
270,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (10.52 A.m.),"I am pleased to participate in this deThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25533 As Mr Beazley indicated, Labor has four priorities. The first is intelligence, which is of paramount importance for a country with a professional defence force numbering only about 15,000 members and trying to protect 10 per cent of the world’s landmass. This is where Australia’s alliance with the United States can be most advantageous, but you would think from present debates in this country that that was not the case. The second priority is the need to counter threats on the maritime approaches. For this purpose the Labor Party believes that we ought to have a coastguard; I support that view. This is one of the major platform items already announced by Mr Beazley in January 2000. It is of particular importance in the Northern Territory as, in recent times, there has been an increase in illicit drug imports and illegal immigration. This increase has been shown to affect the Territory and it highlights the need for a coastguard service or something similar-certainly a lot more than we currently have. That is not to say that the Defence Force personnel who are involved in this work do not do a magnificent job, but in my view they are under-resourced and they do not necessarily have vessels that are appropriate to the task. It is time for us to look at a different way of doing things in that area. The third issue is the question of strike capabilities, which I think are under threat. While defence policy should concentrate on the main aim, defence, there should also be the ability to strike at focal points of threat to Australia. This means there must be a premium on aerial strike, submarine and special forces capability. The fourth priority, importantly for all of Australia but most importantly for where I live, is the fundamental need to defend the Top End. The Labor Party has asserted that it is most important that the Top End be protected. That is why it initiated the Army presence in the north in the early 1980s, to the point where now a large proportion of Australia’s Army capacity is in the Top End. With the Air Force in Tindal and the naval base in Darwin, there has been a massive relocation of defence forces to the Top End. That is appropriate, because the Top End is clearly the region of greatest exposure to military threat. I will focus this morning on personnel, which is critical if we are to have a defence force that is capable of self-reliance. I am very concerned about what I believe to be very low levels of morale amongst many units in the Australian Defence Force. It is certainly true in the Top End of Australia, where the Defence Force community believes it has been given short shrift by this government, particularly by the minister responsible for defence personnel matters, Minister Scott. There is a range of issues currently on the boil which have affected that attitude. In this chamber and in the main chamber on a number of occasions, I have raised one of those issues: the question of remote locality leave travel. I will come back to that in a moment. Remote locality leave travel is part of a range of issues which are affecting morale amongst Defence Force personnel, certainly in the Top End. The second issue is the proposed change to the methodology for calculating district allowance, which will hit all serving members in Northern Australia. In my view, this needs to be rethought. We understand that more than 500 ADF members are ineligible for the new housing loan scheme, the Defence Home Owners Scheme, because they failed to revoke a non-existent eligibility for the previous loan scheme. It is not their fault, yet they have to pay. Nothing has been done by Defence to fix the problem. It is also clear that maternity leave provisions as they currently exist are potentially discriminatory. If you take more than three months leave without pay as part of your entitlement, this then counts as non-continuous service and you stand to lose your promotion date. The fifth issue is that the Soldier Career Management Agency needs to examine what it is up to, because it is refusing to approve discharges, despite unit recommendations that they be approved. Why keep people in the defence forces who do not want to be there anymore and are 25534 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 clearly surplus to the immediate requirements of their units? Lastly, and most recently, is an issue which affects people in East Timor. I have been to East Timor on half a dozen occasions since the end of 1999. I am absolutely speechless, in a sense, in terms of defining the professionalism, integrity and work ethic of the Australian Defence Force, and the role that they have played and continue to play in East Timor. They do it without moaning-although, obviously, they raise issues from time to time, such as the adequacy of equipment, rations and those sorts of things, and you would expect that. Recently-I think it was three weeks ago-seven Austarlian Defence Force personnel were sent to East Timor in a group called the Australian Training Group. Their purpose is to provide training for the formation of a defence force for the people of East Timor-that is, the old Falantil forces. This is being done jointly by Portugal and Australia. These people have been in East Timor for over three weeks. They are in East Timor on visitor status. Essentially, they have no rights. These Defence Force personnel are not armed, they are not allowed to drive and they are restricted in their travels. At the moment they accrue no benefits for themselves or their families, even though they are serving in an area of operation where other Defence Force personnel under the Blue Beret are receiving full benefits. They have to pay full taxes, they do not get any allowances and, in one case reported to me, one soldier’s mother, who has a heart condition, had no way of contacting her son. These soldiers’ families have not got the access to welfare and support or removal to the nearest family member which is usual in these circumstances. To their credit, senior management within local units in the Top End are appalled at this situation. I would be very surprised if land headquarters were not equally appalled. I have raised this issue with Minister Scott’s office. Minister Scott’s office has failed to return the calls. This is symptomatic of the contempt in which I believe Minister Scott, his office and some areas of the Department of Defence are holding Australian Defence Force personnel. This is a minor issue-an important issue but, in the scheme of things, small. It is not something which would cost a lot of money, but apparently it is administratively too difficult to do. I am putting the government on notice that I will continue to raise this issue until it is fixed. I will do all in my power to embarrass the government into fixing this problem today. If they will not fix it today, I will continue until they do, just as I will not rest until the issue of remote locality of leave travel is properly addressed. Let there be no doubt about what the issue is there. I have had a running battle with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Minister Scott, on this issue. I will not detail what remote locality leave travel is-because I have done before in this place and the Hansard is there for people to see-other than to say that there has been a dramatic decline in the dollar value of the entitlement. The minister says, ‘The entitlement still remains.’ That is true. He will not acknowledge that, as a result of the changes which have been made to the way in which the entitlement is administered and the arrangements that the Department of Defence have got with Qantas Airways, the dollar value to the Defence Force personnel so affected has declined substantially, to the point where many Defence Force personnel are unable to take their leave because they cannot afford to pay the difference between the remote locality leave travel entitlement and the cost of the airfares to the destination to which they want to go-say, Sydney or Melbourne. As recently as last week, I spoke to Defence Force personnel in Darwin who said to me that this is an issue of grave concern to the Defence Force community. It has been raised with the minister on a continuing basis for the last seven or eight months-certainly, it was raised at almost this time last year-yet he has failed to do anything about it. The cost of addressing this, I am advised, is around $10 million. I also understand that there are savings that have been achieved as a result of the impact on fringe benefits tax. For the sake of $10 million, this Thursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25535 government has dramatically eroded the morale of Defence Force personnel in the Top End of Australia. I think that is an outright scandal. When I see the Minister for Defence get on his scrapers in the chamber, trying to say what the government has done to advance the cause of defence in Australia, I want to say to him that what they have not done is the basic work of addressing the fundamental needs of Australia’s Defence Force personnel in order to ensure they stay committed to the job that we need and want them to do. This government has failed the Australian community. This government needs to pay attention, put its eye on the ball and understand that, if we want to have an adequate and capable Defence Force, we have got to look after service personnel. Whilst in East Timor, I was appalled to learn that the senior Australian officer, General Smith, has been advised that when he comes back to Australia he will have no job. I do not know what is behind that, but I have to say that, given the experience of this gentleman and the work that he has done over the last 12 months, an explanation needs to be given by the government. fundamental review of Australia’s defence policy in order to form the development of a white paper. The white paper which was released in December last year-Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force-is the most significant statement on defence policy for more than a decade. It communicates the outcomes of the government’s rigorous consideration of key issues facing defence into the future. Specifically, the white paper addresses Australia’s strategic environment, our national defence and strategic interests, and our important strategic relationships. It outlines the key roles that the Australian Defence Force must focus on in the future and provides a comprehensive plan for the future capability development of the Australian Defence Force. One of the key planks of the white paper is an increase in defence funding of an average three per cent per annum in real terms over the coming decade, with an immediate increase of $500 million in 2001-02 and $1,000 million in the following year. In all, defence spending over the decade is expected to increase by a total of $23.5 billion in real terms. The press and the public have received the white paper extremely well. Strategic analyst Alan Dupont, writing in the Australian, said: This is the best White Paper on Defence in the past 25 years. It provides a strategic roadmap ... a good outcome for defence and the country as a whole. Professor Paul Dibb, architect of the Labor government’s 1986 review of Australian defence needs, which led to Kim Beazley’s 1987 defence white paper, said that it is ‘arguably the best defence white paper Australia has produced’. Newspapers across Australia have also hailed the government’s achievement. The Advertiser called it ‘realistic and sophisticated’; the Sydney Morning Herald, an ‘impressive document’; the Australian Financial Review, a ‘positive path to future security’; and the Australian, a ‘level-headed response to Australia’s defence needs’. Implementation of the policy directions outlined in the white paper has already commenced, with the signing of the AEWC contract and the release of the tender for armed reconnaissance helicopters, and will be further developed throughout the year. The government’s defence white paper is a commitment to the defence of Australia and the future needs of the Australian Defence Force. The Australian public were also given the chance to tell the government what they believe should be the priorities of Australia’s armed forces. The community consultation process established this white paper as one that not only the government but also the Australian people can be proud of.",122,Representatives Main Committee
271,Mr Schultz (Hume) (11.07 A.m.),"Over the past year, the government carried out a25536 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 With this in mind and unlike the Labor Party’s approach to defence, the coalition believes that the military is not just for show; its equipment must be the best in the world. As we showed in East Timor, we have a world-class defence force. But complacency will see quality fall. The defence white paper will see the Australian military meet our immediate and long term defence objectives and our commitment to global security. The government has recognised the need to upgrade our defence equipment and to have the troops required to man the equipment and meet our strategic challenges. The new acquisitions that will be included in this upgrade are two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters, additional troop-lift helicopters, airborne early warning and control aircraft, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, $13.5 billion to replace and/or upgrade the ageing FA18 Hornets and F111s, and new combat systems and platform modifications for all six Collins class submarines. The government’s defence white paper included valuable initiatives which will provide benefits to communities across Australia. A significant amount of the increased investment and funding announced in the white paper is expected to be spent in this country. A number of specific measures contained in the white paper will be of particular benefit to regional centres. They include an expansion in the number of infantry battalions at a level of high readiness from four to six. This commitment will continue beyond the East Timor deployment and generate ongoing benefits for Darwin, Brisbane and Townsville, which are home to large defence communities. Further, two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters will be based in Townsville and Darwin, with additional training facilities developed at Oakey, Queenslandthis must have been received very positively in those areas. Other measures include the airborne early warning and control aircraft project, which will bring significant work to the Hunter and Brisbane regions, with aircraft eventually being based and maintained at Williamtown, New South Wales and platform modifications and an upgrade program for the Collins class submarines, which will continue at the Australian Submarine Corporation facilities in Adelaide, South Australia. We have also a government commitment to maintain the F111 as our principal strike platform, which will have important long-term benefits for the community of Amberley in Queensland; a new army combat training and evaluation centre to be established in Townsville; a commitment to build three air warfare destroyers, replace the current patrol boats and support ships, and upgrade and modernise Australia’s service fleet, which will provide significant opportunities for the domestic shipbuilding industry and related industry sectors; and the upgrade of 350 M113 armed personnel carriers, which will provide additional work in the Albury-Wodonga area-to be gratefully received by that community, I know. Another positive contribution to Australian industry is the further development of the Nulka missile decoy system, which will provide work opportunities in South Australia. And the provision of opportunities for companies around Australia to tender for a range of upgrade and modernisation projects for aircraft, ships, vehicles and communication systems is to be commended. I am sure industry will receive it very favourably. I mentioned the Collins class submarines. I know that the upgrading of the Collins class submarines will be of particular interest to the Leader of the Opposition-although he does not seem as proud of them now as he was when he launched them. We can only hope that he does not put the same level of interest into other areas of defence, because I do not think we could afford it. Thursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25537 The government has also recognised that there is no point having the best equipment in the world if you do not have the skilled personnel to man them. The government’s commitment to ADF personnel is obvious when you see that we will spend over $4 billion on personnel under the provisions in the white paper. The greatest challenge is to increase the number of troops from 52,500 to about 54,000 full-time personnel by 2010. To do this, the government will make military life more accommodating for families, as the drain of talent from the middle ranks is often caused by the harsh facts of military life. In this area, the ADF will concentrate on limiting the impact of postings on families. It will improve education and training, aligning Defence Force education and training with the national training framework. It will be illustrating to employers the benefits of employing reservists due to their increased military-learnt competencies. It will be improving military postgraduate education and educational service at the Australian Defence Force Academy and using innovative and flexible learning techniques. We also stress that there will be an improvement in links with the Australian Services Cadet Scheme. I think that is a very positive contribution. As a person who sponsors a number of cadet units in the electorate of Hume, I am very pleased to see that happening. That improvement in links will come through the Naval Reserve Cadets, the Australian Army Cadet Corps, and the Air Training Corps. In 1999, 22 per cent of full-time ADF personnel and 25 per cent of reservists had once been cadets. Currently, there are 25,000 cadets in 417 units throughout Australia, providing youth development programs and a taste of military life. There is no better funnel for people to the Defence Force than the cadet system. The government will also increase cadet funding to $30 million a year by the year 2002. The cadet scheme obviously provides mental and physical challenges. It also enhances self-esteem and self-discipline, so readily received by the community today and in the past. Revolutionising the role of the Australian Defence Force Reserve, which comprises 42 per cent of the total Australian Defence Force, includes measures such as recognising the importance of reservists to our total defence capacity, protecting reservists’ civilian jobs and supporting their families and employers. An amount of $20 million a year will be made available for financial assistance to employers and self-employed reservists who are required for extended periods of training or operational deployment. The government is leading the way by instituting leave policies and employment practices that support reservists undertaking ADF training or deployment. It is also in the business of recognising the unique skills reservists bring to defence through their civilian roles and of training reservists in skills that will be recognised in the private sector and that improve their employability. This will result in better recruitment and retention strategies. The other great problem is the retention of the troops that the ADF has already trained. The fact that the private sector headhunts defence personnel is a testimony to the quality of the training and of the people in the ADF. However, this does create a problem in the middle ranks. As the paper says: Recruiting, developing and retaining high-quality people in our Navy, Army and Air Force is essential to turning weapons, equipment and systems into world-class capabilities. To solve the departure of skilled personnel, the government will structure a military career to the needs and expectations of the skilled people it attracts every year. The government will create remuneration packages to meet the needs of personnel with a pay system that goes beyond paying on the basis of rank and acknowledges skills as well, taking account of labour market forces and recognising people’s expectations of a military career. It will also adopt a long-term care approach to people’s careers within the ADF, focusing on superannuation, compensation and entitlements. It should be remembered that Australia is maintaining its position as a peaceful member of the world community with the ability to join and lead such forces as UN peacekeeping mis25538 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 sions. The most obvious is the superb recent effort of INTERFET in Timor. However, if the opposition had had its way, defence would have been cut in our first budget. Instead, thankfully, the Australian Defence Force was capable of meeting the East Timor challenge-a crisis on our doorstep. Thanks to this white paper, any future event such as the East Timor deployment will be able to be met without placing an undue burden on our defence capability. The measures the government will adopt will allow the Australian Defence Force to meet multiple needs at the same time, independent of or in coalition deployment with other nations. The government acknowledges that we are a nation with our own needs and imperatives. It places great importance on the alliance, on self-reliance in the defence of Australia and regional commitments. Conventional war and non-combat military operations such as humanitarian relief, evacuations, peacekeeping and peace enforcement are an integral part of Australia’s commitment to overseas agencies. In total, the government’s commitment to the Australian Defence Force has been reinforced and its future development has been guaranteed. After the neglect of the Labor years, when Mr Beazley was more interested in riding in tanks than in the care of the men driving them, this government is not only meeting the needs of the ADF today but is making sure that the ADF can meet the challenges of tomorrow. I commend the white paper to the chamber. Future Defence Force-is a useful document. We should really put it in context. This government, like its predecessor conservative governments, is desperately trying to recreate the fifties and sixties for the khaki election. Let us remember that, back in 1980, when the Russians invaded Afghanistan, the Fraser government used it as a platform to generate a whole raft of defence activities. If we think back to 1980-81, we remember that they initiated a submarine project, a new surface combatant and a replacement for the M113s, Project Waler. They were active in terms of the F111 replacements, which was also a Menzies khaki election exercise back in 1966. And lo and behold-what goes around comes around-we have a conservative government in office, heading towards a bad election, so we see a whole new raft of defence spending, a massive spending program. Funny about that; it seems to be a recurrent theme on the conservative side of politics. The tragedy is that to establish that credibility they had to do a great deal of damage to defence. And damage they did, in two key areas. The first one is perhaps the most difficult to correct in the longer term. I refer to the damage to defence industry and defence manufacturing. There was a cavalcade of meetings around the countryside, chaired by Andrew Peacock and others, in order to talk to the community. That is not a bad thing to do; it is quite a useful exercise. The interesting thing was not the discussions that took place but the discussion paper that was issued-and not what it contained but what it did not contain. That discussion paper did not contain reference to defence industry. In other words, all those people who orchestrated this exercise and the consultation with the community in order to set the standards and the future direction of defence are saying that industry was not mentioned. Let me tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, what the community did, because the community understands that self-reliance, sovereignty and some sense of independence require us to have a capacity. I will come back shortly to the Fraser initiatives and what did not occur at that time. But staying on the theme of defence industry, it is fascinating to look at the white paper. In chapter 9, paragraph 9.12 states: The Government will also seek to make greater use of off-the-shelf purchases ... What does ‘off-the-shelf purchases’ mean? It means we will not do it ourselves; we will import ready made. A good example of that is contained in this week’s Courier-Mail, which talks about the AWACs and the work that was going to go to Amberley. I am sorry, Queenslanders, but you missed out. Because they have reduced the order from seven to four, it will",125,Representatives Main Committee
272,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (11.21 A.m.),"This white paper-Defence 2000: OurThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25539 now be done in America, purchased off the shelf. The insight into this government’s real understanding of defence is clear from this discussion paper. Industry is not mentioned and what flows through is industry being wiped out. There will be a greater use of off-the-shelf purchasing. More importantly, in the buying strategies and processes, the acquisition processes do not factor in Australian production. I return to Mr Fraser’s proposals in 1980 for a whole raft of defence equipment. The proposals were all initiated but provision never was made for them in the budget. The funds were not projected so there was a spend of an enormous dimension coming along but no money. One has this terrible feeling that we are about to see that all over again. One has a real sense of deja vu because this conservative government is projecting a whole raft of new defence spending but, somehow, there ain’t no money. But they are a little cleverer this time, because in the last five years the government have deferred defence spending. A whole stack of products that were to have been acquired have been postponed. AWACS is one example. There were supposed to have been seven Boeing aircraft for the airborne early warning system. That project has been deferred over and over again, and the number of aircraft has now been reduced to four. The other example-a very dramatic example-is the patrol boats. The patrol boat program was agreed to by both sides of politics literally years ago. It is not a controversial program. There is no argument about it; the patrol boats are required. But these things have a long lead time. The companies that build these products take a long time to get organised and the tendering process is a long one. This government has postponed the patrol boat program for the three years. The request for tender was supposed to have come out in March last year-final last offer, absolutely guaranteed. And what happened? It was postponed for the white paper. So the white paper is being used as a vehicle to postpone a stack of expenditure and as a vehicle to project expenditure. As I said, I have a terrible feeling of déjà vu. There is a strident battle here to create a khaki election, and we have been watching the new minister who was put in position to create that situation. The previous minister would not have been all that good at it. He might have been able to do it strategically and tactically but on the floor of the chamber he might have had some difficulty. To create the potential for a khaki election he had to be replaced. And what is the result: a by-election on Saturday week to achieve the khaki election potential with a minister who does not much care what he says, who is not all that careful with the truth and who is able to distort the situation; a minister who has no real background in defence and very little knowledge of it, other than what he has learned in the last week or two. What price will the community pay for the by-election? Probably half a million dollars. That money would have been better spent on defence. We have already wasted a certain amount of money-getting rid of the previous minister had an enormous public cost-but, ironically, in this case eventually there will be quite a substantial cost to the government. In a sense, the situation has turned and bitten them-deservedly so, because they have played so fast and loose with it. But the government have done the most damage to something different: the submarine project. We have built in this country the world’s best diesel-electric submarine, and we all know it. The attempt by this government to turn the submarine project into a political issue is disgraceful. The government have done much more than hurt the submarine project itself; they have done enormous damage to our companies and to our credibility. This particular company has established its credibility because of its skill, but its capacity to project that skill across the world has largely been destroyed. The government have, for political gain, destroyed the credibility of a key Australian company. How did they do that? What has happened to the submarine project? What is the real story? The Sydney Morning Herald published an article a few weeks back which started to get towards the real story but it did not actually have the full story. The factor in the submarine project that has caused most difficulty is the combat system. Let us look at the history of that 25540 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 combat system and how we tendered for it. There were two separate and distinct strands to the tendering process for the submarine project: the platform for the vessels and the combat system. We ran two separate competitions. The project was, I should point out, initiated by the Fraser government-we simply picked it up and continued with it. Commander Graham White, who was appointed by the previous Liberal government, was initially in charge of it. The current Prime Minister was at that time the Treasurer. When we came into government the process was well in train. Six or seven companies-including German, Swedish, Dutch and British companies-competed in the tender process for the platform of the actual vessel. The selection process narrowed the number of companies down to two-the German company HDW-IKL and the Swedish company Kockums-for the platform, for the actual vessel. For the combat system, their leading contender was always Rockwell from America. The eventual competition for that was between Rockwell and Celsius. There were two separate bidding systems, two separate exercises and two separate contracts. Let me tell you what Navy thought of Rockwell back in those days. Rockwell was far and away the world’s best developer of combat systems. It was the company that did the big American nuclear submarines and it was seen as being light-years ahead of the rest. In fact, the Navy did not want to have a competition. They wanted to give it to Rockwell without a competitive process. That was declined because the decision had been made years previously to have a competition. But the Navy view was that Rockwell could do it and it was unchallenged. In the competition that was held, Rockwell was eventually successful, but after quite a bit of modification to its tender. The fact is that Rockwell could not complete their contract. It had nothing to do with the Submarine Corporation and nothing to do with Australian capacity. The world’s best company in this technology were unable to meet their own specifications and unable to complete their own tender. While we were in government they tried week in and week out to break the contract, and we said no. The contract that was drawn up in the technology of the mid-1980s was automatic. The fixed price contract said, ‘You’ve been paid this price and you will provide this product.’ Rockwell eventually admitted that they could not provide it and wanted to change the details. They wanted to change the hardware, the software or anything, because, once they could change one bit of the contract, they could change the price. This particular project destroyed that company. Rockwell eventually collapsed. They were taken over by Boeing and have in turn been passed on to Raytheon. So this single process destroyed the world’s leading submarine combat system developer. We all know that; this is not news. This is well known and understood, but this government and conservative politicians have used it for political gain at enormous cost. This government has now agreed to break the contract. It agreed to release the company-Raytheon as it is now; Boeing as it was at the time-from this proposal. And guess what? The price has gone up because, in releasing them from the contract, the government has renegotiated a price-something that we refused to do. We insisted they meet the contract. Remember, these contracts also had penalty clauses. I wonder how much of that has been exacted from the company. I also wonder how come there is now such confusion over who owns the intellectual property. I understand that the government is now saying, ‘It belongs to the company.’ The Australian taxpayers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for the development of those systems and it now seems to belong to the company itself. And guess what is happening right now? Guess who wants our submarine? Mrs Crosio-The Americans. with the Americans vetoing the sale of the Submarine Corporation to Germany. Why are they",128,Representatives Main Committee

274,Mr Allan Morris,"The Americans. We have watched this charade in recent monthsThursday, 8 March 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 25541 doing that? What has it to do with them? They were not involved. They were involved with Rockwell way back, but Rockwell is long gone and we have taken responsibility. It is all our problem, not Rockwell’s. So how come the Americans are involved? Because they want the submarine. We are about to see in the next few months an attempt by the Americans to buy Submarine Corporation, not to build submarines but to buy on the cheap the world’s best diesel electric submarine. They know it is the world’s best and we know it is the world’s bestexcept this government, for political purposes, wants to blacken it. The damage that has done to our industry and our reputation around the world is enormous. I have talked to a number of defence companies over a lot of years. Let me tell members of this government that what you have done to those companies is unforgivable. You have virtually wiped out our defence capacity, starting with Bronwyn Bishop back in 1996-an absolute joke. For a Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel to do that was an absolute joke. The running down and breaking up of our defence relationship with our industries was scandalous and it has not stopped. It was indicated in a discussion paper that it did not even exist; it was not even up for discussion. And the white paper says, ‘We’ll buy more off the shelf.’ Bully for you. We are back to the 1970s and the Fraser government, where we went and bought the latest American or the latest German technology, were part of the world club and no longer had an industry capability. What companies have we got left? Who is available in the defence field to do major work? Who are our next prime contractors? What are our companies doing? They are collapsing all over the place. In the middle of all this has been the manipulation of the submarine as a key political issue. The government and their members will eventually be called to answer for that because what they have done is unforgivable. We in this country have an enormous capacity. We have talented people with great design skills. We now have the world’s best people in the design of diesel electric submarines. We have spent a fortune training them. We knew we were doing that and we knew it would be expensive, but it was a good investment-but only if we keep using it. To make the investment and then junk it is a disgraceful waste of public money, and that is what you have done. You have actually marginalised and junked the skills of hundreds of people in defence electronics, software and design, and you should be held accountable. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Sawford) adjourned. Motion (by Mrs Elson) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Australian Labor Party: Women Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (11.36 a.m.)-I am very pleased to be speaking today on the International Women’s Day in the year of our Centenary of Federation. I was hopeful that the member for Prospect, who has just recently left the chair, might be in the chair for this speech. She is one of many great Labor women who are very proud to be part of the Labor Party in this year of our Centenary of Federation. We were very pleased with ourselves last year when we achieved a milestone at the same time that our nation was celebrating and becoming 100 years old. We achieved the milestone of having 100 sitting Labor women members of parliament across our state, federal and territory parliaments, which is quite an achievement, as you would know. In the very short space of time since that milestone was reached last year, we now have, after the Western Australian and Queensland elections, some 122 sitting Labor women members of parliament. That is a great achievement. It is interesting that the members opposite today are both women too; we see the numbers going up on all sides. But the member for Prospect and I think we have a 25542 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 little edge here and are very proud to be part of the Labor Party. We are hoping to make it 123 if the Ryan by-election is successful for our candidate. I have recently been appointed as the National Convenor of the Labor Women’s Network, and I want to take this opportunity to promote a coming event which is part of the celebration of the Centenary of Federation. It is called ‘100 years: 100 women’-we are going to be able to update that title, as I say, because we now have well over 100 women in parliament. We are going to be honouring the women who have gone before us, celebrating the women who are currently actively part of the Labor Party and encouraging those who will come after us. For the record, this event is going to be held on 6 May in Melbourne. I would like to record my thanks here to Julie Warren, Monica Gould, Melanie Raymond, Kate Dunn and Katie Hall for the work they have done in creating this event. I know it will not appear in the Hansard, but I want to show members in the chamber the fantastic picture that is on the invitation to this event. It is a picture of the delegates to the women’s convention at Trades Hall in Melbourne in October 1912. It is a fantastic photo of an extraordinary number of women, but sadly very few of them are well known as part of Labor’s history. Part of the event in May is a launch of a project called ‘Labor Women, Our Story’. Many of us are determined to make sure that some of the gaps in our history do not occur again. We are going to be calling for all Labor women across the country to give us a little snapshot and story about their involvement in the Labor Party and the Labor movement. We are hoping they will also take the opportunity to give us a snapshot of any role that their mothers, aunts, neighbours and other people have played in the past. We want to put together a book, which will have records of the many thousands of women who are actively involved in the Labor Party across the country. In another 100 years, we will not be in the sad position where we have fantastic photos from the past of activist Labor women we cannot identify. Whilst we are pleased that there are so many women now coming into our parliaments, in fact they are often the ones who do get the most recognition, but there is a lot of quiet and very strong work being done by many thousands of women who we are hoping to recognise. I am hopeful that many of the members here will participate in this project, as well as other Labor Party members across the country, and will attend that event in Melbourne. I know that it will be a great day for everybody. I would also like to take the opportunity to briefly mention a local event that was held in my electorate on Sunday for International Women’s Day. It was called the Women’s Fair, and it was a fantastic day. It was held outside the Footscray Community Arts Centre. Over 1,500 people attended. It takes quite some effort, as you would all know, to get people to attend any sort of community event. It was a beautiful event, held outside the Footscray Community Arts Centre, with a lot of training rooms and forums where I think the women’s circus put on training sessions for the kids that attended. There were writers forums and a number of other forums, as well as many cultural dances and performances. I would like to record my appreciation for the fantastic work done by the organising committee for this event. Onnie Wilson and Sue Leigh provided the main effort and volunteered many hours in organising this event. I would like to thank Jaya Manchikanti, Miriam Munoz, Melba Marginson, Cuc Lam and also Dure Dara for opening the day and the Footscray Community Arts Centre for hosting the event. I congratulate them. I hope that this will become an annual event in my electorate for the women of the western region of Melbourne.

It was a great honour to accept the invitation to address the congregation at the opening and dedication service by way of civic greeting and presenting our Australian flag. This Salvation Army has now been at Greenwith for nearly seven years, and the official opening and dedication service at the complex at Greenwith celebrates the tireless efforts of members whose aim is to live out the Salvation Army’s mission statement, part of which reads: The motivation of the organisation is the love of God and a practical concern for the needs of humanity. This is expressed by a spiritual ministry, the purposes of which are to preach the Gospel, disseminate Christian truths, supply basic human necessities, provide personal counselling and undertake the spiritual and moral regeneration and physical rehabilitation of all persons in need who come within its sphere of influence regardless of race, colour, creed, sex or age. Together with the Salvation Army members, I am pleased about the future of the Salvation Army at Greenwith. This new complex means that the fellowship will be able to continue to serve the community from their own facility-which will now double as a place of worship and community centre for the Salvation Army in Greenwith-instead of having to operate out of rented facilities, such as the local schools and community halls, as they have in the past These activities include family church services; the kids church, which is Sunday school; Bible study groups; prayer groups; community needs-based seminars; the over 50’s club; youth group; keep-fit classes; playgroup; craft groups; and school holiday programs. They will all be based at the Salvation Army complex at Greenwith. I would like to highly commend all of those people responsible for making this dream, seven years in the making, possible. As the member for Makin, I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate them for striving to fulfil their dream so tirelessly to ensure that the members of their local community could share their resources. May I also take this opportunity to congratulate, in this International Year of Volunteers, all of the volunteers who helped to make their dream a reality. Aviation: Bankstown Airport betrayed by the Howard government. I refer specifically to the callous decision taken by the government in December 2000 to allow jet aircraft into Bankstown Airport. This decision is clearly an attempt at short-term political gain by a government which heartlessly believes it has nothing to lose by alienating the people of south-western Sydney. The community is being treated with scorn by a government which persists in disregarding the views of people whose quality of life will be impacted by this cruel decision. Why is there such contempt for the people of Bankstown and the neighbouring areas? Consider the electorates surrounding Bankstown airport: Banks, Blaxland, Lowe, Reid, Watson, Barton, Fowler and Hughes. Apart from the last, what do all these electorates have in common? That is right; they are all held by the ALP, with the exception of Hughes, and even there, coalition voters must have begun to question the extent to which their interests are being represented. The naked self-interest and political game-playing evidenced by this government are crass in the extreme.

People purchased homes in the areas and established lives for themselves and their families knowing that Bankstown Airport functioned as a busy airport which provided local employment. They did not purchase their homes on the basis of a massive increase in noise levels and air pollution from jets, which will be the direct result on their lives from this malicious decision by a government in trouble. The Bankstown community coexists with the airport as it is, but they want no expansion of jet movements into the community. My electorate office and, I am sure, those of my colleagues in the surrounding electorates, are receiving a significant number of queries each week from worried members of the public who are concerned that they should consider moving from the area. In addition, there has been no consideration of even minimal infrastructure to support any expansion to accommodate jets. We have a picture of a community that is seriously concerned about the future. The lack of interest by a jaded government in consulting with the people it purports to represent is most clearly evidenced by the lack of an environmental impact statement. The 1997 EIS completed for Badgerys Creek found that Bankstown Airport was not viable for jet aircraft. Any change in the airport function would have a significant impact on the existing general aviation facilities as well as raising environmental issues for the nearby communities. Any changes, according to that EIS, would still not satisfy long-term air travel demand for Sydney. We in south-western Sydney are used to being held in contempt by this government. Only a few years ago, Holsworthy was announced as an option for a second Sydney airport. When, and only when, community outrage was articulated was there any response to that anger, and the government performed one of its ongoing backflips. The campaign against Holsworthy has blooded the people in and around my electorate. We will be taking the debate up to and in the face of this cynical government. Community action, with the support of the local councils, commenced days after the announcement in December. At a rally of over 3,000 people in February, there was no-one present prepared to attempt a justification for the government’s decision. This government has refused to learn from its mistakes. Once again, a decision is announced before any consideration is given to the consequences of that decision. Over recent weeks we have seen myriad examples of the lack of forethought given to its decisions by this government and the resulting backflips required to placate voters-desperate attempts by a desperate Prime Minister. No wonder the polls are reflecting what the Australian public has known for some time. The voters, including those in my own electorate of Banks, are not so easily fooled. This decision on Bankstown Airport was thoughtless and mean-spirited. In 2000, the Prime Minister ruined Christmas for the people of Bankstown. I can assure the Prime Minister that his present for Christmas 2001 will be to pack his bags and leave Kirribilli House, as he searches for a new home after the election. The people of south-western Sydney and, indeed, across the country, will return in kind the contempt in which this Prime Minister holds them.

The leaflet is part of a union movement campaign against federal school funding arrangements, and it contains some outrageous and misleading claims. The QTU leaflet claims: The Federal Coalition Government has ripped millions of dollars from state schools. The fact is that the Commonwealth government has poured more money than ever before into Queensland government schools. In the year 2001, Commonwealth funding for government schools stands at a record $416 million-that is a 6.6 per cent increase over the year 2000 and a 43.7 per cent increase over the year 1996 when the Labor government was in power. The QTU leaflet also claims: State Schools are getting a raw deal ... And they sure are from the Beattie Labor government. The last Queensland state budget increased government school funding by less than one per cent, described at the time by the same union president, Julie-Anne McCullough, as ‘a standstill at best’ that provided ‘no extra funding in real terms’. The QTU leaflet also claims: ... private schools are getting nearly twice as much Federal funding as state schools. More than 60 per cent of total funding for schools flowing through the Commonwealth budget goes to government schools. Government schools get three times as much public funding as non-government schools. Public funding is around $13 billion a year for the two million students enrolled in government schools compared with $3 billion for one million students in non-government schools. In the year 2001, every student at a government secondary school will receive an estimated $6,980 in public funding. Students of the neediest non-government secondary schools will receive only $4,886, while those students in non-government secondary schools serving the wealthiest communities will receive a mere $957. The QTU leaflet goes on to claim: The Commonwealth’s funding arrangements favour rich private schools. The fact is that the new SES approach to funding of non-government schools is more transparent than before, with objective measures based on independent data that are consistent for all schools. The new SES model shows that some of the schools considered wealthy under the old model serve middle and lower income communities rather than rich communities. These schools should receive funding increases according to need. Category1 schools, the so-called rich schools, enrol 5.4 per cent of all non-government school students nationally. However, they receive only 2.5 per cent of total Commonwealth general recurrent funding. It is essential that the parents understand that there are blatant and brazen mistruths contained in the QTU leaflet and that they ignore them. Anna Bligh should assure Queensland parents that she will not allow the state’s schools to be used as part of the QTU political propaganda machine. If Minister Bligh refuses to stand up to the Queensland Teachers Union, I will be calling school principals in Forde and asking them to also distribute information to parents to counter the QTU lies and set the record straight. Ryan Electorate: By-election Queensland on 17 March in a by-election that could only be described as a completely unnecessary by-election and one which will cost the taxpayers of Australia at least half a million dollars. Why are we having this by-election? Because there has been a personal spat between the former Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said to Mr Moore that he wanted Mr Reith, then the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, to become defence minister. The response of the Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, was, ‘If that is going to be the case, then I am out of here altogether,’ and he packed up his bat and went home. So we have a by-election, costing the people of Australia",134,Representatives Main Committee
278,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (11.53 A.m.),"The people of Ryan are about to go to the polls in25546 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 March 2001 half a million dollars. The interesting question, which I think has yet to be properly explained to the House, is: where actually does John Moore’s untimely exit, shall we say, from the House of Representatives fit in terms of the late by-election stakes in the history of this parliament, in the history of the Australian Federation? Thanks to the Parliamentary Library, which I commissioned to undertake some research on this, I have discovered that, since our parliament first convened in 1901, there have been 23 by-elections held at least two years after a general election. If we look at the 23 by-elections which have been held in the third year of a three-year parliamentary term, the party breakdown is very interesting. Nineteen of those late by-elections were from non-ALP and four were from ALP representatives. Of the four from the ALP, one died in office and the other had a by-election occur as a result of ill-health. The other 19 were from non-ALP parties. If we read the list of the reasons why some of these people had late byelections, we see that we had by-elections in 1909, 1919, 1928, 1928 again, 1936, 1936 again, and a couple of others as well, where the stated reason for the early by-election was the death of the member. I think most of us would accept that as a reasonable reason for having a late by-election. It is generally regarded as being beyond the immediate control of the member concerned. Let us look at some of the other reasons why people had late by-elections. Let us go, for example, to the case of Dick Casey, who was a minister of the government. He had a late by-election. Having been elected for two years and four months, he had a by-election in March 1940 in order to become our first minister in the United States at a time of national emergency. Most of us would not have a problem with that. We even look at ‘Ming’ himself-Pig Iron Bob. He held on for two years and four months before retiring at the age of 71. Even on this side of the House, we are respectful of the great man’s desire to exit the place with some dignity at a time of his choosing-but that was two years and four months. Let us look at others, such as Sir Paul Hasluck who retired from this place after just on two years and five months in order to become Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. Again, that is not a bad reason for exiting the place. However, when it comes to John Moore, the former member for Ryan, we find that he had no such reason for an early departure. In fact, when we compare him with those who had late by-elections in the history of our federal parliament, John Moore comes in as winning the centenary bronze medal for late-term by-elections-that is, he has come third in terms of exiting this place in an untimely fashion very close to the impending holding of a general election. He is only beaten by Mr Ian Allan from the Country Party, who reached two years and seven months after a general election in 1969 before causing a by-election. He went on to become Secretary-General of the ANZAC Agency of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. To me, that sounds like a worthy body as well. The person who wins the silver medal in terms of late departures from the parliament immediately prior to a general election is Mr Arthur Coles. He was, I understand, a pro-conservative leading Independent who was the member for Henty and went on to become Chairman of the British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Corporation. Given that position, he probably was not pro-Labor at the time. So with John Moore, the former member for Ryan, we have the centenary bronze medallist in terms of leaving this place early. I note from the smiles of those opposite that it has caused some inconvenience to people in the Liberal Party as well. As we go doorknocking in the suburbs of Ryan with our candidate, Leonie Short, the people give us one single message: John Moore has not only been a missing member for 25 years in the federal division of Ryan but he is now costing us, as constituents of the electorate of Ryan, half a million dollars because he could not hold on for just a few more months until the general election was due. Well done, John Moore, the centenary bronze medallist; you may not have made it to Wimbledon, but you got a bronze medal here.

She used an impersonator. will be silent. ened to bring out its opposition leader for campaign purposes. However, on a matter relating to classification, may I say that I am delighted that the Senate has passed amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995, the legislative centrepiece of the national classification scheme for publications, films and computer games. According to the Attorney-General, the amendments, which were agreed upon by the states and territories and supported by the opposition, will come into effect following the passage of complementary amendments to state and territory classification enforcement laws. The amendments contain many improvements of a procedural and technical kind to streamline the classification procedure. Under the new arrangements, the range of films that are exempt from classification will be expanded to include certain current affairs, hobbyist, sporting, family, live performance, musical presentation and religious films. The exemptions will only apply to material that is suitable for children at the G or PG level. Additionally, the Classification Board will have power to determine whether or not a film is exempt from classification where there is doubt about its legal status. The Classification Board will be able to issue a serial classification for certain submittable publications and to require, in some cases, that publications only be sold in sealed or opaque wrappers. The new arrangements also clarify who may apply to the Classification Review Board for the review of a classification decision-in light of the Lolita decision, this is most welcome. Consequently, organisations or persons with a particular pre-existing interest in the contentious aspects of the subject matter or theme of the material concerned will be able to seek a review as a ‘person aggrieved’. These changes reflect five years experience of operation of the national classification scheme. They will provide benefits to the industry and the community alike. This bill was originally designed also to rename the X category for sexually explicit films. At the same time, the government announced that the content of the category was to be further restricted. Those restrictions were implemented administratively by agreement with the states and territories, and came into effect last September. In this context, the government decided not to proceed with the proposed non-violent erotica classification because of concerns from many backbenchers and the community that it did not accurately reflect the content of the material. I make no apology for supporting the retention of the X classification. Many constituents in my electorate would be aware that recently the film Hannibal was reclassified by the Classification Review Board from MA15+ to R18+. I believe this is an important decision, reflecting the legitimate concerns of our community with regard to the ever increasing, unnecessary, gratuitous and graphic violence portrayed in films and other genres for the sake of entertainment. We have enough violence in our society without trying to teach our children that violence is entertainment or a way of solving problems, particularly in the manner of that film. The reclassification of Hannibal to R18+ is a win not only for my local constituents in Makin but for our society right across Australia.",135,Representatives Main Committee

She has common sense and a realist approach, and I look forward, as deputy chair, to working with her. Irving Langmuir provides us with a concept of pathological science. It is the science of things that are not so. It is the science of the ideological rather than the objective. It is the science of the qualitative but not the quantitative. It is the science of the spiritual but not the real. It is the science of the synthesis but not the analysis. It is found in various writings of gender studies around the world, especially the Western, English-speaking world. It is wrong! It is leading us, including in this country, down the wrong path. It discredits the social sciences as being bereft of analysis, scientific method and-more importantly-common sense, and disconnected from reality. Pathological science is science that leads nowhere, but often it goes on and on. In the United States it is funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is funded in this country as well. When it exhausts one part of its study, it starts on another. What is happening in many English speaking countries, particularly in the United States and certainly here-but, interestingly, not the United Kingdom-is that gender studies has begun to take sight on boys. It now seems that boys are the victims of a male dominated culture. Current thinking of this kind is, perhaps, doing a great deal of harm to boys. People put forward evidence of a qualitative nature and stare you down when you ask the obvious question, ‘On what quantitative evidence is that based?’ They look you straight in the eye and say that it is not required. The great guru of gender studies in the Western world is Professor Carol Gilligan, the professor of gender studies at a very substantive university, Harvard, who wrote the book A Different Voice-all qualitative research. There is said to be quantitative research; unfortunately, in 17 years of being asked by journalists and other social scientists to produce it, she refuses to do so. I wonder if it exists. I suspect it does not. There is value in qualitative research; it should not be dismissed out of hand, because it has something to offer. When it is not based on quantitative research, however, it ought to be ignored. pired. Main Committee adjourned at 12.07 p.m.",137,Representatives Main Committee

The time allowed for this debate has exThe following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Taxation Office: Compensation (Question No. 1518) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 May 2000: (1) How many claims for compensation for defective administration were made to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) in each year since 1996-97. (2) How many claims for compensation were successful in each year. (3) What was the total compensation bill in each year. (4) How many claims were made by tax agents on behalf of clients in each year. (5) How many (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful applicants for compensation were subsequently audited by the ATO. able member's question: (1) Up until 5 April 1998 claims under the Defective Administration Scheme were decided by the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer. On5 April 1998 certain ATO officers were authorised to decide some defective administration matters. Relative to the number of taxpayers, (around 11.5 million, as published in Taxation Statistics 1997-98) defective administration claims are lodged by a miniscule number of taxpayers (less than 0.001 per cent). From6 April 1998 – 31 December 1998, 110 claims for compensation for defective administration were made to the ATO. In 1999, 93 claims for compensation for defective administration were made to the ATO. From1 January 2000 to 30 June 2000, 25 claims for defective administration were made to the ATO. The statistics for the period July to December 2000 have not yet been collated. (2) In 1998, 39 of the 110 claims were paid in full, 24 were paid in part, 46 were rejected and one claim was withdrawn by the claimant. In 1999, 46 of the 93 claims were paid in full, 12 were paid in part, 34 were rejected and one offer of compensation was declined by the claimant. For the period January to June 2000, 9 of the 25 claims were paid in full, 2 were paid in part and 14 were rejected. (3) In 1998, from 6 April through to 31 December the total compensation bill was $41,605.51 (an average of $660.40 per successful claimant). In 1999 the total compensation bill was $78,423.15 (an average of $1352.12 per successful claimant). For the period January to June 2000 the total compensation bill was $6,626.89 (an average of $602.44 per successful claimant). (4) The information sought is not available. (5) The information sought is not available. The fact that a taxpayer has received compensation for defective administration is not relevant to whether they will be selected for audit. Goods and Services Tax: Real Estate Fees (Question No. 1715) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 June 2000: In the transition to the New Tax System, will real estate management fees for residential property be GST-free until 1 July 2005 if signed before 2 December 1998, while fees for commercial properties will be GST-free until 1 July 2005 if signed before 8 July 1999; if so, why. member’s question: Where the recipient of real estate management services is not entitled to full input tax credits, the fees are GST-free until the earliest of a review opportunity (as defined) or 1 July 2005, provided the supply of the services is under a written agreement signed before 2 December 1998 which identifies the supply and consideration for the supply. This provision takes effect from the date of the introduction of the legislation into the Parliament, so as to minimise any behavioural changes in order to take advantage of GST-free status.",138,Representatives Main Committee

This provision takes effect from the date of Royal Assent reflecting the often more drawn-out nature of the commercial negotiations involved and the relatively low incentive to change behaviour. Capital Gains Tax: Evasion (Question No. 2059) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: Has he received advice from the Australian Taxation Office regarding the incidence of tax evasion and tax minimisation following the Government’s decision to halve the capital gains tax rate; if so, what are the details. able member’s question: The reduction in the capital gains tax rate was passed by the Parliament with the support of the Labor Party in both houses. The ATO has not provided any advice regarding the incidence of tax evasion and tax minimisation in relation to reducing the capital gains tax rate. Australian Taxation Office: Gunton, Mr Mike (Question No. 2172) Mr Latham asked the minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 November 2000: (1) Further to the Minister’s answer to question no 1546 (Hansard, 4 October 2000, page 20847), what evidence can the ATO provide that it conveyed to Mr Gunton the appropriate information prior to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. (2) Did the ATO send the information referred to in part (1) to addresses in the Sydney suburbs of Smithfield and Sutherland, even though Mr Gunton did not reside at these addresses. (3) What evidence can the ATO present that Mr Gunton actually received the information referred to in part (1). (4) Is the ATO aware that it forwarded Mr Gunton’s tax assessments in the mid 1980s to the wrong addresses; if so what are the details. (5) What evidence can the ATO present showing that Mr Gunton earned income from a commercial enterprise in 1981,1982, 1983 and 1984 and has it ever conveyed this evidence to Mr Gunton; if so, what are the details. able member’s question: (1), (2) and (3) I am advised that records from the District Court of NSW at Parramatta show that Mr Gunton was personally served on 9 November 1985 with a Statement of Liquidated Claim from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, for income tax and additional tax payable for assessments for the financial years ending 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984. Default judgement was entered on 27 May 1986. I am also advised that records from the Federal Court (General Division, Bankruptcy District of NSW and the ACT) reveal that Mr Gunton was personally served with a Bankruptcy Notice on 20 June 1987. Mr Gunton was also personally served with a Creditors Petition on 21 March 1988 which stated that the debtor ( Mr Gunton) committed an act of bankruptcy on the 6 July 1987 by failing to comply with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Notice. Federal Court records show that the Creditors Petition was personally served on Mr Gunton at an address in Smithfield.
