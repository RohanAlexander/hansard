The Bench resumed indexation it said that the consumer price index after the luncheon break at 2.15 p.m. The would be discounted for the effects of indirect implication of that is that there had been consultaxes and charges for use in the tax indexation tation with the Government before the answer calculations.

The Opposition pointed out then that this there had been proper consultation. Mr Morling meant that Australians in fact were not receiving said: full tax indexation. By putting qualifications on Before the adjournment His Honour Robinson, J. asked the extent to which taxation would be indexed, me whether I could inform the bench as to whether the the Government left the way open for a further Medibank components of the December consumer price watering down of the proposal. That is precisely index would be removed from calculations determining the tax indexation adjustment to take effect as from 1 July 1977. what has happened in this Bill before us tonight. The answer is no to that question. It is worth remembering that the Government I repeat that was a considered answer given was very much aware, when it introduced the immediately after the luncheon break when Incomes Tax (Rates) Bill 1976-that is the Bill to clearly consultation had taken place with the which I have just referred; the original Bill in Government as to what the answer should be to which tax indexation was introduced allegedly in Justice Robinson's question.
