0,"3douse Of 'Ixrpitsrnfntibcs. Friday, A.m., And Read Prayers. To Ask Yon A Question, Which, I Think, Affects The Privileges Of Honourable Members To A Very Large Extent. I Believe That I T Is The Practice I N Nearly All Parliaments","and you will recollect that it was the practice in the Parliament which you for so many years adorned by your presence-that the Chairman of Committees always votes for the reduction of a duty so as to enable honourable members to reconsider the item. which the honourable member desires to bring before me 1 plain the position in which I am placed. In Committee of Ways and Means a proposal is made to reduce the duty ou an item ; an equality of votes is cast, and the Chairman gives a casting vote in favour of the duty as it stands. with any votes given by the Chairman of Committees. I should like to know the point of order which the honourable member desires to raise. ruling from you, sir, as the custodian of the rights and privileges of honourable members, so that we shall know exactly what position we stand in, and I feel sure that you will give honourable members every information on a question which is of great importance to them. In view of the fact that a Chairman of Committees gives a casting vote in favour of the higher rate, and then when a proposal is made in the House to recommit the item, for the purpose of reconsidering the duty, he costs a vote against a recommittal, what opportunity will be afforded to honourable members to reconsider the item, as stated by the Chairman when he was in committee ? I think it is a straightforward question to ask. Chairman of Committees. has been put to me has no relation' to my conduct of the business of the House. It 18 April, 1902.

MrV . L . SOLOMON I desire to ask the Attorney-General a question with reference to a paragraph in this morning's Argus, about the pearl shelling industry. The Prime Minister is reported to have stated that he intends to appoint two gentlemen to inquire into the position and prospects of the industry under federal legislation in Queensland and Western Australia. Some weeks ago I drew attention to the position of the industry, not on\y in Queensland and Western Australia, but also in the Northern Territory of South Australia, where at least 200 people are employed in 50 or 60 boats. I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether the inquiries will be extended so as to include the pearl-shelling industry at Port Darwin. gentlemen asked to act accepts, I think the honourable member will admit that no one is better qualified to speak for the pearl-shelling industiy of Port Darwin than he is. for Home Affairs if his attention has been of tickets for members' wives. called to the following paragraph in the Brisbane Courier from its Melbourne representative :I should like Mi-. Leahy explained to Mr Barton the question of members' railway passes, stating that Sir William Lyne had misrepresented the Queensland attitude to members of the House, as no such arrangement had been entered into as was reported by the Minister for Home Affairs. He would, he said, have refused to make any charge for members' passes, but that the accounts sent in. were for tickets for members' wives, and in at least one case for a member's family. Further, Sir William Lyne had never said a word about havinjr no money till the Estimates were passed. Nothing had been known here of members being The unfortuallowed pusses for their families, and this would appear to be yet another instance of wrongful and wasteful expenditure of public money. The Queensland Minister for Railways has made the matter quite clear, and put quite another complexion on it to that which had been submitted to the House. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have not seen the paragraph, arid I cannot but express my surprise that Mr Leahy has made. I never said be such a statement, if he has, because when he waited upon me in Melbourne, I showed him all the papers which had passed, not between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government, but between the department for Home Affairs and the Railways Commissioners, and he expressed himself to the effeotthathedidnotunderstandthe position before, that he believed thereexisted some documents, sent from the Queensland Government to the Railways Commissioners whicli I had not obtained, that my position was absolutely unassailable, and that the arrangement had been made between the commissioners and myself. member paid the Queensland Government any money yet ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I can speak only for the department of Home Affairs. I asked the Treasurer a week ago to pay the amount of money which is due to Queensland. Their proportion is payable through the Victorian Railways Commissioner, and the account was sent in for the f u l l amount. Yes ; and if one of the My only course was to ask that that amount should be paid to the Victorian Railways Commissioner, and that Queensland's proportion should be handed by him to the Queensland Railways Commissioner or State Government. I have also asked the Treasurer to pay the smaller accounts-amount I wish to ask the Minister ing to about £ 3 0 , 1 think-for the payment",14,Chairman Of Committees

J u s t before the committee adjourned last n i g h t the M in is t e r for HomeA f f a i r s made a statement which he has made no attempt to prove. Seeingt h a t he challenged the figures of an honourable member, and said t h a t his statement was a gross misrepresentation of facts, it was due to the committee t h a t he should have proved the accuracy of his own figures. He alleged t h a t the local manufacturer of sewingmachine stands would have to pay an additional sum of os. on the material because of the duties which we had imposed; whereas The f o l l o w i ng is the it had been asserted by the honourable member for West Sydneyt h a t it would amount to only 4d. I should lik e to hear w h a t the M in is t e r has to say in connection w it h his statement. If he can prove t h a t the in creased cost to the manufacturer is 5s., I shall subscribe £ 1 0 to any charity. T h a t is a gross misrepresentation of facts. The local manufacturer' states t h a t he uses A u s t r a l i a n woods solely in the manufacture of his pianos; and surely he should be able to use looalty-grown timber in the manufacture of sewing-machine stands. There is Debates. no d u t y levied upon the castings which for m p a r t of these stands, and the screws and bolts used in p u t t in g them together are also free. It is claimed t h a t locally-made varnishes are used by the local manufacturer, b u t even assuming t h a t he p a i d (r/) Department of tlie d u t y upon the imported article, it would only amount to a fraction , and the statement of the honourable member for We s t Sydney, t h a t the duties upon the r a w materials used in m a k in g a sewing-machine stand would not exceed 4d., is very near the mark. It was originall y proposed t h a t sewing-machine heads should be free, b u t the honourable member for Melbourne gave notice of his in t e n t i o n to move t h a t sewing and machinery. machines, as a whole, should be placed of metals, viz.:upon the free list.

25,Mr Poynton (South ' A US T R A L I A ),"t h a t , except in the case of Western Australia, sewing machines were previously a d m it t e d in to a l l the States free of d u t y . It is interesting to note t h a t in 1894 the V i c torian Government sought to impose >a d u t y of 10 per cent, upon sewing machines as a whole. This, I claim, would be very much more equitable in its incidence t h a n the present proposal to place a d u t y upon a portion of tlie machine. It is well k n o wn t h a t manufacturers in a large way can i m p o r t the sewing-machine heads fre e of d u t y and erect them upon benches, whereas the seamstresses and other poor people have to buy the machines complete aud pay d u t y upon the stands. it would be very much better to levy a d u t y upon the complete machines t h an upon the stands only. ferred to the Age saidThe housewife, aided hy ifc, made and mended the clothing of her children at a minimum cost; the factory employee, using it by day in the execution of ber duties, worked it at night in her own home; others, again, found in it their sole source of income, purchasing by its aid the very articles whose prices it had already helped to reduce-^ ^ twofold triumph indeed. The absence or sickness of the bread winner proper, the husband or father, as the case might be, was no longer the keynote to the mournful dirge of destitution and starvation. The sewing machine supplied in a measure the place which the man had vacated, and, despite the tyranny of the ""sweater,"" enabled the woman to at least keep the wolf from the door. The machine becomes the modern substitute alike for the oil of the good Samaritan and. tbe "" w i d o w ' s "" ever-replenished ""cruse,"" while in the average household of to-day it is as much a necessity as the washing boiler, the oven, or the grate. The Age went to the trouble of tracing 1,000 machines, and their inquiries resulted as f o l l o w s : An analysis of bhelast thousand town customers in this direction (fanners and country folk generally not appearing in the list) gives the following results :Single women, laundresses, dressmakers, tailoresses, nurses, &c, ... 37 Small tradesmen, Jfec. ...

Hotel-keepers Actors and vocalists Thusi t was shown t h a t 90 per cent, of the machines sold upon time payment went into the homes of the poor. The Age continues. . . And yet, in the face of all this, the Government proposes a tax of JO per cent, on sewing machinesa tax which, with interest and profit superadded, must eventually fall upon the purchaser; a tax never yet levied in any European countiy ; a tax not even now proposed to be placed on knitting and stitching machines ; a tax in the very nature of things unfair, unjust, and which must be forthwith abandoned if the Ministry desires to pose longer as the "" poor man's friend."" T h a t was the testimony of the Agei n 1894. No w let us see w h a t t h a t newspaper has to Therefore say regarding the present proposal of the Government. U p o n the 27th December last they saidOn the occasion reIn August, 1894, Mr Carter proposed a duty of 10 per cent on sewing machines. A t that time some carefully collected statistics in the Aye showed that 90 per cent, of the buyers of sewing machines are amongst the hard worked poor. The Federal Tariff provides that whilst the heads of sewing machines are free, tables, covers, and stands will be subject to a duty of 20 per cent. The complete machine is the only one of use to seamstresses, white-workers, dressmakers, tailoresses, and the wives of our bread.wiuners, and to place a tax on any portion is a burden they can hardly bear. On the grounds that it is to the interests of outworkers that the implements of their trade should be obtainable at as low a cost as practicable, it . . . . may fairly be suggested to the Commissioner of Customs that the stands and tables of sewing machines should be included in the free list. I have no doubt t h a t t h a t is w h a t in fluenced the M in is t r y in agreeing to place the machines as a whole upon the free list. The Age remarks f u r t h e r As a fact, all the States except Western Australia, but inclusive of New Zealand, admit sewing machines free complete. To do otherwise would be to place a direct tax on labour. It would be interesting to k n o w what has brought about the change of f r o n t on the p a r t of the Government.

Cooks, Mr Mauger","If a d u t y is placed uponber has asked that nearly all the tools of trade used in connection with theindustriesin and around Melbourne should be admitted free of duty, and yet he is proposing that a duty should be placed upon sewing machines, which are the tools of trade of some of the poorest classes in the community. If a duty is to be imposed it should be placed upon the whole machine, so that the big manufacturer as well as the poorest seamstress will be compelled to pay it . -The Minister for Home Affairs characterized the statement of tlie honourable meniberfor WcstSydney regarding the duties upon the materials used in the manufacture of a sewing machine stand as absolutely unfounded, and he then made the extraordinary assertion that they amounted to 5s. I challenge the Minister to show how he arrives at that amount. I am convinced that it was evolved out of his inner consciousness. If he will lay before the committee the data on which he arrives at that estimate of 5s. we shall be much obliged to him. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE (Hume-Minister for Home Affairs) I am amused at the speech of the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, who'is at present opposed to anything which savours of protection, though he brought in a protectionist Tariff in Tasmania, and kept it in existence for many years. Sir WILLIAM LYNE understood that I know little practically about the cost of manufacturing sewing machines, or the parts of them, but I have taken some interest in their manufacture, and have visited the factoiy in New South Wales where they are made. In going through the works I happened to meet a workman whom I knew, and whom I asked to show me the various deparments of the manufacture. I obtained detailed explanations as to tbe processes. The information supplied to me is as follows :-Methylate d spirits used are of the highest class, and are imported at an invoiced price of Is. 3d. per gallon. The glue that is used, according to this information, costs 4d. a lb.; French polish, 4s. per gallon ; black Japan varuish, 5s. a gallon ; oils, Is. Gd. per gallon ; cheap lubricating oils, 6d. per gallon ; timber, 8s. 4d. per 100 feet. The duty on brassware and ironware ad valorem is given on this information as 25 per cent., but it is now 20 per cent.; labels and transfers pay a duty of 25 per cent., and machinery and tools 25 per cent. as to duties or cost t items refer to duties, but the others refer to the cost of the materials-the invoice price paid on importation. gentleman mixing up invoice prices and duties in this way 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE I was asked to mention the articles upon which duties were payable, and I am giving the particulars asked for. The statement made to me was that the duty on these articles, in the case of the inferior machines, will come to at least. 2s. 6d. on each machine, and, in-the case of the higher class machines, to between 5s. and 6s. whether the Commonwealth Tariff makes the articles used in connection with the making of the machines from 5s. to 6s. more expensive. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE W h a t I stated last night was that certain materials required to be used in the manufacture of these machines are dutiable. I have given in detail the price paid for all the articles which are dutiable. If we desire to foster the manufacture of these machines in the Commonwealth, we must not forget that It may well be the wages paid here are higher than those paid in the centres of the world from which sewing machines are imported. In the polishing trade, taking into account the shorter hours and higher wages, the cost of labour is 75 per cent, higher in this country. Here the hours of labour are 48 per week ; abroad the hours are 54 per week. The Cabinetmakers' Union connected with the Trades Hall, Melbourne, recently stated in its trade report that the Sydney company had absorbed much of the skilled labour, and that wages had risen accordingly. This very factory which has been deprecated so much by honourable members correct. able member for Parramatta does not wish to say that the statement the Minister has made was entirely incorrect.

Sir WLLLIAMLYNE I do not objeetto an honourable member interjecting, but when the head of the firm in question makes a statement it should not be described as incorrect unless it can be proved to be so. incorrect, but it does not prove anything. Let the Minister tell us how much methylated spirit, how much varnish, and bow much of other materials are used in connection with each machine. Sir WILLIAM LYNE answer conundrums whicli have been put into honourable members' mouths by other persons. I think I am safe in saying that, by enabling this industry to compete with the importing rings, the price of sewing machines, instead of being increased, will be materially decreased. According to one honourable member, the margin between the actual cost and the retail price of these machines represents something like 150 or 200 per cent. In the light of this information, is there not room for us to assist the industry in a way that will tend to reduce the price of sewing machines to every householder in the Commonwealth ? -The statement of the Minister for Home Affairs regarding tbe duties payable upon the raw material of these machines is about as accurate as is his declaration that I introduced a protectionist Tariff into Tasmania. In other words, it is entirely incorrect. Fortunately we have now sitting in this Chamber an honourable member representing Tasmania who was opposed to my Government at the time. I introduced tbe last Tariff with which I dealt, and who will admit that that Tariff was purely a revenue one, and was not introduced for protectionist purposes. Sir WILLIAMLYRE making Tasmania a protectionist countiy. Regarding the puerile effort of the Minister for Home Affairs to show that the honourable member for West Sydney is wrong, I leave the latter to deal with him, and I hope that he will deal with him mercifully. for Home Affairs stated that he had paid this particular factory .a visit, and led the committee to believe that it was a large factorya statement which I can endorse. There is no desire to set a trap for the I withdraw, but But I should like to point out that this industry was established in a free-trade community, and prospered under free-trade conditions. If the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs prove anything, they certainly prove that the imposition of a duty upon any article increases its price. In that we see the hideousness of protection. I do not say that it is I wish to put before the committee the men's side of this question. The Cabinetmakers' Association of New South Wales have sent mo a circular soliciting my support in regard to this matter. They sayIn the first place we wish to emphasize the fact, I am nothere to that as the Federal Tariff stands at present it practically penalizes the production of Australian goods. That is not the statemenc of the Australian manufacturers, but of the men engaged in this industiy. They affirm that the blundering and the muddling of the Ministry has a penalizing effect upon Australian production. They continueTaking for instance, the cabinet work of sewing machines, we find them included under the free list, while the raw material, such as timber, glue, methylated spirits, varnish, &c., with only one exception, namely, veneer, is heavily taxed. It will thus be seen what an injurious effect upon a large number of our men this Tariff blunder will cause, and so strong is the feeling about it that we send 3'ou the following resolutions. As a free-trader I absolutely refuse to absolve the Ministry from the consequences of their blundering and muddling. My duty is not to this factory alone, but to the Commonwealth of Australia. I agree with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, that sewing machines should be exempt from taxation. It is my duty to consider the interests of those who use the machines. I regret the position in which the Cabinetmakers' Association has been placed, but I cannot adopt the ideas of that organization. With Messrs. Beale and Company sewing machines constitute practically a side line, and now that inter-State free-trade has It had the effect of been established, surely this industry is not so weak that it requires protection. I cannot see why I should vote in compliance with the request which has been made to me. If I did so, protectionists might be able to impose taxation on the small articles, and claim, in consequence, that there must also be a duty on the finished product. That would be an ingenious way of capturing the free-traders ; and I refuse to be captured by any such design.",18,Tariff

Apparently honourable member for Dalley wants to say that the extra charge is entirely due to protection, and that consequently no protection should be given to the finished article, in spite of the fact that there are duties on the raw material. The honourable member, sees in the circumstances an attempt to capture the free-trader. protection by no means eventually cheapens articles to the consumer; but in the word "" eventually"" lies the whole of the difference of opinion. that protection does not, in the first instance, possibly raise prices, but we contend that eventually, in the nature of things, protection must reduce prices. No commodity presents a more certain prospect of reduced prices under protection than do sewing machines, giving the widow who has been so pathetically referred to, the means of keeping the "" wolf from the door."" Singer's sewing-machine factories at Glasgow and Coventry, machines, which here cost £S 10s., can be bought for £2 10s., and other machines which sell here at £12 10s. can be purchased at £3 10s. to £4In Australia purchases must be made through the regular agents, and the result is seen in the enormous profits to which reference has been made. Again and again we have heard statements made as to the protectionists' "" ring"" formed in connection with cream separators, but in imported sewing machines we have an undeniable illustration of the evils of a free-trade "" ring."" If local competition can be created by a reasonable duty, which will not be oppressive in the first instance, the price of sewing machines will eventually be reduced by at least 50 per cent. The extortionate charged to poor bread, winners ample room for the beneficial application of protectionist principles. We do not say that the good effects will be apparent at the very outset, but they willberealizedinavery Mr Konald} time, if reasonable protection be afforded and the local industry is not penalized by merely revenue duties. All. the evils The which the honourable member for Dalley that has attributed to protection are evils of a revenue Tariff, and those evils would have been increased and intensified under the drag-net kind of system which would It is urged that the Tariff has have been introduced by honourable members of the Opposition had they been in power. By fostering a native industry we can considerably curtail tbe powers the of the present monopoly, and can promise seamstresses that the prices of their tools of trade will be very materially reduced. Under ^-esisonable protection that prophecy will be amply fulfilled, and I ask protectionists to take care that nothing is done to harass the industry. It has been contended that very sorry the Minister for Home Affairs did not supply us with his data for the extraordinary statement he made last night and reiterated this morning. These data, No protectionist ever said have been kindly taken down for me by the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, while the honourable gentleman was speaking, but tbe statements, though they may be correct, supply no more information than is found in the catalogue of any oilman's store, or in the Tariff. What we desire to find out is how much methylated spirit is used to At every table. If gold for stopping teeth, were worth £ 4 an ounce, and a patient weighed 10 stone, it would not be argued that the patient had to pay £ 4 for every 1 lb. of his own weight ; yet such a calculation would be just as sensible, as to deduce from the data before us tliat there is a charge of 5s. on each machineHas any one ever heard of a machine on which all the articles enumerated have been used ? The top of the machine may be polished, and the sides of the cabinet may be varnished, but both polish and varnish are not applied to the same Surface. French polish is alcohol, in which is placed, for solution, shellac and various other gums, and there is a higher duty on alcohol than on methylated spirits. I have made a careful, examination of the sewing-machine stand prices now which is here for observation, and it is indicate an admirable and creditable example of the cabinetmaker's art. But the duty on the wood cannot amount to more than 4d., and the cost of the glue, apart from the short duty,'is surely not more than one-twentieth",19,Tariff
44,Mr Hughes ( West Sydney),"I amof a penny. This machine has no cover, but it has three or four drawers which are dovetailed ; and there is a desire to have us believe that the woodwork is varnished and polished throughout, and that over all is spread an ocean of methylated spiritto the extent of 1 gallon. I venture to say that l j d . would be an excessive and untrue estimate of the duty on all the varnish and polish used in any machine, and that, excluding methylated spirits and shellac, £d. would cover the charge. The quantity of oil used is insignificant, and may be disregarded if she lived-woul d be able to secure member make his'computation? the honourable member for Melbourne Ports did not know whether these articles were made from Australian wood, or imported wood. the excessive duty on timber would have been commented on but the Minister for Home Affairs was silent on the matter. In any case, with a duty of Is. 6d. per 100 super, feet, the duty cannot exceed 4d. on the 17ft. or 18ft of wood which is used. A machine such as that outside could not be put upon the market under £ 1 5 . It is an admirable piece of work, but it is not the machine which the poor widow or the seamstress buys; it could serve as an article of furniture in any house. The brasswork on it is worth more than in most cases, and the duty on it would thus be more. But the brass-work on an ordinary machine is of the very cheapest kind, and I should be very sorry to say that I could not open the locks with a hairpin. The duty on the whole brass-work would not amount to more than 3d. or 3^d. Therefore, the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs that the duty on the raw material for cheap machines stands amounts to 2s. 6d., while that on the dearer class of machines is 5s., is difficult to The difference between the clearer and the cheaper machine-stands, so far as the duty on the material is concerned, is that on the better class of machine, polish instead of varnish is used, and electro-plated instead of brass or some other cheap fittings are put on. Certainly at the outside the difference in the duty could not be more than Is. on the two classes of machines, even if everything were used on them as stated by the Minister. I still maintain that the estimate made by me last night was based on a close examination of sewing machines, and I have confirmed it this morning by a further examination of a machine manufactured by the same firm. The remarks made by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne have for the most part no connection with the subject, but where they have they are so outrageously w^-ong that they do not call for further comment. The honourable member urged that machines would be dearer now, but that by-and-by the widow them at cheaper prices. Just imagine the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as a widow, plunged in unutterable grief at the death of the bread-winner, and confronted with the irrefragable fact that the price of sewing machines is £ 1 0 10s.; but that the protectionist manufacturer proposed by-and-by to reduce them to £ 5 . If he could be a widow, I think he would be as good a one as ever lived; but in such circumstances even he would rather get married again than wait for such a condition of tilings. We know that the effect of this taxation is to increase the cost of these articles. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke like a poet on the effect of taxing articles from which varnish is made. He urged that the result would be that varnish would flow through the land l it e cataracts of wild honey and milk, but the Minister for Home Affairs says that position has not yet been reached. We have the statement qn the one hand that protection increases the cost of the stand, while the Minister for Home Affairs says that it decreases tlie cost in the case of the machine itself. In America, where they have had protection for a very long time, the retail price of a Singer's sewing machine is £ 1 dearer than it was under free-trade in New South Wales. America is the home of the sewing machine, but the selling price there has never decreased ; so that we might have understand. a widow of 40 years ago, long since in her tomb, still waiting for the everlasting trumpet call announcing cheap sewing machines. The request made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is outrageous, while the support afforded to him by the Minister for Home Affairs is characteristic of the honourable gentleman. The whole request is so astounding that if it were made to a body of men who were unaccustomed to such unreasonable demands it would meet with",20,Tariff

48,Mr Hughes,"Had that been so,a very short shrift. In this committee, where it is unnecessary to consider the reason that underlies anything, but necessary only to consider the numbers one has at his back, there is something to be said in its favour. Although a number of employees of the firm in question are among my constituents, I must vote for what I believe to be the best interests of the Commonwealth. In deciding upon that course I am cheered by the knowledge that for the last five years those men have lived under a system of perfect free-trade; while the proprietor of the manufactory has been able to build up a colossal industry and make a huge fortune. Now he says that a duty of from 4d. to Is. on a machine-stand is going to crush his industry out of existence. I refuse to believe it, and I challenge the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the Minister for Home Affairs to substantiate their statements on any platform in any State they please. They have not a leg to stand on; and, what is more, they know it. posal as placed before the committee by the Minister for Home Affairs and the honourable member for Southern Melbourne represents some extraordinary, if not contradictory, features. The Minister desires the committee to place a duty upon sewing-machine stands on the ground that duties have already been imposed upon a number of materials used in their manufacture to the detriment of the local maker, as against the importer. When those duties were being considered honourable members were informed by those who advocated them that their effect"" would be to cheapen the cost of the materials to the consumer. It now appears that they have had an opposite effect, and that the local maker of sewingmachine stands is now labouring under a disadvantage which he did not suffer prior to the imposition of the duties. That seems to be a contradiction. Either the duties have resulted in cheapening the materials, and the manufacturer can be in no worse position than he was before their imposition, or, as predicted by honourable members of the Opposition, they have increased the prices, and placed him at a disadvantage. The Minister for Heme Affairs has attempted to explain away the apparent contradiction by stating that the local output of the raw material is confined to inferior articles, and that the maker of the stands finds it necessary in order to obtain the best quality to import the polish required by him. In that way, he said, the tax fell upon the manufacturer. That is the position which from time to time has been put before the committee by the Opposition. Honourable members on this side have always contended that the imposition of duties designed to establish industries before the requirements of the community make them possible, on a paying basis, leads at the outset to the production of inferior articles, and that local manufacturers who are adversely affected by these duties have to import their raw materials in order to be able to place a superior article on the market. The Minister for Home Affairs claims that the effect of the Tariff is disadvantageous to manufacturers of sewing-machine stands to the extent of something like 4 or 5 per cent. I have opposed the imposition of all these duties right from the first, and I think I have had good ground for doing so; but, when we find that the committee have imposed a duty which operates adversely to a manufacturer within the Commonwealth, I think, he should at least receive consideration in respect of the additional cost to which he is put in producing his goods by leason of the advantage given by that duty to some other manufacturer, i think that the manufacturer of sewingmachine stands, who, under a pure system of free-trade, was able to establish his factory and to extend it to its present dimensions, has some little claim for consideration. The honourable member for AVest Sydney says that the disadvantage under which this manufacturer labours does not amount to more than 4d. per 2nachine-stand, while the Minister for Home Affaire contends that it amounts to Os. There are some machine-stands which can be made for 20s., while there are others of elaborate construction, and designed to be an ornamental piece of furniture, which cost nearly £ 2 0 each. I can quite understand that the quantity of material used in the manufacture of a machine-stand which cost 20s. may represent an increased iharge of 3d. or 4d., and that in the case of a machine-stand which cost 20s. the additional cost is 4s. or 5s.

I offered to meet the honourable member by placing a duty of 10 per cent, on unrefined glycerine, and the Jionorable member agreed.

These are, shortly, the provisions of the Bill. The schedule, of course, will be an exact copy of the result of our labours in committee, and I do not see that there is any necessity on my part to further occupy the attention of the committee. there must be a feeling of satisfaction upon all sides of the House at the termination of the very arduous task upon which we have been engaged for so many months, and although there may have been a number of keen encounters during the progress of that woi>k, I feel that, upon the whole, we can congratulate ourselves upon the good feeling and good temper which have characterized our deliberations. I trust that that standard will always be maintained, even in dealing with the most exciting proposals of a Ministry. To refer at once to the Bill which has just been handed to us, I do not know whether the Ministry have kept in mind the provisions of the Constitution. them in mind, in my opinion they have not acted upon the provision in section 55, thatLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. How a provision about putting down rings can be said to be a matter relating to the imposition of taxation I do not know. Probably a very different view will be taken both by a court outside and by the Senate. Whetheri t is passed by the Senate in that form or not, I fancy that it would be a very serious matter for the consideration of a court whether such a provision in such an A ct would be of any. effect, in view of the declaration, in section 55 of the Constitution, that any extraneous matter shall be of no effect. But I hail the introduction of the provision. There is an admission by the Government that under a protective system there may pairs. be rings and combinations to increase the burdens of the people; and I would same. A majority of 14 in a House of 76 remind Ministers that the whole Tariff is intended to establish one vast ring. Eor what purpose ? To unduly enhance the price of commodities which Australian manufacturers put upon the market. So that, in putting in this clause, the Ministry forget the whole purpose of their proposals, which is to precisely bring about, in respect of articles manufactured in Australia, the effect of a ring-to unduly enhance their price as apart from the effect of open competition. I wish to pass on to the very important matter we have to deal with. I must admit at once that a number of improvements have been made in the Tariff. I must acknowledge most cordially, with feelings of gratitude, sincere gratitude, tlie assistance which some honourable members opposite have given the Opposition on many of their proposals. But I cannot thank the Government for anything. They never yielded on a single point until they found that they were beaten. If they had had their way they would have placed their supporters in the position of passing the Tariff they submitted without any important alteration. Such a Tariff, so passed, would have handed down with ignominy the name of the Prime Minister who uttered the Maitland speech. WhilstI have the most friendly feelings for the Prime Minister as a man, I cannot speak too strongly of the effect of his speech upon public opinion beI f the Ministry have kept fore the general, election. If the Tariff which was submitted had been appended to ' that speech, the Ministry would never have been able to submit a Tariff. I give as proof of that the fact that, although the Ministry, by virtue of that most deceptive utterance, only presented the principle of protection to tlie public as an appeal for benevolence to the distressed, even a House elected upon such a basis declined to follow the Ministry to the extremes into which they desired to lead it . Their. own supporters deserted the Ministry and enabled us to make many notsufficient but serious alterations When I submitted a motion of censure on their proposals, which the House has now absolutely approved of by its treatment of the Tariff, we were defeated on a division which represented the number for the Government at 39, and the number for tlie Opposition at 25.",27,Second Reading

90,Mr Reid,"Yes,bu t the proportion is themembers was the handicap on the Opposition when we began this fight. It was a great handicap ; and in that which we have done I hope the public will remember the disadvantage to svhich I referred. If I might drop into sporting language, the gamebird of the Ministry had vastly the superior weight, and by weight alone it has inflicted a defeat on the younger and the lighter bird. The younger and the lighter bird has come out of the struggle with eyes of undiminished lustre, and with the fullest confidence in its ultimate success. The larger bird has come out of the conflict minus many of its finest feathers, in a very flustered state, and with no sort of disposition to renew the conflict. I must admit the difficulties of the task which the Government set themselves. They set themselves an impossible task. you cannot have at the same time a protective and a productive duty. It is impossible, if the duty is to operate as a protective one; it is a contradiction in terms. That was the initial difficulty of the Government. If they had recognised it, and put before the House a heavy revenue Tariff, which would have been productive, and heavy protective duties on which they did not rely for much revenue, they would have stood in at any rate a logical position. But they have put themselves before the country as tbe authors of a Tariff which was to effect a large revenue result. I must here express my very deep obligations to the party which I have the honour to lead. I have, unfortunately, been compelled to be absent on more than one occasion, and it only heightens my feeling of admiration for the loyalty, determination, and devotion which have been shown to me, and to the cause which we represent, by honourable members behind me. I also wish to tender my deep acknowledgments to the honourable member for Wentworth, and the honourable member for Macquarie. Mr B.EID -The honourable member for Macquarie-and I am very glad to be able to say precisely the same of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro-ha s managed to unite unrivalled skill with personal honour. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to recognise that, whatever our fights may be, we can honestly say that no cloud of suspicion rests upon the personal honour of any honourable member, and in view of -occurrences in other lands, with reference to matters such as we have been debating, I think that that statement can be echoed by every honourable member. Long may it so continue. It takes the bitterest element out of our differences. We recognise that if we have failed we have been defeated by honourable men who happen to differ from us, and who in differing from us are honest. I have no sort of bitter feeling with reference to any Minister or any honourable member of the House. Whilst on that account I can not shrink from perfect candour, I hope that I shall never descend to personal bitterness. Now, I wish in the first place to say that, in my opinion, it is seriously at variance with that system of parliamentary government to which British communities are accustomed, that the leader of this House and Speaking generally, head of the Government should have so ostentatiously abandoned his position in the Chamber during these prolonged Tariff debates. The leader of the House# always owes this duty to parliamentary government. He must recognise the obligations which attach to his position; he must recognise that under our system of Cabinet, and government, and Parliament, unless there is a firm and steady hand, and the same hand at the helm, confusion and disaster must result. I am not ignorant of the great calls upon the Prime Minister, but I hold that what Ministers like the British Ministers can do, with the vast responsibilities devolving upon them, our Prime Minister must do. Occasionally, we must all be absent from this State, and while absent no one will expect a physical impossibility to occur; but that our leader and our Prime Minister should, night after night, and month after month, be within the precincts of the chamber, and yet take less interest in and less control of this most serious of all national tasks than the humblest private member, is a circumstance which I feel bound to comment upon. fact. for he has been at his work tlie whole time. is the work of the leader of this House?

I feel more strongly upon this matter, because the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs are representatives of New South Wales, the State whose interests are vitally affected by the Tariff, perhaps more than those of any other. It would have been infinitely better for this Chamber if the Prime Minister"" had taken a more active part in our deliberations. but a compliment. my right honourable friends, the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, I wish to say at once that they have all through shown a patience and a willingness to listen to discussion, which excites my full appreciation. ments which I do not entirely mean. I suppose that to some extent their was influenced by the fact that they were not successful either in crushing the Opposition or in keeping their supporters here beyond a certain time, and, therefore, my compliment must be to a certain extent discounted. that the Ministers have given us full and fair opportunities for discussing the Tariff. NowI wish to deal with a matter which is almost as important and that is, the finances of the States, and the financial system which is to provide ways and means for the Commonwealth and for the States. respects in which the Braddon blot will be justified by posterity, and one of the best things about ibis that it points a strong finger in the direction in which our Commonwealth finances must always proceed. We have taken from the States their main source of revenue, and we have left to them nearly all their sources of expenditure. we must be careful to send back to the States a most substantial amount of Customs revenue; and whilst we are bound to do that, we, as setting an example to the Australian States, must proceed upon strictly prudent Some people speak as if we can only effect retrenchment by the painful method of reducing expenditure. are concerned, however, it is equally important to them that economy in taxation should be observed, because if we can -safeguard the rights of the taxpayers of the Mr lieid. Commonwealth and of the States, who are the same, by a prudent system of taxation, laying no unnecessary burdens upon them, we shall, at the most critical stage of our finances, be acting wisely and fairly to all. My first objection to this Tariff of the Commonwealth Ministry is that, as far as it expresses a system of finance, it is reckless and extravagant. When the Tariff was submitted, the Government had many opportunities of obtaining information, of which we were deprived. Stilli t did not need a very That is not satire, large amount of inquiry, such as a private Now, with reference to member could conduct, to discover that tbe Tariff proposals must infallibly produce a larger amount than the Government said was required. Surely there is no injustice in testing the Government's finance by their own measure of tbe necessities of tbe I do not wish to make complicase. The Government told us, speaking of a year which was not a normal attitude year, owing to the fact that for three months and eight days of it the old system prevailed, that they expected a revenue of £8,009,000. They said further that in a normal year they estimated the Customs revenue at £8,942,000. They acted proAt the same time, I admit perly in putting before us these two estimates, which were called for by the necessities of the case. We find already-as was said on this side of as the Tariff, the House often enough-that on the basis of the revenue so far produced the actual return will be within £150,000 of the £8,940,000 which the Treasurer There are many estimated would be received in a normal year. This calculation is based upon the experience of about five months, but the statement, of the Treasurer taken by itself shows an increase of £580,000 over and above his estimate. According to the Treasurer's estimate for nine months, if we take the same rate of receipts to exTherefore tend over the f u l l 12 months, we shall receive something like £S0'0,000 in addition to the £8,009,000 which was estimated for the current year. That brings the total to £8,809,000, or within £150,000 of the estimated receipts for a normal 3'ear. We and economical lines. have this enormous excess over the estimate, although there has been a serious falling off in eight or ten of the largest lines of So far as the public revenue. Whereas for four months we should have receivedsomething like£l,500,000 from these lines, we have derived something under £900,000. That is to say, the shortage on these eight or ten lines amounts to £600,000 for four months. In order to estimate the shortage for the year, we must multiply £600,000 by three, and we shall thus arrive at a total deficiency of something like £1,800,000. We know that this shrinkage does not represent any collapse of consumption, but that it results from the operation of trade manipulations before the Tariff came into force. This will all disappear in a normal year, and we shall have a legitimate revenue such as the Treasurer estimated to receive from these lines. In spite of the collapse upon these four lines to toria will receive an increase of £S41,000, the extent of £600,000, the Treasurer has received in actual revenue £600,000 more than he estimated for nine months. I mention these figures as showing the reckless calculations upon which we were asked to pass a Tariff that woukl produce extravagant results. Whilst we are considering this point, we should not forget that the estimate for a normal year is based upon the State revenues from Customs for 1S99, so that in a normal year, which cannot come round till 1903, we shall have the figures of a period three years later than 1899. This will probably result in an important addition to the revenue. Taking the period of five months from October to February as a basis, the Tariff will probably yield-leavin g out Western Australia £9,271,000; that is assuming, as I have said, that the shortage on the leading items referred to disappears. The Treasurer's estimate for a normal year for the same States was £8,230,000 ; so that upon the basis of the actual facts in an abnormal year, we have an excess of £1,000,000 sterling-if the general receipts continue for the f u l l period of twelve months as they have, been coming in over the estimated revenue for a normal year. The case of Western Australia is very exceptional, and I have, therefore, eliminated it from tlie comparison. Let us, however, add the figures for Western Australia. Adopting the same basis of calculation, we find that the receipts in Western Australia will probably amount to £1,250,000, and that the Tariff will yield a total of £10,500,000 in the six States in an abnormal year, instead of the £8,9-10,000 estimated for a normal year. By the term ""normal year"" we recognise that several leading lines of revenue have been impoverished, but are bound to recover in the course of time. Now let us contrast the probable revenue returns for this year with the actual Customs revenue derived by the Statesi n the year 1900. That will be going back some little time. I shall first leave out Western Australia as a very special case, and take the five other States. In 1900 New South Wales received Customs revenue to the amount of £1,785,000, whereas during the current year, upon the basis of the revenue as it has been coming in, she will receive probably £3,397,000-a n increase of £1,612,000 upon her Customs revenue for 1900. VicQueensland will unfortunately receive £121,000 less. South Australia will receive £205,000 more, and Tasmania will receive £82,000 less. The total revenue received from Customs in these five Statesi n 1900 was £6,816,000, whereas the probable revenue during the current year, as I have said, will be £-9,271,000 ; and the increase in these five States will thus be £2,455,000. That is, even if the revenue pans out for the rest of the year as it has panned out for the period which has already passed, and the leading lines referred to recover their elasticity. It must be remembered that in 1900 some intercolonial products passing from one State to another were taxed. And our Inter-State products were supposed to yield about £1,000,000 to the different States in a year. So that we must remember that since 1900 £1,000,000 has gone-wisely ; we do not grudge it , but it has gone ; and in spite of this £1,000,000 having gone, this Tariff will give us on the basis I have named £2,500,000 more than the five States got in 1900.

That is a period of five months. week in October? under the old system, before we had a Federal Tariff. October? I am dealing with the Federal Tariff. I to the 28th February. The revenue re-ceived in that period is the basis. I apply tliat basis to the period of twelve months. Applying that basis for five months, to the receipts for the whole year at tlie same rate-estimated , of course-and expecting .the recovery on leading items alluded to, I bring out, as I have said, the result that the receipts, exclusive of Western Australia, would be £9,270,000 instead of £8,230,000 on the estimate of the Treasurer for a normal year of £8,942,000. I want honourable members to see that whilst we were fighting here over this little item and that little item, we were putting on tlie people a huge burden, and applying a huge engine of taxation, which is creating a basis for State extravagance. I have, of course, to condense my remarks under existing circumstances, and I therefore leave that point for the present; but later on, if these figures are challenged in any way, I shall be able to deal with the subject more fully. NowI want to point out the radical difference which we all know exists between the two points of view. gether if we act upon protective lines on the one hand, and revenue Tariff lines on the other. The two positions are irreconcilable. The Government have based this huge taxation machine upon the principle of destroying revenue instead of fostering it : but this that to be true. My honourable friends opdestroying machine has produced enormously more than a revenue Tariff would have produced. AVhat does that mean ? It means that we have set a standard of taxation which is inordinately high. Do honourable members expect that the protective influence of the Tariff will bring down our I should like to give the imports by five or ten millions in one or two years ? If they have any such expectation they will be disaj>pointed, and the people will be burdened accordingly. NowI want to refer to tlie pith of this matter. I recognise that my honourable friends opposite are men of intelligence and candour. They may be wrong, but I recognise that during the course of this grear, discussion they have had tbe advantage of bearing what we have had to say, just as we have had the advanThat first week was tage of hearing what they have had to say. As far as I understand it , my honourable friends opposite are protectionists in 9th of dealing with the Tariff, mainly from these considerations-that the labour conditions, happily, of Australia are better than tlie labour conditions of other countries ; that, calculate from the 9th of October therefore, our labour cannot produce a given article as cheaply as the labour in those other countries; and labour being an important element in production, they say-""We are protectionists in order to establish manufactures, and so that our men may earn something like an Australian rate of wage."" That is, fairly put, I think, one of their grounds. Now, there are some considerations that my honourable friends, I hope, will think over, which rather disturb that position. AVe have heard, for instance, of cheap Chinese labour. The effect of that phrase upon the committee has been almost galvanic as applied to any particular item. Whether the matter under discussion were crockery or glue-pots, or anything else, the word "" Chinese"" and the word "" Japanese"" have paralyzed the committee. One of the most distinguished men in the United States, who was the ambassador of that country to China, in an article a few months ago in the J\ orlh American Review, made r this statement as the result of his knowledge of both America and China. He said that those who state that Chinese labour is We can never come tocheap, and that good American labour is deai-, make a profound mistake. He says that the American labour, with its high rates, is cheaper labour than the Chinese with its nominal rates.

107,Mr Reid,"Tw o men and a boy worth upon us right enough, whatever our policydebase labour in order to produce cheaply. The American, who leads the world's production from the factory and the farm alike, does not sweat the workman. Yet his cheapness is proverbial, for he undersells the nation in their owii markets. How is it done ? After showing what "" small potatoes"" the Germans are as compared with the Americans, the article continuesThe manager of a tool shop in Berlin says that, apart from differences of wages, the American can turn out his product 25 per cent, more cheaply than the German. Was tbe American, bred by a Tariff? The American can turn out his products 25 per cent, cheaper. The article addsThis is not. because the American workman toils longer hours than does his European brother. The difference arises mostly from the superior adapbabilibx' of the American, his readiness to use newer labour-saving processes, and his ability to get the best results from the object to serve, that is to make some indusmachines which be is tending. Ib is due in part also to the superior efficiency of the American shop, bhe economy of arrangemenb by which handling of the article in bhe various processes and Customs, with a skill which is native to of manufacture is reduced bo a minimum; all delays are eliminated, and every one is kept constantly employed. Ib is upon these bhings, and not in cubbing the workman down bo a starvation stabe of living, that the American relies of legislation which ought to make them for maintaining his supremacy. There is something more to be added. we all know, if there is anything absurd and ridiculous in the world it is the attempt which little Victoria has made to cope with the marvellous magnitude of the manufacturing industries of a great nation like America. the conditions, it is impossible that a small people, with a small home demand, can in manufactures, rise above the level of the great manufacturing nations of the Northern Hemisphere. product goes out upon the ocean, the Tariff ceases to follow it. Then the stilts of protection fall, into Hobson's Bay. Young Australia therefore sets itself an absurd task in pitting its little factories against the vast with the Tariff? manufacturing power of Great Britain and the United States. mean that we cannot develop manufactures. It is the greatest fallacy in the world to suppose that we believe that our policy will be fatal to manufactures. couraging men to enter enterprises which can never stand upon their own legs, the effect of our policy is to compel the investor bo study the doctrine of profit and loss. If most of us make a mistake in our enterprises, does the protectionist come along and pay for it ? Mr JRtid. Isi t not a fact that every miner, farmer shopkeeper, and labourer has to submit to the results of these mistakes ? The advantage of a free-trade policy-whic h seems the cruel policy-is that the sprouts which come up in the open-air of the heavens are hardy, they are suited to the natural conditions of the soil and climate, and the winds, instead of withering them, make them grow stronger and stronger. AVe believe in encouraging manufactures, but we do not believe in stifling them by placing them in an artificial atmosphere, or upon the footing of paupers. AVe believe in our manufacturers working like men to produce their own results, and we believe it is a political wrong of the worse kind that the masses, who bear tbe burden of the industries of Australia, should have only one tries snug and safe for those who inhabit a few large cities. The Minister for Trade him, drew a touching picture of what Australia does for the farmer and the miner. He pointed to a series of wonderful pieces cheerfully submit to all sorts of hours of As labour and to all sorts of beggarly wages in order to maintain a few men who are in a better position in the towns.

If the protectionist Instead of enstilts are necessary for the men of the towns, let us buy a few for those who are working under the burning sun. It is the old story over again.

109,Mr Reid,"It has much to do with it ,does not give them their fair share of the returns of their joint enterprise. Acts of Parliament have been passed to redress that -wrong. But why should not the -wrong be redressed right through Australia 1 Because we have not the courage to apply to our great primary industries the coddling -which we apply to the industries in the town, and because we know that the moment we widen this preserve of beneficial legislation the whole thing becomes so ridiculous that it breaks down. A monopoly can never exist when its range includes every one. We may have a monopoly if we single out the bootmakers or the clothing manufacturers, because they constitute only a few amongst the great mass, but if we confer upon all the citizens of Australia the benefits of a monopoly, where is the profit going 1 The root of this absurdity is shown in its limited range. Tf protection is a good thing for labour, why should not labour benefit all through ? Why should not the swagman, the boundary rider, the hand on the farm, the hand on the station, the hand in the country store, and the man on the road, with his dray and his team, have a friendly helping hand from the State% If we could confer these benefits all round and help every one, all would be protectionists. But ridicule the principles of political economy as we may, we have never yet been able to prove that if we take a shilgoods in exchange, surely some one must ling out of one man's pocket and put it into the pocket of another, it has not shifted its venue. Of course, the fellow who loses the shilling is told that in some mysterious way it travels all round the country, but eventually comes back to his pocket like a boomerang. That is .good enough for some political economists, but, as a rule, the old-fashioned principle is the best-the man who has earned a thing has the best right to keep it. If from a motive of benevolence he chooses to pass his shilling to a fellow tradesman well and good; it is a noble act. If he realized the position he would not do it. The charm of the policy of protection is that we can be wondrously liberal to some people at the expense of others without being able to earmark tbe way in which it is done, and the money with which it is done. The reign of this sham political economy is going to bi-eak down. If protection be a good policy it must be extended from the overcrowded cities to the country; but if it is bad'it had better be killed. In the few words I have to say I want to point to another fallacy which appeared in the Melbourne Age during the current week. That newspaper, which is rightly looked on as the most able and intelligent champion of protection in Victoria, has a number of additional advantages which are always at the command of the unscrupulous. If we fight fairly we are put at a disadvantage compared with the man who fights, not only with his fists, but with knife, blue metal, or dynamite, and uses every other known means of getting rid of an obnoxious opponent. This newspaper, which enjoys a notoriety earned long before the Federal Parliament was established, in a leading article published only two days ago, asked the intelligent protectionists of Australia to take note of the fact that from 1S90 to 1900 the United States exported £540,000,000 worth of goods more than they imported. What a magnificent fact that is ! The productive energies of tbe people of the United States were so enormous, and their requirements from abroad so limited, that they had this magnificent balance of exports. I thought it necessary to inquire into the enormous amount of gold and silver coin and bullion that must have come back to America in respect of this excess of exports, for which nobody paid with imports. If nobody sent have sent cash 1 I.s there any other method of paying known to protectionists 1 debts. Then, this stalwart young republic sent away an excess of £540,000,000 worth of exports in ten years, in order to pay interest on its debts ? This is another examine of the mistakes which will occur when the signal is given, "" Up, Crouch, and at 'em ! "" On inquiring into the movements of silver and gold coin and bullion during the same period, I find that the United States exported £66,000,000 more of gold and silver coin and bullion than was imported. What a marvellously generous people the United States people must be! They sent out £540,000,000 worth of exports as a present to the world, and they sent £66,000,000 in gold and silver coin and bullion running after it . Now let us look at the horrible condition of Great Britain.

On looking at the movements of gold and silver coin and bullion during the same period, I find that, in addition to presenting Great Britain with worth of goods in excess of what was paid for in similar goods, the world presented her with a sum of £51,000,000 in gold and silver. What ruination! to England, but to the other countries who made the presents. But to a man who goes below the surface there is no magic here. England has grown so enormously in wealth -this she gets from all the other countries of the World an enormous annual tribute in interest due on moneys owing; and, like a sensible merchant, she takes goods instead of gold. These goods are turned over in British factories, fill British shops, and feed British people cheaply. That is the pauperism and distress of the mother country. able member spoke of pauperism in England, and I should like to give a few figures which will gladden his humane heart. In 1849 there were 62 paupers per 1,000 of the population in England, while last year there were only 24 per 1,000. provides alms-houses for the old and feeble must have a great many people in those institutions; men and women to work. number of able-bodied paupers, who can work if they have work, and the proportion of these in 1849 was 13 per 1,000. I do not think that Mr Fleming would mind a proportion of that kind so much. In 1900 the proportion of able-bodied paupers was under 3 per 1,000. Here we have a country which opens its ports to all nations and colours of the human race, and yet the number of able-bodied paupers has been reduced to this remarkably small proportion, and the people generally of that country, commercially, financially, and industrially, are in a position such as they never before occupied. call attention to another matter before I conclude my observations. be remembered tliat in the motion of censure which I submitted financial I asked their proposals would place the finances of the Commonwealth on an unsound and extravagant I think I have sufficiently proved that that was true, Mr Reid. What an appalling Government failed to adjust the burdens of taxation and the advantages of the free list in an equitable manner. That, I think, has been shown to be true £1,455,000,000 also. ThenI contended tliat the Government revealed a marked tendency to unduly press on the necessaries of life. Is that not true ? What is the effect of the duties of Not ruination 30 per cent, on boots, shoes, and caps, and duties of 25 per cent, on clothing down to the cheapest kind? On what other commodities, except narcotics and stimulants, do we find duties of 30 per cent. ? Why ""poor, depressed"" England-that should such heavy duties be placed on bhe clothing of human beings ? Because clothing is necessary for the people, and affords. the largest scope for monopoly. Who wants a monopoly of any commodity that the poor do not use? What is a monopoly in champagne worth ? What is a monopoly in diamonds worth ? No; monopolists go straight An honorfor the biggest returns, and the necessaries of the masses of the people are sought after for that reason. who imposes enormous duties on the clothA nation which ing of men, women, and children running after them with a tax on their tea. I cannot understand such a ravenous sort of but we do not expect poor old night bird. Success having been achieved The test is the in taxing every possible commodity required by human beings, resentment is exhibited at the action of those who left untouched the tea of the bushman. The honourable and learned member for Nortliern Melbourne is, I suppose, one of the most humane men in Australia. We all respect him, although we differ from him. We know that his views are simply the result of environment. The honourable and learned member has sat so long beside the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that he cannot help himself. What a bitter fight we had to get the duties on the appliances used in the farming"", mining, and I should like to pastoral industries reduced to 15 per cent.? May I remark on the significant It will fact that, as this prolonged struggle has gone on, the Government have been getting on the weaker and weaker; instead of winding statement of the Ministry, up like a band of victorious patriots, the House to declare that they are now all limp. I believe that this morning the Opposition had a victory on and the States almost every division; and that was a basis. great temptation to keep the struggle going on. But I want to point out that if the I complained that the Government had had their way, this Tariff,",35,Honourable Members Hear Hear
112,Mr Higgins,Such as a tax on tea.,36,Honourable Members Hear Hear
113,Mr Reid,"I cannot understand a manwith all its monstrosities, would have been the law of the land. That the Tariff is not the law of the land is due to the Opposition, generously reinforced sometimes by honourable members opposite, and sometimes by the honourable member for Bland. I do not want to flatter the honourable member for Bland as the leader of the labour party, but, speaking as one man to another, I ' wish to recognise the great services which he, being a protectionist and acting on his principles, has rendered by his efforts to preserve the revenue as far as possible. The honourable member and other members of his party have helped us in a manner that I here wish to recognise. I do not believe in omitting any who may fairly share the credit to which the Opposition is undoubtedly entitled. By the action of the committee I prove all the charges I made against the Government. Every word in the motion of censure ought, on the honest votes of the committee, to be recorded against the Government, judging the Government by their acts and not by their speeches. I am deeply indebted to honourable members on both sides for the extremely courteous hearing I have had. I must admit that the Government have had a victory over us, owing to the force of their superior numbers ; but it is a victory full of many humiliations. We have been defeated, but our defeat may prove to be one of those transient reverses which sweeten the success of ultimate triumph. I suppose that during our prolonged struggle to lighten the burdens of the people, we have incurred the dislike of tbe men who have crowded those galleries, and infested the lobbies of Parliament, not to promote the public good, but to gain private advantage. I have no doubt that we shall be regarded with bitter aversion by those who have so strenuously endeavoured to win the aid and countenance of the Legislature in order to exploit the necessities of the poor. I think I can with all propriety claim that I voice the unanimous feeling of every member of His Majesty's Opposition when I say that we shall always look back uponthisprolonged struggle wi th feelings of satisfaction and pride. As to the future I am sure we shall be equally determined. I feel tliat we shall be united as one man, to do all that we can, in this new land of ours, to save our infant Constitution from those evils which all the world over have turned systems of government into huge engines of favouritism' and monopoly, adding abundantly to the. wealth of the man of many possessions, whilst taking from him who hath little all that he hath. That the debate be adjourned. May I ask what business the Government propose to put before the House next week ? on with this and the Excise Bill, at least I hope that we shall dispose of them sospeedily that we will be able to deal with some other business. The Bonus Bill will be brought on next week. Motion agreed to ; debate adjourned. Bill presented, and read the first time.

MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I desire to bring under the attention of the House a' question relating to' the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. It s urgency is my excuse for bringing it forward at this late hour. Certain honourable members of this House, and another place, had an interview yesterday with the Prime Minister in regard to the employment of coloured aliens in the pearl-shelling industry at Thursday Island, and I take exception to portion of the Prime Minister's reply in dealing with some of the statements put forward by the deputation.

118,Mr Mauger (Melbourne Ports),"II had better read, the whole statement as reported, in order that honourable members may understand the positionMr Barton, in reply, stated that he intended to appoint two gentlemen to inquire into the present position and future prospects of the. industry under federal legislation in Queensland'and Western Australia. The following is the portion of the Prime Minister's reply to which I object:Meantime, in order to avoid any possible danger of the destruction or removal of the industiy, he had decided to issue exemptions to the coloured clivers for a period of three months. It was only the other day that the House decided that in the best interests of Australia, it was necessary that legislation should be passed, in order to avoid the evil of allowing Kanakas to come into Queensland for a term of three years' service. Government then said that the education test would be sufficient to keep out the coloured promised that administered. ment proposing to relax their efforts to keep coloured aliens out of the country. They propose, to allow this exemption for three months, simply in order that they may make inquiries. If the Government were sincere and honest in their administration of the Act, they would make their inquiries without allowing any exemption. I do not think that any exemption need be given. At one time there were nearly 2,000 Europeans on Thursday Island who were engaged in the pearl-shelling industry, but to-day there are only 96. The remainder of those engaged in the industry, to the number of nearly 2,000, consist of coloured aliens of different When we find that they are driving the white men out of employment in this way, it is time to say something against tlie action of the Government in this matter. tunity length as soon as the House meets on Tuesday next. ments, showing that the agitation has been brought about merely to encourage the belief that, unless an exemption is granted, the vast pearl-shelling fleet at Thursday Island will shift to Dutch New Guinea. As a matter of fact, they cannot work there. The waters there are too rough, and the shell is not to be found in sufficient quantity, or of a quality equal to that found in the vicinity of Thursday Island. Therefore, in any circumstances, these people will be compelled to carry on their occupation at Thursday Island. They must also obtain their food and water there : so that it is ridiculous to say that they will remove to Dutch New Guinea. I have it on the authority of men who have been engaged for a number of years in the industry on Thursday Island, that the agitation is designed simply to bring pressure on the Federal Government to induce them to relax their efforts in dealing with the exclusion of coloured aliens. I hope that the Government will not grant these exemptions, but that they will continue to put the education test to every coloured man who lands on the shores of Australia, or wherever they have jurisdiction, so that, if possible, all The may be kept out. should like the Attorney-General to tell us, races from Australia, and if possible, the date on which it is proposed it would be properly to enter upon the inspection of the sites for Now we find the Governthe federal capital. Do what we will, we cannot obtain any definite statement on the point from the Government. The cold weather is coming on, and we should like to know positively whether the Government contemplate making this trip immediately, or whether, as has been rumoured, they intend to abandon it until next year. year. not the Government tell us when the trip is to be made ? ral) I had not the good fortune to be present at the deputation which waited on the nationalities. Prime Minister yesterday, and know no more of what transpired there than appears in the report read by the honourable member for Kennedy. I know, however, that the proposal with regard to I shall take a further opporthe exemption does not imply the addition of dealing with it at greater of a single coloured alien to the population of Australia. The temporary exemption I have a number of docuproposed is intended simply to allow these men to land for the purpose of disembarking their shell and obtaining their stores. Having done that, they are to be mustered on their ships, and to take their departure. The temporary exemption for three months is only to preserve the status quo, so to speak. It is to allow an inquiry into the very circumstances to which the honourable member has referred.

123,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"-AttorneyG enebeen stated on some authority that the Dutch station at Merouke will not afford a suitable haven for the pearl-shelling fleet. That is one point which has to be settled. It is also stilted that tbe difficulties in relation to the pearl-shell fishery, so far as they affect us, can be met without interf e r in g with the operation of the Act. That, too, has to be inquired into. Tbe further question as to the displacement of white divers by coloured men, relates to a branch of the subject with whicli I am not familiar, but on which no doubt the Prime Minister will be able to give the honourable member information. House understands that this proposal is only to preserve the status quo whilst inquiry is being mode, and that it is not to leave an open door for three months, a great deal of the honourable member's apprehension will be removed. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Does the honor, able and learned gentleman mean that pearl fishers who bod their boats at these ports before the Act came into operation will be prevented from landing without an exemption? will be, but that may take place. I have asked my honorablecolleague, theMinisterforHorne Affairs, who has to deal with the question of the visit to the federal capital sites, and has the: matter very much at heart, whether he can state definitely the date on which the inspection will be. entered upon. If the honourable member for Parramatta can tell me when the Customs Bill and the Excise Bill will leave this Chamber, and when the Treasurer will obtain the necessary advance to enable him to proceed-as he has practically exhausted his voteI shall be able to answer his question. Mr ""WATSON -What about the Bonus BillI brought in, but I do not know that it will be necessary to proceed with it before the visit to the federal capital sites is made. The desire of the Government is to deal only with those measures which are absolutely essential before the inspection is made.
