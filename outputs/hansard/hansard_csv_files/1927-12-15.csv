The arrangement is that their services are available whenever required, but they are permitted to make their own arrangements for taking time off subject to the hotel management being satisfactorily carried on. On the 9th December, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked me certain questions regarding the architectural competition for the National War Memorial at Canberra. I am now in a position to advise him as follow:1. The fresh design, which tbe two architects in collaboration were commissioned to prepare, ha* been submitted and is now under consideration. 2. There was no question of amalgamating two designs, nor any attempt to reconcile the widely divergent architectural styles mentioned. The architects were requested to prepare a new design, in collaboration, which has been done. . 3. Sixty-nine. 4. and 5. The conditions of the competition provided for two stages of adjudication. The Australian board was required to select not fewer than ten designs for transmission to London for final consideration by an architect nominated by the Royal Institute of British Architects. A fundamental condition of the competition was that any design, the probable cost of which would exceed the stipulated sum of £250,000, should be excluded. The Australian board of adjudicators, after an exhaustive enquiry in which they were assisted by practical experts, determined that, with the OF HOTEL MANAGERS exception of one design which was excluded on other grounds, none of the designs subWAR MEMORIAL-Cos r OF mitted fulfilled this condition, and, therefore, further with the competition. This matter was represented to the Federal Capital Commission and the Government, and it was determined that no good purpose would be served by involving additional delay and expense in forwarding designs to London whicli had been excluded owing to tlieir non-compliance with one of the mandatory conditions of the competition. After conferring with the Federal Capital Commission, the War Memorial Bo.ird T be answers to tbe h o nand the Government, the adjudicators wore requested to nominate twelve designs lo receive an award as an act of grace by.'o not in accordance with the conditions of the competition which was regarded as being at an Hotel end. Thc engagement of tlie two architects to prepare a fresh design was a matter independent of the competition but followed a recommendation by the adjudicators in order that further progress with the matter might be housekeeper-in-charge, possible. The adjudicators expressed the view that these architects had given evidence of housekeeper-in-charge, Beauchamp capacity to produce a satisfactory solution of the problem from the point of view of architectural design and cost. G. No expression of resentment has been received from the Royal Institute of British Architects.

20,Mr Marr,"Hotel Wellington £23,166, Beauchamp House, not finally complete but -would not exceed £24,000. I explained that these figures were the actual cost of the buildings and did not include overhead charges and interest. sion's annual report for tbe financial year 1926-27, the expenditure on these buildings is shown as -Hote l Ainslie £27,996, Hotel Wellington £25,849, Beauchamp House £23,552. The difference in tbese figures is accounted for by the inclusion of interest and overhead charges in the report. In all these cases the estimated cost of the work was under £25,000, and tbey did not, therefore, fall within the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act."" It was decided some time ago that for tbe purpose of this act interest and overhead charges should not be included by tbe commission, although these are added later for its own bookkeeping purposes as a commercial concern. The reason for not including interest and overhead charges when considering whether a work sbould be referred to tbe Public Works Committee was to bring the commission's works on to tbe same basis, for this purpose, as other Commonwealth works, e.g., those carried out by the Department of Works and Railways, in regard to which it is not the custom to include interest or the cost of preparation of plans, &c, as these services are performed by permanent officers and the administrative cost of the department is not distributed over tbe works.

Several such instances are quoted in the report of the Tariff Board which conducted an exhaustive inquiry into this industry.

It w ill be noted, too, that with one exception the Australian manufacturer's price in Australia is lower than the American manufacturer's price in the Argentine, and in all instances considerably below the Australian price of the imported article. This proves quite conclusively that the Australian manufacturer is not taking advantage of the tariff, and tlie steadying effect of local manufacture on imported prices is apparent. A further illustration may be quoted in regard to the exports of tractors from the United States of America during the first six months of 1927. anything like this in the House before. It is an absolute scandal. tralia include 1,558 two-plow wheel tractors valued at $801,301; also 684 three-plow wheel tractors, valued at $647,590. Dividing the amount of dollars by the number of tractors in each case, and converting into sterling at $4.86, shows the price of these tractors respectively at £105 16s. and £194 16s. The smaller size, £105 16s., sells in Australia at £395, or an advance of 272 per cent. The larger size, £194 16s., sells in Australia at £595, or an advance of 205 per cent.

The bill rean extension of the field of both presents another attempt to deal with the Commonwealth and State legislation, industrial problem, so far as the powers until to-day we bave in operation in Ausof this Parliament permit it to approach tralia, under both Commonwealth and that problem. Many matters with which State laws, a vast and intricate system of modern parliaments have .to deal are industrial regulation. The result is that essentially economic in character. industrial problem itself is but a portion secondary industries are working under of the larger economic problem of so laws of this character, as are also most organizing tbe community as to proof those wbo are engaged in transport duce the maximum amount of wealth; industries and urban services.

66,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorney health legislation, began in a movementtbese tribunals are not founded upon tbe contention that the wage paid is insufficient to support the worker and hia family. Claims now made are for increases in wages, reduction of hours, and alterations of conditions of employment, which may or may not be desirable, but which, as a general rule, cannot be claimed on ordinary humanitarian grounds, as was the case in the past. Thus the causes which produced the extensive system of regulation of industry have now, owing to the application of legislative remedies, almost disappeared. In some quarters it is occasionally suggested that as the original reasons for this system of regulation have now largely if not entirely disappeared, it ig no longer necessary to maintain in operation the laws under which it exists. I am unable to agree with that view. If all employers coiild be trusted to pay a fair minimum wage for work done, and to observe, upon their own initiative, fair hours and conditions of employment, it might be possible to leave the whole matter to the bargaining of tbe parties concerned. But even then the interests of the community as a whole would, in some instances, require special consideration. Moreover, the variations of conditions granted by employers would almost inevitably cause discontent, so that some method of regulation would still be required to remove that discontent by stable adjustments. Tbat ideal condition of affairs-of being able to rely upon every employer to do the fair and just thing-however , does not exist. Therefore, although the Government recognizes that this system of regulation in many ways imposes a burden upon industry, it considers that the general abandonment of industrial legislation in Australia, wbich is sometimes suggested, would not solve any problem, but would open the way to a period of social and industrial unrest, and to the perpetration of individual injustices, for which the Government is not prepared to accept the responsibility. Upon the inauguration of the' Commonwealth the conception of tbe object of industrial legislation took a new form. provisions Constitution, which are directed towards the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Commonwealth legislation is necessarily conditioned by the only power which the Commonwealth Parliament possesses in this field. The power of this Parliament is limited in such a way that federal laws dealing with this subject must be founded upon the idea of industrial disputes. It is therefore in my view unfortunate that this conception of industrial disputes must necessarily be the primary consideration in federal legislation. The existence of disputants is a condition necessary to the application of federal legislation. Tbe limitation of tbe power of tbe Commonwealth to dealing witb disputes by means of conciliation and arbitration has necessarily resulted in the organization of both sides in industry for the purpose of either creating or fighting disputes in order to bring themselves within the ambit of, or to protect themselves against it. One consequence has been that tbere is a tendency, very marked in Australia at present, to regard the interests of organized employers or tbe interests of organized employees as something distinct from the interests of tbe community as a whole. One of the considerations which the Government has borne in mind in preparing this bill has been the necessity of trying to re-establish in its primary place tbe interests of the community as a whole. In applying this principle it must be remembered that the welfare of the whole depends upon the well-being of tbe parts. There is, therefore, in this principle, a simple application of the idea of social welfare and not a contradiction of it. Professor Zimmern one of the most enlightened of English writers on social subjects, saysThe problem of industrial policy, or what is sometimes roughly described .as the Labour problem, may perhaps be thus stated: how to secure or maintain for civilized mankind (or for our own particular section of it) the goods and services it needs, whilst st the same time providing justice and freedom for those who produce them. To put it more shortly, how to secure that a good life for the consumer shall be compatible with a good life for the producer. It is a problem which goes to the root of democracy. It is impossible for the CommonThis is indicated by the wealth witb its limited powers to attack of the Commonwealth this whole problem. Had the referendum submitted to the people last year bt«n successful, it would have been possible to do much more tban is now possible in tbe direction of dealing witb social problems of this character so far as legislation can deal witb them. It. must be remembered, however, that, whatever the Commonwealth Parliament may do at the present time, it is impossible for it to consocial justice and efliciency; . and tbeir trol tbe activities of State legislatures. In dealing with this subject. I suggest that it is a mistake to expect too mucb from legislation. Nor sbould legislation be blamed for all tbe industrial evils which exist. Legislation can help or binder industrial activity; but legislation cannot produce anything. Only work can produce. Wages and profits -come out pf tbe product of industry, and unless industry is profitable it cannot continue, in which case there can be neither wages nor profit. It is frequently said that tbe object fairness to Australia, that the same of industrial legislation should be to promote peace in industry. A good deal depends on what is meant by that term. The absence of strikes and lock-outs is merely a negative ideal. It is a mistake to approach this subject merely from tbe point of view of endeavouring to avoid something, instead of trying to attain something. Industrial peace, if regarded merely as the absence of strikes and lockouts, is but accidental and precarious. Viewed only from that angle, industrial peace is not sufficient. There must be a vigorous and positive co-operation between employer and employee towards a definite object-the success of the particular industry and the well-being and contentment of tbe community generally. With that spirit in industry, there will be less difficulty in reconciling conflicting interests. Tbe extent to wbicb the Arbitration Court has adopted methods of conciliation is not generally known. In almost every case the court has first endeavoured to obtain a settlement of the dispute by conciliation. Its success in that direction is mucb greater than is generally recognized. But even conciliation presupposes under general law a potential dispute. One of the difficulties witb which we are faced in Australia is that industrial organizations are tending to become ends in themselves. That is particularly the case Mr Latham. when an organization is under the control of a few officers wbo in practice, whatever may be the position in theory, cannot be controlled by tbe members of tbe organization. Organizations of employers or employees are not ends in themselves. Tbey are only means of obtaining particular interests must take a secondary place to those of the community as a whole, upon which, after all, they and all of us depend. In Australia, unfortunately too little attention is paid to the general well being of industry. Employers' organizations and industrial unions are essentially fighting bodies. I agree that that state of affairs is, in a measure, tbe result^of the character of the legislation which the Commonwealth is compelled to introduce to deal with this subject. But it must be remembered, in position obtains in Great Britain, where also tbe employers' organizations and the unions of employees are primarily fighting bodies, though not to the same extent as in Australia. We have had before us recently the report of the industrial mission to America. Honourable members, in. reading that report, must have been struck by tbe degree of activity displayed by employers' organizations in holding conferences on business management, on busiuess methods and, generally, on business efficiency. If such conferences do take place in Australia, tbey are very rare. It appears to me that in America in this respect there is a more general recognition of the common interests of industry in success and prosperity, and a more' general recognition that industry owes a duty to the community as a whole. I should like to see such conferences between employers' organizations in Australia. Consider also what trade unions could do in helping to train and educate tbeir members. I suggest that it would not be unreasonable to expect that membership of a trade union should be a hall mark of craftsmanship-shoul d be some guarantee of efficiency-and that it should be part of the normal function of to-day a trade union, to ensure good craftsmanship amongst its members. That used to be one of the objects of trades unionism. Trade unions used to give attention to that subject, and in otber respects to tbe welfare of their members. To-day, unfortunately, most, of them consider that the scope of their activities, the whole field of wages for skilled and unskilled workers in their action, should be confined to fighting for higher wages and lower hours, and often to fighting for higher wages regardless of the money value of the wages obtained. Industrial representatives on both sides have a tendency to feel that they are not earning their money unless there is a fight afoot in wbich they are taking part. Tbere are many unions which always have a dispute in process of action or iu the list of the court, and it is obvious in some cases that union officers are afraid that if tbey have not a dispute in progress it might be thought by someone who is anxious to get their job that they are not doing their work properly. I put it to the House that it would be a good thing to let industrial representatives of both sides have something else to do than conduct industrial fights before the Arbitration Court. Let both sides meet and examine industrial conditions in Australia, with a view to removing causes of friction, and promoting efficiency. In England to-day. steps of this character are being taken as a result of tbe motions carried at the last trades union congress. We are living in an era of great competition and acute national feeling. Cartels founded on a national or international basis, and international trade unions, are being organized in increasing numbers from year to year. We in Australia cannot, under modern conditions, afford waste, and friction between employers and employees means waste. instead of complaining so frequently to Parliament, and complaining so much of parliamentary action, industry itself should take a hand in this matter, and exercise some initiative of its own. Eor example, the report of the industrial mission to America suggests that there should be a greater appreciation of the fact that industry is essentially a joint enterprise, and that, in order to promote success, tbere should be eo-operation between employers and employees. It suggests that employers and employeees might well meet together to consider a number of matters affecting tbe welfare nf industry. Tbere is, for example, the narrowness of the margin between the Australia. That is a matter wbicJi must cause many bonorable members on both sides of tbe House considerable concern. Then there is t.he question of a greater supply of power to assist labour. If we compare the power figures in Australia with those of many other countries, we shall immediately realize that there is scope for great improvement in this reaspect. Questions of organization of plant might also be discussed by employers and employees, and, I suggest, also, the advisability of appointing shop councils Al l these matters arise from what I call the American report, and I suggest that employers and employees should take steps to meet and discuss subjects of such importance. We are all proud of our Australian standard of living, but must realize that that standard can be maintained, not by words only, but by work, and that work can proceed successfully only in the absence of friction and in a spirit of goodwill. BeforeI deal in general terms with the particular proposals of the bill, it is necessary to consider more in detail tbe views of those who urge from time to time that the Arbitration Court should be abolished. The expressed opinion of some is that tbe whole system has serious defects which cannot be amended, ancl that, therefore, it sbould be ended. The Government does not, at the present time, subscribe to that view. The abolition of the court would not solve any problem; on the contrary it would create new problems without any satisfactory means at band for solving them. I suggest that, It is necessary to face tbe realities of tbe situation. At tbe present time tbe membership of the unions which are working under awards of the court, and under agreements filed in the court, is 693,000. I bave not tbe precise figures, but a tremendous number of the unionists are working under awards of the court. I use the term "" awards "" as including certified agreementsThe actual membership, 693,000, is a very large proportion of tbe industrial population of Australia. It is sometimes said that tbe court is a failure. I do not profess that it is a complete success, that it has not been, and is not now, subject to defects; but very few human institutions are a complete success. I do, however, suggest that in some cases criticism bas been most unjustly and unfairly levelled at tbe court, and that criticism itself has made the task of the court infinitely more difficult. The number of unions registered in the court is 149, and there are 27 employers' organizations. Most of those organizations are working in peace and satisfaction under tbe awards of the court. It is necessary to remember these facts because it is often alleged that Australia is a land of strikes produced by the Arbitration Court. Tbe troubles which have occurred in Australia have been practically confined to the transport, minthe forty-four hours case. I may refer to ing, and engineering industries. These troubles bave, in some cases, been serious, and the industries are so important in relation the effects have been far-reaching. But similar troubles in tbese particular industries are occurring to-day in every country of the world. A great disservice is rendered to Australia by emphasizing such troubles, and by representing Australia as a land of constant strikes. We do our own country a grave injury by exaggerating the strikes which occur. If we compare the position of Australia with that of England, we find we are very fortunate indeed in relation to strikes. We have bad no sucb upheaval as the transport strike in England in 1920, tbe general strike of 1926, or the coal strike of 1926. All these were far greater disturbances, proportionately, than any we have had in Australia s'ncc the strikes of 1890 and 1891. At the same time, let us not disguise from ourselves the fact that we have far too many strikes in Australia, and that while some of the strikes are upon real issues, sonif ni'e entirely unjustifiable from any re:;.=r>nnMe point of view. are lock-outs, not strikes. outs? lock-outs, and for a very good reason. Some gentlemen, who, again, would ordinThe Arbitration Act contains a penalty arily be regarded as supporters of the against strikes and lock-outs. If the ofGovernment, complain very bitterly of fence is proved, the penalty can be imposed. It is difficult to prove a strike against a union, but it is a relatively easy matter to prove a lock-out against an employer, and employers as all honourable members know, have been much afraid of the penalty of £1,000 against lockouts. There are 149 awards and agreements filed in the court. Under most of tbese, industry is working peacefully and, on the whole, satisfactorily. Sometimes those wbo are opposed to tbe court criticize it upon matters witb wbich it has nothing, or very little, to do. Take the criticism of those wbo are, in general, political supporters of the Government-criticis m directed against the decision of the court in that as an example of just tbe sort of thing that ought not to take place. When that decision was given, a long statement to other industries that appeared in the press putting the employers' point of view. I do not for one moment suggest that the decisions of the Arbitration Court are to be removed from comment or criticism, but I do say that that criticism should be fair, reserved and restrained. It should be remembered all tbe timej that the court is an impartial tribunal wbich has no object to serve other than to do its best in very difficult circumstances. That criticism by employers created a most difficult atmosphere. Later, as a result of the fortyfour hours case, an award was made for what I may refer to generally as piecework. Then tbe otber side began its criticism and some of this criticism was couched in almost abusive language. Tbat is just the sort of thing that ought not to happen, I bave no desire to refer even indirectly to tbe merits of tbe forty-four hours case, but on the facts I would point out that before the decision in that case was given, a forty-four hour week was the rule in Queensland. It was also largely the rule in New South Wales and Western Australia, and in many inmembers, who refer to the Arbitration Court as having in some way brought forty-four hours week ought, in tbe first",22,Second Reading

I do not think that there is an award of the Gommonwealth Arbitration Court to-day that orders preference to unionists. Waere there is such a preference, whether it be right or wrong--and again I am dealing only with facts, and not with the merits of the case-it exists sometimes under determinations or awards of State tribunals, and, in other cases, as a result of the strength of the unions themselves. It is a mistake to think that the abolifor its members in order to obtain the tion of the court would lead to the abolition of the system of industrial regulation. There are unfortunately, some employers-ver y who think that if the Arbitration Court were abolished they would be perfectly free to do what they liked at least in' agreement witb tbeir employees. They forget tliat apart from the strength of trade unionism, the State industrial laws would continue to operate. Some people think that the difficulties associated parties will recognize that their real inwith this problem are created by the legislature. To a small extent only that may be true, but tbe big difficulties arise from the complexity of the facts. The industrial problem is one of the most complex in the world, because it involves the interests, desires, and aspirations, the daily life, and the livelihood of the people, and there can be no simple solution of it. It is impossible to produce complete satisfaction in industry, either with or without legal regulation, but there is one condition upon which the continuance of the arbitration system depends, and that is tbe general principle that those wbo appeal to the arbitrator must observe bis awards that those who seek the benefits conferred by tbe court must be prepared to work under its awards. They must not take arbitration when it suits them and resort to direct action when that seems more likely to give them what they want. The result of allowing such action would be to engender disrespect for the law, and that would have very evil effects upon the community as a whole. Appeals have been made to the Government to end the system instead of amending it. Tbis bill is the Government's reply to such appeals. Tbe Government is not prepared to submit indefinitely to the flouting of awards by those who have sought them. If those who bave applied to. the Arbitration Court are not prepared to abide by its awards the Government holds itself free to take proper steps under existing legislation, or by introducing fresh legislation if necessary, to deprive them of the benefits of those awards. Acceptance of the benefits of awards implies a corresponding responsibility. A union, for example, which claims to bave authority to speak benefits of arbitration, must be treated as having authority to control is members so as to assist in the continuity of few I believeindustry. There is a positive obligation to the community resting on both sides to keep industry going. If it is found that organized industry on either side is not ready to recognize this obligation, the Government will bave to re-consider whether it is desirable to maintain tbe system. It is hoped, therefore, that all terests lie in the stability and security which obedience to the law creates. I come now to tbe specific proposals in the bill. Before it was finally drafted, many scores of suggestions were received from both sides of industry and from the genera] public. All have been carefully considered. It was impossible to adopt some on account of the constitutional limitations, subject to which this Parliament operates. Others were considered unwise and for that reason were rejected; others were adopted, and the Government bas added other proposals which were not suggested from any outside source. I propose to deal with the proposals in general terms under the following main headings:1. Prevention of overlapping between Pederal and State tribunals. 2. The necessity for correlating the awards of the court with economic realities. 3 Development of a system of voluntary arbitration as distinguished from compulsory arbitration. 4. The further application of the principle of conciliation. 5. Certain important improvements in procedure. 6. The responsibility of organizations for the conduct of their officers and members and for the general observance of awards. 7. Pro visions relating to the rules of an organization, the audit of its power now? accounts, and similar matters. S.

83,Mr Latham,"This bill accords morethan any other legislation passed by this Parliament. I appeal to honourable members not to say on every possible occasion that there is, and can be, no goodwill. Every bonorable member is entitled to bis own opinion, but the constant reiteration of tbe statement that there is no such thing as goodwill will make goodwill impossible. I am not suggesting that tbe honourable member for Wannon has ever made so general a statement, but his interfied. They then have an opportunity to jection gives me the opportunity to make this observation. The scheme of conciliation committees is based upon the principle of the round table instead of legal procedure. It also develops the idea of preventing disputes before they happen, instead of settling them 'after they have happened. We have constitutional power to utilize conciliation and arbitration for tbe prevention as well as for the settlement of industrial disputes, and I have always been of the opinion that the power to prevent industrial disputes by this means bas not been sufficiently utilized. The law, in the past, has dwelt too much upon the subject of the settlement of disputes as distinct from their prevention. This provision is an invitation to the parties to utilize this procedure before the stage of actual dispute is reached. The clause provides briefly, that in order to prevent or to settle indusrecommend the terms of an agreement? trial disputes, the Chief Judge may appoint conciliation committees consisting of a chairman appointed by bim. who may be a conciliation commissioner, and of an equal number of representatives, on both sides. Before appointing representatives of both sides the Chief Judge is required to take into consideration any recommendations made by the employers or organization of employees. It is not provided that tbese representatives shall be elected. I am afraid that if provision were made for the election of representatives the scheme would fall under its own weight. This is an Australian, not a State act, v and effective provisions for a real election of representatives by an organization would break down in practice. Wben a conciliation committee has been appointed and has met it may arrive at an agreement, and if an agreement is reached, it can be certified under section 24 of the act. But what will happen if an agreement is not reached? The clause provides that in that event the conciliation committee or a majority of tbe committee may recommend tbe terms of an award. Tbe procedure wbich then follows is this: Those concerned are served with a notice requiring them to show cause why an award should not be made in the terms speciappear before the judge and show cause why an award should not be made in the terms specified, and the judge may make an award in those terms or in any other terms that he thinks fit. The section alst. provides that in the notice requiring the parties to show cause the judge Vuinself may make a variation or modification for the consideration of the parties. The result of this procedure, so far as I bave outlined it, is that a great many of the matters wbich are not controversial ought to be adjusted between the parties without going into tbe court at all. This will obviate lengthy hearings. In many instances agreement should be reached; in others the matter will have to be left to the decision of the court. not come to an agreement, how can it that a majority may recommend terms. If both parties are going to be adamant and simply preserve a spirit of fight and hostility, it will, of course, be difficult to work many of these provisions. I can see that possibility, but I hope that industry in Australia generally will recognize that there is upon it a responsibility wbich is owed to the community as a whole. I think that honourable members will admit that I have, tbroughout my remarks, spoken of both sides, and the obligation resting on both sides in industry. This clause further provides for what is called a representative order, which I propose to deal with under tbe next heading. I call attention to tbe fact that it is proposed that only the chairman of the conciliation committee shall be paid. It is suggested that the two sides in industry may well find their own representatives, and pay them, if thsy",30,Second Reading

We have a great hope that this procedure, if utilized in good will and good faith, will greatly assist in promotmatter, it may make a representative ing peace and harmony. In these provisions the Parliament is asked to go to the very limit of its constitutional powers. provisions for a representative order, which I shall refer to in detail in a few moments, are in my opinion within the constitutional powers of Parliament. I do not give that opinion dogmatically, because I am aware that tbere is room for argument on the otber side; but my view is the provisions are within our constitutional power. There is also a short reference to the method of conciliation which I hope will be most useful in practice. In awards of the court, it is possible for the court to appoint-and tbe power has frequently been exercised-board s of reference, which may deal with matters specified or referred to in the awards as suitable for determination by boards of reference. It is proposed that these boards, wbich represent employers and employees, and which usually sit under the chairmanship of the Industrial Registrar, shall also have power to deal witb any matter wbich may affect the amicable relations of the parties with reference to an award. Tbat is one of tbe many suggestions made by the' trade unions of Australia, with whom I have been in consultation on this general subject. I have redrafted the proposal as originally submitted; but I welcome it, indeed, and it has been incorporated in the bill in this form. Here we bave another avenue of conciliation-anothe r opportunity for the recognition of a common interest, and for friendship to operate. That, after all, is what we need more than anything else. I now come to my fifth heading, ""Improvements in Procedure "". I refer first Mr Latham. to the provision for a representative order, which, is in clause 16, and is also embodied in the provisions relating to conciliation in clause 28. This is -tb e procedure in a Court of Equitywhich permits the representation by It is therefore, the single parties of large numbers of persons having a common interest. Provision is accordingly made that where it appears to tbe court that there are numerous persons having the same interests in any order. That order appoints persons as representative respondents. It is further provided that the representative order shall be published forthwith in the The Gazette, so that there will appear in the Gazette a complete list of the persons sought, to be affected by any of the proceedings. The clause goes on to provide that any documents, &c, served upon the representative respondents shall be deemed to have been served upon all of tbem, and that any order made shall bind all of them. Tbere is also a provision that any person objecting to be represented by tbe representative respondents may apply to tbe court, and may obtain an order to be represented separately or by some suitable respondent. near to it as we can under present legislation. I bave already said that in my opinion tbe legislation now proposed is within the powers of this Parliament. Tbis procedure will result in a great saving of expense. It will not, under the ordinary' procedure, dispense with the service of a log, although the conciliation procedure, wbicb I trust will successfully run the gauntlet of any litigious risks to which it may be exposed-and I hope that tbere will be none-save s practically tbe whole cost of service of everything after the log. In any event, therefore, it will save a great deal of money. Clause 21 gives power to make a provisional or interim award about which there has been doubt. Clause 23 deals with a matter upon which there will be an acute difference of opinion, that of the appearance of lawyers in court.' At the present time counsel, solicitors and paid agents may appear by consent of both sides. Some-",31,Second Reading
86,Mr Latham,"No; but we get astimos that consent is given, sometimes it is not. The amendment is that they may appear by leave of the court, as an alternative to the consent of both parties. The present position as to lawyers and paid agents in court is simply hypocritical. It is a mere pretence. The act as it stands provides that lawyers and paid agents shall not appear. But what happens? Three or four things may occur. Let me briefly mention some of tbem. A lawyer is made a director of a company, and then, being an employee of that company, he may appeal in court. A union secretary who is quite properly paid for his work, may spend practically his whole time in the court. He is a member of the organization concerned, and therefore is not technically a paid agent. Again, a gentleman seeing an opportunity to practise in the court goes through a complete legal education, but abstains from being admitted^ to the profession. Not having been admitted, lie can practise in the court. This is being done at tbe present time. A man who bas been struck off the roll of barristers and solicitors for misconduct would be able to practise; but be could not practise so long as be was on the roll. Surely the position is so ludicrous that it cannot commend itself to common sense. unionists. at least gives a guarantee of a certain ally desired, I think, by both sides. It amount of training, which is some guarwill involve some expense. The inspecantee of efficiency. Tbe proceedings tors will have to be paid, but there is in this court are more important than provision for making arrangements with ordinary proceedings in civil and criminal the States for the employment of State courts.

Tbe Deputy President ( Sir John Quick) who Government, however, bas not gone so is at the present time hearing tbe railway far as that, and tbe suggestion is that procase. fessional men or paid agents shall be year tbe Governor General was authoallowed to appear by consent of all rized to empower him to continue tbe parties, or by the leave of the court. That leaves the matter in the bands of the court. Clause 41 provides for the policing of awards by Commonwealth officers. It provides for the appointment of inspectors to secure tbe observance of the act and the awards. I do not like referring to my own speeches; but three or four years ago, I submitted tbe only motion that I ever moved as a private member of this House. It declared in effect that it was tbe duty of tbe Commonwealth to provide for the administration and enforcement of the legislation that it passed. I then submitted to tbe House that the Parliament would not discharge its duties if it passed a measure, put it on tbe statute-book, and then said to it, as it were, "" Off you go, work yourself."" Our acts must be administered. It is our duty to see that tbeir provisions are observed. Tbe Government of tbe day did not allow a decision to be reached on that motion. The volume of urgent public business was much too great to allow private members to occupy tbe time of the House. However, I expressed my views on that occasion, and now I bave an opportunity of giving effect to them. It is proper as a matter of principle that Parliament should see that its acts are observeda member of the Government.

Union ancl the salaried and professional officers asked that as Sir John Quick was dealing with the general subject of tbe railways, be should deal with these matters as well as the whole question. This legislation does not prejudice the position of any honourable member in relation to the general question of how far a federal court should have anything to do witb State railways. It simply recognizes the fact that as his Honor Deputy President Sir John Quick is dealing with the railway position he should deal with it as a whole instead of leaving subsidiary points for another judge who would bave to spend a long time in making himself familiar with railway conditions. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. bill with which I propose next to deal is what I call No. 6-the responsibilities of organizations, and the control of organizations by their own members. Registered organizations are given great privileges by tbe Arbitration Act. Those privileges should be accompanied by a sense of responsibility, and in many instances that responsibility is recognized. It may be easier for bonorable members to follow me if I use the word "" union "" instead of "" organization."" The Arbitration Act makes a registered organization or union a corporation. Such a union can be liable and responsible only if it is made responsible for the acts of its officers and members. A. union exists only as an artificial legal person and is something apart from the actual human persons who constitute its officers and members. Accordingly, unless a union is made responsible for the acts of its officers and members, it is not liable at all. Objections have sometimes been raised to tbe provisions which already exist in the act making a union liable for the acts of its officers and subject to a penalty if they break the law. But unless that were the law, there would be no liability at all on a union, because a union can act only through its officers. It follows that if a union is liable for tbe acts of its officers, the members must have real and effective control over those officers. Frequently that is not the case to-day. Having reBoth tbe Railways gard to the important position wbicb trade unions occupy in our national life, and to the powers possessed or assumed by their officers, it is necessary to make provision to govern these matters. Wben a vigilance officer of a union bolds up a mail steamer, it is natural that some inquiry should be made into the source of his power and the extent to which he really represents the members of bis organization wben he does the particular act in question. The bill contains a number of provisions to deal witb these matters. I invite attention first to clauses 4 and 5, which deal with the penalties now provided for strikes and lock-outs. The penalty at present provided is £1,000 in all cases. The Government considers that that amount is unreasonable in the case of an individual person. It therefore proposes to amend tbe act by providing that the penalty shall be £1,000 in tbe case of an organization or employer and £50 in respect of any other person. It is a mistake to provide penalties which cannot be* recovered or which are out of proportion to the gravity of tbe offence. Clause6 provides that where the court is satisfied that bona fide efforts have been made by members of the committee of management of an organization or its officers to prevent tbe commission of an offence, that fact shall be taken into consideration in fixing the penalty. It may be urged that it is unfair to make an organization responsible for tbe acts of an irresponsible officer. I do not accept that proposition. An organization.ought not to have an irresponsible officer; or. if it has, it ought to remove him. The bill contains provisions whereby a union may remove an irresponsible officer. Nevertheless, there is much to be said for tbe proposition that if bona fide efforts have been made to prevent the commission of an offence that fact sbould be taken into consideration in fixing the penalty. Tbat provision is included in clause 6. Tbe provisions of the existing act as to strike .penalties bave been ineffective in preventing strikes Honourable members are familiar with published announcements intimating that,",33,Second Reading
91,Mr Latham,"The feature of theunless something is done, there will be a strike. in the press reports of a union meeting in which the demands of the union are set out, ending with a threat to strike unless those demands are conceded. Later, we read the actual resolution authorizing the strike. After that the strike actually takes place. That has often happened in Australia. Yet it is impossible to impose penalties, because there is no legal evidence that these things have happened. Press reports are not evidence, and cannot be made evidence. Every one may know what has happened, but no one may be prepared to come forward and give evidence. In some cases it would be impossible for any one to do so with safety. Accordingly the penalties for strikes have been largely ineffective. In a very few instances they have been enforced; but in others, although the facts are notorious, it has been impossible to obtain legal evidence on which to secure a conviction. Tbe existing remedies as to lockouts are mucb more effective than the remedies against strikes. In the case of a lockout there is a defined individual-the quently has a great deal to lose if a conviction for a lockout is recorded against him. It is very difficult to deal witb these and lockouts in order that in cases matters under the existing law. result is that some unions operate deliberately upon the policy of the double chance. They rely on arbitration wben it suits them to do so, and they strike when arbitration does not suit tbem, knowing that they are reasonably safe in so doing. Eveni f tbere is a strike in a portion of an employer's establishment, the employer is not at liberty to lock out the men in the rest of his works. Take the engineers' strike in Sydney recently. That was definitely declared as a strike; there was no question of its being a lockout. Three firms or. companies were involved. tional strike was applied. Tbat policy consists of attacking and beating employers in detail, thus ultimately securing by means of direct action what tbe court has refused to order by award. If , in sucb a case, an employer were to lock out the members of the union engaged in otlier portions of his work-shop, a solution would in many cases readily be reached; We frequently read but under tbe existing law that cannot be done. The position in connection with tbe engineers' strike in Sydney was that tbe other employers were unable to support tbe firms or companies against wbich tbe strike was directed, though tbe only complaint against tbem was that they were seeking to work under an award of the Arbitration Court, while on the other hand the union was supporting its members who were on strike, although it was impossible to prove by legally admissible evidence that it was doing so. Clause7 is designed to deal with such a case. The clause enables either of the parties to an award to apply to the court for an order declaring that a strike or lockout exists. The court may or may no make that order, accordr ing to the circumstances of the case. Let us suppose that the court does make sueh an order, ancl declares that there is a strike in an industry. Other employers in the industry will then be at liberty to lock out their employees. Similarly, if there is a lockout in a portion of an industry, the organization of employees may apply for a declaration that a lockout exists. If that employer-wh o fredeclaration is made, the union will then be at liberty to strike. The clause modifies the absolute prohibition of strikes Tbe where a contest upon the legal plsne is not an effective and proper method of dealing with the difficulty, the hands of one party to the dispute, who is obeying tbe law, shall not be tied while the other party is breaking the law. It is thought that tbe clause will provide an effective remedy in certain cases Clause8 reproduces in an improved and clearer form the original provisions of section S dealing with the responsibility of an organization for the acts of its ofBcers ancl members. It contains also a new provision in sub-sections 3 and 4 proThe policy of a secviding that an organization may reduce itsliability from £1,000 to £100 if it exercises tbe power conferred upon it of expelling tbe officers or members whose acts have exposed it to the penalty. Should a union be fined because of tbe act of an officer or member, tbe penalty will be, as at present, £1,000 if the officer is retained; but if he is expelled it will be only £100. Subclause 4 provides that an expelled officer may not be reinstated tbe next day. If he. is reinstated within twelve months of his expulsion the penalty is £1,000. This provision makes it possible for a bona fide union, which bas been misled by an officer into a breach of the law, to rid itself of that responsibility to the extent that I have mentioned. that a union may, after giving a member fair notice, expel or suspend bim if he has committed a breach of an act or an award. That section gives a union power over its officers and members, and places on the union the responsibility for controlling their acts. It will, therefore, no longer be possible for a union to say that it is unable to control its members, because it will in future be able to control its membership. Tbat is a proper provision where an organization of its own free will seeks to obtain the benefit of the Arbitation Act. for a member being expelled from tbe union or only from his office in the union? an expelled member make a living? dustry or iu some other industry. There is also provision for a nappeal to tbe court in the case of a member wrongfully expelled from a union. a member of a union is acting contrary to the decisions of a committee of management, that committee will have power to expel bim from the union after be bas had a fair opportunity to place bis case before tbe committee. Tbe principle of making a union responsible for its members-the only method of making tbe act effective-is introduced and enforced in a manner wbich is entirely proper. I shall not take up the time of tbe House by referring to matters of minor importance contained in the bill. Honourable members will understand that I am mentioning only its main principles. direct attention to clause 10. [Extension of time granted.] Clause 10 makes an organization liable to the extent of £50 for strikes and lockout penalties imposed on any officer of the organization. Provision is made that the organization is to be heard before being ordered to pay the amount of a fine in such a case. In several places, where in tbe existing act power is given for the taking of strong action, I bave included a provision that tbe person affected shall have an opportunity of being beard. Clause 27 provides that a judge may order any orSection 50 provides ganization submitting an industrial dispute to tbe court to give security by way of bond, or a deposit of cash, for the observance of an award or for the carrying out of any order tbe court may make. Sucb a bond may be enforced in tbe Arbitration Court, or in other courts. I know that some honourable members think that there ought to be a provision that a bond sbould always be provided. In this bill, however, it is left to tbe discretion of tbe judge to determine whether the bond shall be given or not, and it is provided that tbere must be a surety to tbe bond, so that when a bond is ordered it will be something real. Under clause 32 specific provision is made for the cancellation of an award. The existing law is that tbere is power in tbe court to order a variation of an award, and a cancellation is effected by varying the term of tbe award. Tbat is an indirect method of securing this object, and now there are express provisions in the bill dealing witb the subject. An award may be cancelled if an organization bas done anything in tbe nature of a lockout or strike, or has committed any other breach or non-observance of an act or award; and further, an award may be cancelled if it is shown that any number of members of an organization sufficiently large to form a substantial part of the organization refuses to accept employment either at all, or in accordance with existing orders or awards. In otber words, if members of an organization are not prepared to work in accordance with tbe terms of an award, tbey can have no just objection to its cancellation, and it is better that it sbould be cancelled than that it sbould stand on tbe statuteI book, a simulacrum and a pretence.

I have myself, from a particular angle, bad a good deal of experience of industrial disputes. My experience is particularly connected with the stage wben trouble arises. I remember on one occasion when the Seamen's Union was before tbe court; it was sworn that the union was observing' tbe award, and were in order in all particulars. facts were tbese: The union was insisting on selecting crews for vessels, but tbere was no overt act showing that this was tbe case. When, however, a man went on to a vessel, baving been picked up in tbe ordinary way, the representative of the union asked h i m at a suitable moment where was bis ticket. If be bad a blue ticket be was all r i g h t ; if he did not have a blue the rest of tbe men the ship. rules about it ; there was no authority in writin g to which any one could point to show that the vigilance officer wbo issued these tickets was acting w it h tbe authority of the union; but that was what happened. There is a means of keeping the award to tbe letter, and breaking it in the spirit, and in reality, although the breach cannot be proved. An attempt has been made to deal with that position which I have referred. The clause f u r celled if any number of members of an organization, sufficiently large to form a substantial part of the organization, refuses to accept employment either at all or in accordance with existing orders or awards. ' This w ill be of great protection to the members of unions. I do not know whether a practice sucb as I have referred to w ill be defended by any one in this House. Such a practice means that a man's chance of earning a livin g depends on tbe w ill of one individual, and that neglected to exercise these individual is not, in practice, controlled in his actions by members of the union. of insisting upon Tbis bill is designed to protect tbe awards of the Arbitration Court, and l i m it tbe power of tbe union if tyrannically exercised in opposition to any award. Clause 48 also defines tbe effect of the deregistration of a union. In the past, the effect of deregistration has been very obscure. Tbe union is made a corporation by tbe Arbitration Act, and when deregistered, it is, apparently, still a corporation, but its actual status is most difficult to determine. Accordingly, provision is made that the court, upon deregistration, may wind up an organization, pay its debts, and distribute the property among its members, or vest the affidavits the property in a new voluntary organiTbe zation consisting of tbe previous members. Thus provisions similar to those relating to the dissolution of companies are provided for tbe dissolution of these corporations. NowI come to the subject of the rules of a registered union. Clause 43 adopts, w i th some slight modification, tbe present schedule to the act, wbich stipulates that certain matters must bi? provided for in tbe rules of tbe union. ticket Clause 47 provides that no alteration of walked off the rules of an organization shall be made Tbere was nothing in the unless tbe alteration is approved by a vote of tbe members of the organization, and it makes provision for taking a secret ballot upon alterations of rules. Tbe court is given power to disallow any rule which in tbe opinion of the court(a) is contrary to law, or to an order or award; (6) is tyrannical or oppressive; (c) prevents or hinders members of the organization from observing the law or the provisions of an order or award; or (d) imposes unreasonable conditions upon the membership of any member or upon any applicant for membership. That provision is founded upon the principle that if an organization obtains registration under this act for tbe purpose of getting an'award, it is not to have anything in its rules inconsistent with the award made. If an award orders piece-work, any rule prohibiting piecework, or imposing penalties upon men who do piece-work, is invalid, and may be disallowed, and tbe presence of sucb a rule may be a ground for tbe deregistration of tbe union. option is offered to the union. likes tbe conditions prescribed by the cour! it can observe tbem; if it does not, it runs the risk of being put out. There is also provision in clause 51 that certain records of membership, aud information relating to tbe funds of tbe union, shall be filed in the court. They must be filed annually, and provision is made for the auditing of accounts of a registered organization. The organization may appoint its own auditor, provided he is duly qualified. auditor is provided, there is power to appoint one. Clause 49 cancels section 61 of the act, wbicb provides that during the pendency of any dispute or. matter before tbe court, no resignation from the membership of a union shall have any effect. Tbat is to say, if a member once joins a union, be is bound to it so long as there is a dispute or matter pending before a court. He cannot resign, and he must pay bis dues. He can be sued for tbem whatever work be is doing, or wherever he may be. know of a case in wbich a man belonged to two different unions, one in the industry in which be was then working, and another in the industry in which he had previously been engaged. He had no desire to have anything to do witb the first union, but this union always had a dispute before the court, and he could not resign from it though he no longer had any concern with it or its affairs, the act, and this section of tbe bill repeals it. I come now to the question of the secret ballot. unions that are so organized that the officers have complete control. Without any order by the court granting preference, the unions are sufficiently Mr Latham. strong to enforce it. The result is that, in many cases, a man cannot work if be quarrels witb the secretary, the organizer or tbe vigilance oflicer. If members of unions are prepared to submit to this form of tyranny, well and good, but tbey sbould be afforded an opportunity of releasing themselves from it, and the bill proposes to give tbem that opportunity. Tbe members of any organization are entitled to have real and effective control, and not merely nominal control, over tbe election of officers, and the policy of tbe association. One of the main securities of our political life is the Therefore, an secrecy of the ballot. It enables all men If it to express tbeir minds without fear, and the time bas come for the introduction into industrial life of tbe same principle. Clause 44 accordingly provides"" 56A. Any ten members of an organization may, when any vote is taken or about to be taken in any election of the committee or officers of the organization or of a branch tliereof or in respect of any resolution pro. posed for adoption by the organization or the branch, as the case may be, demand, either verbally or in writing, that tlie vote be taken If no by secret ballot and the vote shall thereupon be so taken accordingly."" It may be asked, ""j£.t is all very well to say in an act of Parliament that a secret ballot shall be taken, but what if it is not taken ?"" Proposed section 56s. provides that if after a demand for a secret ballot bas been made a ballot is not taken, tbe court may give directions for the conduct of a secret ballot under the control of an officer of tbe court with or without provision for absent voting. In any provision for a I ballot it is essential to arrange also for its control. Such matters as tbe election of scrutineers, for example, will be within tbe power of the court. We have bad experience of so-called secret ballots, tbe efficiency of which would have been greater if they had been honestly controlled, I am reminded of "" Mr Dooley's"" account to Mr Hennessy of bis conversation with President Kruger about giving tbe franchise to the Uitlanders. The President was reported as saying in effect, "" I mayn't be very good lookin' and may be there are marks of food on me Tbere are some vest, but I'm not more than half crazy, and when you find me givin' the Uitlanders a chance of votin' me into a permanent job as ex-president, ye may conclude that your Uncle Paul needs a guardian."" Mr Hennessy asked, "" Dooley, what would ye do, would ye give iiiem a vote ?"" "" SureI would,"" said Mr Dooley, "" but I'd do the countin'."" The bill provides that the court shall be able to control the conduct of a poll. Proposed section 56c deals with another form of application for a secret ballot. It is all very well to protheir responsibility. This bill, if apvide that the men may demand a secret ballot, but in many unions such a demand would require a lot of courage; in some unions it would not be made, because of terrorization by a militant minority. Accordingly it is enacted that there may be a secret application for a secret ballot. Any ten or more members of a union may apply to the Registrar in writing for a direction that a secret ballot on a particular question be taken. The Registrar is prohibited from disclosing the names of the applicants to any person otber than a judge. The judge, if satisfied that ten applicants are members of tbe organization and that the application is bona fide and relates to a matter of substantial importance, may give directions for a secret ballot under control of an officer of the court with or without provision for absent voting. Under proposed section 56D. tbe court may of its own volition order a secret ballot in relation to any matter in a dispute upon which it thinks it desirable that the opinion of the organization should be obtained. It is further provided that if complaint is made to the court that a secret ballot, bas not been fairly held, the court may make an order for the holding of another secret ballot under tbe control of an officer of 56F creates offences for obstructing tbe taking of a ballot, for counselling any person to abstain from voting, for preventing any person from voting, and, in the case of an officer of the union for refusing to make available to the returning officer tbe register or membership list of tbe organization. These provisions are in pursuance of a definite undertaking given by the Prime Minister in bis policy speech at the last general election. They constitute a faithful performance of that promise, and will be welcomed not only by the people of Australia as a c whole, but by hundreds of thousands of trade unionists who want to control their own affairs. They are entitled to have tbe control of tbfiir organizations restored to tbem; they have not got that now. If they do not wish to control their own affairs they need not use tbese provisions. The opportunity of self-government is given to them; the rest remains with themselves. If they are not prepared to govern themselves that will be proved by the House, will at least give them the opportunity. The final provisions of the bill are directed to protecting the court and securing the observance of awards. Clause 54 makes it an offence to create a disturbance in or near a court. Tbere is no objection to persons interested in a case attending the court in any numbers, but if tbere is any disturbance' outside or near tbe court or demonstrations for the purpose of influencing the court it can be dealt with under this clause. Proposed section 86A providesNo person shall(a) by violence to the person or property of another person; (6) by any threats; (c) by any pecuniary penalty or in j u r y ; (d) by intimidation of any kind of whomsoever directed; (c) by abusive or insulting language; (/) by declaring or joining with .other persons in declaring goods or places or persons or undertakings or positions ' black ' ; or (g) by any other form of boycott or threat of boycott, prevent, or endeavour to prevent, any person from offering or accepting employment or working in accordance with the terms of an award or order of the court. the court. Proposed section The immediate comment upon the provision relating to black-listing is that some highly intelligent person will evade tbe law by declaring goods white or yellow. Accordingly the section prohibits "" any otber form of boycott or threat of boycott."" This often irresponsible practice of declaring things black is an evil that must be dealt with. The unions themselves know that it is an evil, but some of tbeir subordinate officers have got beyond tbeir control. Proposed section 86B requires an organization to abstain from imposing any penalties on members, because they are working in accordance witb an award. We should not for a moment tolerate a state of affairs wbicb permits a man to be exposed to a. penalty simply because be is prepared to work in accordance with an award made by the court at the instance of the organization of which he is a memresolve itself in to C o m m it t e e of S u p p l y ber. abusive ana insulting resolutions which have become mucb too common in the proceedings of a few unions.

98,Debate On Motion (By Mr Chablton),,40,Pratten Martin Ministe R
99,Parliament On Motion (By Mr Pbatten ),"This amendment is the considered proposal ' of the Government in regard to the difficult subject of timber duties. It covers and amends three items out of the fifteen items of timber duties in the schedule. It will be noticed that the proposals' of the Government affect Oregon .or similar pine from practically the same geographical area, and the increased duty on the three items affected is 4s. per 100 super, feet in the rough. There is also a consequential increased duty on dressed timber, to prevent tbe anomaly of dressed oregon being imported under a lower duty than that for rough oregon. It is also proposed to admit oregon free for mining purposes, and a further exception is made in respect of redwood and Baltic timber. ""We bave bad a long and protracted inquiry into timber duties, which I believe started in 1925. It has been arduous, and perbaps costly, to tbe parties concerned; and the Government has now endeavoured to reach some finality in this item, which is more intricate and certainly more complicated in its various phases than almost any otber item in tbe tariff. The first report of the Tariff Board upon timber suggested only a few minor alterations to the duties, and its recommendations were not accepted by the Government. A copy of that report was tabled and printed, I believe, during last Parliament. On tbe application of the timber interests, a furthe duties proposed by tbe Government ther inquiry was held, and as a result another report was submitted by tbe Tariff Board to the Government, and a copy of that report has already been placed in honourable members' hands. The board recommended increases in some of tbe timber duties. Tbe Government, after carefully considering this report, has now submitted its proposals to honourable members. differ from the schedule ? ferent in essence, but tbey include a further item of dressed timber in order to prevent rough timber from being imported under a higher duty than that on dressed timber, Tbe proposals also cover certain pines, spruces, and firs wbich may be imported from the same geographical locality in substitution for oregon. Many [121] people are interested in timber. It is in' general use by sawmillers, importers, merchants, case-makers, fruit-growers, house-builders, house-owners, and furniture-makers. The Government bas decided not to alter the incidence of the tariff on timber for case-making, as that has a vital bearing upon the packing and marketing of primary products. These proposals affect only three main items of scantlings that are in every-day use. Another complication of the industry is that different conditions prevail i u n^l tbe States. Tbere is admittedly a shortage of softwood timber in Australia. Queensland supplies a great deal, but unfortunately the Government of that State has lessened tbe consumption of the Queensland pine by increasing tbe royalties on it. vernment has now given an assurance that tbe royalty will be reduced. lia, weatherboard bouses are principally built of hardwood and tbey are very satisfactory. Although they may cost a little more in labour, they last a good deal longer, and are perhaps the cheaper proposition in the long run. South Australia has not very mucb timber; so that affect to tbe greatest extent, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. The Government's desire has been, if it interferes witb timber duties at all, to benefit the industry, and so we have concentrated upon the three lines set out in the amendment in order to give a maximum benefit to Australian sawmillers with a minimum of disturbance within the industry. Oregon is the biggest line of importations, and tbese duties are intended to enable Australian saw-millers to increase the sale of tbeir products at the expense of imported soft woods. I bave already said that this amendment aims at preventing the substitution for oregon of similar timbers, and thereby avoiding increased duties. We bave rectified the obvious anomaly of rough timber being imported under a higher duty than that for dressed timber. In submitting these proposals the Government realizes that there may be a considerable divergence of opinion on them,",40,Pratten Martin Ministe R

It was thought by the Governpetitor with many of our Australian ment to be undesirable to increase the price of baltic timber, wbich is largely used for the floorings and linings of working men's bouses. The proposed duties only affect oregon or similar pine from the same geographical area, and if the proposals of the Government are passed by the committee, we think that the duties will give the maximum benefit to the Australian saw-millers with a minimum of disturbance within tbe industry. amendment that has been tabled by the Minister is certainly some improvement on tbe schedule as originally tabled, but it falls short of what should be done; and I suggest to the Minister, that having gone so far be might easily have extended further tbe protection' to this industry. Take the amendment that bas been tabled. As was pointed out during tbe general debate, if oregon only were specified in tbe item, other timbers would be substituted for it, and thus escape the increased duty. added hemlock, spruce, fir and pine, and excepted redwood and baltic. Tbe importation of baltic timber is not so important as that of undressed Japanese oak and Pacific maple. Japanese oak is a hardwood, and it competes with our beautiful Australian hardwoods, including Tasmanian oak and blaekwood. pointed out in tbe general debate, the timber imports from Japan during the five years from 1921 to 1926 increased by 2,290,000 super feet. But tbe value decreased by £40,000, due entirely to the cheap labour of Japan. Surely we sbould take a national pride in our timber industry. I do not know whether I am a faddist about our beautiful timbers, but I think that it is a calamity to import Japan, instead of putting into our furniture our own timbers which are unexcelled elsewhere. We should use our own timbers also to benefit our commerce and industry. We should keep Australians employed by using our own timbers, and I submit to the Minister that Japanese oak and Pacific maple sbould be included in tbe first item of tbe amendment. Item 291 (1) ""timber, dressed"" should I have no wish to evade include baltic wbicb is a serious comwoods. The Government is imposing afairly heavy protection on 30 per cent, of the sawmillers' output, but is not adequately protecting the remaining 70 per cent., which consists of dressed timbers. The Minister has said that if we increase the duty on dressed baltic timber, tbe cost of workmen's homes in wbich it is used would be increased, and that cannot be disputed. I have, however, worked out from the specification of a standard house the quantity of timberassuming the builder to use imported timber-tba t would be needed in a five-roomed bouse erected by the State Savings Bank of Victoria, and I find that the added cost would not exceed £7. As such a house would last a lifetime the additional cost is very small. Australian workers have to pay higher prices on quite a number of commodities in order to assist in the establishment of Australian industries. It frequently happens that when tbere is no local industry to compete wilh overseas industries prices Now the Minister has are high, and at times our industries bave to reduce the prices of their products in order to combat foreign competition. by tbe honourable member represent increased duty?

Japanese try would, if agreed to, assist in placing the Australian' industry on a firm basis.

Tbey realize that it' is essential to bave tbe industry in operation in their own country, so that they may obtain employment ai wages which will enable tbem to meet the higher cost of living. concessions on many other items. removed some anomalies. I urge that Japanese oak and Pacific maple, which is competing with many of our beautiful timbers, should also be included in tbe amendment. This would encourage tbe use of Australian timber, and demonstrate its beauty and efficiency. In going through the forests in the constituency represented by tbe Postmaster General( Mr Gibson) I bave seen tbe remains of beautiful blaekwood trees which have been burned down by tbe early settlers. considered tbe best firewood. and blackwoods in tbe Otway forest burn very easily. through tbe forest the good trees are destroyed and tbe inferior ones are left. For tbe reasons I have mentioned, I trust that the Minister will include Japanese oak and Pacific maple in item 291 L, which are seriously competing witb Australian blaekwood. spoke on tbe general debate I directed the attention of the Government to tbe anomalies in the schedule, some of which will be removed if the amendment submitted by tbe Minister is agreed to. I agree witb tbe Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin) that tbe Government's proposals are not of mucb value to tbe timber industry. Dressed timber from the Baltic is a serious competitor with Australian timbers, as also are Japanese oak and Pacific maple. tAs the Minister has included dressed' timbers from tbe Pacific coast, I cannot understand wby be has not also included oak, wbicb is cut and carried by cheap labour, is a serious competitor witb Australian timbers used in furniture and furnishings. Tbe proposed increases in the schedule are not likely to be of much' value to tbe Tasmanian sawmillers, wbo are at a disadvantage because of the high freights between Tasmania and the mainland. Tbat disadvantage is admitted by the Tariff Board. It does not pay Tasmanian sawmillers to ship anything but the best timber, which is cut into board, flooring and furniture timbers. In the main it is only tbe offcuts that are cut into has scantlings and it is those that are affected by competition witb oregon. About 77 per cent, of the output of the mills consists of dressed timber used in building construction and has to compete with Baltic pine. This is not to receive any increase under the schedule, although, tbe remaining 23 per cent, is to receive a measure of protection. The proposed duties are of very little value to tbe sawmilling industry. Owing to the delay in tbe presentation of the Tariff Board's report on timber duties, two-thirds of our sawmills have closed down. If tbe duty imposed is not suflicient to protect tbe industry, it is not only tbe sawmillers Avho 'will suffer, but the many workers dependent upon this When bush fires pass industry for employment as well as settlers wbo find a market for fodder ' at tbe mills; tbere are also those engaged in transport services. Considering tbe difference between the freights ruling between Baltic ports and Australia and between Tasmanian ports aud tbe mainland of Australia, one wonders why the Minister declines to place a duty on Baltic timbers. To give one comparison, tbe freight on certain lengths of timber from Baltic ports to Australia is 3s. 9d. per hundred super feet, as against 5s. 9d. between Tasmania and Melbourne, and 9s. between Burnie, Tasmania's nearest port, and Adelaide. Lumber is brought out from Baltic ports at reduced rates, and this makes matters very serious for tbe Australian timber industry. Honourable members will",42,Pratten Martin Ministe R

116,Mr Bell (Darwin) [3.25],"Wben Irealize why I particularly put the case of the Tasmanian industry. It is not merely because I represent an electorate in that State, but also because Tasmania obviously suffers greater disadvantages than the other States from this competition. The Tariff Board drew special attention to the fact; but it pointed out that it was difficult to give adequate protection to the Tasmanian industry without giving too much protection to the sawmilling industry in, say, Victoria. That is most inconsistent with our general policy of giving protection to those who are most in need of it. Surely if the Tasmanian industry is peculiarly handicapped because of tbe operation of tbe Navigation Act, wbicb is largely the cause of the high freights ruling on the Australian coast, it is entitled to first consideration wben attention is given to tariff duties. Yet Japanese oak, wbich competes witb our beautiful timbers, is excluded from tbe schedule. I am glad to know that a duty will be placed on oregon, because that will benefit particularly the mills in the other States and, to some extent, tbe Tasmanian mills; but I draw attention to the curious reasoning of those responsible for the proposal when they say that Tasmania cannot be adequately assisted because that would give too much protection to the mills in other parts of Australia.' The bonorable member for Yarra Scullin) said that the proposed new duties would not to any great extent increase the cost of building. That is perfectly true, as was shown by tbe figures he supplied relating to tbe cost of building in Victoria. houses are more beautiful and durable and less costly to maintain than those constructed of imported softwoods, and if tbe public would insist on the more general use of our splendid hardwoods it would give support to a languishing Australian industry, in which are employed many of our best and most deserving workers. Those who toil in our forests often receive lower wages than those employed in the cities. opinion no Australian sbould build a house of soft timber. It is argued by tbe Tariff Board and by tbe Minister that because no softwoods are grown in Australia, Baltic pine should not be inMr Bell. eluded. Tbat might be a sound argument if it were necessary to import softwood; but I know of no case in wbicb Australian hardwoods could not be used for precisely tbe same purposes as Baltic pine. The Australian timber, as I bave said, results in a much superior building. I noticed that tbe Tariff Board remarked that one of tbe troubles of tbe industry was that tbe system of marketing timber was not efficient, and that tbe millers were not getting the best value for tbeir commodity. Tbe need for organization was suggested. When the members of the Development and Migration Commission visited Tasmania a few months ago, tbey met at Burnie the millers of tbe north-west coast, and, I believe, also representatives of most of tbe other mills in Tasmania. Throughout the discussions that took place at that gathering the millers admitted that many things might be done to help tbe industry, and bring about furniture greater efficiency, but tbey thought it was useless to attempt to improve tbeir conditions while, they bad to contend with the competition of cheap timbers from overseas. I personally ag ee that something v along those lines sbould be done. The chairman of the commission, Mr Gepp, in addressing the meeting, emphasized the necessity for co-operation and efficiency, expressly .with regard to the handling and marketing of tbe timber. I desire this committee to know that shortly after( Mr wards tbe millers held several meetings, and formed a co-operative company for the purpose of doing precisely what Mr Gepp suggested they sbould do. I told them that I thought they could reasonably hope that tbey would receive a subAustralian hardwood stantial measure of protection when the Tariff Board had reported on tbe matter. I must say that I am disappointed. I could quote figures at great length to show the extent of the importation of cheap foreign timbers, and I could let thej committee know bow many employees in the timber trade are out of work; but I shall not weary bonorable members with statistics.

These figures are sufficient to warrant our serious consideration of the needs of the local industry, which employs thousands of Australians, and, like all our industries, is board respecting the suggested alterations of worthy of all tbe support that we can give duties, strong exception was taken to the foreit.

I am not satisfied witb tbe action of the Tariff Board in this matter. It bas criticized unionists employed in the timber industry for asking for increased wages each time new duties are imposed. It was never The report of the Tariff Board respecting duties and comment by the board was submitted to a meeting of the federal execuAfter perusing the comment offered by the under the heading of "" Industrial Conditions,"" wherein the following reference ap"" Thc board pointed out that the recom. mendations for increased duty did not pro.. .. 243,000,000 vide for increased wages, but were nude .. . . 203,000,000 only to save the industry, and enable small .. 304,000,000 proiits to be made and prevent many mills .. .. 441,000,000 from closing down.

117,Mr Charlton Fhunter) [3.43],"I intended that the Tariff Board sbould inany,proposed increases in duties, had filed an application before the Arbitration Court for a reduction'of wage rates te the extent of 8s. per week on the base rate now payable to country workers; an increase of four hours per Week for city workers; the application of an hourly system of employment as against the weekly hiring now obtaining; a reduction in margins for skill from 21s. to 6s. per week as at present awarded by the court, and the further application for unlimited boy labour. These employers who were making that application to tlie Arbitration Court were the very people who had flooded the Australian timber market with their cheap foreign imported timbers. The executive of the Timber Workers Union cannot believe that a more scandalous attitude could have been taken by the employers themselves than to make such a reference in its report as submitted to the Federal Parliament which the executive contends is bristling with declarations of partiality towards the employers to the detriment of the union's applicaapplication before the Arbitration Court, tion before the court. The employers' application to the court for reduced wages, &c, was submitted six months previous to the union lodging a claim which was really a reply to the employers' application. It was pointed out at the executive meeting that a number of union secretaries had tendered evidence before the Tariff Board in support of increased duties, but the board has made no reference to that evidence, although tliose unions were also before the court applying for increased wages and better conditions. There is not the slightest doubt that indirectly this precious Tariff Board is responsible for tlie huge importations of foreign timbers, and consequently for much unemployment in the timber .and other industries, yet its recommendations respecting timbers are all in favour of importers of foreign timbers. The executive is anxious to know what was behind the mind of the board when it drew up its reference to the union. It is anxious to know who inspired the reference referred to, and if it were not for the purpose of an attempt to influence both the Arbitration Court and Parliament itself in the interests of timber importers, for what other reason was the reference made?As for its recommendations respecting the increased duties, if the Tariff Board desired to protect the timber industry from foreign competition, its endeavours have been a complete failure, as the only items they have increased the duties on are tliose which provide work in respect to re-milling and re-cutting. There have been no recommendations made respecting timbers cut to size and dressed ready for use; no increases are suggested on Baltic pines such as flooring, lining and ' weatherboards or box materials (the partial production of female and child labour) which .do not give labour to the Australian workman nor trade to the Australian sawmillers. One hundred per cent, increase on the present duties on those timbers would have been of some assistance to Australia's natural product and the timber industry generally. Mr Charlton. It is believed that hemlock, spruce, and other timbers will probably replace oregon if the defined designation as set out in the . Tariff Board's recommendation is adopted. A summary of the recommendations of the board amounts to but little import so far as the welfare of the Australian Timber Workers Union is concerned, and we look to the workers' representative in the Commonwealth Parliament to ventilate our grievance against the inadequate proposals of the board, so that a proper and true protectionist policy may be adopted by Parliament. That letter is from a union which has suffered great injustice at the hands of the Tariff Board. I have never been a critic of the T a r if f Boardbecause I believe that generally it carries out its investigations in a thorough manner; but when it goes out of its way to criticize a trade union merely because it has an it is time to protest. Especially is that so when, as in this case, the union has merely replied to pleas put forward by the importers of timber. I understand that in the schedule before us the Minister has made some alterations to the Tariff Board's recommendations, but the schedule is still unsatisfactory. Sumcient protection has not been given to the timber industry. It is possible that Australia w ill be flooded with Pacific maple and Japanese oak. We should make the future of the timber industry in Australia secure by preventing the undue importation of foreign timber. If we can supply our own timber requirements, we should do so. A proper system of reafforestation would provide employment for large numbers of workers. Tbe first requirement is to impose duties which w ill restrict the importation of cheap timber. It may be contended that it is necessary to import timber to meet our requirements, but bonorable members will admit that Australia can grow all the timber it requires for housebuilding. We have in this country some of the finest timber in the world. Honourable members bave only to see the beautiful timbers in this building to recognize that fact. It may be that tbere is a shortage of Australian timbers on tbe market, but that difficulty could easily be overcome. We should not allow timber to be imported from overseas if it means throwing Australian workers out of employment. These workers are as mucb entitled to protection as are the other sections of the community. This schedule will do a little to improve conditions in the timber industry in Australia, but it does not go far enough. building more expensive. with the honourable member. must know that tbe cost of building bas increased considerably during the last few years. everything has increased since the war, uot only in Australia but also in other countries of the world. We have not returned to normal conditions. I do not admit that tbe .utilization of our local timbers would increase building costs in Australia. Everybody knows that mass production is essential to tbe success of many industries to-day. I submit that if our timber mills were working at full capacity prices could be reduced. It cannot be expected that a reduction in price will occur while so many mills are working at only half capacity. If the timber millers could be sure of a regular output they could fix tbeir prices accordingly, and the industry would be stabilized. Many mills in New South Wales bave closed down altogether and others are working only quarter time. This is serious for Australia. The Government should do a little more than it has done to encourage the industry. The information which the Minister gave us to-day respecting the price of agricultural machinery indicated quite clearly that higher prices do not always follow increased duty. Tbe development of our timber industry would advance Australia and provide increased employment for our people. For these reasons, I trust that before this debate concludes tbe MinAt Port Nelson, for instance, it is lining ister will agree to an increase in the duty houses with imported wood when our own set out in the schedule. The increases in duty provided in tbe schedule should afford some relief to the Australian timber getters, but more sbould be done for them. The industry is well established in every State in the Commonwealth except South Australia, so that I am entitled to describe it as Australian-wide. It may even be termed one of tbe key industries of tbe nation. It provides employment for a large number of men directly, and many more indirectly. It is regrettable therefore, that more than 200 timber mills in Australia are closed down. Their business has been rendered unprofitable in consequence of the large quantities of timber imported into Australia from overseas. Thirty years ago the importation of oregon into Australia was negligible, but at present about 500,000,000 super, feet of it are being imported annually. Tbis means that many timber mills which were formerly engaged in cutting scantlings have lost that trade and bave had to turn their attention to tbe cutting of flooring, lining, weather and furniture boards; but even this trade is being jeopardized by the importation of Baltic dressed timber. I suppose that there are more timber mills in my division than in any other in the Commonwealth. Tasmania, has millions of feet of flooring and lining boards stacked in different centres for which a sale cannot be found, notwithstanding that it is incomparably better for building purposes than imported Baltic timber. A better house can be built witb it than with the Baltic boards and at a lower cost. Tbe Baltic timber is full of knots, many of whicli frequently fall out after the timber has been used for building purposes, and the holes have to be plugged with cork or something else. That does not occur witb hardwood. In 1925-26, we imported 85,0S4,976 feet of Baltic timber into Australia, which was about 20,750,000 feet more than in 1924-25. It is not surprising, therefore, that tbe Australian Industry has been bit very hard. The Commonwealth Government is itself using imported instead of local timber for mucb of the work that it bas in hand. hardwood, which would make a better job, is available at a lower price. The lamp posts outside of this building are of oregon, notwithstanding that this timber is the worse that could be obtained for putting into the ground, for it will only last two or three years. All the timber used in the barriers in front of Parliament House on Armistice Day was oregon, and tbe joinery and timber used in the hotels ?n this city is almost exclusively oregon.

122,Mr Seabbook (Eranklin) [4.4],"the Government is not sincere in its expressed ' desire to assist the Australian industry. It must be apparent to honourable members that when we import dressed timber from'oversea we support foreign industries to tbe detriment of our own. Manchurian oak and Pacific maple are also being allowed to compete on arunfair footing with Australian timbers. Queensland has some of the. finest cabinetmaking timber in the world, and on this account the importation of timber for this purpose from overseas sbould be stopped. On this point the following extract from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of yesterday's date is interesting:""There are millions of feet of Queensland maple and unlimited supplies of silky oak, red tulip oak, native walnut, red satinoy, and other cabinet-making timbers available for sale at the present time from the Forestry Department and other timber vendors of the northern State,"" said Mr P. J. Sally, Director of the Queensland Tourist Bureaui n Sydney. Mr Nally was referring to the published statements that Sydney merchants' orders could not be met; that Queensland maple was scarce, and supplies were being conserved by the Government, and that the repeated complaints as to Queensland scarcity was obviously an attempt to get protection against Pacific oak, "" the chief competitor of the Queensland maple."" Mr Nally declared that the president of the to Melbourne is actually more than from Sydney and Suburban Timber Merchants Association and other complainants here who voiced these statements did not know what they were talking about. There were beautiful timbers other than maple, he said, being extensively used for cabinet-making in Queensland. "" The whole trouble over the Queensland timber position,"" Mr Nally submitted, ""would appear to be that Sydney merchants do not seem too keen upon securing the fancy timbers except at their own price."" Queensland.^ he repeated, could supply unlimited quantities. There were no fewer than 800 varieties of timber available for building and cabinetmaking purposes. I have seen furniture made out of Queensland timber, and know that there is no better furniture made. Tasmania some blaekwood and '""'King Billy"" pines wbicb form some 'of the finest forests in the Southern Hemisphere, yet notwithstanding that Nature has given us these things, we have mills closing down because of insufficient protection afforded by tbe Government. I wish to impress upon the Minister the desirability of granting some protection against the competition of Baltic timber. Tbat is the timber which causes most of Mr Seabrook. the trouble to-day. We have lost the scantling trade because builders, who have been used to handling oregon for so many years, are not likely to go back to hardwood timber by reason of the greater cost of working. There is a great expense in cutting floor boards, because they have to be cut on tbe quarter, and tbere is more waste. That is why the cost of that timber is much higher than that of ordinary classes of timber; but unless the mills receive protection against the Baltic pines there is no doubt that many of them will have to go out of business. If that comes about I want honourable members on this side of the House to know that tbe price of oregon will go up to nearly double its present price, and tbe same will apply to Baltic pine. We shall find then that bouses will be much dearer than now. There is not much difference between tbe cost of hardwood flooring and Baltic flooring. Hardwood flooring costs 13s. 3d. per 100 f t . super, f.o.b. Tasmania; baltic is 14s. landed in Melbourne. Under the Navigation Act, as tbe honourable member for Darling pointed out, tbe freight on timber from Launceston Norway to Melbourne. It is a monstrous thing that we can bring timber to Australia from tbe other side of the world for less than it takes to carry it 200 miles. Hardwood weatberboarding is 14s. 3d. f.o.b. Tasmania, and baltic weatherboarding is 19s. l i d . While it is true that the baltic weatberboarding is cheaper than the hardwood, we have to remember that a weatherboard house has to be painted at least twice for every time wbich it is necessary to paint a hardwood house. Painting is now a fairly costly item, and this sbould be taken into consideration when comparing tbe relaWe have in tive costs of Baltic pine and hardwood houses. There is little likelihood of our getting back the scantling trade, and we shall have to confine ourselves to boards; but even that trade is being destroyed by the importations of baltic boards. The Minister proposes in this' schedule to allow mining timber-to come in free. I quite approve of that, so long as the timber is used for underground work. Tasmania supplied practically tbe whole of the mining timber for Australia for many years, and it is idle to say that hardwood timber cannot be used for this purpose. However, I have no objection to underground timber being imported; but I am afraid that a great deal of the timber coming in free, allegedly for mining purposes, will find its way into other channels, and will be used for ordinary purposes. To prevent that, it would be necessary to create an army of officials to see that tbe timber is not used for otber than mining purposes. I am satisfied that tbe importers of oregon timber would not care if all the mills stopped work to-morrow. If the mills were closed imported timber would go up in price, and the importers would make more out of it At tbe mills tbroughout Australia there are millions of feet of flooring boards which cannot be sold at the present time. seasoned, and properly treated, but the millers cannot find a market for it, and their capital is locked up in such a way that tbey cannot realize upon it. recognize that we must have pine for butter boxes, and some other kinds of boxes, but I say unhesitatingly that hardwood timber is quite suitable for most kinds of cases, including those used for packing fruit. used hardwood timber for fruit cases, and every one who saw tbem agreed that nothing better could be made. They will stand all the knocking about to which such cases are usually subjected. Therefore, it is clear that we have not got to go outside Australia to get suitable cases for packing fruit. I admit that we must get imported timber to make butter boxes, in order' to prevent the butter from being tainted. pines suitable for tbe manufacture of baltic timber. If the Minister would butter boxes. hear that. Queensland pine for butter boxes, there mania, and I believe in otber States is no need to go outside Tasmania for has been seriously prejudiced by the any otber case timber which we may revery large importations of these quire. It is' just a matter of seasoning timbers, and also of Manchurian and dressing it. I hope that what I have oak, Pacific maple, Borneo cedar, said will be placed before the Minister. and timbers from other countries. I am satisfied that if he bad heard my What is the position to-day? remarks, he would give some relief some of the big timber-growing countries to the mill-owners, notwithstanding that he has declared that he will not alter the schedule relating to baltic pine. Coming as I do from a big timber producing State like Queensland, I desire to say someibing upon this item. Even as an Australian I should protest against large importations of timber from other countries while we bave unlimited supplies of some of tbe finest timbers in the world growing in Australia. This is not a subject on which we should take a parochial view, and I only wish that the honourable member for Eranklin( Mr Seabrook) could see bis way to be as consistent a protectionist on behalf of sugar, as be is on behalf of tbe timber industry. I have in mind the honourable member's statement wben discussing the Canned This timber is properly Eruit Bounty Bill, when be said be would remove the sugar embargo, and wipe out tbe Arbitration Court. I hope that he bas seen the light since then. I know I that his speeches are most contradictory. Wben he is dealing with anything that suits his own electorate he is a protectionist, but be is an ardent free trader when the matter concerns any otber State. In this instance, happily, he can Last year a firm in Tasmania join with otber bonorable members in advocating a duty on timber. I know that tbe honourable member holds himself up as an authority on everything; but when a man advocates the importation of black-grown sugar, and the sacrificing of an industry worth £12,000,000, his attitude is anti-Australian, and it is no wonder that the Minister went out of the chamber rather than listen to him. In regard to the item 291, sections F, G, and H, I ask the Minister that he should also cover Japanese oak, Pacific maple and Borneo cedar.

125,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.25],"would welcome a duty of 15s. British, preferential, 15s. intermediate, and 16s. general, to cover Baltic timber. I wish to refer tbe Minister to a statement that has been made by Mr George W. Hudson, managing director of George Hudson's Limited, one of the biggest importers of -dressed timber in Australia. He is in favour of a duty of 15s. per 100 super feet on all dressed timber entering the 'Commonwealth. would remedy the grievances of most of the sawmillers and give employment to many hundreds of men in the manufacture of floorings, linings, and weatherboards to replace the millions of feet of manufactured Baltic timber at present being imported. I sincerely hope that the Minister will pay heed to the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members in favour of increased duties. The saw-mills and timber yards in Queensland have on their hands enormous quantities of cedar, walnut, which there is at present absolutely no market. If honourable members were to visit the wharfs in Sydney and Melbourne, tbey would see scores of lorries laden with all kinds of timbers that have been imported. The Minister has seen fit to extend tbe duties' so as to protect the softwoods. I ask him to meet our wishes in regard to timbers that are imported from Japan and otber countries. Foreign timber is being used extensively to-day in the building trades in all the big cities of Aiistralia. In Queensland and the other States which produce large quantities of timber, hundreds of employees are out of work. The importations during tbe last five years were valued as follow:192223 192324 192425 1925-26 192C-27 Total' .. .. £24,582,000 As we can grow the whole of our requirements, I ask the Minister to extend tbe item so as to cover Japanese oak, Pacific maple, Borneo' cedar, and Baltic timber The Australian timber-getters and sawmillers would then have a chance to compete on a fair basis. A large quantity of timber is brought from ScanMr Forde. dinavia. Why sbould we exteud any privileges to Norway and Sweden, seeing that we have a big adverse trade balance with both of those countries? During tbe year 1925-26, the bulk of the Scandinavian products that arrived in Australia was 570,638 tons., In the year ended the 30th June, 1926, our trade with Norway was as follows:Imports .. £1,106,000 That, he contends, Exports .. 18?,000 The latter sum included £97,475 or. account of whale oil, in tbe procuring of wbicb their own labour and vessels were utilized. The figures in regard to Sweden show a similar disparity. They are as follow:Imports .. .. £1,157,123 Exports .. .. 151,339 We imported matches to the value of £226.000, which exceeded by nearly £100,000 the value of tbe products which Sweden purchased from us. Why should we extend consideration to those counpine, and other timbers, for tries? Their labour conditions are altogether different from those that exist in Australia, and their standard of living is much lower than ours. Yet by importing from them large quantities of timber, work is provided for thousands of tbeir people, and thousands of good Australians are unemployed. Tbe hours of work in Sweden number 4S and the wage is £2 8s. Od. a week. In Australia, the wages paid under tbe timber workers' award is £4 6s. Od. for a week of 4'S hours. Under those circumstances how can we expect our timber industry to compete witb theirs? Let us now compare freights. Tbe average freight from the Baltic to Australian ports, is 4s. 5d., tbe ruling rates being 3s. lOd. per 100 super, feet in sailing vessels, and 5s. per .. £4.253,000 100 super, feet in steamer. The freights .. .. 5,627,000 to Melbourne are-Erom Tasmania, from .. 4,447,000 5s. 3d. to 5s. 9d.; from Sydney, from .. .. 5,305,000 4s. 3d. to 4s. 9d.; from Western Aus.. .. 4,950,000 tralia, 7s. 2d.; from Cairns 8s. to 8s. 6d.; and from Brisbane, from 5s. 3d. to 6s. per 100 super, feet. It will thus be seen that, the advantage lies with them in regard to both wages 'and freights. Unless the protection for which we are asking is afforded, tbe Australian timber industry will be wiped out. It has been argued that if the duty is increased, the cost of workers' homes will be raised. Sucb an argument is used only by those who are opposed to the building up of this great industry in Australia. It is the old stock free trade argument that is trotted out whenever protection is sought for a great Australian industry. on this side bas been converted. while timber is being discussed. Tomorrow, be will again become a free trader. Tbe specifications of the various types of houses that are erected under tbe Victorian Housing and Reclamation Act are set out in a publication that has been issued by the Victorian State Savings Bank. It is a most illuminating document, which I invite honourable members to read. Type No. 28 is a five-roomed cottage in which the quantity of Baltic timber used is as follows:Linings Floorings .. Weatherboards The increased duty on this type of bouse would add to its cost to the following extent:1,400 ft. at ls. O^d. por 100 2,000 ft. at 3s. l*d. per 100 2,850 ft. at 2s. 8d. per 100 The additional cost would therefore be only £7 6s. 0d., which is negligible considering that tbe worker secures an asset that lasts bim a lifetime. Let us now consider the advantages that would accrue to Australia if imported timber were kept out ancl thousands of Australians obtained employment in hewing timber from our beautiful forests. We should be able to absorb a much larger population, and give employment to thousands of timber-getters, carriers, railway employees, wharf labourers and others wbo, in the rearing of Australian families, would provide for the primary producers the best market they can have. I come from a big timber producing State. The timber industry there, as in other parts of Australia, is in a very parlous condition. Scores of timber mills that once were prosperous and thriving, are nowclosed down, and hundreds of men bave been thrown out of employment. If the Minister will agree to the increased duty that is requested, there will be a revival in that industry and probably a big proportion of the 50,000 unemployed who are now walking tbe streets, will be given employment in productive work. As an Australian I ask the Minister to accede to our request. [4.43] I have not takena very prominent part in the debate on the tariff this year, although I spoke at some length on last year's schedule. Tbe reason is that it has been quite obvious tbroughout this debate that tbere is not a particular desire on the part of honourable members generally to listen to tbe views of anyone who is not prepared to advocate the biggest measure of protection that can possibly be afforded, even to the extent of prohibition. The debate witb respect to the proposed duty on butter occupied twelve hours, during which only four members spoke in opposition to the new duties, the remainder of the time being 1,400 ft. of Oin. x Jin. occupied by those wbo either explained .. 2,000 ft. of Oin. x Jin. or defended their action for tbe benefit .. 2,850 ft. of their constituents. But this particular item embodies, in a rather acute form, a case of sheer injustice, wbicb is greater in the case £ s. d. of some States than in others. Apart1 5 11 from that, it will be an injustice to a 3 2 6 large number of poorer people, and 2 17 7 even to some of those better off, wbo will be required to pay a great deal more for tbeir bouses in order that a few people may, possibly, reap a benefit. It appears to me that the chief beneficiary will be tbe Government, which will get increased revenue duties. When the Minister introduced bis amendment to item 291. some bonorable members wo e under the impression that it represented a reduction of his original proposal. I personally did not expect that, and I find on looking through, tbe details that he had added to the word "" oregon"" in 291 F ancl H from other timbers, "" hemlock, spruce, fir, and pine, except redwood and Baltic,"" and he has added another sub-item 291 L, "" Timber dressed, n.e.i., Oregon, hemlock, spruce, fir, and pine except redwood and Baltic."" vent the substitution of those timbers for oregon. is that tbe alteration does not mean a reduction of tbe original schedule.

Practically no softwood is grown in Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania; tbe supplies of Queensland are largely depleted; and New South Wales cannot supply its own requirements, Western Australia has plenty of hardwood, but the output is being restricted in order to conserve tbe timber resources of the State. Oregon, the principal timber affected by tbese duties, is conceded by tbe Tariff Board's report to be essential. The board saysWitnesses in favour of the request for additional duties admitted, however, that hardwood could not be used as a substitute for oregon for many purposes, and that no matter what duty was imposed, oregon would still be imported The Tariff Board is satisfied that it is desircreased duties wbich oppress in varying able that some additional protection be given to assist local sawmillers in disposing of their timber, but it is not prepared to recommend the whole of the additional duties sought for the reason that such a course, would be imposing too great a burden upon the industries in which the use of a certain quantity of the imported timber is essential, and on those activities in which only overseas softwoods are suitable, or even possible. Tasmanian hardwood is not suitable for tbe purposes for wbich softwood is used, and the result of these duties will be the collection of more revenue and a general rise in tbe cost of living, because of the great cost of housing. South Australia imported in 1925-26 roughly 11,000,000 feet of hardwood from Tasmania, and 36,000,000 feet from Western Australia, a total of 47,000,000 feet. Of undressed softwoods, including oregon, it imported 46,000,000 feet. The imports of softwood and hardwood were practically equal, and no one can rightly suggest that there has been any disinclination in that State to buy hardwood for tbe purposes for wbich it is suited. On which of the States will these new imposts fall most heavily? The statement has Schedule. been published in tbe press that in -1924 Brit. Inter. Gen. tbe existing duties meant an impost per bead of population of Ss. 2£d. in South Australia; 8s. in Victoria; 3s. 6£d. iu New South Wales; 44d. in Western Australia; 2£d. in Queensland; and l i d . in Tasmania. I ask tbe committee to note that tbe range was from l j d . to 8s. iJ^d. Tbe extra duties will increase the burden per bead of population by approximately 3s. 6d. in South Australia, 2s. 6d. in Victoria, ancl 2s. in New South Wales. In other words New South Wales will pay 5s. 6^d., and South Australia l is . 8£d. per head of population. Those figures show that the tariff is being applied in a way that is manifestly unjust to certain States. I cannot help feeling that there is behind tbese duties a political motive a desire to assist the State of Tasmania. I have the greatest sympathy for that State. It bas fared badly under federation, and bas received very little sympathy. I am not desirous of withholding mine, but if Tasmania requires further assistance than it bas already received, tbe proper method 'of giving it is by a direct grant-whic h indeed has already been done-and not by way of indegrees other States. This schedule of duties means that some States, and those",51,Pratten Martin Ministe R

132,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES I acceptnot the largest, will pay a greater proportion of the amount to be levied, nominally against tbe whole of the Oommonwealth, for the purpose of helping Tasmania. I commend the report of the Tariff Board on this subject to tbe consideration of bonorable members. In 1925 the'* board refused tbe request for increased duties, but every effort was still put forth by those interested to get additional protection. In regard to that the board said:The Tariff Board strongly resisted the granting of the request for a re-opening, as it considered that its investigations should not be re-opened merely because the parties to the requests are dissatisfied with the result, at least until such time as those concerned are in a position to present what could be regarded as fresh evidence. In each instance the board's report to tbe Minister very clearly demonstrated that' tbe information tendered was not fresh evidence. Again at page 19 of its report tbe board says, under floorings, linings, and weatherboardsNot only does the question of comparative prices as between the imported and local timbers constitute a factor in the preference manifested for the imported timber, but the very much lower cost of transport, handling and working softwood timber as compared with hardwood represents a very decided advantage to the former. The Tariff Board agrees with the contention that the granting of the increased duties asked for would not have the effect of increasing the use of hardwood, which, of course, is thc objective of the request, but would have the eifect of increasing the use of substitutes which, in addition to being cheaper than hardwood, require considerably less labour to handle and fix, and involve a lower cost of upkeep. Moreover, the granting of higher duties to the extent sought would impose upon users of the timber a burden which the Tariff Board considers is not justified by the circumstances. This would apply more especially to States such as South Australia, in which there is no local supply of hardwood timber, and to those localities in other States which are remote from the source of supply of hardwood, seeing that the cost of thc timber in such places would be increased considerably by heavy freights. I tails of tbe increased costs at different places because of the heavier freights. Towards the end of the report we find the comments of the board on the efficiency of the timber industry. The Prime Minister has for several years past told us that tbe Government does not intend to grant assistance either in the form of protective duties or by giving bounties unless an industry is obviously efficient. Tbe Tariff Board dealing with the efficiency of the timber industry says uncier grading and classification of timbersThere is no doubt that in the past much of the timber handled by local sawmillers has not been cut and marketed to the best advantage. In the next paragraph, dealing with seasoning, it saysThe Tariff Board is satisfied that the commercial value of much of the timber produced by local sawmillers would be enhanced by proper seasoning before marketing. These two comments seem to indicate how much scope tbere is for improving the efliciency of the timber industry, and how necessary it is for tbe Minister to explain tbe Government's action, if it is not bis own, in adopting tbe higb increase recommended by tbe Tariff Board. A few weeks ago we passed a Housing Bill, in wbich we provided that for the building of a bouse a sum could be advanced wbich, in my opinion, was unreasonably bigb; but one can readily understand that tbe advance will need to be high if tbe country is to be charged so much more for its timber. It is obvious that the effect of these timber duties will be felt by tbe whole community. Tbey are certainly not justified by any argument that bas yet been put forward, nor should tbey be imposed because of any desire to show consideration to one State or the people of that State. From tbe Adelaide Register of tbe 30th rdtimo I quote the following:In the Assembly on Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition (Eon L. L. Hill) directed the attention of the Government to articles in the Register concerning the 100 per cent, increase in the duty on Oregon, which, he said, combined with the proposed increased inward wharfage rate and the reduction of the advances for homes by £350,000, would place the building trade in a precarious position. Mr Hill asked that a protest should be made to the Federal Government. The Premier (Hon. R. L. Butler) said hp could give to the committee dehad considered the position, but had not come to a definite decision. The increased duty might promote the use of local timber; if it did not it would not serve any good purposej and he would certainly make representations to the Prime Minister. I trust that we shall find honourable members of tbe Opposition in this chamber agreeing with the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the South Australian Parliament. Tbere is also a wider question bebind all this-bo w far we sbould proceed at tbe present juncture in using up the timber that Australia still bas left. Australia is not rich in timber. Every one who bas taken the slightest interest in the subject knows that its splendid forests bave been squandered in a most shameful manner. Honourable members opposite say that at the present time we are benefiting tbe people engaged in tbe timber industry in overseas countries aud thereby injuring our own people, but I ask them whether in the long -run it would not do more good to Australia if' we used as much softwood timber as we could get from overseas and built up our owu timber reserves. Lord Randolph Churchill, speaking of the late Mr Gladstone, who, we all know, was a great axeman, said: ""Tn bis amusements and in bis work be is alike destructive; tbe forest groans in order that Mr that at every stage the process of preGladstone may perspire."" Some of us may not agree with that criticism; but I venture to say that the whole of Australia must groan in order that tbe timbercutters of Tasmania and, it may be, elsewhere, may perspire. I support tbe Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin), in bis claim that this schedule of duties does not deal adequately with the timber industry. I regret the absence of some provision to deal with dressed timbers wbicb are coming to Australia and depriving our sawmillers of a considerable amount of work that should rightly be theirs. Although, tbe Minister now proposes, to increase tbe duty on hemlock and spruce as well as On oregon, which is certainly an improvement on his earlier proposal, be does not propose to impose increased duties on Japanese or Baltic timbers which are mainly used for flooring, for which purpose Australian timbers are equally serviceable as well as for linings and weatherboards. If we could make full use of our own timbers for these purposes we should be in a position to use up in tbe manufacture of boxes portions which would otherwise go to waste. But we find that Norway and Sweden are sending us dressed timber in all shapes and sizes ready for putting together as boxes. I am anxious to prevent that competition, so that we may utilize our forests to the fullest advantage by using for box making purposes what would otherwise be waste timber. It bas been said that the present time is inopportune for imposing heavy duties on imported timbers, because we ought to be taking steps to .conseiwe our own. timbers. I know that in tbe Wirrabara Forest in South Australia at the present time tbere is 16,000,000 super, feet of pinus insign is ready to. cut, which is actually deteriorating, because it is not possible to cut it to commercial advantage. This forest could supply 2,000,000 super, feet of this softwood annually, and it is only one of several forests from which supplies are available. Australia bas timber wbicb could replace imported dressed timbers, notable those that come from Norway and Sweden, and I trust, therefore, that tbe Minister will so impose duties on dressed timbers paring tbem for use may be done by Australian workmen. The proposed increase of 5s, per 100 super, feet on oregon is on bulk timber, tbe size prescribed being 12 in. by 6 in., but tbere is not sumcient protection for Australian industry against an inrush of timbers that are coming in fully dressed and cut to sizes suitable for box-making. At tbe present time owing to low duties on Baltic timbers very little hardwood flooring or lining is used. A tremendous amount of timber in Australia wbicb is suitable for the manufacture of boxes is deteriorating in the forests owing to tbe huge importations of Baltic timbers for boxes. from America. to me from an authentic source are as follows super, feet.

The only question is what is the best method of assisting this industry from a national point of view. I admit that Australia is over milled, and that as a result there is unemployment. There is a banking up of timber both at the mills and at the merchants and there is a temporary disorganization of the timber trade. That is but one feature pf a great Australian problem. Timber authorities who have visited Australia and our pw.n forester? are agreed that under our present methods of handling our timber resources, the industry is a great national vanishing asset. Australia We must pay due regard to afforestation. times The Tariff Board has made a survey of the Australian timber industry, and its We should take furreports contain some valuable information. Let us at once acknowledge that it is impossible to build Australian homes of all Australian timber. There must be a dilution of softwood timbers in Australian homes and other buildings.

But I believe that Australian sawmillers and the saw-milling trade interests would be far better' met .by tbe payment of a bounty than by the imposition of a duty. The States, because of their varying climatic conditions, have different milling resources and forestry areas. .For instance, we have heard this afternoon .that tbe State of South Australia has practically no timber resources, and is at present engaged in forestry work, attempting to make up tbe shortcomings of nature. That is undoubtedly a commendable work.

The output of Australian hardwoods is approximately 650,000,000 feet per annum, and, less .the exports, 121,000,000 feet.

Tbe very low duty would encourage tbe importation of foreign timbers, and tbe country would be so flooded witb imported timber that our timbers would not bave a market here, and consequently little or no bounty would be paid on our own timbers. Nor can I for a moment support a proposal uncier which timber would come in free of duty. If that were allowed, it would be impossible to find a market for our timber, as Australia would be flooded with imports from other countries. A forestry school has recently bf en opened in the Federal Capital Territory, in which a number of students from every State in the Commonwealth are studying reafforestation, and their work will in the years to come be of great beneto the board, which has now submitted fit to Australia. The States, particularly South Australia and Queensland, have also made special efforts to encourage reafforestation. It would be useless to engage in this work unless there was a possibility of finding a profitable market for tbe timbers to be produced. Consideration has also been given to tbe further encouragement of reafforestation by tbe Government, as the Treasurer recently introduced an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Bill exempting from income tax any sum's expended by individuals on reafforestation work. If people are to be encouraged to invest their surplus capital in reafforestation schemes, they must have some security for the future. This cannot be done effectively unless forests products are protected against foreign competition. It is our duty to definitely state our position by saying that we-shall give adequate protection to the timber industry. If we do not. do that, it must go out of business-. As tbe tone of the debate on timber duties bas been overwhelmingly in favour of tbe inclusion of Baltic and Pacific timbers in the schedule, I trust the Minister will agree to the suggestions made from both sides of the committee. I do not think I have ever listened to a debate in wbich there has been such unanimity, and I am sure it is tbe Minister's desire to comply witb the wishes of tbe representatives of tbe people. The same arguments that have been used in support of higher duties on oregon apply with equal force to a duty on Baltic and Pacific timbers. I do not wish to quote the figures of imports wbicb have already been given several times today; but I am justified in emphasizing the fact that many saw-mills are now closed down owing to overseas competition in timber. There are millions of feet of good timber in our forests which has reached maturity, and in some instances is beginning to deteriorate because a market cannot be found for it. Those engaged in the industry appreciate the assistance which tbe Minister has already given. B.o was good enough to submit the matter of duties to the Tariff Board, the report on which the Government considered, and then referred tbe matter back otber recommendations. Further representations bave since been made ro tbe Minister, as n result of which additional protection is to be afforded. ""We now wish the Minister to crown his good work by including Baltic and Pacific timbers in the schedule, and I suggest with some trepidation, that shooks sbould also be included. I will refer to this matter again later. I have discussed this matter with the Minister many times and have' also introduced deputations to him on this subject, and I trust that he will respond to the strong representations which have been made. Baltic timber, wbich is competing with our Australian timbers, usually comes out at a very low freight, very often at ballast rates, because the vessels in which it is shipped expect to make up any loss they incur by back freight, which usually consists of our primary products which are shipped to the markets on the other side of. tbe world.

I should like particularly to impress upon hiin the serious position that has arisen through the heavy importation of shooks. These imports are imperilling the interests of the saw-milling trade throughout Australia. For some time now the Commonwealth has been flooded witb imports of this timber, witb tbe result that Australian saw-millers are fast losing the Australian case-making trade. Millions of feet of valuable timber wbich could be used for case making purposes are rotting in our forests. relating to tbe importation of undressed timber under tbe item n.e.i., for the manufacture of boxes and foi the making of boxes cut to size but undressed, are startling. They are as follow:Imports.

Year. 1920-21 192425 1925-26 If the Australian saw-milling industry is to be adequately protected in respect of this class of timber, it is essential that these duties should be reviewed. The position in Queensland is somewhat complicated, owing to the royalties paid to the Queensland Government. ister referred to this matter in his speech to-day. I have been giving attention to it for some considerable time. royalty was imposed to promote reafforestation, but Mr Swayne, tbe superintendent of tbe scheme in Queensland, has been complaining for some time that instead of payments under the royalty being used for that purpose, they are being paid into the Consolidated Eevenue.

I hope that he will re-submit this question to the board.

These duties affect an important and an established primary industry. I would never be a party to giving assistance to secondary industries if I were not prepared also to protect our primary industries, upon wbicb tbe prosperity of this country rests. Tbere is special reason why these duties should appeal to the Minister aiid the Government. The timber industry is a rural and an established industry. It",59,Pratten Martin Ministe R

I may add that the employment which it gives is not casual, but of a permanent character, enabling tbe workers engaged in it to live in the country and rear their families tbere. the concentration of people in our great cities sbould be encouraged. We are not appealing for assistance for a new or an unknown industry; but for one wbicb, as I bave said, has been long established, and in which a considerable amount of capital has been invested. It is in an entirely different class from new industrial ventures, which very often depend for their success on tbe measure of protection given in the tariff. It is much better to relieve alarm; but tbe quantity of foreign timdistress and unemployment in this way than by handing out doles or authorizing the carrying out of ill-considered relief works. If by means of these duties we can assist an established industry, we shall be carrying out our national task along proper lines. I hope' that tbe Minister will not leave this good work half done, but that he will include Baltic timbers in tbe item imposing duties on Oregon. I realize that we are to somi extent wasting time by making representations to the Minister witb regard to the duty on shooks, but I support tbe remarks made by tbe honourable member for Moreton( Mr J. Francis), and I urge the Minister to consider the desirability of giving the box-making industry an independent hearing before the Tariff Board at an early date. The honourable member for Moreton was not very wide of tbe mark when he said that this section of the industry was submerged in the general inquiry, and that if it were set out in a special schedule it would make a special appeal to both the board and the Minister. I hope that the Minister, in his reply, will be able to give us an assurance that this section of -the industry will before long have an opportunity to put its case before the Tariff Board. I welcome this opportunity to say a few words with regard to tbe position of the timber industry in Australia. A l though Western Australia has only about 3,000,000 acres of timber land, compared witb about 6,000,000 acres in Queensland and 8,000,000 acres in Victoria, its resources bave not been exploited to the same extent as have those of Victoria. Consequently, that State supplies about one-third of the timber produced in Any industry which prevents Australia annually. It is to be regretted that the heavy increase in the importation of baltic flooring and oregon is seriously endangering tbe position of the timber industry throughout Australia. Even in that state tbe effect of imported timber is being felt. If 50 per cent, of timber used for building purposes consisting of imported softwoods were necessary and the other half .Australian hardwoods, tbere might be no cause for ber used in Australia for purposes for which our own beautiful hardwoods are most suitable, is appalling. In 1918-19 the quantity of timber imported was 144,000,000 super feet, and in 1925-26 tbe imports bad grown to 499,000,000 super feet. Tbe imports in the intervening years certainly showed fluctuation; but tbey have gradually increased. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook), who is an ardent free trader on some matters, bas pointed out that the timber industry is in a parlous condition. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are fairly consistent with regard to the policy of protection, and are prepared to help the timber industry. In Victoria, 27 out of 72 mills have been closed down, and a large number are working 'short-handed. An appeal was made to the Tariff Board in 1925, and, although its conclusions were not quite as decisive then as they are on tbe present occasion, the report showed that tbe men engaged in tbe industry felt the need of protection against imports from America and Baltic ports. Oregon pine has proved a severe competitor of Australian timbers. Oregon forests can be worked in tbe face, and, therefore, tbey are operated mucb more cheaply than Australian millers can work their hardwoods, because a large number of trees per acre can be obtained. In Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, great waterways facilitate the handling of timber, wbich is conveyed cheaply to the sea by",60,Pratten Martin Ministe R
172,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [6.14].,"means of logging rafts. This cheap transport assists in making the American competition particularly formidable. Wages there are low compared witb those ruling in Australia. on timber workers is equivalent to £3 14s. 6d. a week, ancl in Oregon and Washington it is, roughly, the same, as against tbe Australian basic wage of £4 6s. Most of the men engaged in tbe industry in Canada and the Uuited States of America are classed as "" labourers,"" whereas in Australia skill is recognized and rewarded-a large number of the men receiving more than tbe basic wage. well-known builder in Melbourne, in giving the reason for the use of oregon in house construction, recently stated that it was a matter of price. that, if hardwood were given the protection sought, the total quantity of oregon that he would specify for a 5-roomed house would be a little over 400 super feet, which, with an increased duty, would mean an extra cost of only 16sThere is no reason why Australian hardwoods should not be used almost exclusively in tbe building Australian are and they are particularly prized in -tropical regions because tbey are whifeant proof. It is worthy of notice that in India and China, and in other countries where it is necessary that timber shall be capable of resisting the inroads of the white ant, the jarrah hardwoods of Western Australia are in demand. Some years ago oregon was regarded as necessary for ceiling joists because of the tendency of Australian hardwood to shrink. trouble was. that it was used in a green condition, and cracks appeared in plastered ceilings; but there is no reason why it sbould not be well seasoned before use. To-day, however, instead of plastered ceil* ings, plaster boards are used, and objection to the use of our hardwoods can no longer be sustained. Tbere is now no valid reason why Australian hardwoods sbould not be used for all building purposes. I believe that Victoria is the only State where Baltic pine and oregon timber will withstand the Australian climate and tbe insect pests. In tbe warmer and tropical portions of this country, builders would no more dream of using Baltic flooring or ilr. A. Green. Baltic weatherboards than of erecting grass houses after tbe F i j i style, because the building would be riddled by white ants. Even in Victoria it is not at all In Canada, the wage paid necessary to use softwoods in the construction of houses. In Western Australia, jarrah is used from the stumps to the ceiling joists and ridging. A bardwood house only requires to be oiled on the outside, and. therefore it is much cheaper in the long run than one built of softwood. A Baltic weatherboard house should be painted every three years, and the cost of that would be £30 or £40; A whereas a jarrah hardwood cottage could, be oiled by the occupant at a cost of a few shillings. It bas been suggested to me ^ that it is necessary to import softwoods He added because tbe Australian supply of timber is petering out. In 1920 an interstate conference on forestry was held in Hobart, and it was laid down that the various States sbould set aside 24,500,000 acres of tbeir forest lands in parts of Australia where the rainfall averages 30 inches or more per annum, which gives of bouses. ideal conditions for forestry in temhardwood ceiling joists perate climates. In tropical climates the tbe best in the world, rainfall should be at least 60 inches per annum. In Borneo one sees marvellous forest growth, and tbe forests contain many species of trees, no one kind being found in great numbers together, If single species grew together as Jo our hardwoods, Australia would be unable to withstand the competition of that timber. It is difficult to penetrate a tropical jungle, and if one were looking for a some species of timber, he might not find The two trees on an acre. It has been authoritatively stated that .86 acres is sufficient to supply tbe timber requirements per head of tbe population in any country. Australia has 4.09 acres of forest land per head. Therefore, if we set aside for serious afforestation 24,500,000 acres, we sbould have sufficient timber for the requirements of 28,500,000 people. Countries like France and Germany are taking extraordinary precautions to utilize all their spare land for afforestation purposes. The interior woodwork of this chamber bears eloquent testimony to the . beauty of our Australian timbers. Not only is it unnecessary to neglect them, and give preference to imported softwoods, but it is unpatriotic. The Minister is now asked to put a duty on Baltic pine, which is used almost exclusively by the jerrybuilder because it is cheap. In Baltic countries a large number of women are engaged in the industry at low wages. We should have an afforestation scheme in Australia sumcient to meet tbe needs of a population of 30,000,000. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.SG p.mThis is tbe first time that I have risen during the tariff debate. It may be said that I do so only because an industry in my electorate is under consideration. Surely it is not surprising that honourable members should be concerned with the industries which are established in tbeir own districts. Tbe persons engaged in those industries expect their representaSouth Walestives to protect their interests. I therefore make no apology for rising to speak in connection with the duties on timber. Generally speaking, our secondary industries are able to pass on any additional costs incurred, but that is not the case with primary industries, which, however, have to pay their share of the duties imposed in tbe interests of secondary industries. As the representative of a country constituency I am glad that the Government recognizes the claims of primary industries for protection. Tbere can be no doubt that the timber industry is a primary industry in tbe true sense of that term. In many instances other primary industries cannot be established until tbe timber industry bas paved tbe way. Before agricultural pursuits can be carried on in some districts the native timber growing on the land must be cleared. Tbe timber industry also helps to snpply freight for our raillittle more difficult to work than is oregon, ways and cargoes for our ships. Honourable members on both sides have urged that this industry is entitled to greater consideration. In'an excellent speech this afternoon tbe honourable member for Boothby( Mr That the item be postponed, Duncan-Hughes) put tbe other side of the case. He said that if Baltic timber were included in the schedule an additional burden would be placed on tbe community, particularly that section which could least afford to bear it. I do not know whether the honourable member was in the chamber when the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) quoted from the report of the Victorian housing authorities, showing that if Baltic timber were included in the schedule the additional cost of a bouse would be about £7. If a reasonable measure of protection were giveu to the Australian timber industry many of the requirements of the building trade could be met without placing an undue burden upon tbe community. Tbe honourable member for Boothby referred to afforestation. I am not an authority on that subject, but I know that in tbe coastal areas of my electorate there are thousands of acres of good hardwood country wbich, because of the competition of imported oregon, is worth only about £2 per acre. I desire to quote the following statement made by Mr R. D. Hay, Forestry Commissioner of New To-day we are in an entirely different position. The forests, as cut over, are being systematically regenerated for the growth of new crops, and we have an established system of afforestation by planting softwoods, of which we had always a shortage. Last year (1924), our regeneration works covered 40,000 acres, and our planting about 3,000 acres, and under the present policy this will be indefinitely continued. In view of this, the estimate furnished by the commission in letter of 15th April last to the secretary of the Associated Sawmillers is quite sound, namely, that the hardwood supply can amply meet demand for 50 years ahead, and, if the present policy of reestablishnicnt be continued, for all time. I remind honourable members that a few years ago when Oregon was difficult to procure, Australian hardwoods wero employed in its stead with satisfactory results. The adaptability of Australian timbers to various requirements was shown clearly during the war. It is a but its lasting qualities compensate for that disadvantage. Believing that Baltic pine and Manchurian oak should be inI also urge its claims. cluded, I moveas an indication to the Government that, the desire of the committee is that this shall be done. support the motion moved by the honner). .

Tbe schedule makes no differentiation between timbers suitable for manufacture into furto say of late about our adverse trade niture and co?istructional timber such as oregon. Timber should be classified in the same way that items relating to other industries are classified-fro m the raw material to the manufactured article. Many manufactured articles made from timber enter Australia from other countries. Eor instance, axe bandies are imported, to the detriment of axe bandies made from timber grown in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Australian axe-handle industry does not attempt to compete with axe handles made of high-grade American hickory, but imported axe handles made of inferior hickory are seriously affecting it. One would think that a higher duty would be imposed on tbe manufactured article than on the raw material from whicli it is mede. A higher duty should be imposed on shooks. If it is necessary to import timber f j r box-making, we sbould endeavour to ensure that the work in connection witb it is done in Australia. I rose to support tbe motion, and also to direci attention to tbe need for a better classification of timber. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Tbe fall from the year 1914-15 to 1.922 Eodgers) pointed out that Australia needs to put into operation a sound afforestation policy and I agree with him; but in the meantime our existing timber industry should be protected. I trust that the Minister will give earnest consideration to tbe requests that have been made for an increased duty, and that he will not further resist the amendment. duties on timber should be decreased and not increased, for the present imposts are excessive and cannot favourably affect our local industry, nor stimulate to any considerable extent tbe use of our hardwood. An increase in the present duties can only add to tbe cost of building and of timber generally to tbe people of Australia. I represent perbaps the most important timber producing district in Australia; but I bave not heard an outcry there for an increase in the existing duties. Queensland is the only State which has any considerable supply of softwoods,, but she cannot meet the needs of tbe otber States of the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite bave bad a good deal balance and tbe extravagance of the present administration, so that I find it difficult to discover any grounds on which tbey can justly vote for this proposal, seeing that tbe only effect it can have is to place an additional £400,000 in tbe hands of the Treasurer. The following figures show the imports of softwoods into Australia during tbe last sixteen years:Super, feet. 1911 .. . . 443,000,000 1912 .. . . 444,000,000 1913 .. . . 455,000,000 191415 .. . . 326,000,000 191510 .. . . 257,000,000 191617 200,000,000 191718 .. . . 109,000,000 191819 .. . . 144,000,000 191920 .. . . 157,000,000 192021 .. . . 243,000,000 192122 .. . . 203,000,000 192223 .. . . 364,000,000 192324 .. . . 441,000,000 192425 .. . . 402,000,000 192526 .. . . 499,000,000 192627 .. . . 465,000,000 was accounted for, of course, by tbe war. It is rather significant that tbe enforcement of the Massy-Greene tariff did not prevent increased importations. My figures show that we are now importing only about 10,000,000 super, feet more per annum of softwood than in 1913-14, although our population has increased by about 1,500,000. I compliment the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes) on the sane, sensible and practical speech which he delivered on behalf of his State. We should look at this subject from the point of view of the general development of the Commonwealth. While a Parliamentary committee with which I was associated was taking evidence in Tasmania some time ago, a leading sawmiller and timber merchant there informed us that in America 850 super, feet of timber was cut per man per day, while the figure for Australia was only 130 super. feet.

"" Advocates for them have advanced the absurd view that this w ill protect the Australian hardwood saw-miller.

In Australia to-day it is freely admitted by experts that Australia cannot possibly supply her own softwood requirements. State may be summarized as follows:"" 1.

"" 4 . South Australia -On the 2nd September, 1925, the Tariff Board, in its report on the timber investigation, used these words:The State of South Australia is the Cinderella amongst the States, in so far as timber resources are concerned. No other State within the Commonwealth is so singularly deficient in the possession of suitable hardwood forests, and so far as softwoods are concerned this State possesses none save a few forest areas that they have planted with foreign fastgrowing pines. The result of this situation is that any higher duties imposed upon foreign softwoods would press most heavily upon this The position in regard to each State, which is already carrying a burden such as none of tlie other States are called upon to bear.

Although the quantity exported has been exceeded on three previous occasions, the declared value of the past year's oversea sales constitutes a record. It is generally recognized by those closely associated with the trade that the quantity of timber cut annually cannot be increased if any consideration is to be given to the future of the industry.'

The depression in this industry is so well known that it is hardly necessary for me to draw attention to the position in the State wbich I represent. Since the duties on timber were last dealt with by tbe House, tbe importations into Queensland have greatly increased, ancl, slowly but surely, foreign timbers are ousting the native timbers from tbe market. In my State there is a very large area of timber of all classes, but the timber industry there bas been destroyed because there bas not been tbe necessary protection to enable its products to be placed on tbe market. A general survey of the sawmilling industry of Queensland shows that tbere were until recently 160 mills in operation. Tbey employed approximately 1,200 men who received wages amounting to £240,000The value of the logs cut was £430,000, and the average number of teamsters and fellers employed was 800. The hardwood resources of Queensland comprise some 8,000,000 acres, and with re-generation and a further assurance of support, there would be a total yield of 800,000,000 superficial feet a year. Of course, some honourable members wbo have not been to Queensland, and who have not taken tbe trouble to make inquiries, speak as if tbere were no timber resources tbere at all. We cannot compare it with Western Australia or South Australia because, unfortunately there is very little asally in South Australia. There are large untapped resources of semihardwoods and fancy woods in Queensland of which greater use sbould be made. They are suitable, in quantity and quality, to serve any of the particular purposes catered for by importation from Java and other countries. There is 60,000,000 feet of unused timber on Fraser Island alone. Tbat island is in my electorate, and only a short distance off a coast port. Not very long ago a Sydney firm built a very large factory on Fraser Island, but it found that on account of the adverse duty it was unable to make tbe industry pay, and it bad to close down. It was .forced to sell its plant for a very small sum, much below what it had cost. They are 60,000,000 feet of timber untouched on that island, and there is a further 60,000,000 feet of grey and red satin ash on the ISungella Range near Mackay. Tbere are untold millions of feet of Talif oak in the forests along the whole coastline. No encouragement has been given to utilize these timbers. Naturally people ask why tbey should trouble about assisting re-afforestation when tbe timber we have now, which ought to be used now because some of it is degenerating, is allowed to go untouched. is not accessible. M.r. COBSEB -It would be largely impossible to find a more accessible place than Fraser Island. The reduction would result to a large extent in the substitution of hardwoods for softwoods. Tbere is a large quantity of softwoods in Queensland, and when they bave passed through the saw-mills, especially those that have drying plants, they come out to the satisfaction of dealers. One cannot lay the whole of the blame, upon tbe shoulders of tbe Mimster. He bas to consider the wishes of the Government, whose interest, I am afraid, is not always as keen as his. Tlie lack of adequate protection in relation to dressed timber has tbe effect of lessening tbe value of tbe security wbich is held by tbe sawmillers throughout tbe Commonwealth. As a large number of",66,Tabiff Ceeds

192,Mr Pbatten,"Some of that timberQueensland mills have been closed down witbin tbe last six mouths, and hundreds of men have been thrown out of employment, it is time that tction was taken to safeguard tbe industry. The imports of dressed timber bave increased since 1920-21 by 37,724,000 superficial feet. The following table of imports clearly sets out tbe position:Super, feet. .1020-121 .. 47,360,198 1924-ii5 1925-26 Tbe increase between 1920-21 and 1924-25 was 17,003,830 super feet, that between 1920-21 and 1925-26, was 37,724,778 super, feet, and that between 1924-25 and 1925-26 was 20,750,000 super feet. That is the result if an inadequate protective duty on imported timber. If it is necessary to protect the interests of other industries, would it not be merely an act of justice to protect also our timber industry? In Queensland I have seen hundreds of thousands of feet of splendid pine burnt. Doubtless honourable members are aware that wben i pine bas been cut it becomes discoloured, and of no use if it is not utilized within a short space of time, t have already referred to the enormous quantity of hardwood that is grown in Queensland. Eight along the coast of that State there are millions of feet of hardwood of the very best quality. Millions of acres also are covered with o'tber timbers, that would be utilized if proper protection were granted. I trust that before we leave this city we shall be given an assurance that the industry will be further protected. I congratulate the Minister, but not as wholeheartedly as I would wish, and as I hope to be able to do nt the conclusion of tbe debate. Tbe honourable gentleman interested himself in preserving the rights of the timber getters, and the saw-mill proprietors to some extent. I point out, however, that while he has locked the front door be has lef s tbe back door open. The position in regard to the industry may be well summed up in tbe lines:The lil.tle more, and how much it is, The iittle less, and what worlds away! If the. Minister persists in excluding Baltic timber from the item he will leave undone mucb that should be done. Sawmills are dotted all over my electorate. Tbe followingj^etter is typical of a number that I have' received:We are very concerned about Baltic, one of our chief competitors. This timber should follow oregon, as Baltic is solely used for linings and floorings (mainly floorings), and is a deadly competitor of our hardwood floorings. The Minister to-day gave a half-hearted reply to the question-wh y is Baltic timber being excluded? His statement that it is the means of providing . . 04,364,028 cheap homes for the workers cannot .. .. 85,084,976 be accepted as a f u l l explanation. Tbe argument that it means increased cost to the worker might also be applied witb equal force to butter and every otber item in the schedule. I hope that tbe Minister will give the matter further consideration and decide to bave duties imposed on Baltic timber at the level of those on oregon. The timber mills are suffering a great injustice in connection with the distribution of their timbers. Honourable members are aware that tbe timber is cut in tbe bush and that the largest quantity o t j it is sent to the city, where it is distributed. Those who are charged with its distribution have also the distribution of tbe imported softwood timbers. They make practically no profit on oregon, Baltic and similar timbers; but, according to evidence that has been given before the Tariff Board, tbey make a profit of anything from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent, in the handling of native timbers. I wisb to quote from the statement of a gentlemen who recently visited the Twofold Bay district. He is Mr G. H . Gibson, a member of the firm of Gibson& Company, the representative of the K.D. Lumber Company. The portion of his statement that I wish to quote refers to oregon and appeared in the Eden Magnet. He saidThe market for Oregon was world-wide. The yearly production was 12,000,000,000 feet, of which 1,000,000,000 were exported. The cost of felling and putting logs to the mills in America vas JS -perhap s to _ 6s -pe r 100 feet board measure. That was liigher than in Australia, where logging was cheaper, but in milling and shipping the Canadians and Americans had us hopelessly beaten. Here, though logging cost Is. per 100 feet less 'than in America, we had an awful lack of suitable transport. Milled Oregon goes on to the ship at 10s. per 100 feet, a freight rate of 6s. per 100 feet brings the price of the timber deliverd at Sydney to 16s. per 100 feet, and an average duty of 5s. per 100 feet brings the price to 21s.",67,Tabiff Ceeds
193,Mr Perkins (Eden,"Monaro) [8.21].landing costs raise it to 2os.,-ithe-cost of transquite well that unless the timber is cut at port to Sydney suburbs by another 2s. to 25s. at which price t was being sold. Importers ; made no money on Oregon. That applies also to Baltic timber. The duty of 5s. wbich previously existed was eaten up by tbe amount of profit tbey made on colonial hardwoods. If tbe big firms in Sydney that are engaged in distribution were to sell local hardwoods at cost price and make a reasonable profit on softwoods there would be no need for us to engage in this debate, because the hardwoods would be able to bold tbeir own. Otber timbers in addition to Baltic are excluded from tbe schedule. If we place on one timber a duty at wbich it cannot profitably be sent out, others will be sent in its place. I do not agree with tbe argument that was urged before tbe board, and in a letter that was read tonight by the bonorable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), that the result of a tariff upon imported softwoods would be to increase tbe price of local hardwoods. I believe that the contrary would be tbe case. ""We bave a sufficient number of mills in Australia to turn out from two to three times the present output. If tbey were able to work full time, with full staffs, they would produce more cheaply. The requested tariff would have tbe effect of increasing tbe price of the softwoods, and at tbe same time would bring about a corresponding reduction in tbe price of hardwoods. Therefore the worker who wished to build a home would be just as well off as he is now, and he would also have the satisfaction of knowing that his fellow Australians were being kept in employment. Tbe honourable member for Boothby( Mr small in relation to tbe total area of the Duncan-Hughes) urged the necessity to preserve our forests. A similar contention was raised also in the letter which was read by the honourable member for Forrest. letter was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is signed by the secretary of the Associated Country Sawmillers of New South Wales. Admittedly he may be prejudiced; but so also is the gentleman who argued on behalf of the importing interests. This is what be saidSome people hold the opinion that our timber resources Should be carefully huspeople were unable to get oregon or banded. Those engaged ih the industry know maturity it rots and becomes useless. Further, an asset which has been going to waste for many years past will, in the event of an adequate tariff being enforced, turn to account a considerable amount of wealth which is now left to rot on the fields. Tbe New South Wales Country Sawmillers Association comprises a big body of men wbo are carrying on tbe industry throughout that State. Tbe Minister has granted protection against Oregon. We now plead with bim to see that it is also against Baltic timber. Tbe quantity of timbers of Baltic origin wbich was imported last year totalled no less than 90,000,000 super, feet. If one timber is penalized by tbe tariff another will take its place to a certain extent. I appeal to tbe Minister to close tbe door against all. There are one or two minor timbers, redwood for example, about which we hear scarcely anything. Tbey probably bave tbeir uses. I "" would put all timbers on the one level, and thus give our own industry a chance. It is estimated that 24,500,000 acres of land in Australia are capable of carrying good forest timber. Reafforestation has been commenced in every State and in the Federal Capital Territory, and good headway is being made. It is considered that if we were to devote our attention to the 24,500,000 acres to wbicb I have referred we should be able to grow sufficient timber to supply tbe wants of a population of 28,500,000 people. We shall bave to provide for that population in the distant future, but in the meantime Australian forests are quite capable of supplying our wants. Tbe extent of forest land in Australia is continent but large in proportion to our population. I hope the Minister will be convinced by the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members. The following reply to that I admit that Oregon and other softwoods are very useful, and carpenters find them mucb easier to work than hardwood. Architects and builders are continually finding new uses for them. Even in the vicinity of Canberra, timber bas actually been used for fencing and for underground purposes for which years ago nobody regarded it as at all suitable. Early in the history of this country our Baltic pine and had to rely on the local New South Wales has planted pinus inresources. Yet some of the oldest houses signis extensively, and I think these forin Australia are still in a good state of ests also are entitled to some protection repair although there is not a stick of from softwoods r-from abroad.

I am pleased that the Minister has decided to exclude Baltic pine and other soft timbers from tbe operations of this schedule, but I am sorry he has not taken the same view in regard to oregon, wbich is so much in demand for building purposes, especially weatherboard houses and other cheap buildings. The increased costs that will result from the imposition of these duties will be a severe handicap to very many citizens of slender means wbo desire to acquire homes of their own at small cost. If this item i * to be reconsidered, I hope that the Minister will, instead of extending the duties to those timbers wbich are now exempt, include oregon with tbem, and albandon the proposal to increase the duties. > While I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs on the amendment he brought down this afternoon, I hope that he will go a little further, because it is fooLsh to spoil a house for the sake of a coat of paint. He must realize that it is tbe wis'h''of tbe committee that his schedule should be revised to give, proI tection against dressed Baltic timbers. I hope that he will also increase the duties on Japanese cak, Pacific maple, and Borneo cedar, wbich particularly interfere with tbe tire of Australian bard woods for furniture making. A very serious omission from the dressed timber sub-item is Baltic timber. Its inclusion would mean the building up of an Australian industry for tbe supply of hardwood for weatherboards, flooring boards, and linby importations of oregon. The price of Oregon has come down so much in recent years that there is little possibility of our hardwjods competing with it, although it is not as suitable as Australian hardwoods for the purposes I have mentioned. The imposition of a sufficiently high duty to enable our hardwoods to compete witb oregon and Baltic timbers for building materials would mean the re-establishment of an industry giving For employment to 35,000 Australians. I have figures to show tbe languishing condition of our sawmilling trade. Out of 178 tion for wbich I am asking is not given. There are only 76 mills working in Tasmania out of 178, and I suppose the proportion is the same in the sawmilling industry throughout the Commonwealth. Out of 2,500 men formerly engaged in tbe industry in Tasmania, 1,780 are now unemployed, and I think that condition of affairs is typical of the industry throughout Australia. In the matter of wages, Australian millers are at a great disadvantage. In Scandinavia, which supplies the Baltic timber that competes witb Australian hardwood, the average wage is £2 8s. a week of 48 hours. The Australian timber-workers are paid £4 6s. a week of 48 hours. In America the timber worker is paid £4 a week for 51.8 hours. The Canadian timber worker gets £3 14s. 6d., and works from 48 to 54 hours a week. The position of the Australian miller is even worse in regard to freights.. Timber in 20-ft. lengths costs 8s. 6d. per 100 super, feet for hardwood, and 8s. for softwood, to ship from Cairns to Melbourne, and 6s. and 5s. 3d. from Brisbane to Melbourne.

Honourable members will thus see that the Australian timber industry is handicapped in every way. ""When tbe timber millers appeared before tbe Tariff Board they pledged themselves not to raise the price of timber if tbey could secure the market. To them it was a question of getting a sufficient turnover to enable tbem to make a profit. Tbey may not adhere to their pledge, but if tbey do raise the price of their timber it will be a matter for the Tariff Board. It is one of the duties qf the board to see that industries do not take advantage of tbe community that has afforded tbem protection. Tbere cannot, therefore, be any danger in giving the timber-millers tbe extia duty tbey seek. It has been said that the effect of an increase in duty will be io increase tbe cost of Avorkmeu's homes. Contractors have already daid that tbey are willing to contract to build a five-roomed hardwood cottage at a cost not more than £25 or £30 in excess of the cost of a similar cottage built of softwood. Tbe superior bouse he would get would be well worth the extra money. Mr G. M . Hudson, managing director of George Hudson Limited, one of our biggest timber importing firms supports tbe imposition of a duty of 15s. per 100 super, feet on dressed timber. Support for this particular duty comes from every quarter. As a matter of fact, any one who tries to get at the real facts and approaches tbe matter witb an unbiased mind, must realize the justice of tbe claim for an increase. Mr Le. G. Irby, Conservator of Forests in Tasmania, in bis annual report says:The position of the timber industry still remains very unsatisfactory. To permit without restriction, as is virtually the case to-day, Government of the State with the the flooding of the Australian markets with foreign timbers, the while glaring instances of alienation of magnificent forests and their wholesale destruction has continued almost unchecked for generations, is, to say the least of it, a peculiar policy. The specious argument, that such a policy helps to save our own forests shows either genuine ignorance of the subject or a deliberate attempt to gull the public by those whose monetary interests are identical with big American or Scandinavian lumbermen. The prime forests destroyed in practically all the Australian States during the past few decades alone would have maintained an adequate supply for many years. Forestry is gradually coming into its own in Australia, but its progress has been wilfully retarded by those interested persons, who have Mr Atkinson. forever' decried our own timbers in order that they might;'make greater wealth by handling the importedwoods of other countries. The Federal Government is exhibiting interest in forestry of late', and contemplating how it eon help in such a great national work, yet remains content to ignore the one method by which more could be accomplished at one stroke to invigorate the whole forest policy of Australia than in any other way. No action would have such a salutary and rapid effect on forestry as the bringing about of a full appreciation of our own timbers by adequately restricting the imported article. Speaking of the Tasmanian forests he also said that Tasmania could double the present output without fear of a timber famine. Tbe life of tbe Tasmanian forests is assessed at 90 years, but by that time regeneration assures a sustained yield for all time. There does not seem to be much in the argument we bave beard advanced, that we should use timbers from other parts of the world and reserve our own forests. As a matter of fact, tbere are trees in our forests which are decaying and should be thinned out. If fire is kept out of our forests a great many of them will renew themselves. I see little in the talk of reforestation in Australia. The bonorable member is getting altogether too far away from the item under discussion. connect my remarks witb tbe item, but I bow to your ruling because I want to bave a vote taken as soon as possible. However, I must point out something that bas not already been put before the committee. To-day in Tasmania a co-operative company of sawmillers is working in conjunction with the object of marketing timber economically, dressing it and seasoning it properly in order to compete witb imported timber. Another matter that bears on tbe debate, is that of tbe royalties wbich the Minister fears the States may increase. The Premier of Tasmania has declared that if the Commonwealth will provide a duty that will give the hardwoods of Australia a reasonable chance, be will cut the Tasmanian royalty in balf. Last year 85,000,000 feet of dressed timber came from overseas. If that timber had been dressed in Australia it-would have meant",71,Tabiff Ceeds

201,Mr Atkinson,"I think I coulda distribution of £85,000 among Australian workers. I shall not delay tbe committee any longer, altbougb I bave sat bere all day trying to catcb the Chairman's eye, but I must say that the importations of Baltic timber give very little chance to the Australian hardwoods in tbe building lines for which they are so superior weatherboards, flooring boards aud linings-and that the importations of Japanese oak and similar wood do not permit of the use of Australia's beautiful hardwoods for furniture making. If we allow timber produced by tbe cheap labour of the East to oust our own superior timber from our markets, it will be a very poor advertisement for our White Australia policy. is tbe first time that I have spoken on the tariff during this debate, and therefore bonorable members cannot accuse me of wasting the time of tbe Parliament on this occasion. I have always had strong convictions in regard to the tariff, and I bave never regarded it from a party stand-point. I have considered it from a national outlook, and I regret exceedingly that in dealing witb the tariff as we are to-day, we are drifting into a condition of absolute degeneracy. I do not intend to discuss the respective values of imported softwoods and local hardwoods. They are both valuable. The Australian timber industry must ultimately be of immense value to this country, but for many years tbe preservation of our forests has not been receiving half the attention that it sbould have received. We should ensure our timber requirements, not for ten or twenty years, but for 100 years ahead. These two timbers cannot come into competition because each bas its respective uses. Eveni f the tariff is increased on softwoods, they will still be largely imported into this country. The Minister has acted outrageously in setting aside the recommendations of the Tariff Board in respect of the timber industry. We cannot keep imported softwoods out of this country except at an enormous cost to the taxpayers. knows that the taxpayers bave suffered too long, and this debate on the tariff will do more than anything else to organize a movement outside this Parliament, protesting against the excessive and unjust duties. For years past, we have collected [122] between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 in customs revenue in excess of estimates. This is an outrageous tariff, and never in my political experience have I seen one like it. It is being forced upon this country in spite of the recommendations of tbe Tariff Board. We sbould concentrate more on tbe conservation of our forests. I sbould like to refer at this stage to an ex-Governor General of Australia, now Earl .Novar, who is recognized as an expert on forestry, and whose income is largely derived from forest lands. While in Australia tbere was no subject dearer to his heart than forestry, and he fretted considerably because of the shocking neglect of our forests. We bave a wealth of literature on afforestation, supporting the view of Earl Novar that Australia has magnificent timbers, and that they should be conserved scientifically and scrupulously. Some authorities even advise us to limit our output so that later we may reap immense wealth from this industry. I am proud of tbe fact that I was the first member in this Parliament to recommend the establishment of the Tariff Board. It was when tbe Massy Greene tariff was being discussed. Mr Massy Greene, then Minister for Trade and Customs, when imposing additional duties, did not take the people unawares. He gave every, one a fair spin, and no man had a better name in the community than he did, simply because tbe people trusted him. In view of our insistence, he agreed to the appointment of the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board has since rendered valuable service to this country, but at a time wben we need its guidance most, its recommendations have been set aside. I do not expect the Minister to be a dummy, but my conception of tbe Tariff Board is that dt was established for the guidance, not of the Government alone but of Parliament. The members of tbe board have had considerable experience of the conditions of Australian industries, and their recommendaGod tions bave, in most cases, been wholly adopted; but this Government has taken the extreme and unprecedented step of setting aside the board's recommendations altogether an action which we all deemed to be almost an impossibility.

The present Prime Minister, when Treasurer, said that no more should be taken out of the pockets of the people than was necessary for purposes of public administration; yet in recent years, in spite of disastrous times, we bave been collecting annually from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 in excess of estimates. This sort of thing must stop. A lot of rubbish has been talked in this chamber on tariff matters. -Honourable members must realize that this additional duty will do nothing except make timber more costly. Sooner or later tbe people of Australia will squeal against being tortured on the economic rack, and I hope that tbey will continue squealing until those responsible for such impositions are brought to tbeir senses. this instance I find myself in strange company. I feel strongly tbe necessity for protection being given to those engaged in our timber industry. There is a very earnest desire on tbe part of the people of Australia to protect our forests.

A few years ago one could erect -a 'wooden house fo.r a reasonable sum, ,!;but now tbe price is exorbitant.

Wben one looks around this building and sees the magnificent blaekwood that bas been used to beautify it, one is surprised that we bave been unable to establish a big export timber trade. I congratulate the Government upon establishing a. forestry school, wbich will extend and improve our reafforestation system. I think that it would even be wise to take advantage of the cheap softwoods that are obtainable from overseas and conserve our own softwoods, for a time of shortage must inevitably dome. Tbe timber resources of Canada and the United States of America are rapidly becoming depleted. Tbe United States of America consumes millions of cubic feet of timber annually in tbe manufacture of paper alone. By preserving our own timber, and utilizing cheap timber from abroad, the cost of house-building in Australia would be cheapened. Oregon an'd other cheap timbers are excellent for a certain type of work, but discrimination sbould be exercised in the use of our own timbers. If this heavy duty is imposed, we shall prohbit foreign softwoods from honourable coming into Australia, and deplete our own better-class timber's.

Statistics show that tbere bas been a fairly even cut of timber since 1911. There certainly has been no annual reduction. Last year there was a slight increase in the quantity cut. Western Australia has very successfully marketed its hardwoods. Recently over 1,000,000 feet pf. jarrah was .used for flooring .purposes in two buildings erected in Sydney.

207,. Mr Gregory,"I thought that itexperienced under the Navigation Act, and of the enormous expense entailed in bringing timber across to tbe mainland. It is rather difficult to adjust sucb matters. I have been endeavouring to induce the Government to take some action in that direction. Every bonorable member must recognize that if higher duties are imposed tbe cost of imported timber must increase. I find that during 1923-24 tbe price margin in favour of Oregon varied from ls. 6d. in July, 1923, to 3s. 6d. in January; i924, and 4s. from April, 1924, until the end of June in that year. Even if a higher duty is imposed upon Oregon1 do not think its use in Australia will be decreased to any, great extent, but the cost of al} softwoods used in the Commonwealth will be greater, thus imposing a heavy burden upon those engaged in building operations. I congratulate the Minister for displaying a little common sense in connection with this schedule by allowing the BrokenH ill mines to obtain oregon free of duty. That ought to have been done long ago, as tbe mining companies on the Barrier, have had to use tens of millions bf super, feet of oregon. These duties will affect South Australia very materially, as the supplies of timber in that State are limited. Generally speaking, I can see no justification at all for the increase. The Tariff Board, in wbich I have not the same confidence as the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), has investigated the question of timber duties and. submitted a recommendation beyond which the Government has gone, owing perhaps to political pressure. I could understand the Government for political and economic reasons imposing lower duties than the board recommended, but I cannot understand its attitude in submitting duties in excess of those recommended by a tribunal specially appointed to make the fullest inquiries. I Understand that an amendment is already before the committee, but when that, has been disposed of, it is my intention 'to move that the duties recommended by.,tbe Tariff, Board be adopted1 trust tbe Minister will accept the motion moved by tbe honourable mem;hef for Robertson ( Mr Gardner), for tbe postponement of tbe item, since as,, in tbe absence of tbe latest information, tbere is a good deal of uncertainty concerning tbe actual position. When the Tariff Board first considered timber duties, it presented, in 1925, an interim report. The subject was further considered and additional evidence was taken in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, but not in Queensland or Western Australia. The Australian source of softwoods is Queensland, and the principal source of hardwood is, I believe, Western Australia; but additional evidence was not taken in either of those States to bring the information before the board up to date. Tbe Tariff Board's report suggests that there is a shortage of softwoods iu Queensland, but tbere is a great deal of controversy even on that question. I bave before me information from a Queensland source, which readsA great deal has been said about the scarcity of Queensland pine. The Queensland Forestry Board, some months ago, "" rationed"" the trade, witli the result that importers were encouraged to flood the market and at present the Queensland mills generally have on hand enormous quantities of pine and other timbers for which no market can be found. This position apparently exists even at the State saw. mills, for the Auditor-General in his latest report calls attention to the great increase in' .stocks of pine timbers Wliich wore in the saw-mill yards belonging to the State Sawmills Department. The saw-millers through their association, quite recently asked, for a suspension of their contracts for six months, as they were unable to find a market for the enormous quantity of pine logs and pine timber iii their yards. With reference to tbe Atherton Tableland's softwoods. and cabinet timbers, I bave before me a letter from the Cairns and District Saw-millers Association, in which it is stated' The present condition of the industry is distressing. It is not developing ; rather is it retrogressing. The capital invested is not merely dormant; it is wasting.' Matured timber instead of being marketed and becoming wealth in tlie form of manufactured goods, is rotting in the' bush. Three million super, feet of cabinet timbers now mature and waiting harvesting' cannot be marketed because foreign timbers supersede it . The letter was written ontbe 29th September, 1927,' and continues-^ In three months' time another similar quant it y will be available. ! What then? Must, this wealth be allowed to rot, or eventually, find a second' or third class market? ' . The Cairns and District Sawmillers Association represents the views of the proprietors of twenty saw-mills in which",74,Tabiff Ceeds
208,Mr G. Francis (Kennedy)'[9.33],"£750,000 of hard, cold cash has been invested. Tbey object very strongly to tbe proposed free admission of timber for mining purposes, as they contend that Australia produces the finest quality of timbers am reminded by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that there is only one mining district in which imported timber is used; but even if timber for mining purposes is imported free of duty it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for the department to exercise suflicient supervision to see that it is used only for that purpose. It is said that when tbe forest area of a country falls below .86 acres per head of the population it must import its requirements, but not otherwise. Australia's forest area at present is approximately 4.08 acres. If our timber areas were properly cultivated and worked, tbey would supply sufficient for a population of 2S,000,000. Australia bas a population of only 6,000,000, yet we are importing enormous quantities of timber. This question cannot be disposed of have no timber fied types, bers may be more suitable than those wbich we produce. I suggest to the Minister that in view of tbe different opinions expressed in this chamber the consideration of this item should be deferred until tbe Tariff Board or some other authority has again investigated the position and reported to Parliament. In the circumstances I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Robertson cause I believe the schedule submitted by the Minister is not sufficiently comprehensive, since it deals only with undressed oregon timbers and the protection proposed, in my opinion, is inadequate. I cannot see any reference to dressed timbers or to hemlock, wbich is grown in large quantities in British Columbia. ""We have also suffered from the heavy importations of Baltic. Large quantities of Pacific maple and Russian oak are likewise imported, and these timbers which compete with out cabinet timbers are often seriously affected with borers, which add to the pests which we already have in Australia. I trust the Mr G-. Francis. Minister will accept the amendment by the honourable member for Robertson and postpone the consideration of this item. [9.43] I wish to reply to a statement for such requirements. I of tbe honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr Atkinson), wbo.said that a person building a home would not object to its cost being increased to the extent of £25 or £30. That would mean a good deal to a married man, and I suggest that before tbe bonorable member repeats his assertion he sbould undertake the responsibilities of a man who bas to maintain a family. I congratulate those persons who bave recently been so busy about this chamber in connection witb timber duties, and who, if tbey applied tbe same energy to their work as they do to their lobbying activities, would be more prosperous. They would not then be crying out for higher duties. In this connection I am reminded of a book wbich I read some time ago in connection with tbe timber industry in Tasmania, entitled The Timber Wolves. I represent a State which may be regarded as one of the by merely saying that we lambs which the timber wolves will of certain specieventually devour. Tbe South Australian or that certain timtimber supplies are limited, and tbe people in that State have to carry on as best they can under these heavy duties. most of tbe imported timber. in South Australia, and my State will feel the increase more than any other.

These increased duties will mean an impost per bead in South Australia of l is . 8£d., but will not affect Queensland, Western Australia or Tasmania, so it ill becomes the representatives of those States to act as "" spruik'ers "" for higher duties. There appears to be growing up in this chamber a practice of exchanging favours, on the principle of "" Y o u vote for my duties, and I will vote for yours."" that put up to me.

213,Mr Parsons,"Well, I have l a dobtained disclose that tbe total duties colindustry in this country will be placed lected last year on the items which the Government proposes to so greatly increase approximated £590,000. Competent authorities estimate that these increased duties will mean another £480,000. The timber duties last year realized £1,349,546 so that the proposed increases will mean that tbe revenue will be £1,830,000. I take this opportunity to remind the representatives of Tasmania that South Australia is a very good customer of that State in connection with its timber business, and that every good busiuess man looks after bis customers. During 1925-26 South Australia imported from Tasmania 10,9S5,927 feet and from Western Australia 36,184,800 feet, or a total of 47,170,727 feet. In tbe same year the importations of undressed softwoods, including oregon, amounted to 46,292,035 feet. It is gratifying to know that the representatives of Western Australia in this chamber are not decrying the ability of the industry in that State to carry on without being spoon-fed. According to the bonorable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) and tbe honourable members for Swan( Mr Gregory) tbe industry in Western Australia is not in need of high protection. That is really the attitude which we, as Australians, should adopt as a general principle. During tbe war we were able to do many things because we all pulled together. Unfortunately in more recent years tbere seems to be a disposition on the part of many persons engaged in industry to see in what way tbey can protect themselves from competition, so as to be able to lead a more or less lazy life. I am much concerned about the trend of events. I am a moderate protectionist. I have been twitted by honourable members with inconsistency because whilst I have been a strong advocate for tbe payment of a bounty on the production of wine, I have opposed duties on many other items. Tbere is a vast difference between tbe bounty on wine, which has already been reduced by ls a gallon, and wbich it is hoped by the industry will evetnually be unnecessary, and tbe imposition of high and still higher duties for the protection of certain secondary industries. We are continually being told that if only Parliament will agree to tbe imposition of higher duties, on a sure and safe foundation. I am wondering where this business will end. These higher duties represent protection to the extent of 150 per cent. Surely it is a reflection upon the enterprise of Australians engaged in this industry, to suggest that without this measure of protection they are unable to carry on. It has been said that our hardwood timbers are unsuitable for building purposes. I bave nothing to say against Australian timbers, except that I believe they are far too good to be used as floor joists and for flooring. I sbould like to see them put to better use. I can speak witb some experience on this matter, because I happen to be the owner of a house that was built during tbe war. At the time tbere was no oregon available for tbe roof rafters, so the builders used hardwood, which warped to such an extent that the tiles sagged very badly. An expert advised me that the whole of tbe fault was with the roof timbers. I then made it my business to make further inquiries, and I ascertained that wbereever hardwood timber bad been used for roof rafters, it shrank appreciably and the tiles sagged. I do not know what timber'is used in tbe roof of tbe Hotel Kurrajong, but I do know that whenever rain comes the roof leaks very badly. Tbese duties, as tbe honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) bas told us, will mean an increase of £30 in tbe price of a five-roomed timber house. Some bonorable members dismissed that as if it were a mere trifle, and I remind tbem of tbe old Scotch saying, "" Mony a mickle mak's a muckle."" A little here and a little there in the cost of a house means a great deal to the man who is on the bread line, and whose wages have to be adjusted from time to time to meet changed conditions due to the increased cost of living. Their position reminds me of tbe man who is chasing a wounded game fowl, but does not succeed in capturing it. Unfortunately for a certain section of tbe people, they never seem to catch up to the increased cost of living. I am surprised that, wben duties are being imposed on practically everything in connection with timber, we are not called npon to consider an item to impose a duty on wooden tooth-picks. I am very much concerned about this continual increase in the cpst of living. Wheat to-day costs 4s. 7d. to produce. What will happen if tbe cost of production rises to sucb a level that it will not be profitable to export our staple product. Is it suggested that wheat production in Australia shall one day be limited to tbe capacity of tbe Australian market, or does the Government contemplate paying an export bounty? Tbe same remarks may be applied to tbe wool industry. All honourable members wbo have any knowledge of wool-growing know that it is not now so attractive a proposition as it was a few years ago. The time has come when we should take stock of our position. My opposition to these duties is, in effect, endorsed by tbe bonorable member for Wilmot, who should be an authority on this matter. He bas told us that tbese duties will mean an increase of £30 in tbe cost of a five-roomed bouse. It is refreshing to have such an admission as that from a supporter of these imposts. I take the view that, if an industry requires more protection than, say, 75 per cent, of tbe landed cost of an article to keep its head above water, it sbould no longer be encouraged. I intend to support tbe ministerial proposal, not because I believe in it, but because I believe that half a loaf is better than no bread. In other words, I should rather be stunned than absolutely killed. Earlier in the debate I indicated that, in my view, the Australian timber industry could be protected more effectively by means of a bounty, wbich would not have the effect of increasing the cost of houses in Australia to the same extent as duties would, and I suggest now that the Minister should submit this proposal to the Tariff Board. Honourable members who did not favour the idea desired to know from what source the funds for the payment of the bounty would be' obtained. My proposal is that the 1924 duty sbould stand, and have added to it Is. per 100 feet to create a fund out of which to pay a bounty on all locally-produced timber. Tbe CHAIRM AN ( Mr Bayley) Order! The honourable gentleman is not in order in discussing a bounty on an item imposing customs duties. due respect to you, Mr Chairman, that I am in order in explaining to the committee . the method by wbicb necessary funds for tbe proposed bounty can be obtained. I am entitled to' show an alternative system that will provide a fund for tbe endowment Of tbe timber industry Consequently, I contend that my proposals are relevant to tbe item before the committee. Tbe CHAIRMAN -The bonorable member may not, on this item, discuss a proposed bounty scheme in detail. to do that, then I cannot demonstrate the merits of my proposal. All I wisb to state is that tbe needs. qf this great industry may be provided for without increasing beyond tbe ls. for the bounty fund the cost of imported and local 'timber, as provided for in tbe schedule and tbe Minister's amendment. Take tbe timber industry of Queensland. There tbe Provision? 1 Forestry Board takes an opposite view of the industry from that of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), and the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis), who have described .what is, I believe, only a passing phase of the industry due fo financial depression, the falling bff in . the building trade, and overmilling Of timber. Those honourable members would bave us believe that those conditions have been brought about by tbe importation of foreign timbers. The report of the Forestry Board of Queensland for the year ended SOtb June, 1926, statedAvoiding the free play of the laws of competition and survival of the fittest, the sawmilling industry has chosen to adopt a mutually protective purchasing organization under which it buys raw material for the. industry non-com pctitively from the Forest Service at upset prices, and proceeds to allot to each of its Members an apportioned share of the purchases. This method involves the sharing of the deficiency in supplies of raw material amongst the industry as a whole, so that each unit sawmill accepts shoi t time rather than that 'the life of the least efficient should become forfeit at competition. The arrangement is in the nature of an antisuicide ciub, and the industry is clearly entitled to adopt it . The Forest Service has no criticism to offt r beyond the reflection that",76,Tabiff Ceeds

216,Mr Rodgers,"If I am not entitledthe weight of the accumulating shortage inevitably must have its eventual way in determining those units whicli by reason of efficiency iu location und management are best fitted to serve the lomniiuiity's need in wood. Tlie honourable member for Wide .Bay challenged a statement previously made by me, and for his information I ahull put On record another se-Jtion of the reportThe general diminution of the pine supplies of Queensland, and the particular diminution at rail, because of the extension of bush-milling operations must force upon the attention of town and city mills a consideration of other alternatives in raw material. Already the reduction in the native pine log yield is beiug marked by a corresponding increase in the importation of cheap building softwoods from abroad. To supply the accumulating deficit in tlie local softwood supplies, Queensland has no possible alternative but to enlarge its importations. Between 192G and 1952 we will have to buy from foreign countries over £30,000,000 worth of coniferous wood. . Surely the Forestry Board must be the accepted public authority in Queensland on this subject. What is tbe use. of saying that Queensland can supply tbe timber requirements of the Commonwealth? the Forestry Board's statement alongside that of tbe bonorable member. The timber industry of Queensland is in much the same condition as that of the other States. Australia bas before it tbe dreadful spectre of the forests in all States, except, perbaps, two, being denuded within the next 30 to 50 years at the present rate of cutting, unless a vigorous re-afforestation policy is adopted. Unless we materially increase the available supply of locally-grown timber, it will be necessary for us to import more softwoods for our requirements. . Probably no country uses more hardwood in proportion to its timber requirements than does Australia, and I cannot accept the statement that the imposition of the extra duty would make large quantities of Australian timber available to take the place of the imported softwoods. If it did that, our forests would be denuded at an alarmingly rapid rate, and then we should be placed at the mercy of foreign importations even more than we are now. We have too many milling plants to-day, a result of the absence of importations during the war years wben there was a large demand for local timber 11 profitable rates. Those good years for the industry, and the prosperity that followed, bave passed. The milling industry, like almost every other, is now experiencing bad times, but on that ground alone we should not impose a duty that will further embarrass the nation by adding to the cost of every home, including. those that the Government will have to finance under tbe bousing scheme. The imposition of a charge of ls. per 100 super, feec ou all imported timbers would raise a sum sufficient to provide £110,000 for a bounty of 6d. per 100 feet, and leave £103,000 for an afforestation subsidy, research work, and organization of the marketing of' Australian timber. I regret, Mr Chairman, that your ruling prevents the committee from giving tbe country a sane alternative to the proposed duty. By imposing an additional tax of Is. per 100 feet on imported timber we could create a bounty fund equal to tbe duty now proposed and provide an additional £103,000 for afforestation purposes. In that case, it is foolish for tbe Government to persist in imposing tbe proposed high duties, thus adding to our financial and economic difficulties. We cannot for ever continue to pile'tax upon tax, duty upon duty, obligation upon obligation, and expect them to be met by a population of 6,000,000 people. Australia has already incurred a public debt amounting to approximately £l;016,000;000. In many directions we bave heavy obligations to meet. Our interest commitments alone represent tbe value of this year's wool clip, and. the total pension bill of £17,800,000 will absorb the value of this year's export wheat. Rather than, that we sbould continue to pile up duty upon duty it would be better for the Minister and the Tariff Board to seek alternative means of meeting the situation such as I have suggested. for Trade and Customs) [10.12] -In stating that tbe Government intends to Stand by its proposals, I desire to set out the basis on which tbey were arrived at.

219,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Ministerthat body recommended tbe imposition of an increased duty of ls. 6d. per 100 feet on timber 12 inches by 6 inches, 2s. per 100 feet on timber 7 inches by 1\ inches, 2s. per 100 feet on dressed timber, and various increases on box timber. Tbe Government is not desirous of increasing the duty on box timber, particularly in view of the fact that boxes are required to market our primary products. Consequently it does not agree with the recommendation to increase the duties on box timber. Nor does it agree that the small increases proposed in respect of scantling timber would do mucb to assist tbe timber industry; they would rather be in the nature of revenue duties. The Government, therefore, while desirous of doing something for the timber industry and ' those employed in it, submitted proposals to increase tbe duties on only three items by 4s. per 100 feet-an average of a little more than double the amount recommended by the Tariff Board. It thinks that its proposals afford tbe maximum of benefit with the minimum of cost to the country. Tbe Government also considers that as the duties proposed will enable tbe Australian timber industry to attack, with a reasonable chance of success, almost half the imports jlons of foreign timber, the industry is being assisted appreciably. Tbe Government does not propose to make any alterations in the .duty on Baltic timber, wbicb comes here as flooring boards and lining boards, and is used chiefly in the more modest dwellings, particularly in tbe vicinity of the ports of Australia. moved by tbe honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner) to postpone the item is agreed to, the Government will regard it as an indication that tbe committee wants Baltic timber included witb the oregon item. The Government is not at all convinced that the proposal is economically sound. There is much to be said as to tbe value of our unique hardwoods in the markets of tbe world. I point out that if the importation of timber is increasing, so also is the local production of hardwoods and Australian timbers generally. The Government bas no desire to make and will not be a party to making tbe cheaper timbers required for thc smaller dwellings in Australia dearer than tbey are to-day. In its opinion any increase in duty in respect Mr Pratten. of Baltic timbers will increase the cost of the class of bouse to which I have alluded and will not be worth the cost. I repeat that if this item is postponed, to which I hope the committee will not agree, the Government will regard it as an indication that the committee insists that Baltic and otber timbers shall be included in the Oregon item.

Tbe Tariff Board did not recommend it because it understood that it would involve certain administrative difficulties, but my officers bave informed me that that is not so. not object to the amendment, but I point out that there is a likelihood that it may inflict an injustice upon the Australian manufacturers because of tbe way in which it is worded. I suggest that the exemption should apply only to records which are invoiced at more than 2s. 6d. each. ancl Dale records are expensive. bility enter made During tbe last few years tbe gramophone record making industry has been developed in Australia in a remarkable way. About 70 per cent, of tbe records we use are stamped here from tbe matrices obtained from abroad. In the great majority of cases tbe master records are made overseas, where artists are available; but Mr Alfred O'Shea, a notable Australian tenor has recorded twelve or thirteen remarkably fine records for the Columbia Company. As tbe years go by and our population increases, undoubtedly many artists will record here just as tbe artists are doing to-day in otber countries. We bave established this industry, and there are many hundreds of men and women who are engaged in it on good, clean, wholesome work. It does not require a great organization or plant to do the stamping of records. Tbere is, to me, no reason, if Columbia and otlier gramophone record-makers can establish tbeir plants in Sydney for the mere stamping from Master records, why the Edison Company cannot do the same. If this is such a small matter as bas been represented, tbere bas been a remarkable amount of publicity and organization carried on in connection with it. Manufacturers of records in Australia state that tbey do not oppose tbe exclusion of H ill and Dale Diamond Disc records from tbe tariff so long as they are not below 2s. 6d. each, but while they may not oppose it before tbe Tariff Board now, I venture to say that in a very short time they will go before the board and ask that Edison records be placed on tbe same basis as tbeir own. I believe that we should help manufacturers in Australia to establish industries bere, and that we should encourage those with capital to come to Australia to set up factories in this country. But while I am prepared to help Australian manufacturers, I cannot, and will not, help manufacturers to exclude from this tariff something which is adversely affecting tbeir trade to-day. No matter what kind of gramophone it is, and no matter what kind of record is played, that record and that pramaphone, if imported, are that they may become cheaper and entering into competition with the Ausinto competition with the locally tralian-made articles. I ask the Comrecords. mittee and the Minister to leave the item as it stands. I believe that within three months of tbe passing of this duty as it stands in the schedule the Edison Company, notwithstanding the allegedly small part its products play in the gramophone trade in this country, will establish its industry in Australia under Australian conditions, and that will help to build up what will ultimately become a very great industry. I do hope that nothing will be done to break down the principle of protection of this very fine industry. For those reasons I urge tbe Minister not to exclude H ill and Dale records from tbe tariff schedule.

Item 365 (Pianos)[10.39] I sbould like the Minister to state whether tbe recommendation of the Tariff Board in the general tariff was for a £30 or £40 minimum. It has been widely stated that tbe minimum was £30, but, by a reference to tbe report of the Board, it appears to me that it is set out at £40. Trade and Customs) [10.40] -This item in the foreign schedule exactly follows the recommendation of the Tariff Board. It does not in tbe British schedule follow the recommendations for this reason: About £50,000 worth of pianos are imported annually from England, and about £1,000,000 worth of pianos from America. It was considered by tbe Government that if tbe recommendation of the Tariff Board was followed in the foreign schedule, there would be a possibility of putting a very large amouut of. business in tbe way, not only of local manufacturers of pianos, but of British manufacturers as well. Consequently the foreign schedule is exactly in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board, and the Britisb schedule is identical with the duties that have been in operation for some time.

Because a tin-pot mine in Queensland produces a small quantity, a duty is proposed. I cannot understand tbe reason for sucb an imposition.

Postponed item 58. (Cornflour). Trade and Customs) [10.48] I move That the item be omitted. This item was included with the intenr tion of rectifying what is clearly an anomaly in tbe tariff. Tbe duty on starch flour is different from that on .cornflour. It is difficult to distinguish between the two commodities, and for some time past the department has bad to analyse every consignment that bas been sent to Australia. The importation under the heading "" cornflour "" is not great. Since this proposal was made, I have ascertained that cornflour is the raw material for several other substantial industries connected witb the manufacture of custard powder, and that tbe rectification of this anomaly would create another by upsetting, tbe balance of those industries.
