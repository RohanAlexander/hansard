Certain correspondence passed between him andi myself on that matter, which with his consent I shall be delighted to allow the public to see as early as pqssible. I took then the step that I thought was necessary and proper, and I did so because I was committed by a promise to individuals who were not then in Australiaa promise which I made before the House rose in December'last. There could, therefore, be no doubt as to what was in my mind regarding the time when Parliament should again be called together. Prime Minister communicated with me later on and suggested that Parliament should be convened earlier, because of the urgency of the Dreadnought proposal and other matters. I did not think that proposal was necessary at that time, nor do I think so now. I was not in doubt at any time regarding it, but that will clo for another occasion. with business at once, this one should. The principle of the fusion which has taken place has been continuously discussed by the honourable member for Parramatta and *he Prime Minister since early in this year. There is no more experienced parliamentarian than the Prime Minister, and he It is a very simple has associated with him the right honourable member for Swan, who is also one of our oldest parliamentarians; the honourable member for Parramatta, who had Ministerial experience many years ago; and the honourable member for Angas, who has also had great experience; while the Honorary Minister, the honourable member for BrisMayI offer my congratulations bane, has also had experience of Ministerial office. What is .perhaps even more important in this matter is that the Minisever been suggested. I should like to hear I should say if I were the Prime Minister on that aspect of the question. If that sort of thing were to continue it would be possible to suborn Parliament. If an indefinite number of Honorary Ministers are to be appointed to I have alsuit a peculiar situation, then this Parliament should seriously take the matter into consideration. I cannot congratulate the Prime Minister on his attitude in that reI desire to afgard in forming this Government. Moreover, of these ten capable and experienced men, no fewer than seven are lawyers. The Prime Minister himself, the honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Angas, Senator Best, ancl the honourable member for Brisbane are all lawyers. The only three who are not lawyers are the honourable member for Parramatta, the right honourable member for Swan, and Senator Millen. That is the kind of Government who are asking for a long adjournment, and they are led by the very honourable member who said, regarding the Governor General's Speech, that everything was ready to go straight on, an|d that the majority of those who were then on this side desired to proceed immediately with the business of the country. He has now had The his opportunity, yet he asks for three weeks' adjournment. May I remind him that he said that the reason for tlie sudden death motion which put the late Government out was a desire to get on with business at once? The Prime Minister shakes his head.

Consequently, the Government are looking forward, not only to an adjournment of three weeks, during which they will be under no parliamentary control, and will bring nothing before Parliament, but also to a further three weeks of debate on the Address-in-Reply, according to the honourable member for Lang, thus giving them six weeks before any Bills will be brought forward.

In view of the action which they took then, it will be quite fitting at least, deprived the Prime Minister of tlie if they do so. The new Minister of Defence referred to his present leader's party, when speaking at Ipswich not long ago, in terms the effect of which was that ""The Deakin Party were like a lot of fowls out in the rain, poor same speech that the honourable member for Ballarat was "" despised and rejected of men."" the phrase, but it is an offensive one, and perhaps I had better not.

So far as I am concerned, no time of the House will be wasted; I shall and I shall not now reproach them.

I feel sure, however, that nothing any one can say on this side would be of the slightest effect, in view of the solid phalanx on the other side, who, for the best of all reasons in the world, have decided to do what they have done, and are compelled now to remain, while they are permitted to remain, for as long as possible. 1 than_ the instance now before us, although JOHN FORREST -The honourable I still see, unhappily, on the benches sion who have been unable to find a resting place.",16,Special Adjournment

It may be that we have not seen the end of this canvas, and that there are still more films to be unrolled-that more golden opportunities are yet to be displayed, because on the majority of the faces, I see some small remnants of that expectant smile that marked them a little while ago. But I understand that this is a method invariably resorted to from the beginning of coalition governments-in order to placate gentlemen whose intentions, as well as their political views, are somewhat uncertain-and that the Prime Minister has done his best with the means at his disposal. that there is another billet, at any rate, clearly in view, seeing that some honourable member has to go to England with the Minister of Defence. eleven; and there is yet another billet, which will dispose of twelve. chagrin of the honourable member. ancy ! ber has been unfortunate in his choice of a profession which does hot find such favour in the arena of polities as that of the law. this side ! I shall not further indicate the billet to the honourable member ; I feel sure it will occur to him if he throws his mind back a little, ancl also to certain other honourable members. I see that the Prime Minister, in the course of a debate last week, saidI am inviting honourable members to exercise self-restraint in order that the business of this Parliament may be advanced at once to some important stage. It was this stage which the honourable gentleman had in his mind, and it is a stage broad, and capable of holding many performers for what they fervently hope will be a very long while. It is a play we are to be treated to with an interminable number of acts, in which the various characters will play many parts, a role for which, I venture to say, the leader is admirably fitted. However, I should like to ask some honourable gentlemanI do not know whom -whethe r all the ten members of the Ministry have been sworn in? ary Minister-wh o could not be found after two hours' searching, in order to tell him of the time. them. the Honorary Minister has not been sworn in yet? was swearing at a dentist just about that time. quite immaterial what one says or what one does.

There are some honourable members on the Treasury bench whom I can heartily congratulate, for, as far as I am aware, they have made no sacrifice. They take office uncler circumstances in which' their reputation and their honour are unsmirched. I notice, however, that some honourable members have been included in the Ministry who were not particularly desirous of entering it, and that manv have been excluded who, from what one' could see, were very anxious to be selected. We shall awaif with what patience we mav the submission of the Ministerial programme, but I venture to sav that the Government know very well that no programme of the slightest service to this country that they will bring forward has the remotest prospect of beinoplaced on the statute-book this session. Ao one knows that better than does the Prime Minister himself. No one knows better than he how urgent it is that the defence of the Commonwealth should be put on a proper footing; vet no one has done more than he has clone to nrevent it being so placed. I shall be readv to grant the Ministry a fortnight's adjournment. I do not think that they ought to ask for more. Indeed, they do not require more time.

I shall vote against the proposed adjournment for three weeks. constrained to avail myself of the present opportunity to offer my congratulations to the honourable gentlemen who have been so recently elevated to the Treasury bench. I offer my special congratulations to the Prime Minister on the team he has selected to work with him during the present session. I do not agree with the view expressed by an honourable member who has preceded me, that it is unnecessary at the present stage to have in the Cabinet so many members of the legal profession. It seems to me absolutely clear that such ateam, constituted as it is, and representing what it does, needs all the legal advice possible to clear its path of the intricacies that will ultimately beset it. Some people may be disposed to say that as there are seven lawyers in the Cabinet it is the "" Devil's Brigade."" I shall not apply that epithet to it. I think, however, that the public will consider it, to say the least, remarkable that in such a Parliament as this a Cabinet cannot be formed without the selection of seven lawyers. I do not object to them personally, but I do object to so ""many legal men being at the helm of any Government, whether it be that of the Commonwealth or of a State. I have a decided repugnance to the presence of so many lawyers in a Ministry, for authorities have declared it to be dangerous to have too many members of the legal profession manning the ship of State. stand ber has my sympathy in that he has not been made a -member of the Cabinet; but I feel confident that he and the other members of his profession in the House will have plenty to do in connection with the Ministry before the session is over. The honourable member and his brother medicos In the House need have no fear of being unemployed; they will have plenty of work in soothing the nerves of those who now occupy the Treasury bench. congratulate the Prime Minister upon having included in his Cabinet an honourable gentleman-no t yet sworn in-wh o was in iimes gone by a champion of black labour in another State. To the credit of the Prime Minister be it said, that up to the present time he has fought courageously and patriotically for a White Australia. What, then, will the people say when they find in his Cabinet honourable' members whom he himself described not long ago as "" the wreckage' of the black labour party."" For my own part I ask for nothing better than the Ministry now facing us; we could not wish to see the Government differently constituted. We are told that those whom the gods seek to destroy they first make mad, and I think that will be applicable to the Government when they go before the people in the days to come. I wish them well, and shall endeavour to observe the forms of the House, although I shall feel it my duty to oppose a Ministry constituted and supported as is this new Government. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume) [3.8] I do not wish to speak at length, because, whether we adjourn for a fortnight or for three weeks, we shall soon have an opportunity to fully discuss the proposals and the constitution of this hybrid Ministry. I take this opportunity of congratulating the Prime Minister on his new phase of topsyturvydom, and the shandy-gaff conditions under which he now holds office. half, for some are "" black "" and some are "" white."" Sir WILLIA M LYNE I shall refer presently to that phase of the question. I am sure that I shall not be misunderstood when I say that I am deeply grieved to find the Prime Minister, who was once my chief, and with whom, and for whom, I once worked so ardently, mixed up with such a motley crew. order ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Yes; the honourable member is one of the motley crew. I am greatly grieved to find the Prime Minister associated with honourable members, sharing with him the highest positions in the service of the Commonwealth, who are mixed in policy, and also mixed in honour. I am not complaining of those who have swallowed the late Protectionist party. They have alI ways been opposed to us and to our Tariff, though some of them have not carried out the pledges which they gave at the last election, and by means of which they were returned.

I think there never was an instancs in the history of the world, I might almost say, which parallels ihe present case. There never was a time when, if I may make the remarks without -applying them personally, so much was -done for the degradation of a Constitution and a policy, and to foster everything that is worse in the politics of a country. If I may assume the role of prophet, I say that the present state of affairs will not 'be tolerated by the honourable and honest citizens of Australia. Dishonesty in politics is a serious offence, for which every man who sells his principles should be branded tis traitor on the back, the shoulders, and in fact all over. orable politician to stand alone, or to retire with honour and his good name from public life than, through greed of power or lucre, to accept unholy office, selling principles which have been fought for, not by him alone, but by others for so many years past. There is in some of the Constitutions of the States-and the practice is observed under the British Constitutionwhat I am beginning to regard as a wise provision, namely, that upon a man taking office, he shall present himself before his constituents for re-election. I, at one time, considered that form superfluous, but occasions such 'as this emphasize the fact that it is not. I undertake to say that the constituents of the honourable member for Darling Downs would not condone his action had they an opportunity to express their opinions, and I question whether those of the Prime Minister would not revolt at the accursed action which has taken place. Sir WILLIAM LYNE will do so. I mention these facts to show that there was good reason for asking that the constituencies should be appealed to. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Constitution does not require new Ministers to present themselves for re-election, and, without impeaching anything that the Governor General may have done, I say that this affords a good justification for an appeal to the country at the present juncture, before _,an attempt is made to proceed with business. journment of three weeks is asked for, which I think is longer than has been proposed on former occasions. been proposed on any other occasion. tion obtained an adjournment of f u l ly three weeks-fro m the 18th Apri l to about the middle of May. Minister stated, as his reason for the action which he took against the Fisher Administration, that he wished to save time, so that there might be no delay in getting on with business; but it seems to me retrograde progression to now suggest an adjournment of three weeks. No Address has yet been voted by the House in reply to His Excellency the Governor General's opening speech, an unheard of state of affairs. The constitutional course would have been to deal It is better for an honat once with the Address-in-Ueply, amending it so as to meet the wishes of the majority. The House is placed in a most extraordinary position by reason of that not having been done. When the Ministry brings down its forlorn policy, which has been pecked at by every hen in the Cabinet, we shall be asked to resume the consideration of the proposed Address. I wish to direct the attention of the country to the position regarding the combination of parties opposite. Honourable* members do not know on what basis the coalition is formed. I read one statement of the agreement in the Argus, and another in the Age of the same day, while I also read an account of an interview in Sydney with a former leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for East Sydney, in which he deliberately stated that the protectionist policy is not safeguarded, and that the majority of the Ministerial party can at any moment refuse to allow any proposed alteration of the Tariff for the correction of an anomaly, and vote against any proposed increase in duties; that the free-traders in the party I think that they have a free hand to do as they please in regard to the Tariff. like. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not blame the honourable member. The free traders have scored a great victory.

It will be of no use for the Prime Minister to try, with his honeyed words, any longer to hoodwink the people. He has clone it once too often on this occasion, and those who have supported and believed in him before never can, and never will, believe in him again. If ""they do, they ought to be sold again, just as he will slide out from amongst honourable members opposite one of these days, when it suits him. I was shown a paragraph the other day from a leading morning paper, in frighten me from making any further attacks on the party opposite, and to insinuate that if I persisted there would be an exposure of certain things regarding my political life and public policy, which had taken place in Cabinet or elsewhere. I say to them, "" Bring forward everything !"" I challenge any paper and any Minister to point tome as-a man who deserted or misled in a cowardly way any of his colleagues, or to point tb any unworthy action of mine during the whole of the time that I have been in public life, riot only in this Parliament, but in the Parliament of New South Wales, where.I gained my political education under one of the most honourable and imright men tfTat ever held office-the late Sir George Dibbs. He always stuck to his colleagues, and to those who would support his policy. I tell any one who attempts to prevent me from using every weapon in my power in the peculiarly disgraceful circumstances of the present moment that, if I am goaded, I will go very much further than they think, no matter where the threat comes from; because if there is one thing which I can say regarding my public life, it is that I can dare any person in the community to trv tp find a stain on my record as a man, or in any other way. I shall proceed on my ""own course to attack, for instance, the honourable member for Parramatta as I have attacked him in the past. I challenge him to produce anything against mv public character. When charges have been hurled against me previously, I have not sat down quietly and let the thing blow over; but I have challenged my accusers at once with the demand of a Commission, and rammed down the throats of my detractors the detractions which they have uttered. So long as I live I will pursue that course. taken under their care Miss Grace Watson -perhap s she is sitting in the gallery now -the young lady who maligned me, who lied about me, and who was sent over by the right honourable member for Swan to try to work up the Womens' National League in Western Australia.

It is generally accepted that a delegation will go from Australia to the Imperial Naval Conference, and I have no doubt that the present Government will carry out the intentions of their predecessors, and send representatives. Under the circumstances, I think that, if we consent to an adjournment for three weeks, and that, as any delegation is likely to be on the road to England before the expiry of that time, the Prime Minister ought to indicate to the House and the country the attitude which will be taken up by the delegation when speaking in the name of Australia.

Was it, as has been suggested, that he might murder that Government a little earlier, or was it to give an opportunity for voting a Dreadnought for the Old Country? The newspapers which I .saw when out in my constituency they were three or four weeks old when they reached me-mad e evident the desire of the honourable members for Ballarat and Parramatta to bring about a fusion of parties. The present action of the Prime Minister reminds me of the manner in which a blackfellow on the Cooper, near the South Australian border, makes his advances to a gin. If she will not come with him on a certain day, he, with two or three others of the tribe, bludgeons her, and carries her off. That is what the honourable gentleman has done with those sitting behind him. How are the honourable members for Lang and Batman to appear on the same platform? Directly the new Ministry was announced, there were signs of discontent on the back benches. The honourable member for Lang is sitting as far from the Treasury bench as is possible, without leaving the chamber. the draught. will get beyond his draught, and be drowned. member for Batman are afraid of getting Into deep water, and being drowned. for the honourable member for Batman. fear for the honourable member.

How do'we know that he will not try to spend Â£2,000,000 without the consent of this Parliament? -nothing to him. money, as the honourable member would find if he tried to count it. Some weeks ago, certain honourable members opposite appeared desirous of having""""T'arliament called together to provide for the voting of a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. Why does not the Prime Minister now propose the voting of ,Â£2,000,000 as a gift to Great Britain? The discussion of that proposal would take a week at least, during which time Ministers could consider their policy. Indeed, the honourable gentleman would be satisfied if he got it through in a week. He knows how the public would treat any such proposal, and the derision with which the mention of it was received the other night by the meeting at the Exhibition Building. It would have done the honourable gentleman's heart good to hear then the vociferous cheers for the honourable member for Hume, as the father of Protection. I heard many say that they had him to thank for Protection, a statement which I endorse. But had it not been for his promise to me that, under the new protection to be proposed by the then Administration, the workers would get their share, I should not have voted for his proposals, because hitherto, while the manufacturers have benefited by Protection, the workers and consumers have not been considered. Now the Prime Minister is sacrificing the new protection to what he termed the "" ragtag and bob-tailed party,"" to the party Both he and the honourable vvhich he said was made up of the wreckage of every other party under the, sun.

I can say safely There was the writing on that the amendment was not moved in any hostile spirit to the Prime Minister or the Government. It was moved simply in the f u l l knowledge and belief that a fortnight's adjournment was long enough. though an adjournment of three weeks would suit me very well personally, I must take into consideration the present position of the country arid the fact that an adjournment of that duration would bring us within a week of the end of the financial -year.

168,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4,"14]-of taking a referendum whereby the people of Australia will be dominant over Cabinet Ministers, Parliament, and Governor General. I wish to congratulate the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Bendigo, and the honourable member for Angas on attaining Cabinet rank. think that that is a courtesy which is due to any man who achieves that distinction. Regarding a subject upon which the Prime Minister was very emphatic the other day, I should like to ask him whether it is the intention of the Government to send a representative to the Imperial Defence Conference before the Address-in-Reply is adopted, or before the Government know definitely that they are going to retain possession of the Treasury Bench. The Prime Minister was particularly anxious that no representative should be sent to England unless there was an. assurance that he had a_strong Government behind him and that he could voice thafGovernment's policy. The honourable member knows that, until the new Government have stated their policy to the House and have obtained the approval of the House, they cannot legitimately and honestly say that they truly represent the wishes of this Parliament. Until that has been done, I maintain that nobody has a right to be sent from Australia to represent the Commonwealth at that Conference, and T hope the Prime Minister will not in any way attempt to appoint any of his colleagues to the position. I have heard a rumour to-day that one of them has already been selected. Minister shake his head. evf-n to meet once, that the appointment will not be made until the policy of the Government is laid before, and approved by, the House? I do not know yet whether the time will permit. that action and were deprived of their positions, of course, the representative, if sent, would have to be recalled, or could be recalled if it were thought necessary. thing that the Prime Minister complained about regarding the late Government-that they proposed to send one of their number to -the Conference when they did not represent the wishes of Parliament? Government policy has> beeri (submitted, how can we know what the feelings of Parliament are regarding that matter? The honourable member now says that the Government will appoint some one and send, him, and that if their policy does not receive the support of the House they will recall him. Is that the way they are I going to do the business of the country? The Prime Minister appears, as I have already said, to be subject to the dictates of those around him, and must do what he is told. If it was wrong last week for the late Government to take the course they propose, then it is wrong for this Government to take a similar course this week until they know that theyÂ»are secure in their positions. The Prime Minister appears to be under the impression that the first duty of the House, when it meets again, will be to consider his policy; but let me remind him that the policy of 'the late Government has yet to be discussed, and will be discussed to the .fullest possible extent as soon as the House meets, unless the Prime Minister is prepared to apply the closure to the debate on the Address-in-Reply. It is idle for the honourable member to say that he desires to save time. Why, if that is so, does he ask for an adjournment of three weeks now ? He himself has no particular anxiety, as he has no portfolio to administer, ' and has nothing to do but sign a few papers that may come before him from time to time, and to lead the House when he is present. His attention to the business of the House previously was the poorest that I have ever seen given by a Prime MinisterI am glad to see the Prime or by the Premier of any of the States. During my career I have never seen a leader of a House pay less attention to his parliamentary duties than did the present Prime Minister when previously in office. He was hardly ever in the chamber, and the honourable member for Parramatta, who is now a Minister of the Crown, repeatedly complained-as did a number of other honourable members who were then sitting on this side-that they could hardly get a MinI f the present Government took ister present, with the exception of the honourable member for Hume, who during one long period spent a considerable amount of time in the Chamber. I hope the Prime Minister, now that he is relieved of anxiety with regard to the administration of a Department, will try to lead the House, and not allow' it to run itself as it had to during his previous term of office. It will be in the best interests of this Parliament that Until the the honourable member should attend the",28,Special Adjournment
