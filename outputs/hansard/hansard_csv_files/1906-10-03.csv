0,"S Preferential Ftynise Of Ixrprcsr Atari Tors. Wednesday, J October, 1006. P.m., And Read Prayers. Minister Of Home Affairs To Replies Pub","lished in this morning's Argus to questions asked last night by Mr Frendergast in reference to the carriage of coal on the Victorian railways. Apparently, between Jumbunna and Melbourne, the charges are is. 7d. per ton less for Victorian coal than for New South Wales coal, while between Melbourne and Ballarat or Bendigo the consignor or consignee is charged 8s. 5d. for Newcastle coal, but only 7s. 8d. for Victorian coal, the balance being made up by the Victorian Government. Does he consider these rates a breach.of the provisions of the Constitution, seeing that the Government of Victoria is practically paying a bountv to the State coal industry ? on the spur of the moment an opinion as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the rates in question; but if the honourable member will supply me with a copy of the paragraph to which he refers, I shall inquire into the matter. The subject of railway -charges was brought up by the honourable member for Angas, who referred certain instances to us; and although we have been informed by the Railways Commissioners of the States that there is nothing in their charges contrary to the Constitution, the Department is looking into the whole question. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Railway Rates. tion on the subject at the beginning of Federation I was told that the Railways Commissioners intended to re-arrange their rates on a proper basis. and we were informed, as a result, that there are no railway charges which contravene the provisions of the Constitution. Since then several instances, particularly one or two relating to Queensland, have come under our notice, and we are investigating them. Commissioners acknowledged that the rates of which I gave instances are in force, and do they not seek to justify their imposition on the ground that similar rates have been sanctioned by the Inter-State Commission of the United States of America? know is that at the present moment we are in communication with the Railways Commissioners of the States in order to ascertain the exactfacts, with a view to the investigation of the whole subject. gested state of business in another place, does the Government seriously intend to proceed with all the Orders of the Day on the notice-paper, including no fewer than twelve Bills? If it is intended to proceed with that business, is there any possibility of closing the session before the end of another month? the notice-paper are almost ready for return to the Senate, while others are short and simple, and can be disposed of very quickly. There are at the bottom of the programme several measures with which it is not likely that we shall be able to proceed further this session. Vice-President of the Executive Council whether the Defence Department has recently changed its policy in reference to the obtaining of supplies, confining tenders to the manufacturers of the State in which the supplies are wanted? If so, will he ask the Minister of Defence to consider whether the old practice of allowing all manufacturers within the Commonwealth to tender is not a better one?",13,Setup

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [2.49] -The provision proposed to be inserted is very similar to that which we have embodied in another measure which was recently before us, and, as I have no objection to urge, I move That the request be agreed to. that it is a great mistake to insert such provisions in Bills dealing with only one or two items in the Tariff. When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was under consideration, I moved in the direction of inserting a provision similar to this, because that measure professed to protect labour engaged in Australian industries generally. It was appropriate that we should make express provision of this kind when we were passing a. law of general application, but now we are dealing with one or two special lines in the Tariff. If it is found that protection fails to secure proper labour conditions for the workers, and it is necessary fo make special provision in that direction, we should pass a law which would be applicable to all in-' dustries enjoving the advantage of protective duties. Ministers have not initiated anv of the provisions for the protection of labour that have found their way into our legislation. I made one proposal in that direction, and in other cases the initiative was taken by members, of the Tariff Commission. Instead of adopting, as one of the necessary concomitants of a protectionist policy, a general provision for the protection of all labour, Ministers are dabI did not know that bling with the Tariff and inserting special provisions, which, owing to their restricted application, will become ridiculous. If this provision is, inserted, a staff of inspectors will have to be employed to insure that proper wages are paid and proper conditions are observed in particular manufacturing industries. I think that it is a mistake to lay upon the Administration the necessity of employing a special class of officers whose duties will be restricted to one or two industries. AlthoughI do not object to the spirit of the amendment, T think that the Minister, when he found how the wind was blowing, should have introduced a Bill declaring that whenever protection is given to an industry fair rates of wages shall obtain. [2.52] -i l agree with the honourable and learned member for Angas. No one objects to the empIoy6s having as.ured to them fair rates of wages and good conditions of employment. But the question is whether we are adopting the proper means to bring about that result. It is now proposed to set up two different classes of conditions for employment throughout the length and breadth of Australia. One set of employersj whilst obtaining every advantage that the Tariff can give them, will be under no obligation to pay fair wages, and to otherwise treat their employees with reasonable consideration, whilst other employers will be required to subscribe to such conditions. We should endeavour to make our Commonwealth legislation apply fairly all round. In spite of the fundamental principle of the Constitution that there shall be no distinction s,uch as that now proposed to be made, we are busily engaged in the closing hours of this Parliament in making fish of one set of industrials and flesh of another. This proposal involves a very grave departure from anything that has been done in Australia before, and I do not think that it should be brought forward in the dying hours of this Parliament. The Government have apparently made up their minds that all this, kind of legislation must bepushed through without consideration and without discussion.",14,Excise Tariff Spirits Bill

I am so anxious to protect the worker that I am prepared to avail myself of even an expedient of this kind to bring about a thorough reform. I regret that in many respects this amendment is not the most desirable means of securing the end we have in view, but it is certainly better than nothing at all, and should be supported. I am not a distillery man. My attitude towards the drink traffic is well known; but I do not think the distillers will complain aboujt this provision. I have not heard a whisper of complaint, and since this condition will apply to distillers all over the Commonwealth, it should, in that respect, prove advantageous. It is also to be remembered that employers cannot be expected to observe the eight hours principle, and give what are called fair wages unless they have something like adequate protection. A very striking feature of this proposal is that whilst under it the conditions which we all favour will be applied to the industry, the protection which the Tariff. Commission deems adequate will be reduced. It is nonsense to talk about securing protection for the workers unless we can first find work for them. Adequate and effective protection must be a prelimiliament is in favour of the .application of nary to protecting the employee. I hope that, notwithstanding the difficulties to which attention has been directed, this prinfact that this provision will have but a ciple will be affirmed; that we shall apply it whenever the opportunity offers, and that our action to-day will be the forerunner of provision being made to enable this Parliament to regulate industrial conditions as well as to grant protection to the emplover. thoroughly believe in the principle that when we grant adequate protection to the manufacturer, we should provide that a proper proportion of that protection shall go to the workers; but I think that fragmentary legislation of the description now under consideration is highly objectionable.

It will be found difficult to administer, and we shall have to appoint officers to superintend its application to a few cases, when we might as well apply it to the whole of the protected industries of Australia. [3.26] I am free to admit that if I were in charge of the BillI should think this a wrong way of instituting a system of protection in favour of the employees. quite admit that the proposed application of a principle to only one industry is generally inexpedient, but, at the same time, I think that the mere insertion of a provision of this sort in the Bill, as a condition preceshould be deprived of the benefits of the dent to granting protection to the distillers, wilT have a very wholesome effect upon all industries. I feel as strongly as does any honourable member that no industry should be protected unless the workers in it are fairly used. I well recollect what happened in connection with an analogous case in the Victorian Parliament. In dealing with a Bill providing for the construction of certain railways we inserted a clause declaring that the lines should not be constructed unless a minimum wage were paid to those engaged upon the work. When the clause was submitted to the House, it was urged then, as it is to-3ay, that it was wrong to aprly to the construction of one railway a principle that had not been applied to others. We insisted, however, in making this provision, and the result was that a similar clause was inserted in all succeeding Railways Bills. wages paid generally by the Railway Department, and in turn had an effect on outside industries. I take it that it is well for a Parliament to say, when giving protection to any industry, exactly what it desires. The honourable member for South Sydney appealed to me to express my opinion of his criticism of the amendment. think his view is correct that the effect of it is that the order made by the Governor General in Council must apply generally to those who pay fair wages, and those who do not. That, I am sure, is not the object of another place, nor the end we have in view. If . as the honourable member for South Sydney has said, six out of seven distillers observed these conditions, I do not think we should desire to deprive the six of this protection because of the action of the seventh. I have, therefore, suggested to the Minister a slight variation of the amendment, which I trust he will agree to. It would have the effect of enabling the Governor General in Council to take away the protection only from those distillers who failed to comply with what Parliament deems to be fair conditions of labour. There will be no difficulty in regard to the verbiage. The matter is one for the Committee to decide, but if the Minister has accepted, as I understand he has, the principle of the I amendment, I think the way I have suggested is the only one by which it can be properly applied. If six distillers comply with the fair conditions of labour, and the seventh does not, then the latter only protection granted the industry. At this stage of the session, I do not think it is worthwhile for us to consider the question of whether this will have any direct effect upon industries. It certainly will do no harm, and, as I have already said, it will have the effect of indicating what is the strong wish of the Parliament, that where protection is granted to an industry, the workers in that industry should also be protected. £3-3°]--It is to be regretted that we are unable to complete the work commenced by the Government. It shows that free-trade writers are not far wrong when they say that it is because we cannot protect every one that protection is a bad thing. The speeches which have been made by those who have preceded me go to show that, This had an effect upon the while many persons will be protected in their industry others will not. The manufacturers in the particular industry immediately concerned by the amendment make a profit of ^18,000 a year, and it borders on absurdity to propose to protect them further. It is admitted that they have not a reputation for paying adequate wages, I or for being satisfied with a reasonable number of hours' work a day, while they have not been brought under the operation of the Wages Board system, which, in my opinion, is better for the protection of the workers than the Arbitration Acts which have been tried elsewhere. We are asked to give protection to an industry in which possibly 500 workers are employed; but it is forgotten that probably 200,000 persons in and around Melbourne are entirely unprotected. The masses are to be taxed excessively to provide increased protection for so-called languishing",19,Excise Tariff Spirits Bill

We should examine the whole sphere of our legislation, and pass a measure covering the whole ground, and providing for equality of treatment. No wonder that reflections are passed upon us, when we lightlv consent to the introduction of important provisions in such a haphazard fashion.

When the Tariff is revised during the next Parliament, I am of opinion that the principle which we are now laying down ought to be extended to other industries.

I do not begrudge them this new-born zeal, because I recognise that if we make provision for the payment of proper wages and the observance of reasonable conditions of labour in protected industries, we shall hear less and less of the crv of the manufacturers for protection, and shall see less and less of that lobbying which has always been conspicuous in connection with the passing of Tariff legislation by this and other Legislatures. feeling very dissatisfied -because of the conditions that we imposed in the Tariff, B ill relating to stripper-harvesters.

The latter spirit is distilled from a by-product, which, costs nothing, whereas whisky is made from grain, which is an expensive material. In addition to that, there is the condition in connection with blended whisky that 25 per cent, shall be pure barley malt spirit. If the duty is raised, an undue advantage will be given to rum distillers over those who make blended whisky.

Then we provide for the issue of special certificates, which will enable Kanakas to be employed under an agreement between the 31st December next and 30th June following. We are arranging with a shipping company that their boats shall call regularly at the various ports, and the special certificates which will be issued will, as far as possible, be timed to provide a full passenger list for these vessels. Thus a Pacific Island labourer will be enabled to know . approximately the day upon which his ship will be ready to receive him.

The issue of the certificates, whether general or special, is safeguarded in sub-clause 3 by a power which is vested in the Minister to cancel them at any time. [5.11] I absolutely concur 'in the proposals embodied in this Bill. It seems to me that they are dictated only by a humane spirit. Upon the very lowest grounds of humanity they represent the least that we can do for a class of people who have been seriously affected by the legislation which we have passed, and which has evidently been found to be of too drastic a character. I do not mean to suggest that it has been too drastic in regard to its general application abrupt ? These people are to be deported, and it devolves upon us, on the grounds of common humanity, to render their departure as complete and as easy as possible. Where marriages have been contracted, they should be honored, and where other engagements have been made, which make it impossible for us to deport the Kanakas without outraging considerations of common humanity, we must allow them to remain here if they choose to do so. I am glad that the measure has been introduced, and I hope that the Government will adopt a humane course in respect of these people against whose employment our legislation has been directed.

I presume that if any operations of an illegitimate character, detrimental to the public interest, were carried on in that institution, the Postmaster General would have power to deprive the members of the advantage of the public services now rendered to them by his Department. the speculative operations' upon the Stock Exchange, there is supposed to be some legitimate business. the element of speculation is not in itself an evil so long as the end in view is a legitimate one. The gamblng evil, which it is specially desired to discourage, is so rampant, and is being attended with such evil effects, that many large public organizations, including the Australian Natives' Association and the Chambers of Commerce, have united with representatives of all the religious bodies, and have asked the Postmaster-General to take action. Upon their behalf, I should like to add my congratulations to the Postmaster-General and the Government for having taken this step to cope with an admittedly growing evil. If similar justification existed for the inand trust his administration. If that adtroduction of the other 'amending Bills which have recently been submitted, I am sure that they would have commanded the unanimous support of honourable members. To me it is a surprise to learn that any honourable member is not prepared to support the Government in suppressing an undoubted evil, by giving the Postmaster General the increased power which he seeks. I have no doubt whatever that that power will be justly exercised. The public interest, as a whole, demands the enactment of special legislation of this character to prevent our youths from being corrupted by the vice of gambling, which seems to permeate our offices at the present time. Personally, I am thoroughly in favour of vesting the Postmaster-General with' the power which he seeks.. Inasmuch as he will be called upon to deal with some very clever individuals, it is necessary that we should clothe him with correspondingly wide powers. I am content to trust him to exercise a wise discretion, and not to discriminate between gambling institutions to the detriment of those which happen to be supported by poor people, whilst granting immunity to the more fashionable organizations, whether they be turf clubs or Tattersall's. to visit Flemington is to be at liberty to bet, but it is to be a crime for another man to wager is. discuss which is the worse-to bet' through the Collingwood "" tote"" or through the medium of the Victorian Club.

It may be necessary in some of the States, and, perhaps, in Victoria, to do something to control what I believe is undoubtedly becoming a social evil. But we should deal directly in our attempts to suppress gambling.' and should not give an unreasonable discretion to a Minister. The Postmaster-General has told the Committee that he will take certain action if his officers report, and he believes, that certain practices are taking place against the public interest; but the Bil l says nothing about public interest. A measure like this should apply to all alike. I am not in favour of preventing the use of the totalizator at race meetings at Flemington, Randwick, or other reputable courses, or of preventing betting in legitimate clubs conducted under the laws of the States. Buti f the Minister There is is prepared to use the powers given by the Bil l in regard to all places and establishments where betting is carried on, I am No one willing to makea statutory declaration that betting is carried on at Randwick and Flemington race-courses and the Victorian and Sydney Tattersall's Clubs, where thousands of pounds are won and lost every year in connection with betting transactions.

It is necessary that the Postmaster-General shall have power to act quickly, and therefore the onus of proving that a telephone is not being improperly used must lie on those to whose action objection is taken. put the onus of proof on the Department would be to prevent effective action. I feel sure that the powers asked for will not be abused, and will be used with due discretion. These are not new powers. The Postmaster-General already has the right to refuse to transmit postal matter which may be regarded as indecent or immoral. This power has been used to the advantage of the community to prevent the distribution of post-cards which, if not grossly indecent, were, at least, extremely vulgar. Knowing .something of the extent to which the vice of gambling is undermining the morals of the community, this attempt to minimise it meets with my hearty approval. Our people cannot expect to grow into a strong and virile nation so long as they remain a race of gamblers. I shall support the clause. hope that the Postmaster-General will see ments in this clause. I think that he would be well advised if he permitted a provision to be inserted to the effect that a telephone should not be cut off until the subscriber had received notice of the charge made against him, and had been afforded an opportunity to prove that it was unfounded. If necessary, I shall move an amendment in that direction. I should like to hear what the Attorney-General has to say with regard to the use of the word "" illegal "" in the clause. I do not know of any legislation by which we have conferred upon a Minister power to usurp the functions of a Court of Justice, and determine whether or not an act is illegal. The Courts of I believe that the evil Justice exist for the purpose of determining questions of illegality, and we should not empower the Minister to pass them by, and settle such matters for himself. 'The Postmaster-General might pronounce to be illegal a perfectly legitimate proceeding on the part of a subscriber. I object to the use of the words "" if the Postmaster General has reasonable grounds."" A l though these words are used in the principal Act, there is no reason why they should be employed in this case. The Minister should not only have reasonable grounds for believing that a telephone was being put to improper use, but he should require something in the nature of. legal proof before depriving a subscriber of the service.

On the contrarv, he has very cordially supported the extension of the functions' of Government in that direction. Although' he Was been quite indifferent as to the 'liberty of those engaged in lawful trades and occupations, he is now very much concerned about the liberty of those who engage in unlawful occupations.

There is some doubt as to whether we have not power under the existing law to take action in this direction, and we wish to remove that doubt. The Bill has been carefully framed by the Attorney-General who advises me that it would be inadvisable to insert the word ""knowingly."" That being so, I cannot accept the amendment.

The proceedings were taken under section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act, which deals with the non-delivery of postal matter, and to which this provision is to be added. The Court declared, however, that under that section the Postmaster-General judicial .capacity, the test being that he was not compelled to call evidence. Had he been compelled to do so, and to allow the defendant an opportunity to call evidence, he would have been acting in a judicial capacity. .Barton held that, although the Minister might not be acting in a Ministerial capacity, he was acting in an administrative capacity. of judicial acumen, the learned Justice drew a distinction between acting in an administrative rather than in a judicial or Ministerial capacity, and it was held that under that section the Postmaster-General had power to stop the delivery of postal matter. tute proceedings for conversion, but since the Minister was carrying out an administrative duty in respect to which, his decision was final, he could not obtain from the High Court a prerogative writ commanding the Postmaster-General to deliver his letters. proposed addition to that section, and if the Postmaster-General cause to believe that a certain set of facts exist with or without the knowledge of the -subscriber concerned, he may cut off his telephone. tion of the word "" knowingly"" would affect' the stringency or liberality of the clause. tion of such a word give an aggrieved person a stronger ground for appealing to the Courts? right to complain. ters to a considerable extent. would simply mean that the Committee was of the opinion that the Postmaster-General should not take action unless he con . sidered that a subscriber was knowingly allowing his telephone to be used for any of these purposes. As a matter of There was a suggestion fact, this provision depends on reasonable administration, and I shall not oppose it. I am still of opinion that the Minister could take action without it . There is nothing in the Post and Telegraph Act prohibiting the Department from entering into new agreements with subscribers, and reserving the power of cancellation. Under such agreements, if a telephone were removed, no one would be was not acting in a able to sue for breach of contract. I was under the impression that there was a similar reservation in the existing agreements. I know that under them a subscriber has been cut off, and that, although complaints were made to the PostmasterMr Justice General, the telephone was not restored. It may be that, whether we pass this Bill or not, anything, prescribed in this clause may still be done, but if the Minister has Apparently, with a great deal been advised by the Attorney-General that he needs this power, I shall not object to his obtaining it. If , however, it is to be applied to every subscriber who sends a telephone message about the odds or the result of a particular horse race, the administration will be absurd. Section 57 A person so treated might instiof the principal Act is not directed against messages passing between Jack, Tom, and Harry, as to what horse won a certain race, or what were the totalizator odds.

That is a reasonable provision which I think will find acceptance with a large number of honourable members. The Attorney-General has not satisfied me, nor has he, I think, satisfied the Committee, that the Minister is not virtually given power to say what is an illegal or. immoral purpose. The Postmaster-General, in preventing a telephone from being used, for Assuming that the provision any purpose, must decide that that purpose is illegal or immoral, and the point I took just now was that he has no right to decide a question of that sort, which should be referred to the Courts of the country. The argument of the Attorney General seemed to me so much special pleading, and did not shake my opinion that the Postmaster-General will practically be called upon to decide these questions, and, in doing so, will ignore the functions of the courts of law. How-, ever, the Committee being against me, [ now appeal to its sense of fairness not to allow a charge to be made and decided against a man in the dark, and whose telephone may be cut off before he can know that such action is proposed, or the reason for it.

Does not the honourable member know, when he announces himself in favour of the suppression of gambling, that the wave of feeling now running through the community will, to-some extent, recede? wish to point out that at present it is a common thing, prior to a big race meeting, tor the news to be. telegraphed to the leading newspapers of Australia that, on the card being called at a certain club, such and such a horse stood at 100 to 5.

394,Mr Frazer,"That shows what aopinion, the only justification for the Bill is to give the Postmaster-General, in respect to the telephone service, a power similar to that which he exercises under section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act. Under that section, he may refuse to deliver postal articles to gaming establishments, the intention being that men who are keeping betting establishments shall not be allowed to make use of postal conveniences for the prosecution of their business. But, to prohibit the transmission of messages conveying information regarding betting transactions, which will mean the stoppage of race telegrams throughout the Commonwealth, is impracticable, because the community has not attained a sufficient degree of Puritanic development to support such an administration. I am not prepared to vote for the Bill now that it goes beyond providing that the telephone service shall not be used as an auxiliary to a betting establishment. If the clause, as amended, is to be enforced, the States may well go a step further, and prohibit the publication of accounts of immoral proceedings and divorce cases, which some of us regard as, at least, as pernicious as the dissemination of racing intelligence.

External Affairs) [10.2] -In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to intimate to honourable members that to-morrow we shall first deal with the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill, and afterwards consider the South African Preference proposals. suggest, to the Minister of Home Affairs that in connection with the forthcoming general elections special arrangements should be made in the more populous, centres for separate polling booths in which to record the votes of electors in regard to the various questions submitted to them by referendum. I am afraid that if only the ordinary polling booths are provided serious congestion will take place. If each elector has four or five different ballot papers placed in his, hands, the voting will occupy a considerable time and considerable confusion will result. I do not think that any increased expense need be incurred. Even an increased outlay should be faced without hesitation when the sole end in view is to obtain a, true reflex of the opinions of the electors.
