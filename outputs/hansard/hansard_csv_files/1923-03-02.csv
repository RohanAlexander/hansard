What is the eapital invested at Canberra earning? I am not likely to record a vote in. favour of another trans-continental line, nor shall I sanction the expenditure of one penny piece on similar underheard Tasmania mentioned since I have takings until I know what revenue is likely to be derived from it. I do not think the returns from the Trans-Australian Railway are sufficient to pay for uxlc grease. The Commonwealth Bank has done good work, ancl under efficient management I believe it will continue to render a service to the comniunity. I do uot think there can be auy objection to the control of the Bank being placed in the hands of a board' of directors, because there is, or should be, wisdom in the multitude of counsellors. I am a banker, and I am surprised to hear some honourable members suggest that a Board should be appointed to inquire into the work of the associated banks.

We are here as representatives of a Federation, and it is our duty t.o mete out justice to all portions of the Commonwealth. The grant which Tasmania receives is provided for in thc Constitution -' If a State is financially embarrassed this Parliament may come to its assistance. I trust that through the wisdom of honourable members, and the chivalry which I am sure they will display, what is known as the Cinderella State of the Federation will receive fair consideration at the hands of the Government. I have not occupied a seat in this Chamber. Tasmania intends to honour the Federal compact) and does not mind contributing her share of the expenditure incurred in the interests of the whole Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth has been getting £1,000,000 a year from Tasmania, and giving very little in return. I trust that when the question of the Tasmanian grant comes before this House honourable members will assist in giving that State the assistance whicb she justly deserves. can recall the great assistance which the honourable memher for .Darwin( Mr Whitsitt) gave the party whicli carries ihe same flag .as we do in bis own little island, and I am with the honourable member on the question of Protection.

11,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.3],"I ,It affords me pleasure, on this the first meeting of the Ninth Parliament of the Commonwealth, to be able to congratulate you upon the sound condition of the trade, commerce, and industries of Australia. There are indications to justify belief in the continuance of tliese conditions. In view of the recent assumption of office by my advisers, time is required for the preparation of measures to give effect to their policy. You will be invited to reassemble as early as practicable to consider a definite programme of legislation. My Ministers have under consideration subjects oF a national character in which the Commonwealth and States are jointly concerned. Prior to the next meeting of the Parliament it is proposed by my advisers to invite the Governments oF the States to confer with them on these matters. Commending your deliberations to the guidance of Divine Providence, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and honourable duties. W it h a memory of nearly thirty-five years spent in this Chamber, I cannot recall one Speech from a State Governor or Governor General so barren of matter as this, which'a gentleman of high education and great attainments was compelled to read. And at what acost to the country ! Taking into consideration the salary of £10,000 a year paid to the Governor General, and the wages paid to all who participated in the ceremonies, down to the brave boys carrying bayonets in f r o n t of this Parliament in time of peace, the waste of money was considerable. On the day before the opening, instead of one aide-de-camp, being sent along to do a little rehearsing, and see how things were to be done, more than a dozen men, drawing high salaries, came here to do what could have been done by a boy of sixteen after consultation with our Librarian, who has perhaps seen a score of newly-elected Speakers presented.in the Library to the representative of the Sovereign. In the name of common sense, why was it necessary for the Admiralof the Fleet to come here and see how Mr Speaker would in troduce himself to the Governor General? But all this nonsense will continue, I presume while the people who are called upon to foot tbe bill have no say, either "" Yea"" or "" N a y . "" I am not too severe when I describe His Excellency's Speech as nothing but political piffle. HereI may show how things are done in England. Of course, I am aware that until tbe terrors of the war compelled the Government of Great Britain to give the citizens of that country the right of their manhood, no Englishman, Irishman, Welshman, or Scotchman had the right to a vote there, and even now no English woman i9 considered fit to vote until she is thirty years of age. What impertinent insolence on the part of the man who drafted such a measure! We in Australia give every ma.n and woman twenty-one years of age the right to vote in this part of th© British Empire. I heard the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Marks) speak of the intelligence of those who come here from England. God bless my soul, they do not display much intelligence in regard to the matter of the franchise ! NowI want to compare the policy of stay-in-office-at-any-price and delay-anddelay, as adopted in Australia quite recently, with the attitude assumed by Mr. Lloyd George and Mr Asquithi n similar circumstances, and their preparedness to hold an election and meet Parliament. Had Mr Lloyd George formed committees in the 6C0 odd electorates of the United Kingdom; he would have shown a lack of faith in his colleagues. On the other hand, the Conservative party knew that as soon as they withdrew their support from him he would follow the British precedent, whicli was not followed here, and resign immediately, and so they were prepared for such an emergency. Mr Lloyd -George resigned on tbe 20th October. Parliament was dissolved oil' the 28th October. Nominations closed on the 4th November. The election was held on the 15th November, and the new Parliament assembled on the 20th November-on e month from the date of Mr Lloyd George's resignation. Let us see what happened in Australia. This new Parliament was elected on the 16th December. It was not called together u n t i l the 28tn February. Why did not the ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) follow the splendid example set by Mr Lloyd George, and resign earlier ? Why was not the predominant party of the three parties elected to this House consulted by the Governor General? Goodness knows, I am not here to judge His Excellency, but he had better mind his p's and q'.a, or the people of Australia may some time get aa tired of him as they are of having six Governors in the various States. In eleven days Mr Lloyd George could not form committees right throughout the United Kingdom; neither could Mr. Asquithi n similar circumstances. W h y was it that the .Australian Labour party one of the anost influential in Australia. was not decimated upon the dissolution ef Sof a r as -the capacity of its officials are Parliament, .as were the followers of Mr concerned, .it .'is one .of the most -cleverly Asquith and Mr Lloyd George?

It receives almost fabulous cheques from shipping, pastoral, commercial, importing, mining, and financial concerns, and in dark secrecy it allocates the money to various branches of the Nationalist Party, for Beyond the planks of the expenditure along definite lines carefully laid down by the Union itself. The main avenues of expenditure may be set out as follow : (1) Publicity and support of the Nationalist Party. (2) Advances to cover the election expenses of candidates. (3) Provision for conveyances for speakers and organizers before election day, . and for voters going to the polls on election days. (4) Payment of the salaries and expenses of huge organizing and publicity staffs, who spend money like water at election time. really the ethics of (5) Provision of consolation prizes for men who consent to run in the Nationalist The Nationalist party is interest in electorates where there is no possibility of success. This is a device to keep opposing candidates busy in their own electorates, and 1 prevent them from assisting others who need their help. , 1 thank the Age for having made thoseparticulars' public.

Honourable ""members w ill recollect the delicacy with which the honourable gentleman sympathized with the unfortunate While the honourable gentleman was speaking I interjected that he could alter a good many of the conditions which, he acknowledged, lean heavily and unjustly upon our poor brothers and sisters. When I applied for my old-age pension, you, Mr Speaker, quite within your rights, referred me to tbe Commissioner of Pensions. I replied that I did not thank you for sending me to the Commissioner, because you well knew that the law forbade my receiving the pension. I wanted to sbow every old man and woman in Australia that no disgrace attached to the making of an application for the pension. The biggest parasite that Australia produced-Si r Samuel Griffiththe man who drew £90,000 out of Australia, cadged for an old-age pension. I was the only one who gave him credit for the work that he had done. He honoured Our English tongue by trans-: lating part of the works of the great Italian poet, Dante Alighieri, into English vernacular. If , by unfortunate experiments in finance he lost his money, I would, with any other honourable member, have contributed equal to what I paid by way of income tax, as long as he lived. Minister has shown a lot of sympathy for the old-age pensioners, and I believe he has felt it. The Government gave Sir Samuel Griffith a pension of £5 a day, respect. I asked if the higher paid officials or £35 a week, and if I asked for one day's under the British flag-from the King of wage for one month for my old brothers and sisters, I would not be able to get it. Who knows better than the Prime Minister the increase in the cost of livArmy, the Judges-bot h those who wear ing? If any old relation of his, paternal horsehair and those who do notor maternal-and God forbid that it should he so-were trying to live on 153. a week, I hope that he would not merely give him sympathy, but wotild do something more. I have seen three or four thousand of these old people in the city of Melbourne. I fried last session to improve, their position, and I had the same motion ready for this session, but have withheld it. The honourable memher for Ballarat moved it. I tried to get a vote. not have a vote, for it knew that the House would have agreed that old-age pensions should be made £1 per week. Thank the LordI can help some of these old people by making up their pensions to what I think they should be! [7] NowI come to the question of whether it is money only. Honourable members will carry in their minds what I have said about the National Union, which is a power through all Australia. Are we to go back to the words of old Omar Khayyam, and say of the Country party members that they "" take the cash and let the credit go "" ? The Country party .will have to face the music"" Oh! the brave murmur of the distant drum !""-and when they go back again to the country they will not be a distinct party. They will have to go back as one party with the Nationalists. The Labour party will glory at the opportunity that will then be provided, with a full knowledge that we will be able to wipe out the Nationalist majority in the Senate, and will secure a majority in this House. There was some talk that they had not sought Cabinet for the sake of office, but had sought office for the sake of Cabinet. They merely rose from the dust of their dead selves and got better jobs. Why cannot the Ministry, which is aware of the facts as well as I am, take some action in those cases in which the children of the dear men who left their The present Prime dead bodies on the plains of Flanders and on Gallipoli are helping to pay interest on the war debt? When I asked a question on this subject.

I was informed that it. was a fact that the salaries of thesi The National Government dared people whom I have indicated were known. My second question was, "" With a view to apportioning a just taxation on those best able to bear it , will the Treasurer bring before the Cabinet the urgent 'necessity of publishing the net incomes of all citizens receiving over £500 per annum? "" Mr Bruce replied, "" No."" It was a very distinct "" No,"" and he added, "" There are many objections to such a course.""
