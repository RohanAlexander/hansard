My pledges to my constituents have been binding on my conscience and on my actions, and if honourable members opposite had been similarly bound we should not have the present state of affairs. The statement which I am about to read was made long after the honourable member for Ballarat had intimated that he intended to resign the position of Prime Minister. I felt it difficult to hold the Labour Party together, and to give to the Government of the day that full support which I thought necessary in accordance with views previously expressed. _ WhatI said is reported in Hansard in these wordsI desire to intimate to the House, and to the country, that which I have already privately intimated to the Prime Minister : that the Labour Party can no longer support the Government. I can only say that our relations with the Ministry, personally, have been of the most friendly character. barrassing circumstances have arisen, we have always endeavoured to co-operate in every possible way with the Government in regard to matters that we thought concerned the welfare of the Commonwealth. There have been situations of embarrassment in which I have always sought, to the best of my ability, to safeguard the interests of the Parliament, and the well-being of the country. WhilstI freely admit that we have frequently felt the restraint that a large party such as ours must feel in difficult circumstances, I , personally, have always held that, occupying the position that we do, we musttreat any Government situated as this Ministry is in a perfectly straightforward manner.

That has been denied to them. They are compelled by the terms of their engagement to work seven days a week. It has been said that the work could not be so arranged that it could be done in six days, but I am of opinion that by adding one-seventh to the number of men employed, each of the men could get a Sunday, or at least one day, off a week. That is my idea of arithmetic. I trust that the electors of Australia will soon have an opportunity to empower this Parliament to deal with industrial questions in that broad, general, and equitable way which would be justified from a humanitarian point of view-fro m the point of view of every honest-minded man who desires to see some meed of justice done to the toilers of this country. ber mean an absolute control of industrial legislation ? this Parliament should have power to do wealth. may not be desirable to undertake all the McMillan stated on the floor of this",26,Speech The Longest On Record I Take No Objec

Having the power to impose Customs and Excise duties, we can protect the capitalist, the man who has plenty of money to protect himself and his wife and family for a year without working, but we have not the power to protect the man who may not have capital enough to keep his wife and family for one week from the verge of starvation. Are we to be content with those limited powers because of the cry of unification ? This party will not be afraid to face that question. We think that larger industrial powers are necessary, and that they ought to be direct. We should have the constitutional power to authorize a Judge, after investigating the circumstances, to do justice to the toilers of the Commonwealth. Whatever be the result of the motion to be proposed, this Government will cheerfully accept the verdict, and I am glad to have the concurrence of the leader of the Opposition in the view that, as Parliament has come to a state of uncertainty, the best thing possible is for us to consult the people of the Commonwealth regarding the legislation which is to take place.

215,Sir John Forrest,"The honorableunrivalled in history, and every tale should be told. Under ordinary circumstances, I should not state these facts, but, within the last ten days, the honourable member for Ballarat has deceived me to an extent I never was deceived in my life before, though I was told I was his principal adviser, and believed it. That is the sort of thing I am not going to stand. other people are of that substance, and can be moulded as others please. I absolutely disown, and never wish to speak to, a man who has behaved as the honourable nfember for Ballarat has behaved to the people of the country. I emphasize the statement, which will appear in Hansard, that, within the last week or ten days, I have to my face been deliberately misled. may to talk to little boys like the honourable member. dear old friend, his father, had been here, because he would have had nothing to do with that in which his son is now taking part. honourable member's father was a fine old man, whom I respected and loved. I carefully read the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat at the Melbourne Town Hall; and in it I could find no reason whatever for the action he has taken. The speech, as a matter of fact, really supports the Ministry, if principles are to be considered; and I do not see why we should be called upon to take part in such action as that suggested by the honourable member for Ballarat. if the policy of which we approve is being carried out. There is no reason whatever for the defeat of this Government, as there was no reason for the defeat of the Watson Government; indeed, the action on the present occasion is ten times more scandalous than on the former. I know that in New South Wales, af any rate, the present Prime Minister, during his visit there, raised himself and the Labour Party fifty per cent, in the estimation of the people, and that there are now joining the Labour Party, many as high in social position as some I see sitting in the Opposition. These men are joining the Labour Party because they have met a Prime Minister who is fearless, strong, courageous, and truthful. [Si. orable member be quiet? I hope sectarianism will not keep the sectarian member, Joe Cook, in. I cannot stand this ! the honourable member alone, because he is the bete noire of the whole of Australia. I am not a putty fool, if I do not altogether agree with the financial proposals of the Government, but I should like to know how far the late leader of our party is going to turn himself inside out over those proposals? Is he going to do as he does in other matters? I am prepared for anything from him now, and, therefore, I shall not be deceived; and 1 am quite prepared to expect anything from two or three honourable members who are sitting with him, and who have ""turned dog"" as they have. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to smile, but I see no smiles on the faces of those who belonged I do wish, however, that my to our party. Those honourable members are in the cauldron now, and boiling, and will very scon be eaten, and placed in that oblivion where they ought to have been some time ago. I desire that there should be no delay in regard to the financial proposals. It has been suggested in a smoothtongued sort of way that the whole matter should stand over for five years. But it shall not remain in abeyance with my consent for five vears. I shall fight hard to have it settled immediately. If it had been finallv dealt with seven or eight years ao-o, we should hg.ve avoided the present trouble. The Post and Telegraph Department would not have drifted into its present position, nor would the States have received the large amounts which, in my opinion, ought not to have been returned to them. If it is to be allowed to remain unsettled, we shall have a continuance of the disasters that followed the action taken again and again against my wishes. I am prepared to map out my own course, and have no hesitation in describing as cowardly, a Ministry that will allow this matter to stand over for five years. Their idea is to put it aside in order to permit of the fusion, of parties that has taken place, and which must end in confusion. Their object is to allow it to stand over until after the elections. That is a cowardly position to take up, and I hope that the House will not tolerate it.

In the circumstances, if those in opposition to the coalition are prepared to work, as I hope and believe they are, we ought to be strong enough, not merely to stop the coalition, but to put it out. I suppose that it soon will be. I can always fight an open enemy, but not a false and treacherous friend. I find it impossible to light a man who has been undermining me, without my knowledge, while he has been in the heart of my confidence. I can fight a man who is openly opposed to me, and can respect his opinions; but, I repeat, that I can never fight a false friend, and that I never can and never will forgive one. Sometimes it takes a long time to find out a man, and the longer it takes the stronger and the' longer one should fight him when one does. That is my position. I regret it very much; but I feel constrained to speak strongly. I care nothing for the little gibes and laughter of those who have won. They have won over the death-bed of our party and its principles; they have won owing to the presence of our leading traitor, and other traitors in our camp. victory. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I acknowledge t that. ' I am confident that the people will stand by those who have stood to their guns and their principles. They did so in connection with the defeat of the Ministry led by the honourable member for South Sydney. They rejected the men who on that occasion played the part of traitors; but another, the honourable member for Ballarat, who had acted with them, lurked behind others, and did not meet his deserts. I do not wish to go into any minor matters that' have been touched on; but I wish fo refer briefly to the proposed Government note issue. An honourable gentleman who has joined my late leader, when Treasurer in a former Administration, sent to England, without the knowledge of his colleagues, a copy of a National Banking Bill. I knew nothing of the Bill until, through the instrumentality of the governor of the Bank of England, I saw a copy of it. When I saw it I was astounded. done.

It is a matter which the right honourable member may explain, if he desires, later on. that I heard the right honourable member, in his own office, give an instruction that the copies in the office should be burnt.

I refer to this. question of a Commonwealth note issue, because I cannot understand why an honourable member should object to the Government proposal,, although when he was in office he was in favour of, and produced, a Banking Bill, which he told me later on he was going to submit to the Parliament. That Banking Bill contained a great deal more than is proposed by the present Government. word about the Banking Bill or proposals of the Government in regard to it. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The present situation recalls to mv mind a little story concerning a very old friend of mine in the Parliament of New South Wales, who, although an able financier, did-not often make a fighting speech. On one occasion there arose in the State Parliament a crisis which I do not mean to compare with that now before us, since, in my view, this is the greatest crisis that has occurred in the political history of Australia.

I did think the honourable member was a little bit loyal, and not a turnturtle all the time. But the honourable member has been a Socialist and an antiSocialist, a revolutionary and a loyalist, a protectionist and an anti-protectionist. He has been everything, and has boxed the compass. he thinks he has turned round and become a protectionist again, but I never trust men who have led such a political life as the honourable member has done. t If he, and others with him, get hold of the Treasury bench, God help our Tariffi f they find an opportunity to destroy it ; but I do not think they will, because I believe the public would guillotine the honourable member before they allowed him to do it. I admired the honourable member for Ballarat when he stood up in this House and told honourable members sitting on the Opposition side to stay where they were-whe n he said to the Opposition corner, who proposed to shelter themselves behind us, "" Stop where you are."" That is where they ought to stop now. What did he call the whole of the Opposition but the wreckage of all parties without any policy? He has become the wrecker, and has been .enveloped in the wreckage. He has no policy. He has gone to damnation and perdition with those to whom he referred. That is one of the things that makes my heart bleed. Honourable members know that I am speaking what I feel, and that I feel very strongly, because it is a wrench to sever so long a. political partnership and association. I feel it very keenly. I have had many rebuffs during 'that time, and have swallowed them all, yet a man who is a man, and not a mouse or a thing, must feel it keenly when he has to sever his association with, not only one or two, but a good many others with whom, he had thrown in his lot, and to whom he has tried to be, and has been, loyal, only to meet with the disloyalty that I have met with. Disloyal men, whoever they are, must expect to receive the contempt which the public' will always have for them. ney-General) [4.59] "" When we find men voting against proposals, the principles of which they say they approve, rather than allow opponents to get them on the statute book, I think we have yet to learn what public spirit is . "" Those are remarks It was one that I did not uttered in a prophetic spirit by the honourable member for Ballarat on 31st October, 1906, and it is upon this very suitable basis that we may proceed briefly to consider the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves to-day. The honourable member must excuse me if I pay him more attention than others, because he cannot deny that on this occasion he deNow, if he could be trusted, 1 serves it. The honourable member has always, in this State, and throughout the Commonwealth, enjoyed a reputation for politeness, generosity, gentlemanliness of demeanour, and fair play, which, I regret to say, an examination of his career will hardly justify. While one under the glamour of his affability was very willing to forget many things, he has so timed his actions that we were barely able to forget the one before he managed to perpetrate a fresh enormity which recalled them all. I may be permitted to congratulate some honourable members whom I see opposite, and who find themselves today where they always were. Those men have always opposed the Labour Party, and have every right to do everything they can to put the Labour Partv out of office. To them, who are personal friends of mine, I can only say that I congratulate them now that they are one step nearer office than they were before, because in taking it I do not think they have sacrificed any political principle. A political opponent is a man whom we very often regard, and rightly so, as a personal friend. But there are some political friends for whom I regret that the most copious language in the world does not permit us to select a fitting epithet. In the career of the honourable and learned leader of the Opposition, since he entered this House, has there been an hour that he has enjoyed office and power save by the grace and help and aid of our party? Has he achieved anything in this country since Federation was established but by the help of this party? Is there one solitary law of importance that has been placed upon the statute-book by him save by our aid ? Is there anything, in short, for which he takes credit which is not due to the support of the Labour Party? 'For years, both while he was second in command, and since he has been Prime Minister in various Administrations, the Labour Party has extended to him a support loyal and generous beyond the power and reach of criticism. What, then, is the honourable member's re-",33,Adjournment Position Or The Ministry
242,Mr Hughes (West Svdney,"Attorcord with regard to ourselves ? A little while ago, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in criticising the programme of the Fisher Government, declared it to be substantially that of the Liberal Party with a few extras. now of the Fisher Government is, as the honourable member for Ballarat well knows, in substance that which the Labour Party has always put forward. It is a part of its platform, which I say most emphatically he has been content to carry out and to place upon the statute-book. If there is any law that has been passed since this Parliament was established to which the Labour Party has not given a cordial assent, and that he is proud of, let him state if. Has there been a difficulty in which he has been placed from which we have not extricated him? Has there been an occasion when he was in difficulties that he could find any other party to support him? That policy of the Labour Party, which one of his lieutenants declares-and he cannot deny it-is , or was, the policy of the Liberal Party, is the policy of the Fisher Government now Yet a policy which he was content to support cheerfully for the nine years we have kept him in office he now declares himself unable to consider any longer. We now find him undertaking to carry out what he terms a national policy, and I look around to see the gentlemen who are associated with him in that great work. I see among them the men whom he has always unsparingly denounced. A national policyand Mr Irvine! A national policy-and Mr Fairbairn! A national policy, and every reactionary in the Commonwealth is massed behind it. There is not a vested interest in this country now that does not acclaim him as their champion. He stands to-day under the banner of the Employers' Federation, under the banner of every vested interest, of every powerful monopoly. What a career his has been! hands, at various times, have rested the banners of every party in this country. He has proclaimed them all, he has held them all, he has betrayed them all. Let me ask what has he done for us? What has he done for the right honourable member for East Sydney? fortune to be associated with the right honourable member as a member of the New South Wales Labour Party in the State Parliament for five years. have often said things of each other which might perhaps with advantage have been left unsaid, but this I will say, that that r>ght. honourable member never gave us his word that he did not faithfully carry it out. Whenever he made a pledge to us, it was carried out to the letter and in the The programme spirit, whether it extended to a small thing or encompassed a large one. We have differed, and we are now in separate camps. But tie has never pretended since we broke with him, or he with us, to regard us alternately with that fawning affection, or that intolerant antipathy, that the honourable member for Ballarat, at different intervals, has displayed. The honourable member for Ballarat has thought fit to criticise the policy of this Government. He has done so in a way of which, since he never was at a loss for words, it can only be said that there are no words even at his command, to explain his position and attitude. It is a thing beyond words. It is very fitting that a party which met in comers and hatched in darkness this monstrous combination, and which announced its existence to the world in a Town Hall, to which admission was by ticket, should treat with contemptuous silence the Government policya policy which they cannot criticise, and dare not denounce. This policy is substantially that of the honourable member himself, save that behind it this time are men desperately in earnest. And the honourable member has capped his action by the application of the gag at the instance of his newest colleague. His new policy, hatched and fathered by the new Joshua, who does not bid the sun stand still, but gathers into one camp the hostile factions that for years have been at each other's throats, the honourable member for Ballarat will find indeed a boomerang that will hit him when he least expects it. He sits there now and his new colleagues with him. There are no open signs of dissension in that camp yet. In his The spoils have not yet been allotted. There is an air of hopeful expectancy about these gentlemen. They conceive that the eternal laws of mathematics, which have governed numbers since the world began, can be set aside, and that eight portfolios will go into forty-three in the way that It was my each desires. Their fond hopes are, in the majority of cases, not destined to be realized. But what power has dragged these various factions into one camp ? The We honourable member for Ballarat, in the speech which he delivered in the Town Hall on Tuesday night, put forward the "" national "" programme. I have perused that programme, and compared it with the Governor General's speech, and I find that, although he has referred to the list of measures in that speech as too long, covering legislation which is beyond the power of this Parliament, there are only two measures which were not in the programme which the late Government set on the business-paper. It is perfectly clear, then, that no measure has been put forward iby this Government which is not a proper one for discussion at this stage, more particularly since, if we are to believe these honourable gentlemen, events which have recently transpired render it a matter of vital urgency that the defence of Australia should at once be put on a proper basis. In the report of the honourable member's speech, I find those delightful xef erences to '' national and ever-pressing '' matters which have distinguished his programmes from the beginning. He begins with a ""national"" programme, and he thinks "" nationally."" ""national character and trade,"" ""sound protection,"" the "" new protection,"" "" White Australia and Immigration."" And in support of White Australia and Immigration, and the new protection, he has summoned to his aid the life-long enemies of that policy. These men now sit with those who all through their lives have fiercely denounced them as the foes of what they regarded as Liberal principles. He has still behind him the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whose boast has been that he is as good as a ' Labour man. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat now finds nothing to say against the programme of the Labour Party, not even that it is visionary or impossible, except that it is too Jong; but he says that there must be no caucus domination. What malignant power has dragged into association such men as the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke, and those whom they declared to be the friends .of a black Australia? Is there an epithet which they have not"" hurled against those with whom they now sit Cheek by jowl? Have they not denounced them times without number as the enemies of both the old protection and the new ? Was there ever such an immoral alliance as the present? Let me follow the history of its leader for a few moments. In doing so, I find myself embarrassed by the wealth of material, .when I dig for instances of inconsistency ' Mr Hughes. on his part. I shall not go back into the history of his connection with State politics; it will be sufficient to deal with his actions in this Parliament. Let us take his conduct towards the Watson Government. He, in a most public fashion, pledged himself to support that Administration. He shook me warmly by the hand, at the corner of Collins and Spring streets-anothe r kissed the man he was about to betray-and he assured me that he would extend to theWatson Government that support which it deserved, and which it had given him. Yet a little later, as he himself has declaredI heard him with my own ears in this Chamber-h e drafted the amendment moved downfall of that Ministry. author of that amendment. learned member has stated that he did not know that the amendment was vital to the existence of the Watson Administration; He speaks of but the right honourable member for East Sydney, when, last session, he referred to the statement that the honourable and learned member had been trapped into voting for it,, saidThe honourable gentleman spoke before he gave his vote, and after the statements I havequoted were made; and is it not within the recollection of every member of the House that, for days prior, it was known that the fate of the Government would depend upon the vote recorded? Days after the then Prime Minister had stated in the public press that he proposed to ask the House to go into Committee, and that if the House refused to remove the provision of the B i ll to which he objected, he would' make it a vital question. It was known all over the Metropolis, and all over Australia, that a fight for the l i fe of tlie Ministry was going on that night; and the present Prime Minister saidthen""We are not responsible for the fact that the Government choose to make it a vital question."" That is the gentleman who accused me last night, in the face of the House and the country, of entrapping him into a vote which he thought would not displace the Ministry, into a vote which he thought the then Government would not take as vital.. Here is that extraordinarily reckless Prime Minister the Prime Minister that it is not right to accuse others of entrapping him when his own words show the precise position of affairs. Surely the malignity of political differences does not go so far as that. "" We are not responsible""who were "" We ? "" My affectionate political wife, Mr Deakin, and, myself. honourable member.

The Prime Minister must allow me to point out -that whilst the Labor Party were supporting him from 1901 to 1904 there was a wealth of delightful amiability and affection displayed by him in his intercourse with the members of that party.

And as to greatness (the machine, the infernal machine, to which Australia. he takes exception, he was prepared to swallow that, too. Let us take his attitude towards our programme first. For instance, If Mr Watson is returned with a majority, If Mr Watson is returned with a majority, I sit on the Independent benches. J! T The features of the programme were lucidly with, and the audience were asked to note to the great work immediately before them, development of their beautiful land; the peopling which would permit us, in any circumstances, to peacefully work out our own destiny. Anti-Socialism, as was shown by the statements of Mr Reid's paper, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, was only another way of spelling antiprotection. Anti-Socialism was the new label, but precisely the same old free-trade party was underneath it. The Reid opposition will do of Australia's opportunities. The honourable member for Bourke, the echo then, as always, of his rather difficult leader, is spoken of in this wayThe candidate besought his hearers to beware of anti-socialists, who were simply free-traders animated with a desire to do harm. The antisocialist candidate had not the remotest chance of winning the Bourke electorate. We stand between the free-trade re-actionaries to deprive us of our moderate supporters by terrifying them with the imminent Mr Reid has talked more, and promised more . . . . His record in 1904 was one Act, of he contributed four clauses.

It was our caucus and methods to which he took exception. Now we come to his conversion on these points. The honourable member for Gwydir, by one of those flashes of genius which come across us all from time to time, was the instrument of Providence in this matter. Some time in March the honourable member submitted a motion that so disturbed the equilibrium of the Government that the honourable member for Ballarat positively thought of resigning. I ask the House to consider for a moment the kind of circumstances which would induce the honourable gentleman to do that. It must have been, indeed, a grave situation; it was, in fact, so he is piously thanking God that, amongst grave that the honourable gentleman could see no way out for some considerable time. He spoke in accents which any man not deaf to truth could hardly doubt conveyed that he really intended to resign. However, as time went on, he saw a better way; and in fortyeight hours or so proposals were made to the Labour Party for a coalition. I wish honourable members and the country to understand this particularly. The honourable gentleman, in March last, proposed a coalition with the Labour Party-no t a loose alliance, but a definite coalition. The honourable gentleman, in spite of his applying the gag, will have an opportunity of explaining later on, and, therefore, need hot interject. was not under any circumstances to be a member-that is all I desire to say. apparently is not yet passed, and some portion of the spirit is on me, for I have made the dumb speak. As to the progress and nature of the negotiations the House and the country are no more concerned than to know one or two things. honourable gentleman was concerned, they went to the point that he was prepared to even stand down and allow the leader of the Labour Party to be Prime Ministeralthough on that no actual agreement was arrived at-bu t there were to be four portfolios for the Deakin Party and four for the Labour Party. agreement proposed; and, if it was not consummated, the blame does not lie with the honourable gentleman and his friends. They were prepared to swallow not only our policy but our methods. They were prepared to contract an alliance with men whom we have lately been told practised the worse methods of Tammany. They were prepared to ally 'themselves with men whose methods are subversive of liberty, and which make democratic government in this country impossible. Even more, they were prepared to sacrifice four of their own men-to throw overboard anybody and everybody-so long as the honourable gentleman, who has led in turn all parties, might have an opportunity of leading one more. The tongue of the right honourable member for East Sydney is, unfortunately, tied, and we may not claim his assistance in this debate; but his genial soul is rejoicing, and other things, there are thorns even in the e most fragrant and attractive rosebud. That right honourable member called the honourable member for Ballarat a political Mormon; and, truly, the honourable member has made advances to all parties, has in turn embraced them all, and has deserted them all. He has now dragged into this great combination some men whom nothing but a miracle can save from the vengeance of the people, and he knows it. There are men amongst them who, if they went before their constituencies as allies of the gentlemen who sit in the Opposition corner, would not receive twenty-four hours'"" quarter, and who know that the day Parliament is dissolved is the day before their death. The honourable member for Ballarat knows that; but so long as he is in office, what matters it ? What matters the policy or fate of those who follow him, since he has never attempted to carry out any that was not the policy of those who stood behind him? When they altered he altered; , when they halted he halted. When they ceased to be useful he deserted them. When their policy ceased to be popular he abandoned it. Wep as s from this and come to the latest exhibition of the So far as the honourable member's versatility. The Fisher Government came in. Before that event, there was a vote of want of confidence moved, and, during the course of the debate, the honourable member for Ballarat spoke about the loyal support that had been given to him by the Labour Party. He said that when that party came in, if There was a definite it elected to come into power, he should not complain; but I ask the House whether the honourable member has since done anything else but complain?

252,Mr Hughes,"Age ticket? At page 17 of the introduction to the life of the late David Syme, we have the following clear admission, in the words of the honourable member for Ballarat himself, of his exceedingly great power as proprietor of the AgeThe relations between its proprietor and public to which he is pledged to his electors, men were intimate to a surprising degree. He enjoyed their confidence in and out of office, shaping their programmes from time to time, governing their selection of colleagues as incoming Premiers, and enjoying afterwards a knowledge of the inmost secrets of Cabinets often undisclosed to many of the Ministers within them. Here then is one of the methods by which the flag of freedom has been kept flying in this State. It is in a newspaper editor's sanctum that the policy of this country has been drawn up. It is at his bidding, and according to his view, that these honourable gentlemen have gone abroad to preach the doctrine of freedom. Free! They do not know even the meaning of the word. Free! Does the hdnorable member for Maribyr. nong say that he is comfortable now ? Why does he not sit with his friends? Why does he not go among those honourable members whom he declared to be the champions of a black Australia? Why does he not sit beside the Chairman of the Employers' Federation? His place is there. It is under that cegis that these honourable members now come at the instigation of the Age-unde r the domination of the Orange Political Party, against which not one of them-no t even the honourable member for Ballarat, who voted for the Home Rule resolution passed by this House, dares to say a word. It is, T say, under this sinister patronage that the great National Liberal policy is to be carried out. These honourable members speak of freedom and caucus domination. I reply that they were willing to embrace us caucus, platform, and everything else. They were -willing to share with us the portfolios of office. They were willing to do anything and everything so Jong as they might be permitted to hold office. What is still more interesting, they were willing to do this at intervals for years; they have been willing at any time between the beginning of the last recess and the present moment. What is the true reason for this unholy combination f Is it, as the honourable gentleman has clearly stated, that the Deakinite members of it feared for their seats? It is, then, not a matter of principle at all. These honourable members said that if we would give them a fair run, they would supMr Hughes. port us. They would have consummated an alliance with us, and have supported usup to the last moment, if by so doing they could have secured that. Whether it be right or wrong that we should oppose them, surely it is infamous that a man's principles,, should be a matter for bargaining of that sort. If I believe that the policy of the Labour Party is right, am I to purchase an hour's occupation of office by supporting, some other party, merely because it declares that, if I do so, it will not opposeme? Could there be anything more contemptible and indefensible? Yet the position of the leader of the Opposition is this : That he was prepared, even at theeleventh hour, to*embrace the Labour Party; but because the Labour Party opened up nonegotiations with him-too k no notice of him ; did not ask him what they were to do; but simply did that which they believed to be right, without consulting him, or any one else, he was irritated. Such methodsnaturallv infuriate and irritate a man of his type. He never ventured to do anything without consultation with those upon whose support he was dependent for every hour of hisoffice. To the eternal credit of the presentPrime Minister, be it said, however, that"" he never consulted any one except his colleagues ox his followers. He never went to any newspaper editor or to the Employers' Federation, or even to Joshua. It matters not to us what this man or thatr may think or say of us. That which well ave placed in the forefront of our programme we shall do, and shall ask no man, save the electors of this country, whether it is right or wrong. If , as honorable members opposite say, majority rule is in danger, how shall we ascertain whether or not that is so? There is one sure and certain way; but the passage to it is through cold, inhospitable and desert places. There is wailing and gnashing of teeth beyond. There will be many who go through the passage that will not emerge alive. Because of that, these honourable members, who talk of tlie rule of the majority, fear -as they fear the devil, I was going to say, but they do not fear him for they are his servants-fear , as they fear nothing else, an appeal to the people. And yet, if ever there was a-time when the people desired to have an opportunity to say what they think, it is now. Let those honourable members wholove liberty, and say that we are the foes of freedom and the people, put it to the issue of a struggle, and go before the people. Since they will not let us say here what is -to be said in defence of our policy, but cover up in a way that is shameless and unprecedented, their attempt to oust from clfice a party whose policy they have approved, -against whose administration they can say .nothing, whose policy they were prepared to adopt, whose methods they have criticised, but have been, for years, in the habit of -condoning, let them agree to go before the people. They admit that on two separate occasions, if not more, they were prepared to form a complete and workable alliance with us. They were prepared to form with -us a coalition as complete as was that which marked the Government of the right honorable member for East Sydney and the exhonorable member for Gippsland, Mr honourable member, too, has condemned the McLean. There was to be a sharing of portfolios. I wish to emphasize that point again, so that every man and woman in the Commonwealth may know that these honourable members were absolutely prepared to go 'bodily into the Labour camp, to work with us, to hear what w'e had to say, and to support a platform upon which we jointly -agreed. In the circumstances, the attitude of the leader of the Opposition, and of his party, is one which, in spite of -every effort they may make-and the effort now being made is defeating itself-wil l go forth to the people as an admission that -they have done now a deed of which they are heartily ashamed. I speak now of the generality of honourable members, and not -of any one individual. I know honourable members who now find themselves in company which they detest. all detest each other. member for Maribyrnong does not regard the political opinions of the honourable member for Fawkner with greater detestation -'than that with which the honourable member for Fawkner regards those of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. And the honourable member for Flinders! What are his political opinions? Since when have they -coincided with those of the honourable member for Bourke? Upon what particular principles are they agreed? What sanction 'have they for this agreement? Absolutely none. It were idle to attempt to say one word of the right honourable member for Swan, save that in him we have the piteous spectacle of a man grown old in the service of the country, who, in his insatiable lust for office, has made one more ignoble --twist. I shall not say that he has sacrificed any principle. Itwere as well to say that as to accuse a corpse of having sacrificed its life. But I do say that he has sacrificed what little dignity yet belonged to him. There these honourable members sit, and I do not wish to say one word more of them. What of the honourable member for Lang, whose touching appeal to the free-traders of New South Wales so lately appeared in the Sydney press? In that appeal he urged that the proposed concession to protection was indefensible. . I do not see him here in the body at the moment, but his soul must be torn with agony when he sees himself surrounded by honourable members whom he has vehemently denounced for many years, and who, so far as I know, he was prepared until yesterday to denounce. That caucus. What power has brought him into such a fol d ? To what do we owe the fact that he has signed an eternal truce in favour of protection? Whom should we congratulate in this combination? Who has secured the victory, and at What price? I hold that though no man has been victorious, since men at the mercy of such a leader live only from day to day, yet the reactionaries have the most right to triumph. The cause of Liberalism is hopelessly doomed when it depends upon the daily and hourly support of honourable members who have ever been its open and avowed enemies. If the honourable member for Ballarat be gifted with even ten times the eloquence of Demosthenes there are damning facts that will refute him and stop the ears of the public when he tries to explain these In fact, they matters away. How will he explain The honourable that a party with which for nine years, with One break of eleven months, he was in close association, with which he was prepared to contract an actual alliance, upon which he had been dependent daily and hourly for office, has been treated as he has treated us? How will he explain his surrender of the citadel of Liberalism to the hosts of re-action? The people will see that he has basely and ungenerously paid us for support given through long years by conduct which no man yet even on his side has ventured to defend, and no man in this country, save the honourable gentleman himself, will endeavour to defend. They w ill ' say there could have been only one reason for this conduct and that it was perfectly plain. The vested interests of this country have been aroused and alarmed. I look over the Governor General's speech and see the cause. We propose to impose a tax on the unimproved value of land. Honourable members opposite say little about that proposal, -but it is the main reason for their action. The Labour Party will do this thing, and they know it, and, therefore, their so-called principles have been abandoned, their so called scruples have been swallowed, and they are now banded together. The great vested interests needed a leader to protect them; and they have found one ready to their hand. He has persuaded those who called themselves democrats to go over to the reactionaries. He has persuaded the reactionaries, for the time being, to cover their vulpine faces with the wool of the sheep. But the people, when they have an opportunity, will tear that cover off them, and disclose them as they are. And they will sweep into outer darkness, too, those who, professing democracy, have betrayed them. I leave it now to the House and the country to decide between us. I venture to say that in spite of everything that the honourable member and his allies can do, they will be compelled to face their masters before very long. Immediately I rose, I heard an interjection, "" I s this a 'stonewall? ' "" It is not; know that those remarks are quite contrary but it is an appeal to the members of this -House for freedom of speech, which the Opposition has attempted to deny to tbe representatives of the people. prepared to support the motion of the Prime Minister to get on with the legitimate business of which he had given notice, as embodied in' the Governor General's speech. those who were anxious to get at that business. I have lately been associated with a number of men for whom I had a feeling of personal respect, as well as of strong political affinity. boasts, in which I joined, was that at all times they believed in fair play. But now that they have left the party to which I am proud to have belonged for so many vears-w e have not left it, but have stood by our principles, and it is they who have gone-on e of their very first acts has been to denv to others that freedom of speech and libertv of criticism which they have always claimed, by lending themselves""to an unprecedented and most shameless effort to gag the representatives of the people, and deny them the opportunity of saying in the only effective manner possible"" I am in favour of the Liberal policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister, and approved by the leader of the Opposition, and I wish to give effect to it . "" Like my old friend and associate, the honourable member for Hume, I feel very strongly on this question, and I am going to use plain language. 1 did mv best to point out to the members with whom I was associated what I conceived to be my duty and theirs, and that was to stand by our principles, and not to attempt to get away from any consequences that adherence to those principles might entail. [ failed, and only myself and a few others remain of the great national Liberal Party of Australia. We have been placed in a position in which we ought not to have been placed. History has repeated itself on this occasion. I well recall the time when the Labour Party were previously in power, under the honourable member for South Sydney, a man respected in this House and in the country. I recall also my own action at that time, and the action of those friends who are now associated with me. I remember keenly the dastardly tricks that were resorted to in order to displace that Government from power. able member is too old a member not to to the Standing Orders, and I ask him to withdraw them.

It was done in such a way as todestroy the feeling of pride which every Britisher has at all times in the intention to give fair play even to his opponent, and not hit below the belt. On that occasion, the blow was struck below thebelt. I have no desire now to re-quote thestatements which I made then, although 1 can well remember them, and they are recorded in Hansard.; but I resented asstrongly then as I do now, the manner in which we, as friends and associates, and' not foes, of a party who had absolutely as-",39,Adjournment Position Or The Ministry

To-day we had an undoubted right, established by precedent, to debate the great question of the policy submitted to the people by the Prime Minister on the one hand, and criticised by the leader of the Opposition on the other. That policy is now before the public in a concrete form, but the Opposition, by their action to-da,v, will to a certain extent succeed in closing our mouths as to whether we are going to stand by that policy and by our pledges, or be traitors to the cause. The situation can be viewed in no other light. We were a great party, but we now number only four. I was one of the three who, in the face of all the capio talistic influence, the land-owning interests, and the free-trade and importing interests, raised the banner of protection for Australians in New South Wales twenty-four vears ago. I have kept that banner flying ever since, and I have on this occasion' taken action with my old friend and associate, the honourable member for Hume, because I wanted to see that banner continue to float over Australia. down my political life at any time in its defence, and I will not join with anv set of men. who will drag it down into the dust for the sake of gaining office temporarilv, or saving their own political skins at the next elections.

We do not want this hide-and-seek business. We want fearless, courageous action on the part of the representatives of the people, in order that the country may be shown that the difference between ""the policy put forward by the Prime Minister and that proposed to be submitted on behalf of the Opposition is Tweedledum and Tweedledee. difference is that the Labour Party are getting the plums of office, and the other party want to get them out. This move [27 MAY , 1909.] Adjournment. 141 has been taken for no other purpose; and I say that it is an unholy act to displace a set of men simply in order to take their places without altering their policy. Looking back into history, a study of the works of any great parliamentary authority will show that whenever trouble arose between the two great political parties in England, no Government was ever displaced except on a difference of policy. But this Government is to be displaced without any difference as to policy. I ask my old colleagues and associates to point to one plank of the policy enunciated in the Governor General's speech with which they disagree. I want them to show the country what it is that they disagree with, ber will kindly remember that the debate upon the Address-in-Reply has been adjourned, and that no matter relating specifically to that question can be dealt with in this debate.

Sitting .suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. not my intention to take up much time in discussing the motion for adjournment. I regret exceedingly I have not an opportunity to give an explanation of my vote this afternoon. taken away by the tactics adopted, which I deplore, as I always have deplored any tactics not open and above board. Whether it is my own party, or any other that is in power, I believe we are sent here as honourable men to conduct the business of Australia in a straightforward and honourable manner, and, if we have cause to question any action of a Ministry, to attack that Ministry openly. I contend that, in this case, that plan has not been adopted; and, therefore, I voted as I did this afternoon, and as I ever shall do under similar circumstances while I have the honour of a seat here. time here be long or short matters little to me. opinions I hold, I should not have offered myself as a candidate for the representation of Bass; but, as a free-trader represented the district, and as I was a protectionist, I thought it necessary for me, or some other protectionist, to contest the seat, and, as I did, win it . I am here as a protectionist, not bound to any party or any section in the House; and although those I have been associated with as strong protectionists in the past have chosen to leave the party of protection and join with those who have always been free-traders, I could not fal l in with that arrangement. While there may be a sort of mutual arrangement on a few planks, we know that majority rule is the right rule; and if the majority be conservative or free-trade, protection is not likely to be upheld or advanced very far. Therefore, I could not see my way to vote with honourable members opposite against the party which assisted the Government I supported for so long. I hold in my hand a document showing the good work done by the Deakin Government; and that work I have always regarded with pleasure. The number of measures placed on the statute-book by the Deakin Government is very creditable indeed for the time they were in office. But who gave that Government the power? The Labour Party, .which has been forsaken for a reason which has not been given; and I submit that a Government and party, the members of which have been associated in the doing of so much good work, ought not to be abandoned without rhyme or reason. The only reason I have heard advanced for the vote this afternoon is the fact that it will have the effect of putting the Labour Government out. So far as I am concerned, I shall never vote That opportunity has been to depose any Government until some measure is brought forward of which I disapprove. Whether the free-trade or any other party be in power, I shall assist them so long as their measures are in accord with my principles and opinions. On a question of this kind we should put aside all party and individual ill-feeling. 1 can differ from any member of the House, or any man in Australia, and yet not "" f a l l out "" with him. If a man be guilty of something I consider mean or contemptible I should not trust him in the future, but, at the same time, I ' should not feel inclined to "" f a l l out "" with him. I deeply sympaWhether my thize .with those with whom I have been associated in the past, in the position in If it were not for the political which they now find themselves. They think it necessary for the welfare of Australia to join those who have always differed from them; and that must be a pill hard to swallow. I do not know how they like the company they are in, but that has nothing to do with me, and I have simply to deal with the facts as I find them. WhateverI may say on this occasion will never interfere with any personal friendship I have made in the House, or out of it ; nor do I look on this question as one affecting myself. I know that a certain section of the press will, as before, state that I have joined the Labour Party. Ever since I have taken any interest in politics I have always been democratic in my ideas, and was a liberal and a protectionist before there was a labour member in Australia. I still hold those views, and will support democratic measures. Though not a member of the Labour Party-and I nevet shall beI dc not blame the members of that party for their actions, or .the way in which they transact their business. If the Labour Party had been treated as they should have been, I do not think I . should have had so much feeling against some honourable members opposite; but when I find honourable members there making statements, in which they show, to put it mildly, a large amount of ignoranceI do not know whether it is anything else or not-in accusing the party of cer-",45,Brown How Coul D They Have Been Closed An Opportunity To Express

Labour Party, both inside and out of Parliament, whom I respect; and I contend that remarks by many honourable members opposite have not been in accordance with fact, or right or fair in debating political questions. I have, therefore, always felt a little sore on account of the attacks trorn honourable members opposite on the Labour Party. There are many observations one would like to make on an occasion of this kind, but we are not allowed to debate the Governor General's speech, or enter into a consideration of the proposals of the Labour Government, whether we agree or disagree with them. On another occasion, some time ago, there was a remark made as to having the "" numbers in the bag,"" and, though great exception was taken to that phrase at the time, I must say that it now seems as though it was a case of the kind, and that the Labour Government have to go. shall hear what measures the other party will bring forward. At various times I supported the Reid Administration, as I did when I considered they were unfairly attacked by the Labour Party, who tried to count them out. now sorry he did so? that every Government is in power by the will of the majority of the House; and, so long as the actions of Ministers are straightforward and honourable, and their measures are in accordance .with my wishes and desires, 1 shall support them. On the other hand, I would oppose measures introduced by my best friend if I did not approve of them. In the State House, I always advocated measures, and not men; and if we had more of that ideal and less of party feeling here, the better it would be for Australia. -months the Labour Ministers have been travelling about Australia, while I think it -would have been better if they had been attending in their offices to the business of the country. However, as matters are at present, they are bound to take such steps if they are to maintain a majority; and, while I consider such proceedings a. mistake, I suppose that necessity knows no law, and that where the public drives members must go, and they apparently conceive it to be their duty to travel and enlighten the public on the country's affairs. Under the present system we have so many There are many members of the different administrators that there is no wonder the administration of the Public Departments is not what it should be. Since the inception of Federation, we have had something like six different Treasurers, and eight or nine Ministers of Defence. The present Minister, during the last six months, has worked very hard, and endeavoured to master every detail of the work of his Department. The Government propose that he shall go to England to attend a Conference there, ibut we are told now that he is not to go. the reason for the action against us. I do not know whether or not that is true. fence, we are told, is not now to attend the Conference in England. In his seat, we are to have an honourable member who will atNo doubt we tend the Conference after holding office as Minister of Defence for perhaps a day or a week. He is to be sent home, although he will not have the experience that the present Minister possesses. This is another illustration of the evils of the present system of party government. I hope to see the day when this party system will be done away with, and when we shall have as Minister of Defence, or as Treasurer, the best man for the post in the whole Parliament. It is useless, however, to labour these questions at the present time, and I shall be content to explain my position. I am a member of the 'Liberal Democratic and Protectionist party, and as such am not going to be led into a party where the Liberals will be dominated by a majority holding different views. I intend to retain my independence as a member of this House. I shall offer myself for re-election, whenever the election takes place, and if I am not returned, During the last six I shall be content to stay at home and to attend to my own business. that it is only by taking advantage of the forms of the HouseI can express my reasons for the vote that I gave this afternoon in connection with the displacement of the Ministry.

291,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [ 7 . 5 9 ],"I regret146 in the country throughout my life. Two things had to occur before I , as a member of the Liberal Party, could take a seat on the Opposition benches. The Liberal Party had first of all to terminate their connection with the Labour Party. What is that connection, and what was its basis? On 27th November last, the honourable member for Ballarat, in a calm and telling speech, pointed out the many blunders that the Opposition made on the famous day when the present Prime Minister moved what was taken as an expression of wantof confidence in the Deakin Administration. The honourable member for Ballarat impressed upon the House the fact that rabid anti-Labour members, contrary to all their professions, had voted on that occasion to put a Labour Ministry in office. Those honourable members retaliated by saying that the honourable member had kept them there. His reply was: ""That is a fair statement of the 'position. We will keep them there as long as they carry out our policy."" He went on to sayI f , in the future, we find thnt the proposals of the Government cause us embarrassment, and unduly restrain our freedom, we shall not support it. If its programme places us in a false position in regard to our constituents, or if I cannot control the hostile criticism, of my followers, we must withdraw our support. He also saidTheythe Labour Partyare free from any obligation to us, just as we were free of obligation to them. They will take the course which they believe, in accordance with their principles, to be most advantageous to the country, and by that they will be judged. In a similar manner the whole Opposition, and also honourable members in this corner, who are not included in the direct Government party, will be properly judged by their conduct as they offer factious resistance to reasonable proposals, or give them the support they deserve. We cannot avoid being judged by this standard, and we ought to be judged by it. I fully endorse that statement of the principles of the party. But what is the present position ? I understand that the reason for the severance of the Liberal Party from the Labour Partv is that our seats are being attacked in the country. Immunity from opposition was no part of our promise of support to the present Government.

We knew that theMinistry could not grant us immunity from opposition in view of the experience of the party when the honourable member for South Sydney, as Prime Minister, gave a pledge that was ruthlessly ignored by the Labour leagues in this State. No one would think of asking a Government for that which they could not grant. for South Sydney never promised immunity. Several honourable members interjecting, made across the chamber are more than usually disorderly. Conversations betweenhonorable members on the two sides of the House, and not addressed to the honorable member who is speaking, must entirely cease. honourable member reveal these secrets? the matter. I was not a member of the House on the occasion to which I refer,, but I gathered as an outsider that such a pledge was given. If my impression iswrong, I shall not press it. What hashappened since the present Government took office to necessitate the proposed change? We allowed them to go into recess to administer the affairs of the country, and toprepare a programme for the forthcoming session. It seems to me that that act onour part also carried with it the proposition that they should be allowed to submit their programme to the House, and that,, as the honourable member for Ballarat stated on the occasion to which I have referred, they should be judged by their actions, and the programme that they thought fit to bring forward. The honourable member for Ballarat said that if theproposals of the Governmentcause us embarrassment and unduly restrain ourfreedom, we shall not support it. I have heard no statement as to what particular proposal made by the Government is likely to embarrass us or to restrain our freedom. It seems to me that it was necessary that they should bring down their proposals, and that as reasonable men we should deal with them on their merits. There are in His Excellency's speech proposals that I shall not support-proposals that I am prepared to vote against, ifegardless of whether my vote does or does not bring about the downfall of the Ministry.

In the interests of the country, it seems to me that the Government should be allowed to go on with them. I confess I do not know of any act of administration by the Government that would justify our turning them out of office. It is true that I heard the statement-conceive d in the great statesmanlike mind of the honourable member for Fawkner"" they have raised the telephone rates,"" but I can scarcely imagine that as a reason ""for displacing the Government of the day. know whether or not their new proposals in regard to the telephone rates are absolutely fair, but I do know that the people residing in country districts will be glad of some arrangement that will enable them to obtain, not exchanges, but telephone, lines in remote isolated parts of Australia where they cannot now be obtained, although the people are prepared to give the necessary guarantees, and to contribute half the cost of construction. them, even in cases .where the people have paid their -proportion of the cost. ception of the statesmanlike idea conceived by the honourable member, for -'Fawknerand that can hardly be a matter of national * importanceI have heard of no complaint regarding the administration of. the affairs of the Commonwealth by the present Government that would justify our turning them out of office. Then, again, I hold that they . should have been permitted to -submit their proposals to Parliament. Our party, as recorded in the public press, some time ago made a request to the Prime Minister to call Parliament together at an early date. I concurred in that request, which was made for the reason that we desired that the Parliament should get to work as soon as possible in view of the .great volume of business to be transacted before the close of the session. The Government did not call Parliament together -earlier than they intended, and the time at our disposal, consequently, is less than we had hoped to have. Yet how is it proposed to spend that time? pushing on with business we are to have an adjournment extending over a fortnight to enable a new Ministry to prepare for the work of the session. When it meets the House, I suppose we shall have an almost -endless discussion, on the opening policy .speech of the new Prime Minister. That, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the appeal which we made for an early meeting of Parliament in order that the business of the country might be expedited. Let us turn now to the Government programme and see what it contains. It includes a non-party measure dealing with a question of supreme importance that has been awaiting the attention of this Parliament from the inception of Federation, and which I am afraid will be dealt with too late. I refer to the measure relating to the defence of Australia. The Government have made. I do not proposals based practically on the lines of those made by the Liberal Party. They are somewhat extended, and I think that the present leader of the Opposition said at Toowoomba that they were a very exclellent .set of proposals. That measure could be discussed by us from a non-party point of view. It is the duty.of every honourable member to so discuss it. It should be dealt with, without a moment's delay; but it is to be set aside and to remain in abeyance longer than it should. That seems to me to be at least one wrong that we should db by further postponing the transaction of public business. ' I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Bass in regard to the way in which Ministries are made and unmade. I have long been opposed to the proposed system of elective Ministries, because I have doubted whether it would cure the evils at which it aims; but our experience of the last few days has made me a convert to the principle. I am prepared to support ai system of elective Ministries, or any other that will put an end to the present system of carrying on the business of the Commonwealth Parliament. It was an unholy alliance that put the Labour Party into power, it is an equally unholy alliance that is putting them out."" There was something more that had to happen before I could take my seat on the Opposition side of the House, and that was that I should become a member of the coalition, combination, or "" fusion,"" as it is called. No one has yet defined the difference between fusion and coalition, and ""coalition"" is good enough for me. At the last general election I Instead of pledged myself that I would under no conditions support a coalition between my leader and the then leader of the Opposition. I have also stated, during the last three months, on nineteen or twenty platforms that on no consideration would I support a coalition between my leader and the honourable member for Parramatta.

I shall never support a party membership of which involves great sacrifice of principle. has been said that my late colleagues are sacrificing no principles. I am glad to think that they are not doing so, and if the programme as drawn up is carried out in the spirit as well as in the letter, they will not have sacrificed any; but there is another party to the coalition, or two parties, and they are going to make a tremendous sacrifice of the principles of a life-time. Those men have in this House and on various platforms throughout Australia condemned almost everv one of fhe proposals that to-day they have swallowed. Of course, it may be that they honestly intend to carry out these new ideas, and that they have surrendered their principles and offered themselves up for the good of the country. If they have, this will be known for ever in the history of Australia as the time of the great renunciation; but I. have had too much experience of mankind as a politician and a lawyer to have any faith in the idea that these men are saints come down from Heaven to renounce their principles for the good of the country. I venture to say that the result will be that my colleagues will endeavour to carry out the principles that they have always adhered to and which they believe in, but will find themselves restrained. The position is the most extraordinary that I have seen in the history of politics in this State or in the Commonwealth, because, although I have been only a short time in the House, the study of politics has been my only hobby, and I have followed it closely since I was a boy of fourteen. We have to-day the spectacle of , I think, thirty-two members going down on their principles to a little band of ten-a band which they declared in this House and on every platform to be a disappearing party.. Are their actions in consonance with their statement that it was a disappearing party ? It seems to me that some of them-particularly the Victorian members, whom I know best-are in desperate dread concerning their own seats. They got in at the last election by posing as protectionists, and want to get in at the next Mr Wise. by posing as Liberals. I for one am not prepared to allow them to carry that flag in my company, and I am afraid that their liberalism will be about as effective as their protection was when the Tariff was under earliest moment. consideration. The whole of those thirty-two men go down on their knees to this disappearing Liberal Party, arid say, ""Save us, good Liberals, save us; we will It accept all your principles, at variance with ours though they be."" And still more amazing, they say, ""We thirty-two will go down and let you ten have the leader."" It is not to be an equal-in-all-things arrangement, but the leader is to be taken from the ten, and, I believe-although , of course, I know nothing of this-that the ten are to have an equal number of members in the Cabinet, judging from what I saw in one of the papers. It is a position that I confess I have no faith in, and the action taken today confirms me in the grave doubts I had as to the exercise of the power of thirty-two over ten, because I am satisfied that none of my late colleagues were guilty of originating the cruel treatment extended to us, their old colleagues, when an endeavour was made to gag us, and deny us the right to address ourselves to the House and put ourselves right with the country. I felt that more than anything that has happened in this House, and I say sincerely that I am satisfied that in that matter our ten were over-borne by the other thirty-two. Thebest proof of that lies in the fact that it was not one of the ten that moved the gag., but one of the direct Opposition, and ceitainly they could have selected no more fitting man to do it than the small-minded^ member for Wentworth. I have the most perfect faith in my late colleagues. I parted with them as friends, and I hopeto retain their friendship as I trust they will retain mine. We can differ politically, without being bad friends, and I hope I have said nothing to-day to make our differences a matter of personal feeling. I believe they have done what they think to be best in the interests of the country, and I am satisfied that they will giveme credit for the same motive. Weon this side are now left as four separate individuals, and can hardly be called a party. The Liberal Party may be said 7 almost to have ceased to exist. But I intend to carry out the principles that I ' pledged myself on the platform to support,. no matter from what Ministry they come? If the new Government bring in the measures which they profess themselves ready to bring in, and which are in their programme, and if I approve of the details of those measures, I shall support them as heartily as though they came from a straight-out Liberal Government. I have received no promise of immunity from any party in this country. I _ have never asked it from them. I did not connect myself .at the time of the election with any association-clerical , sectarian, or anything else-excep t the Liberal Party to which I used to belong and to which I hope I still belong. I am prepared at the next election, without asking immunity from any one, to go before my constituents and tell them that I have carried out my pledges. I may be met with a three-cornered fight or straight out opposition, and be defeated. I shall not regret it, although I suffered five defeats in the interests of my party, and was a long time before I got a seat in Parliament. I was proud to win it in a big straight-out fight, free from personalitiesperhaps the biggest fight that was made for my party in Victoria, In winning it, I did what I considered was the greatest good for my party, in defeating the most dangerous opponent that they had. I am prepared now, and at any time, to sacrifice seat after seat rather than sacrifice or deviate from my principles. I shall be. satisfied if I do go down to be able to say "" I have fought the fight; I have kept the faith."" Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [8.19] I listened to the new leader of the Opposition to-day charging the present Government with bringing in a programme for purely show purposes.

The honourable member wanted to carry out ar> expensive naval and compulsory military defence scheme, the transfer of the Northern Territory, which would cost a large sum of money, the establishment of a High Commissioner in London, with expensive buildings, and penny postage, which it was estimated would compel him to sacrifice about ,£300,000 a. year in revenue, together with all those other large commitments to which I have referred; and yet the honourable member did not bring down one proposal of any description to find the money for anyI said one of them._ He did not even propose to procure anything from a land tax. In raising the objection's that this Government have put forward a programme merely for show purposes, and that they have not provided proposals to raise the money to carrv it out. the honourable member must be speaking with his tongue in his cheek, especially when we remember the situation in which he found himself only a few months ago.

Perhaps it will be interesting to note what the Melbourne Age had to say recently about the honourable member. On 2nd April, in commenting on the speech of the honourable member at Bendigo before the Australian Women's National League, the Age referred to the second in command of One. is to get a Prime Ministerthe Opposition, as followsMr Joseph Cook has his merits, and one of those merits is that he has just done a service to Liberalism. His Bendigo speech before .the Australian Women's National League proclaimed him as starched and rigid a Conservative as ever he was. It would not be worthwhile taking any note of this were it not for the fact that he had previously been angling for an alliance with the Liberals. What have these "" good as labour men "" to say to that ? If Conservativesand this refers to the New South Wales free-tradersfeel themselves able to accept all the principles of the Liberal policy of the past-protectio n at the Customs House and statutory protection to the wages of the worker, bonuses to special industries, an enlargement of the national functions, the abolition of the Naval Subsidy-the creation of an Australian Navy and the settlement of the monetary relations with the States on a basis which will make the national needs predominant-that is well. We said that Mr Joseph Cook at Bendigo did a service to Liberalism. This was in frankly taking up the Deakin challenge and proclaiming himself the enemy of all legislative progress, and in thus showing that his ideals fundamentally differ from Liberalism on almost every current question of prominence. the kind was passed by the If that be so, who have thrown their principles overboard in order to dip their heads together in the nosebag? The article proceedsSpeaking of the New Protection, the power tp obtain which Liberalism and Labour alike desire to see incorporated in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Mr Cook has nothing but ridicule for it. He regards it as "" a madcap scheme,"" which can never be made operative in this country. .He thinks the fact that the States have the power to give the New Protection is quite sufficient, and that the National Parliament ought not to have it. We venture to say that on that question alone there is such a radical difference between Mr Cook and Mr Deakin as should prevent those two men attempting to join hands politically.",53,Brown How Coul D They Have Been Closed An Opportunity To Express

Here is the Parliament of New South Wales on the Age againWe may take another case in which he has hibits the honourable member as a repubrendered equal service. In the past Conservatism licanhas always been strongly opposed to the creation of an Australian Navy, just as Liberals have favoured it. They have time and again proclaimed their convictions that Australians cannot do anything-in defence apart from England', and that our true policy would be to quadruple our Naval Subsidy of ^200,000, and place our interests candidly under the protection of the British flag without any aspirations after Australian ships and Australian sailors. There was quite a vital difference between the Liberal and the Conservative on this defence question. The Liberal policy has been to abolish the subsidy, and spend it on the creation of an Australian fleet of coast defence cruisers and torpedo craft. Mr Cook says he regards it as "" the height of meanness to suggest the withdrawal of the annual vote of ^200,000 to the. Imperial Government""the very thing that the Deakin Government did. He further says that he has no objection to an Australian fleet, but it must be part of the Imperial Navy and under Imperial orders. rf What have the lip loyalists of Dalley, position on the Treasury bench, he is preWentworth, and P.arkes to sav to this statepared to throw his principles overboard, and ment of Deakinite principles? The conat the same time to charge others with excluding portion of this powerful article is pressing similar views, although they have as followsI f we go a little further, and try to get at the however, was before Joseph went down into Conservative mind on the question of CommonEgypt, and when he had only a few of the wealth and State finances, we find fhe same divermany colours which now adorn his political gence. Mr Cook looks first of all to the monetary convenience of the States. He would supcoatport the payment of at least ^6,750,000 to the States out of the Customs revenue, quite regardless as to whether the Commonwealth has or has not enough money to meet its own expenditure. Faced with the fact of a Federal) shortage, in which the Commonwealth must either tax or borrow to make ends meet, he says"" Borrow."" In other words, it must give away its own monejr irrespective of its needs, and contract loans to make up its deficits. We venture to say that, as a political criticism, Mr Cook's Bendigo speech is exactly worthy of the Antediluvian party for which it was made. reactionary and unprogressive and un-Australian. It has not a single illuminating note in it. It is the negative of all that a Liberal prizes. And it comes very opportunely to let us know that, whatever else may be done or left undone, it is quite impossible to conceive of any coalition between the Liberal partu and the mouthpiece of such an antiquated set of political fallacies as those advanced at Bendigo. Those are the principles which the Age discovered in those gentlemen opposite, who have been put to the extremity of coalescing for the purpose of turning the Labour Government out of office. It might be interesting to refresh some honourable members' minds with a few expressions of opinion from the honourable member for Parramatta himself. I first quote a portion of his question of Australian Federation, and exOn the broad outlines of the scheme, I should like to say one or two words about fhe question of Federation under the Crown. I do not know that I am a red-hot Republican-a t any rate, not one of those Republicans who say they will do nothing until they can get a Republic. I believe the destiny of these Colonies will be that of a Republic, and whenever it comes I shall certainly hail it, if it does come in a way which will meet the aspirations of the great bulk of the people without any great hardship accruing. I admit that Royalty, as far as the Government of these Colonies is concerned, is almost purely nominal. We are not very badly olT under the monarchical system of government after all. That quotation is quite sufficient to show that the honourable member in his heart believes in republicanism, and yet, lor the purpose of accommodating liimself to the views of other people, and of obtaining a not said anything of the kind. That, But the great objection I have to Royalty is that Mr Labouchere raised to it the other day -that it has such a tendency to the creation of social servility, that it tends to set up orders of being in the State, different castes and gradations in society, and all that kind of thing which is subversive of the great intelligence and education of our time. Further on, after discussing the United States, the French, and the South AfricanI t is everything that is Republics, he saysI do not want a Republicanism with which such effects of government are associated. A Republic will come in Australia. I am firmly convinced, but when it does come I hope it will leave behind the troubles and oppressive conditions now associated with those forms of Republican government which exist, in the countries I have mentioned. Then, in reference to the Governor General, he saysWe were told here last nightI think it was by interjection of the Attorney-General-that we must have a Governor General sent out to us by the Government of Englandi f we are to have parliamentary government. Now, I take leave to dispute that statement altogether. It does not follow at all that to have parliamentary government we must have a Governor General appointed by the authorities in England. And later on, he tried to show the difference that they ever should have been given. The between loyalty and servilityIt has been asserted to-night that those who -dare say a word concerning tha operations of our fleet are disloyal to the Mother Country. I repudiate any such assertion. member who made so much of loyalty to-night was mistaking loyalty for servility. Those who rebel against all servility cannot therefore be tailed disloyal. . . . The limit of loyalty of any people must always be determined by a sense of obligation to one's -own people. '-We have heard this honourable member talking about the confiscatory land tax of the Labour Party. Let us see what his real opinions are on that question. The honourable member referred to the sacred rights of property, and saidIt is the one thing above all others that has .cursed this country, and has cursed every other -country of which we have any knowledge, and unless it be abolished it will curse these countries in the future as they have never, yet been -cursed. The initial wrong done to society is in attempting to recognise such a thing as property in land. There can be no property in land i i i «the sense that there is property in houses, or in anything else that men make by the use of their -muscles and brain. Property in land is a thing -which no man can make, although he may possess -it. The. only thing that can possibly make private 'property in land is old legal enactments -which have given away the people's birth right, and are now making it possible for men who .never did a day's work in their lives to pass stringent measures exacting tribute from men who are craving the means of existence. property iu land is the step to all our other -.movements going in the wrong direction, and we must retrace it or suffer the evil consequence -which will be disastrous to our country and civilization. <by the new leader of the Opposition? Mr J. H . CATTS -It was made by the second in command, the honourable member for Parramatta. He went on to sayThe honourable and learned member was unfortunately emphasizing the sacredness of pri-vace property in land. Who made this private property in land, of which we have heard so much? No value at all attaches to land except the value that the demands of people give to it. Nothing that man can do to land can give it a -value. It is only when population is surging round a particular spot, and other people want -it, that it is acquired. It is a fictitious property in reality, and should be carefully differentiated from other property in every respect. Further on he saidIs the practical enlightenment of the nation -to be set aside out of respect to this old effete grabbers and land speculators have this country enactment? I say that it is an insult to our by the throat. civilization to set these rights up as sacred things Mr no w Sir William-McMillan interto be regarded, in a sacred light. .nothing at all sacred about them. The only jected, "" Why does not that member tell idea is that of their monstrosity-of amazement the truth?"" and the honourable member for only thing we wonder at is that men should have been so stupid and foolish in days gone by as to barter away the rights of the people. Despite these statements, we find him to-day The honourable surrounded by honourable members whom he then declared to be bartering away the rights of the people, and claiming a proI want to say this : perty in land to which they had no right. He also saidAre we in this country, where this kind of thing has not yet been recognised, by the Legislature at all events, to set up this example for those who come after us? It seems to me that if we do any such thing, the time will come when we shall be cursed in our graves for ever having consented to such an iniquitous proposal. . All this of course is done in the name of the sacred rights of property. Governments only exist, we are told, for the preservation of property. The sooner we knock out this old idea, or any idea of property attaching to land, the better for this and every other country. This is the one initial mistake we have made, and until we rectlfv it things will continue to go wrong. . . . I do not mean in any crude or ill-digested fashion, but I do say a legitimate attempt must Be made in this time of distress and depression to assist them on to the soil and never mind so much the sacred rights of property. . the Employers' Federation working under such a leader. Mr J. H . CATTS I think it is true, as has been said, that, although the honorPrivate. able member for Parramatta is certainly a leader, he is not the trusted leader of the representatives of the big moneyed men and the land monopolists of Australia. He no more believes in the principles which he has espoused as a member of the Opposition than I do, and.if he spoke the truth he would repudiate them. I am sure that at heart he believes to-day in the principles that he advocated on the occasion to which I am referring But the point is that it suits his personal interests independently of the interests of the country to throw them overboard, in order that he may obtain a seat on the Treasury bench. He» went on to sayThe great evil in this country is that, while' its industries are declining, there is under the present system of government no possibility of creating alternative employment for the people.

Some time ago I saw a cartoon dealing with the honourable member for Parramatta which I think is one of the most effective that has ever come under my notice. It dealt with two periods in his career. In the first place it depicted the honourable gentleman as taken from the coal mines of Lithgow and returned by his fellow miners to the Parliament of New South Wales. We saw him with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and his trousers fastened with "" bowyangs,"" just as he was taken from the coal mines to give effect in Parliament to the aspirations and ideas of his fellow workmen. That was about the year 1891. Then we saw him as he was in 1904, wearing-a frock coat and high hat, and viewing with an air of disdain the workers who had placed _ him in Parliament. He was represented as turning to the mail of 1891, and saying, "" Fancy meeting you."" member could sustain no greater shock than he would suffer by being confronted by his own image as first returned to Parliament by the workers of the coal pits of Lithgow. There are other honourable members who were first returned to Parliament by theirfellow workmen, but who have since thrown them overboard, because it suited their personal interests to do so. Mr J.

A great deal has been said as to a tax on incomes reaching a man with landed property. It certainly reaches the man with landed property, but only the landed property he is using. It does not touch the man who holds hundreds and thousands of acres of land which are lying idle, and from which he derives no income. The Colonial Treasurer the other night confessed that an income tax would be derived from these unremunerative lands. How he proposes to obtain it . I am at a loss to understand. That seems to me to be the veriest piece -of political jargon that I have ever heard coming from a person in the exalted position of Colonial Treasurer. The income tax will tax incomes 'from land, but only to the extent to which that land is used and put into occupation. That is not what we want. An honourable member a few minutes ago asked another honourable member if he wished to tax the thrif t of the country. It is not the thrif t of the country, but the legalized theft of the country that we want to tax-the men who have taken through the medium of land values something which they did nothing to create, who have taken from the people the result of their own flesh and blood, who have taken it by the machinery of the law, and appropriated it to their own personal use.

I heard him speaking today about going before his constituents and about majority to remind him that he only secured a sult of a split vote, and was really in a very great minoritv. a good deal about the question of a Dreadnought. I claim to be as loyal to the Empire as the shouting phalanx who desire posterity to pay for their present obligations. Some of the loyalists of Sydney, the so-called patriotic men, had the Governor General in Sydney a few weeks ago, and took him out to inspect the Zoo. They wanted a band to play before him, and called for tenders. Two bands-the Australian Professional Musicians and the German band-tendered . The former asked for ios. a day, and the Germans for 3s., and those patriots, who went to the Sydney TownH a l l and voiced their platitudes, posing before the country to get titles to their names, engaged the German band at 3s. a dav to play "" God save the K in g .

You can go round the warehouses in York-street, Clarence-street, and Kent-street, Sydney, and upon the shelves you will find, not British, but German goods. If they can save 5d., they will 'take German goods in preference to British, and then go down to the Town Hall and dictate to the working men as to how much they should pay out of their hard earnings to give a Dreadnought to England to defeat the German Navy.

326,Seat In The House As The Re,"Mr SPEAKER I must ask that whenMr J. H . CATTS -May I remind the honourable member for Robertson of a quotation about dumb-driven cattle? wants to explain himself, let him rise in this House and explain to rhe working men in his electorate, before whom he spouts. Labour platitudes, election after election, to lead them to believe that he is as good as a Labour man, why he sits on those benches beside the chairman of the Employers' .Federation and all the great Conservatives of Australia. I shall take the first opportunity of explaining to the working men in the centres of his electorate exactly what bis position is if he refuses to explain himself. I have no objection to the fusion that .has taken place. One of the reasons why I voted to eject the Deakin Government was to compel those parties to come together, because I knew there was not a shred of political principle existing between them tp keep them apart, and that their only difference was their desire to gain the Treasury tench. I wanted to compel them to come together, and tp stand in their true light before the country as the enemies of the masses of the men and women of Australia. member supported the imposition of a tax on the working men. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member is entirely wrong; but is supporting the Deak'inites now in the policv of protection, which he told his constituents he would entirely object to. I can stand up in this House, and before my constituents, and explain my position, but the honourable member dare not do it. Honourable members opposite have spoken about caucuses, and untruly about a majority even of one in the Labour caucus deciding what is to be done and all the rest following suit, yet we have seen in the press that honourable members on the other side have objected to the fusion of parties and to the make-believe principles of the proposed programme, but have been compelled by majorities in their own parties to swallow their consciences. Not only that, but at the dictation of one man they sit there as dumb as oysters, and refuse to explain their position to the constituencies which sent them to Parliament. I am glad of what has occurred. We have divided the sheep from heard those gentlemen time after time deploring the idea of any class question being raised in Australia. They have said; "" Do not introduce the question of capital against labour,"" but they If he themselves have now effectively raised the issue, and when we go to the country we shall have the great dividing line of the monopolists and capitalists and' exploiters who are against the interests of the masses of Australia on the one hand, and the Labour Party on the other. I for one would ask for no better issue. It has been very much to the detriment of this party in years gone by that there have been conflicting issues before the people to cloud the various policies put before them. The sooner there is a straight-out line of cleavage, the sooner we divide those who are for the interests of the masse.s from those who are for the interests of the people who already have more than enough, the sooner will this party return with an absolute majority to carry its platform into effect, and to sympatheticallv administer its policy in the interests of the people. If there is. one thing that honourable members on the other side are afraid of, it is that we will have an opportunity to take them before their constituents and see if they will be returned give me greater pleasure, because it would give me the opportunity also of going to the constituencies of some honourable members opposite. I am sure it is only necessary to place their position plainly before the people to bring about their wholesale dismissal. There were honourable members on that side who were not enthusiastic over the Dreadnought proposal, but the leading papers of Australia flogged them with leading articles : day after day, pointing out that they were misrepresenting the people, and one after another they capitulated. The Labour Prime Minister said. "" I do not care if all the daily papers of Australia say that I must do a certain thing; if I think it the wrong course, I shall resist them."" What is it that makes the party opposite the creature of the dailv press, and enables us to stand up with our backs stiff against it? Those honourable members have gained their positions by the aid of the press. They are the creatures of the press, and would not' have been here but for the press, whereas every seat occupied on this side of the House has been gained in the teeth of the press, in the face of most the goats. We have lying statements and of a whole artillerv of libels. When they came into my electorate and begged for an opportunity to report my meetings.

The words used the right honourable member for East SydwereSir, I have had to stand with a sword in my hand. I have had to be a fighting Premier. But I carry away from the conflict no bitterness of feeling. I have much to remember in kindness to the House. I have much to remember in lasting gratitude, and I hope that kindly 'feelwreckage of the individualist party; the wrecking will prevail towards myself when I may have to occupy another relation. I know that many faults can be laid to .the charge of my colleagues and myself, but I believe that never can it be said that we did other than, according to our lights, consult what we believed to be the public adyantage of Victoria. There are one or two other matters which I wish to refer to. We have been met with a most loyal, unswerving support from a large body of our supporters, and I should feel that I was an ingrate indeed if I did not to-night make them my warmest acknowledgment for that splendid support which they have shown us through good report and through evil report. If I have to discriminate in my praise at ail, I have to acknowledge here, to a party that is under the ban of public opprobrium in some quarters, that never did a Government or the leader of a Government get better or more consistent support than we got from those members who are called the Labour Party. As I have said to members privately, as I have said to the honourable member for Eastern Suburbs himself, in all my experience I never met one of those men pressing any improper demand, and the experience of myself is the experience of my colleagues. Never were they importunate. Never did they place themselves in the position of beggars for favours which it would be unfair to grant. I am sorry the honourable member for Ballarat is not here, because I should like to ask him if he cannot endorse that eulogium after his experience as Prime Minister with the assistance of the Labour Party. head. sorry, and his personality is so charming that I would be the last to point the finger of scorn at or say a word of him I would regret. I say that after twenty years' experience of him, sitting with him in the same House night after night, and day after day, and,' as one who has quarrelled with him perhaps more severely than any of his friends; and I desire to ask the honourable gentleman, through you, Mr Speaker, whether, . while he was leader of the Government with the Labour Party supporting him, he did not find us following that splendid rule laid down a demand which it would have been dishonourable for him to grant or dishonest for us to accept? On the 20th October, 1908, the honourable member for Ballarat, speak[6] ney, used the following wordsAt the present time the right honourable member has behind him only the wreckage of half-adozen old sections. He has behind him the wreckage of the free importing party; the age of the anti-Socialist Party', and the wreckage of the coloured labour party all are to be found on that side of the House. I can endorse that as ""being absolutely as correct now as when the words were used. The honourable member for Ballarat further saidI do not dispute what the right honourable member says, and am not concerned to dispute it . I have not made the statement in regard to himself or all his following. WhatI have said is-and it is true-that he has behind him the wreckage of the coloured labour party. He does not And it here. ber refer? fectly true. The Opposition side of the House is the refuge of the defeated. That is why, naturally, on the Opposition benches are clustered the wreckage of the parties that have failed in this House. As it was then, so it is to-night, and I iegret the position of the honourable member for Ballarat. If he desired to give a Roland for an Oliver, who can blame him? We know that he and his Ministers, especially the honourable member for Hume, after last session had well earned a recess; but if we, in the tactics of the moment, seized these benches, we only followed the example of the then Opposition leader, the right honourable member for East Sydney. Most of that honourable gentleman's time in office was, I believe, spent in recess ; and when to-morrow's papers blaze forth the news of the day. they can rightly say that this Labour Government spent its existence mostly in recess. That might seem to some people, and to some honourable members, a reason why we hear no speeches from the Opposition to-night.. When the honourable member for Ballarat took the verdict of the House, he left it free for the other side to speak and argue if they chose. The honourable member for Wentworth, who has shown himself so frightfully particular about a personal attack, got up to move a motion to stifle debate; but every member of the Labour Party would have torn his tongue out before doing so.

I asked him, then, whether he and his partners could, at that time, pay 20s. in the pound. The honourable senator at once withdrew the remark, ""but the slur on the farming community remained. I do not know what the farmers will think of his statement when it is quoted from Hansard, and spread over the length and breadth of the land. I have no desire to burden my speech with quotations, but I think it desirable to quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Richmond in this House in 1906. In the course of that speech, the Honourable member said that a question had been put to him by the honourable member for Kooyong, whose absence from the HouseI regret. I trust that he willspeedily recover from his illness. No one will be more pleased to welcome his return to the House than I shall be, differ though we may in our political opinions. When, as a young man, I was employed in a bank, he used to take my part against the stronger fellows in the office, and a kindly feeling has always existed between us. On the occasion in question, the honourable member for Richmond saidWhenI was a member of the alliance, two Conservative members of the present Opposition came to me-the honourable member for Kooyong and the"" honourable member for Grampians will know who they were-and said, "" Look at Mr Reid and Mr Cook. They are now aristocrats-the y are leading the Conservatened with admiration to the eloquence of tives. Cannot you rub the dandy brush over the honourable member for Parramatta and take a few of the labour burrs off him? Then the honourable member, with that sparkling wit of his, which few can equal, saidThe honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable memBer for Grampians will know who asked me if I could not put the curry-comb over The honourable member for Maribyrnong the honourable member for Parramatta, and make him look a bit conservative. I said that I would do my best if they would deal with the right honourable member for East Sydney. I do not know what happened to the present leader of the Opposition, but I saw the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Kooyong walking out on to the lawn taking with tiiem a hay rake and a harvester. I do not know what they wanted with those implements, but I saw them a little later on with a chaffcutter. I wish to show how consistent, how genuine, and how honourable is the deputy-leader of the Opposition in his political views, and I hope that we how trustworthy he is. I am not speaking personally. These political debates should have no individual aspect. I said that I would do my best with him, but did not take anything with me but a piece of chamois and a corn-cob. I found that he shed his coat very easily. This occurred upon a Sunday. I saw him upon the following morning. He was looking like a Vermont. ram-al l wrinkles. I took him down to the basement again, and took a skin off hima fiscal sinker's skin. On Tuesday morning I saw that he still presented a wrinkled appearance, so I set to work upon him, and took a free-trade skin off him. I could smell the opium on it. Upon Wednesday he was again wrinkled, and accordingly I set to work and got a labour skin off him. I knew that it was a labour skin, because he said he objected specially to it, and the honourable member asked me to take it away quickly. The honourable member for Parramatta interjected : "" My leader has never called me a rat "" ; but I am sure that the honourable member for Ballarat has never so described his former colleague and loyal supporter. The honourable member fbr Richmond repliedHonorable members opposite have charged me with every political offence, and now they cannot stand an honest, truthful statement. Upon Thursday the honourable member for Parramatta was still wrinkled, and I got a Protectionist skin off him. On Friday he shed a single tax skin, and on the Saturday, as he was still wrinkled, I took a Socialist's skin off him. AlthoughI tell this to honourable members in an allegorical way, my statement is theoretically true. I have known the honourable member as a fiscal sinker, as a free-trader, as a Labour member, as a protectionist, as a single taxer, and as a socialist, all within a few years. AfterI had finished with him on the Sunday morning, he looked about as amiable as a snake does in spring time. All this only proves the honourable member's powers of adaptability, and shows that he is able to feed out of any nose-bag. I recall the many times that I have listhe honourable member for Ballarat-elo quence that leaves no lips as it leaves his. I remember the occasion when the honourable member for Corangamite was half hesitating to cross the floor of the House, and the honourable member cried out: "" Stay where you are; I do not want you."" joined with me in cheering that remark. How does he feel in his present company? In the right honourable member for East Sydney we have perhaps the most cheery optimist in the House. I have never heard him as leader of the Opposition utter a really cruel or bitter word. That is more",64,Loyalty Of Australians
365,Sir William Lyne,,65,Loyalty Of Australians
366,Dr. Maloney,"It was Senator Bestthan I can say of the honourable member for Parramatta when he held a similar position. Do we not all remember how bitter he was, and how the present leader of the Opposition used to resent his storming and raving? The right honourable member for East Sydney used to say that the Protectionist Party consisted simply of ""66 Bourke-street."" words of Hans Breitmann I may well exclaim, "" Where is dot barty now ? "" The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who has worked hard and loyally for the cause of protection, would not say that any one of the four members of the Liberal Party now sitting in the Ministerial corner are less loyal to the principles of protection than he is because they choose to remain on this side of the House and refuse to join their late colleagues now on the Opposition benches. The honourable member has doubtless crossed the floor of the House in. loyalty to his leader. A warning has gone forth. The Age has spoken clearly and distinctly. The honourable member for Ballarat has never had a more loyal friend, or a stronger one, to help him than he had in the man who now lies silent in the grave-the man who has left behind him the Age as a monument of his ability and genius. I propose now to address myself briefly to the Dreadnought question. man nor a German, but I admire both the Germans and the French. The Socialist movement in Germany is becoming very strong, and no better organized or better controlled body of workers is to be found in the world than exists there to-day. If the Germans desire to build more war-ships, is it not impertinence on the part of any other nation to say that they shall not do so ? In passing, I should like to quote the opinion of the Americans with regard to the English people. Let me read a quotation from' Scrihner's Magazine, which is universally read, and is printed in England as well as the United States:Who are the English and what are the English? They.are Saxons, who love the land, who love their liberty, and whose sole claim to genius is their common sense. AmI not speaking fairly when I ask ""Are not the Saxons a German race pure and simple ? "" I believe the best strain in the Anglo-Celtic-Saxon race is the German blood that permeates it. Why did I raise my hat to the German flag in the New Hebrides, and also to the French flag? BecauseI was glad to recognise a European flag. With the exception of Europe, this Pf. Moloney. is the only continent that is dominated wholly and solely by white races. Two of the great continents of the world are dominated by the coloured race, and I believe that the race which controls Australia will ultimately control the world. I am therefore glad to see the flags of the various white nations. The bars and stars will In the stand as a sentinel against danger when the call comes from the East. Their quarantine laws save us from disease. Speaking of quarantine, I somewhat resent an action that has been taken in the recess, but, as that* has not been referred to on the other side, I shall not be the one to speak of the matter. With regard to Dreadnoughts, it seems to me, now that the genius of inventors is being turned to the problem ot the conquest of the air, it is absurd to place so much reliance upon battleships. It puts me in mind of the old knights, who went out laden with armour and a big spear, and mounted on a cart horse, to kill a few men. Everybody knows th,it if one of them fell off his horse, 'it took two or three men to put him on again. The genius of invention will, I think, make these iron-, clads in a little while as useless as the old men in armour. When the Stock Exchange in Collins-street was agitating for the presentation of a Dreadnought, it would have I am neither a. Frenchbeen well if the Prime Minister had said to them:, "" I do not care to spend £50,000 to take a referendum of the electors, but if you will subscribe 10 per cent, in Victoria, and 10 per cent, in New South Wales, I will take that as an indication that Australia wants to make the gift, and will pledge my honour as Prime Minister to bring in a referendum and a graduated land tax. Then, if Australia, which owes a great debt of gratitude to the Homeland wants to give twenty Dreadnoughts, I , as Treasurer, will know that the voice of Australia will have said so, and also that I can get the money from a land tax."" That would have settled the matter at once. Does any honourable member assert that to borrow £2,000,000 from England and give it to her again would pay the debt of fealty that we owe to her ? I , as the son of an old English mother, love the Homeland, although I have loathing and contempt for some of its infamous laws. In Great Britain no man can claim a vote on account of his manhood. He can only get it directly by ownership, or indirectly by rental. When every English man and English woman has a vote, there will be a grand sweeping out in that country, and the power latent in i the Homeland will spring to the greatness that we all hope to see, although it will never do so under a restricted franchise. I believe it was in 1883 that the British House of Commons, of 630 members, declared by a majority of 145 that it was not absurd that a quorum of the House should consist of three members. Fancy three members being entrusted with the destinies of the whole British Empire! Last session I asked questions of the then Treasurer with regard to the coinage of silver. I wanted at the time to devise a. plan whereby we could build the Federal Capital without borrowing, and without any expense. I saw that it could be done through the coinage of silver, although the price of silver has now risen a good deal above what it was then. I asked the following questions on the 3rd December, 1908, as reported in Hansard, page 26291. What the profit would be on the minting of ;£i,ooo,ooo of Australian silver at the price quoted in the Age of 2nd December, viz., is. 10 5-i6d. per standard ounce? 2. What would be the cost of minting same at the usual rate of 3 per cent. ? 3. What would be the net profit on such purchase after deducting such stated cost or any other contingent expense? These were the answers1. The gross profit on coining .£1,000,000 of silver bullion would be £1,957,983. We could build a very fine Federal Capital for half, that sum as a start 2£88,7393£ >354,555> ade up as follows:I m Gross profit, £1,957,983. Deduct estimated charges (assuming that the coins would be made by the Royal Mint in London)-Coinag e (3 per cent, on face value of £2,957,983), £88,739; freight and other expenses (1.4 per cent, on face value), £41,412; rehabilitation in celebrated for its fineness in export, was a-real perpetuity (16 per cent, on face value), £473, 77-£6o3,428; nett profit a (being 45.79 per cent, on face value), £^354.555The first answers which I got from the then Treasurer were quite erroneous, but, ultimately, after insisting upon a proper answer, I got the above figures. That brings me to the -question of a Commonwealth note issue, and of banking. Many cheap sneers were cast at the proposals of the honourable member for South Svdnev in that direction when he was Prime Minister, and I have no doubt that the same jeers and sneers will be uttered to-day. I remember how the same thing happened in the Victorian Parliament, before the bursting of the boom, when I suggested that no public company should be allowed to pay more than 10 per cent, in dividends, but that all over that should.be put to a reserve fund, and half handed over to the State. If honourable members had only heard the laughs and jeers that came from the fat men at that time, they would have pitied me. But after the boom burst, every one of them, from Mr G. D. Carter downwards, told me that they wished that my proposal had been made law, as it would have helped' to avert the crash. I did not know at the time that the railway companies in England .were compelled by law to reduce freights and fares if they paid more than 5 per cent, in dividends. As an instance of how a bank may run for centuries, I wish to quote from The New Encyclopaedia of Social Reform, volume 1, page 89, the following information regarding the Bank of Venice, which started in 1171, lasted, for 626 years, asnd was only brought to an end when the victorious armies of Napoleon swept over SwitzerlandStephen Colwell's digest of fourteen authorities leads to the following deductions, as will be seen by perusal of his able work : It proves that there was a national bank of Venice founded on a loan of 2,000,000 ducats spent by the State in 1171, and the bank existed within the memory of living men, a period of 626 3'ears, during whicli time it was gradually enlarged over 700 per cent. That, in 1423, the 4 per cent, interest previously paid was abolished. That all promise of reimbursement, other than transfer of credit receipts, was abolished. That no coin was kept as a specie basis of credit, or for strengthening the nation. That no promise to pay any coin was made after 1423, for nearly 400 years of its continuance. That the premium fixed by law of 20 per cent, premium over the Venetian gold ducat, so superiority of legal money of account over the commodity gold, and over gold currency. That it was not dependent on any promise of convertibility or redemption in gold, as no claim for any gold was acknowledged in the National Bank. That it continued for nearly 400 years with all these extraordinary attributes, producing no financial derangements and no oppostiion; but, on the contrary, grew until it exceeded the money fer cafita of any nation in Europe, ancient and modern, and was the pride of Venice, the envy of Europe. That it only fell when Napoleon conquered Venice, when it had reached an issue exceeding $16,000,000 of Government credit or money for 200,000 people, excluding the dependencies of Venice. Will any honourable member deny that we would be much stronger with a Commonwealth note issue, guaranteed by the Commonwealth, and backed up by every hill and vale of Australia, and with a further guarantee that every penny of profit would be spent in improving the Federal Capital, or building a transcontinental railway? I will strongly support the proposed Commonwealth note issue, although, as an old bank clerk, I do not wish to reflect on the present banking system of Melbourne. Some of the bank managers were chaffing me recently about our terrible Labour Party. They said they would like to bring in laws to amend the party, and I replied that I would not object if I were allowed to introduce some of the Chinese banking laws, one of which was that, when a bank failed, the manager and directors should be decapitated. One result of that provision is that the banks in China do not fail. It is my privilege sometimes to be reported by the press. I spoke last Tuesday night for about half a hour, and on Wednesday morning the only report that was published appeared in the Age, to the effect that I advised the people, if they wished to judge the honourable member for Flinders properly, to read the Age for the last month. NeedI say any more about the honourable member ? May I congratulate the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke upon their new colleague? If they bring him to a. knowledge of the error of his ways, and make him a good protectionist, they will do well. If they make the honourable member for Parramatta a real protectionist, never to break away again, they will do well. If they can remove from the splendidly-endowed brain of the right honourable member for East Sydney his ideas in regard to free-trade, they will do well. But I do not think that, in their heart of hearts, they believe any of these things to be possible. Jeremy Bentham, standing before the Stock Exchange in London, and reading the Biblical words which are carved thereon in stone, "" The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof,"" said, ""That is a lie; it belongs to the landlords, and they are not making proper use of it."" infamous land laws of England, grafted upon Australian conditions, have caused injustice here. I do not deny that there are good land-owners, who declare that, when land is scarce, private estates should be resumed, and who only claim what I am sure this Parliament would always grant, that fair prices should be paid-for property that is resumed. Direct taxation is'coming in England, and we shall soon have to follow the British example. It is only by taxing Dr. unimproved land values that the Federal Government can raise sufficient revenue to carry out its functions, and free itself from the chains forged by what are termed State rights. Those who support State rights must remember that the people who create this Parliament have not the same franchise in regard to the State Houses. We must have a proper land tax, and I am certain that this Parliament will, in its wisdom, ultimately impose such a tax. But do the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke think that they will ever persuade a majority of their side to support such a proposal ? The honourable member for Ballarat, however, may take heart of grace, because if he brings forward such a tax, those on this side will loyally follow him. They do not mind who leads, when an opportunity is given to make one of the planks of their platform operative. On one occasion I asked Sir George"" Turner's whip, a namesake, if he could name an instance when he had found it necessary to question, me as to how I would vote. No whip ever had need to ask me such a question, because I voted always for the planks of the platform. Similarly, other members of the party will vote to"" make those planks effective, whether the opportunity is given by a direct proposal, or by means of an amendment or clause. When we come to have a land tax, I hope that it will be cumulative, so as to cause our lands to be available to the native-born, and thus carry out the desire of the honourable member for Ballarat to throw open our country to all white persons, but preferably to those of the British race, with precedence to Australians. A land tax would open up our lands, and prevent persons from leaving Victoria, which, to the unutterable disgrace of the present State Government, is, as has been shown by the Age, losing population daily. When, as in South Australia, there are over 1,000 applicants for 137 allotments, and hundreds of The applications for selections all over Victoria, it is made plain to us that we should follow, the example of the old Romans and other nations of antiquity, who, although when they conquered a country they might remove its inhabitants to other places, eventually settled them on the land, to lay the foundations of future greatness. I hope to see a land tax imposed which will make Australia an example to other countries, and will so strengthen us that in time of trouble we shall be able to face any enemy.
