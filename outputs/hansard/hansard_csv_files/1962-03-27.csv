14,Mr Kearney,"My question isvessels now regularly engaged in handling Australia's imports and exports? tions asked by the honourable member involve matters of policy. I think I could say briefly that the building of this tanker at Whyalla was a major contribution to the Australian shipbuilding industry by a company which probably could have had the ship built at a lower cost outside Australia. The construction of the vessel was certainly an advantage to Whyalla. As to the crew which will man the vessel, I remind the honourable member that this vessel will not be trading around the Australian coast. As for the honourable member's question about the construction of tankers in Australia, 1 ask that it be placed on the notice-paper. Defence say what stage has been reached in negotiations between the Government of the United States of America and the Australian Government on the establishment of a radio station on the north-west coast of Western Australia? House on two or three occasions, the United States Government approached us and asked whether it would be permitted to investigate prospective sites in the north-west of Western Australia to determine whether it would be possible or technically desirable to establish a radio station in that territory as a result of their efforts. In this area. The United States' technicians have examined several possible sites. At the present time, representatives of the United States Government and officials of the Department of Defence and of the Department of External Affairs are discussing the question, to decide how far the Australian Government can go to meet the wishes of the United States Government. I do not expect these discussions to be concluded in the next few days. I should like to say, however, that I am grateful to the Government and the Premier of Western Austraha for the co-operation they have afforded us and the United States technicians. If this major work is undertaken in Western Australia it will be largely due to their efforts. the Treasurer by directing attention to the extraordinary increase in foreign portfolio investment in Australia in the last ten years -fro m £1,500,000 in 1951 to £47,000,000 in 1961. Is it a fact that this kind of foreign investment consists in the purchasing of shares and the taking over of Australian companies? Also, is it a fact that it does not bring any new industry or new technical know-how to Australia? Will the Treasurer review the tax concessions in the double taxation agreements that the American and British investors have in respect of this kind of investment? with the last part of the question first. The Government, rather than being disposed to restrict the operation of these double taxation agreements, is examining the desirability of widening the field of operation of agreements of this sort. There is no doubt in the minds of the members of this Government and, I think, of most people in Australia who have studied this subject, that we as a nation have greatly benefited by the investment here of the savings of other people overseas. I have had occasion in the past to point to the division of view which appears to exist in the Labour movement. On the one hand, State Labour administrations are actively canvassing for overseas investment and take great pride in pointing to some new industry which has been established in their place, on the other hand, we have witnessed a studied campaign of attack on overseas investment in Australia. It is a matter of some irony that when one looks outside this country one sees other countries, which are seeking anxiously to develop their resources, offering a great variety of inducements to overseas investors and sometimes setting up factories for them and offering them taxation holidays of from five to ten years and so on, while we in Australia, working on much less attractive lines in the sense of active inducement, have, by the very nature of the opportunities in Australia and the political stability and scope for expansion here, succeeded in these post-war years in strengthening ourselves with the know-how",6,Shipbuilding

If so, what is behind the United Kingdom's sudden reduction of imports of Australian butter? been made on this subject by the Acting Minister for Trade and also by thc Minister for Primary Industry setting out the quotas that have been established by the United Kingdom for butter from various countries exporting to the ""United Kingdom market. It is a fact that there has been a reduction in the quota allocated to Australia as well as in the quotas of other countries for this year. However, the imposition of a quota in the previous six months resulted in Australian butter bringing a very much higher price on the United Kingdom market. We expect that, despite the proposed decrease in the quota allocated to Australia, the price will be maintained at a higher level they would constitute a very serious charge on the United Kingdom market, and that we shall have access to other markets, principally in South-East Asia, for the disposal of surplus production. addressed to the Minister for Defence.

Whether, if the Navy does recommend submarines, they will fit in to the overall priorities for the three Services, again I cannot say. I would say, however, that Australia will have to be pretty careful before it goes into the submarine arm again and will have to take every precaution and examine the position very thoroughly, because three times this country has become involved in submarines and three times it has been pleased to get out of this arm of the Navy.

Indeed, in the judgment of the International Monetary Fund, it was regarded as a model example of the way in which the resources of the fund should be employed. At a time when there was a sharp run down of Australia's overseas reserves, we took action to strengthen our position by drawing on our second line of reserves with the International Monetary Fund by borrowing £78,000,000, and entering into a stand-by arrangement covering an amount of £45,000,000. With the quick improvement in the position as a result of the economic measures adopted by tbe Government, and for other reasons, we were able to cancel the stand-by arrangement quite quickly. So considerable has been the improvement in our overseas reserves that we were able to make a speedy repayment of the borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. It did carry a small rate of interest which varies according to the length of holding of the borrowing; but while the money was in our possession, it was suitably invested. Although that was not the object of the exercise, we showed a tidy profit as between what we had to pay out by way of interest and what we secured from our investment of this amount. in the United Kingdom and strengthened the position of that country for that period. But the purpose of the borrowing is not a normal long-term loan operation, of course, nor, indeed, would the fund approve of borrowings on such a basis; so there is no comparison between the transaction witb the International Monetary Fund and the transaction with the International Bank. If the honourable gentleman wants a comparison, he can find it in the action of the United Kingdom Government, which also made a very substantial borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and has been steadily repaying the amounts so borrowed. The practice adopted by it and by us is in line with the policies which the fund itself, and those of us who are governors of the fund, recommend to borrowers from it. on Thursday, 15th March, and subsequent dates contained statements alleging that some Post Office employees were aiding starting price bookmakers and racing tipsters, and were not collaborating with the police in controlling these illegal operators. It is important that these allegations be kept in proper perspective and that the House should be aware of what the Post Office does to aid gaming police and of the very important limitations on what the Post Office can do. First, let me make it clear that it could not be expected that every one of the Postal Department's 87,000 officers and employees has a completely blameless record, lt is unfortunately true that there will always be, in such a large group, a few individuals who will succumb to temptation from those engaged in illegal practices. I do believe, however, that those Post Office employees who do assist starting price bookmakers and racing operators in any way are exceptions to the very high standard of honesty and loyalty which activates Post Office people. After the extravagant wording of the early press reports, later statements did begin to place this problem in proper perspective. For example, Chief Commissioner Porter of the Victoria Police is reported to have stated thatThe Victorian Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Smith, has been very helpful to the Victoria Police in the past. Mr Smith has gone out of his way to help my department with its problems. Inspector Hill, whose premature statements to the press initiated the recent publicity, admitted at the outset that he wasreceiving the co-operation of the Postal Department's investigators and some of the department's technicians. and was later reported as saying thatonly a few employees are doing the wrong thing, and that the management of the department is very helpful to us. As I will show later, Inspector Hill's assessment thatonly a few employees are doing the wrong thing, is based in some instances at least on a suspicion of complicity of Post Office people where this, in fact, does not exist.

62,Mr Davidson (Dawson,"Postmasteris, therefore, much smaller than the first headlines made it appear. It is important that there be. the utmost co-operation between Commonwealth and State authorities in. the control of illegal activities. While control of illegal betting is primarily a matter for State poiice, both sides of this House have been concerned to limit the extent to which Commonwealth communication facilities are used to circumvent State laws and to ensure that the Post Ofiice, without violating public confidence, provides State police with certain information when requested to do so. The policy followed has been laid down by the Commonwealth Government and, on 30th January, 1943, the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Curtin, advised all State Premiers of the instructions he had issued to the Post Office specifying the co-operation which should be extended to State police authorities to assist them in dealing with illegal betting. As a result of a review by the Chifley Cabinet, in December, 1946, it was decided that the procedures laid down to assist State police authorities should be continued. Opposition might be interested to know that those procedures are still being continued. In the terms of the Government direction, the following practices are observed strictly on the understanding that the information supplied will be regarded as confidential and used solely for the purpose of detecting illegal practices. This information is supplied only to senior police officials who have been authorized by the Commissioner of Police for such purpose. (1) Details of telephone services, including silent lines, are made available vices in unusual locations without the on request. These details consist of the names and addresses of holders of telephone services, the numbers of which have beenlisted by the police or the names and telephone numbers at addresses supplied by the police. (2) Where the police have secured a conviction and request that the telephone services at the address concerned be disconnected, this is done under regulation 62. A person whose service has been so disconnected shall not become a subscriber again within six months. Under this provision, 622 telephone services have been disconnected in the last three years. (3) Similar information is furnished to the police authorities in respect of private box services, or the box number of a specified person is given. (4) A private box service is cancelled where the Commissioner of Police certifies that the box is used in connection with illegal tipping, race cards or betting practices. In addition to this direct co-operation with police authorities, the departmental instructions in recent years have been designed to minimize the possibility of telephone services being used for illegal purposes and provide for special scrutiny of all applications for initial services of more than one exchange line or for additional lines on existing services. These can only be approved by the Superintendent, Commercial Branch. Where inspection of a telephone service by police or departmental employees shows evidence of unauthorized alterations or additions to the equipment, the services have-been disconnected forthwith and consideration given to prosecution where such a course was justified. Officers engaged on installation work must report any case where facilities are already installed and the telephone order they are handling does not have the endorsement of the Superintendent, Commercial Branch. Likewise they are forbidden to install telephone serauthority of the divisional engineers. All requests for silent lines must be closely scrutinized by the Superintendent, Commercial Branch, and where any doubt exists as' to the bona fides of an applicant a statutory declaration must be obtained. I turn now to liaison procedures. On Monday, 4th April, 1960, in company with the then Director-General, I met a deputation in Melbourne consisting of Mr Eugene Gorman, QC, representing the Victorian Racing Club, Inspector Webb, then Chief",13,Postal Department
63,Mr Calwell,"Hear, hear!",14,Postal Department
64,Mr Davidson,"The Leader of theof the Gaming Squad, and Senior Constable Sylvester of the Victoria Police. The deputation asked me to consider the possibility of extending the scope of assistance rendered by the Victorian administration of the Post Office to the Gaming Squad. At the conclusion of the discussions I asked that the request be submitted in writing over the signature of the Chief Commissioner of Police. This action was endorsed by Mr Gorman. My views were conveyed to the Chief Commissioner of Police and a submission sought. This was received, and the successful outcome of negotiations was acknowledged by the Chfef Commissioner who indicated that the nature of the co-operation set out by the Post Office was most satisfactory. Whilst the general conditions which 1 have just outlined to the House were not changed it was agreed, in order that information could be obtained more quickly by the police authorities, to nominate up to four senior police officers in each State from whom requests for information would be accepted by the department. Since then the Police Commissioner in each State has nominated authorized senior police officers for this purpose. In July and December, 1960, the instructions to the directors in all States were consolidated to include tbe new arrangements so that a uniform procedure would apply in this important field of co-operation. It will be apparent that the Post Office extends to State police a very considerable degree of co-operation, consistent with its responsibility to maintain a communication service in which the public can have complete confidence. It has always been Post Office policy to co-operate fully with police in the maintenance of the law whilst maintaining its obligation to treat as confidentialjits transactions witb its customers, some-, that the matter has been made public before I have thing of, extreme value .in the life of..any democratic community. I shall now deal with investigations in Victoria. The inquiries currently being conducted in Victoria relate to the suppression of dockets for trunk-line calls made by one Melbourne telephone subscriber. In September, 1961I direct the attention of honourable members to the dateI was informed by the Director-General that checks made in Melbourne had disclosed that some dockets for trunk-line calls were not being brought to account. Inquiries had been commenced immediately by the department's investigation staff. For obvious reasons proceedings were known to only a few senior officers, and have been kept extremely confidential. As it appeared that a person not employed in the department may have been involved, the police were invited to take part in the inquiry and Inspector Hill and his officers worked for some time in collaboration with departmental officers. As a result of the work done by the Postal investigation team, a departmental officer was suspended, tried on 2nd March by the court and convicted of being in possession unlawfully of trunk-line dockets. His dismissal has been recommended to the Public Service Board. It was necessary to wait until time for lodging an appeal had lapsed before an official copy of the court order could be secured to accompany this recommendation. Two other officers have been charged with negligence, improper conduct and breach of regulations. Consideration is being given to the possibility of laying charges against one further officer; and £1,500 in trunk-line fees has been recovered from the subscriber concerned. No action has been taken either by the Post Office or by any one else against any person outside the department. The Hill report is the next matter I shall deal with. At the time the press made certain statements attributed to Inspector Hill, the Post Office was completely unaware of his report. Apparently the Chief Inspector of Police in Victoria was also at some disadvantage as he was reported as sayingI have not yet had an opportunity to study Inspector Hill's report fully. I am disappointed had an opportunity to discuss the situation with the Victorian Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Smith Mr Smith subsequently received a copy of Inspector Hill's report from the Chief Secretary's Department; the report has been examined and preliminary comment given in reply. It is expected that there will be discussion at senior departmental level on certain points, and normally I would be reluctant to comment until these discussions had taken place. However, as certain allegations have been made against Post Office people I feel that in all fairness to this House and to the staff of my department I should clear up some obvious misunderstanding of normal departmental services and' procedures. First, we have the charge that telephones suddenly go out of order during a raid on suspected S.P. premises and are in order again later. The conclusion has been drawn that Telephone Branch employees have acted in concert with the suspects. Any one familiar with the automatic telephone system knows that the simplest way for a telephone service to be made inoperative for a limited period is for a connection to be established between two services, and for the receiver of one of these to be left off the switch-hook. Service is restored immediately the handset is replaced. The Post Office investigators who checked all services concerned in S.P. raids at Colac, which were reported in the press, were convinced that this was the method adopted to achieve the result of which the police complained. There was no evidence of collusion between Post Office employees and suspected S.P. operators. Another charge is that a country punter calling one number is connected to another number without his knowledge. It has been claimed that this is done to transfer business from one bookmaker to another or to enable bookmakers to receive calls at different premises to avoid detection. The truth is that, as a standard service, any subscriber to a manual exchange may arrange for incoming calls to be temporarily diverted to another number. Doctors, for example, make wide use of this service to divert incoming calls to another doctor or to a hospital while their surgeries would be unattended. It is quite likely that S.P. bookmakers make use of this service to permit them to operate from various points. The conclusion that calls to S.P. bookmakers are wrongly diverted by telephonists, however, is quite erroneous and not a logical deduction from evidence. The essential privacy of the telephone, of course, makes it impossible for the telephonist to provide this service on a discriminatory basis. The charge is also made that telegrams apparently are not paid for. It has been stated that stacks of telegrams lodged at Elizabeth-street Post Office, in Melbourne, on a Friday, are not paid for at the time of lodgement and are given special treatment. This is only partially true. The telegrams are to interstate destinations, and conform to departmental regulations. If the Police Commissioner believes them to be illegal he may arrange for them to be produced for perusal in accordance with Telegraph Regulation 70. The procedure followed is standard. About 25 per cent, of the despatch is paid for on lodgement; the remainder are sent under the "" collect"" system, a system well known to salesmen and commercial travellers which enables the cost of the telegram to be paid for by the addressee on delivery. With bulk lodgments of ""collect"" telegrams, a deposit is obtained to cover any refusals by addressees. To avoid inconvenience to members of the public and congestion of pneumatic tubes, large bulk "" collect"" telegram lodgments at the Elizabeth-street Post Office are taken by hand to the telegraph operating room for pricing and transmission. There is no secrecy about this procedure and it does not justify any suspicion of irregularity on the part of counter officers concerned. A further charge is made that mail is redirected. Police have obtained indications that mail addressed to a private box or street address is being diverted to other addresses within the Post Office. As all honourable members are aware, any person may fill in a form requesting the Post Office which normally delivers his mail to redirect that mail to another address. A redirection order is usually current for six months only. In a case recently quoted by Inspector Hill, a check revealed that the Post Office held current redirection orders and was quite properly redirecting mail in accordance with standard procedure. There was no evidence of improper collusion with addressees. I understand from reports in the press that the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria has appointed a special police board of inquiry headed by Inspector Hill-the person making the charges, mark you-and two former 'members of the gaming ""squad. This has been done without any reference to myself, and whilst the Government has every desire to have this matter investigated completely, the Government does not propose to submit any of its officers to examination by a State departmental committee. If any inquiry should be deemed necessary, which on present information I doubt, a competent independent authority would be appointed by this Government. I regret that the circumstances and the publicity recently given to alleged lack of co-operation between some post office ofncials and State police has required a rather long explanation. I feel, however, that this House would expect to be fully informed. It will be apparent from my statement that the police, working through agreed channels, can readily secure a great deal of assistance from my department. I am at all times willing to consider requests for further assistance which do not transgress the fundamental principle of privacy of communications sent through departmental services. For its part the department, in giving the police all possible assistance, will deal promptly and severely with any of its own employees found guilty of aiding and abetting illegal practices. It would be quite wrong and unfair, however, to conclude that the ability of certain people to take advantage of communication services to aid their activities is due to collusion by employees of my department.

Leave granted.' will recall that, in announcing new measures for giving temporary protection, the Minister for Trade said also that pending the necessary legislative changes, he would, if sufficient urgency existed, call on the Special Advisory Authority, Sir Frank Meere, to examine cases in which it appeared that protection by means of import restriction might be called for. In subsequently referred to the authority the question whether the local industry manufacturing engine bearings and bushings for use as original equipment and replacement equipment in motor vehicles is being so damaged by imports as to require urgent protection by means of import restrictions. The Special Advisory Authority now has reported that he is of the opinion that urgent action is necessary to protect the manufacture of bearings and bushings used for original equipment, but not those used for replacement equipment. He has indicated that the necessary protection could be given by import restrictions, but at the same time has pointed out that in his opinion, the circumstances are such that an equivalent result could be obtained more simply by an adjustment of the tariff, which already lies within the power of the Minister for Customs and Excise, that is to say the removal of these goods from concessional by-law. After a further examination of the matter, it now has been decided to remove the goods from concessional by-law with effect as from to-morrow.

The housing problem is an old one.

Over rapid increase in population owing to natural increase and immigration. In consequence, this old problem of housing remains with us. Australians have a most unfortunate habit.

There are many who, by a combination of hard work and good luck-in this country, both are neededare able to provide for themselves houses which are of very high quality indeed.

About three-quarters of the will have some effect but it is very doubtful people of this country who want houses whether it will have sufficient effect. Ten find themselves in a position in which they are obliged to seek some source from which they can borrow money with which to many more houses than it will build to-day, build or buy a home.

In the last ten years, there have been and pounds to those who do not. three depressions in the building industry. They have been most serious depressions for those who have been actively engaged in whether there really is a housing agreement. providing homes for the Australian people When the State Premiers meet the Treasurer and those who want homes. I think it is ( Mr Harold Holt) in conference and discuss only fair to say, in defence of those people their needs, which include funds for housing, engaged in home construction who made they invariably leave the conference room such a major contribution to national welexpressing dissatisfaction with what they fare, that they are at least entitled to know have received. I should imagine that that is that, for a long time ahead, there will quite a normal thing for any State Premier be no interference with their building proto do. IfI were a State Premier no doubt gramme. Yet, in the last ten years, there I would always express dissatisfaction with have been three artificially produced depresthe treatment I had received from the Comsions in the building industry. The most recent credit squeeze has dealt whether they be of Labour or Liberal peryet one more deadly blow at the building suasion. Therefore, we must question industry in Australia* particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, where there has been the greatest increase in population owing to natural increase and also to migration. I think it is only fair to those two States to direct attention to the great increase in their populations as a result of the immigration programmea programme which is so desirable and so necessary. I and New South Wales with the situation in Western Australia, where, on a proporThis bill sets forth to palliate the crime Some years ago £7,500,000 would have built reference because the Government's proposal gives pence to those who need help At this stage let me raise the question monwealth. But it is worthy of notice that dissatisfaction is expressed by all Premiers, whether there is really a housing agreement which is satisfactory to the States. I strongly doubt that there is. I should like to refer to the New South Wales Housing Commission. This body builds homes by private contract. The thought seems to exist in many quarters that the Housing Commission is a socialistic kind of institution which, by using only day labour, produces houses at a cost far in excess of what it should be. A critical, careif you go scrounging about the world ful and fair examination by any impartial observer will reveal that the Housing Commission lets its contracts only after a very careful examination of all tenders received. It sifts them and then arrives at what it believes to be the correct decision. It is anything but a socialistic institution. All State housing commissions have been criticized because they have built large numbers of bouses for renting. But not every one wants to buy a home simply for the sake of owning one. Scores of thousands of people in the community need only temporary residences throughout the Commonwealth according to the demands of their occupations. The housing commissions seem to be the only organizations remaining in this land which build houses solely for renting. They deserve commendation. The New South Wales Housing Commission is a fair landlord. I know that there are still many very fair private landlords, but there are also many unfair landlords and building speculators. If the housing commissions received a larger share of the money now made available, those who need homes so desperately would be more likely to receive a fair go because they would be more certain of better treatment from these public authorities than they can expect from private investors or speculators. There is no exploitation by the housing commissions. This House should be well and truly informed of one very important fact relating to the New South Wales Housing Commission. Every nail, every screw, every piece of timber, every brick, every tile and every p.c. item that goes into a New South Wales Housing Commission home has been made in Australia. That is one of the requirements prescribed by the New South Wales Government. The New South Wales Housing Commission is a most patriotic institution. New South Wales is governed by Labour, and I am proud to reflect that the commission declares openly for goods made in Australia. I wonder how many Commonwealth instrumentalities which could prescribe similarly have failed to do so! I know that many articles are bought overseas by Commonwealth instrumentalities which could well have been purchased in Australia. There seems to be the delusion that looking for the cheapest goods you will find a product that is satisfactory and the saving will be of benefit to Australians. That is not true. It will be found that items purchased from countries where the cost of manufacture is very low, and consequently where the sale price is low, act to the detriment of Australian goods, Australian businesses and Australian workmen. The price we pay in unemployment is far higher than any value we might receive from purchasing the cheaper goods overseas. Let me now discuss the allocation of 30 per cent, of housing funds to building societies. The result of the Government's decision in this regard could have been foreseen very easily. In fact, at the time when it was announced, we on this side of the House predicted what would happen. There was an immediate diminution of funds available to building societies from other sources, including the Commonwealth Bank itself. This was a perfectly natural development. Peter has been robbed to pay Paul. The funds which previously had been made available to building societies by life assurance companies and by the private banks were reduced considerably. Those institutions immediately grasped the fact that the building societies were receiving a definite allocation so they believed there was no need for them to pour into the building societies as mucn as had been poured into them in the past. As a result of this allocation of funds to building societies the poorer sections of the communityI have in mind the pensioners and the scores of thousands of people who, through no fault of their own, cannot find the high deposit demanded to buy or build a home-ar e penalized because the building of homes for rental by the housing commissions is correspondingly restricted. Let me digress a little at this stage. Two weeks ago we were discussing the War Service Homes Bill which provided for an increase of £750 in the maximum war service homes loan, taking the loan to £3,500. The war has been over now for more than sixteen years. In that period many young men who have had no chance to serve in this country's armed forces in war-time have grown up, married and had families. They are thus debarred from the right to receive a loan of £3,500 to build themselves a home. This anomaly will become increasingly apparent with the passing of every year. So we are coming to the point where the Commonwealth will have to start saying that every citizen of marriageable age who desires to buy or build a home shall have equal rights with every other citizen. In its financial columns the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" last week directed attention to the ready availability of credit. However, the article pointed out that there is a grave reluctance on the part of those who would normally be expected to seek credit to take advantage of the offers now available to them. I think the answer to this apparent paradox is to be found in an absence of confidence. I wonder how many builders and businessmen had their fingers burned as a result of the several credit squeezes imposed by the Government during the last ten years. Can it be a cause of surprise that to-day these gentlemen have not the confidence to go to a lending institution for credit to finance the expansion of their businesses even if those businesses involve the building of houses, which probably represent the best kind of security to be found in this or any other country? In fact, were I a builder I would be most cautious about accepting the credit facilities offered because, considering the three credit squeezes which have been applied over the last ten years, nobody can predict whether or when there will be another change in policy which will result in drying up the credit facilities now available. It seems to me that there are too many generals in the Liberal Party who are everlastingly blowing the bugle for retreat. Their logistics make provision for this instrument in their army bands, and far too frequently do we hear the bugle call for retreat. As soon as this country looks like making some rapid progress in the direction of satisfying the wants of its people there is an outcry from honourable gentlemen opposite that the economy is expanding too rapidly and things must be slowed down. I could understand this if we were galloping to inflation. Nobody can deny that there has been some inflation, but we could solve the problem by having more planning. If builders and motor car manufacturers, for instance, were told that for the next six or twelve months they should plan for a gradual but steady reduction of output so that provision could be made to prevent the occurrence of inflation, controls could be applied in a more orderly fashion. Last week, we learned from an honourable member on the Government side that there is no shortage of houses. He alleged that there was only a shortage of money. That reminds me that a former member of the Upper House in New South Wales also said at a conference about seven years ago that there was no shortage of houses. He said there was a shortage of deposits. It seems to me that, as Australia has the workmen, the factories, the industries and the know-how, there is no excuse for a shortage of houses. If the problem is only a shortage of money, surely that is a matter for the gentlemen who control Australia's finances. I refer in particular to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and to the Treasurer. It should lie within the power of those two gentlemen and this Parliament to see that the housing problem is solved quickly and solved for ever. Twelve weary years have passed since this Government took office as a result of the promises it made to the electors in 1949, and now it either cannot or will not make credit available so that people may buy homes. Last week, an honourable member on the Government side damned his own government, by implication, by saying that the Government was aware of what it was doing when it restricted finance for home building. The Government is apparently afraid of a depression if the number of houses built ever catches up with the requirements of the people, and so the building industry either slows down or comes to a standstill. I do not think it necessarily follows that the supplying by the building industry of enough houses would produce a depression. Surely, among the many thousands of home owners in this country, there would be many living in old homes which they would desire to alter. I can readily imagine that from that source alone there would at all times be sufficient demand to keep the building industry working at a consistently high level. long run, is a home and security, especially in 1 often regret that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is not supplied with more money to enable it to make an effecive contribution to tbe art of home building. The art of building to-day is much the same as it was several thousands of years ago. Long ago home builders built in timber, using nails, or theyfittedtimber together, or built stone by stone or brick by brick just the same as they do now. There has not been a great deal of change in materials or methods, and I often wonder whether the CSIRO., if it were asked to tackle the problem, could devise some means whereby houses could be mass produced in much the same way as motor cars. NowI wish to say something about the various birthrights of the Australian people. I think Australians are not very difficult to satisfy. They have certain simple fundamental requirements. I think that they want from their governments, first, equality of opportunity. They want to feel that no matter where they may be in Australia will bave the same chance as those more favourably situated geographically. Secondly, they would like, and expect to have, the right to receive a decent educalike to see aD families and not just 75 per tion, no matter where they may be living in Australia. Thirdly, every Australian wants a fair and reasonable job at a fair and reasonable wage. That is not too much to expect. Fourthly, Australians believe that they have, as a birth right, the right to buy or rent a home. Fifthly, they want security, especially in old age. I know that the Government has made some attempts, through the Aged Persons Homes Act, to provide homes for the elderly, but some homes are still provided only for those who have a quite considerable sum of money. The building of a home under the Age Persons Homes Act would still cost a pensioner £500 or £600, and it would be a small home unit at that figure. I believe that the instrumentalities which could do much to provide homes for the elderly are local councils. If they had had access to money provided under the act one of our housing problems would have been solved at least a year ago; but they are denied access to funds under that act. I repeat that what Australians want, in the tbeir old age. If this bill goes some distance towards satisfying that need it deserves the commendation of this House. We feel, however, that the amount of money allocated by the Commonwealth for this purpose is, as usual, and as we have come to expect, inadequate and that it will not accomplish the purpose for wbich this measure has been brought down. We deplore that fact. Had we become the Government of this country we would now be building the homes needed by the Australian people. I have enough confidence in Australia and in Australians to believe that the Government should allocate much morefinancefor this purpose in order to produce the effect which would have flowed from the efforts of this side of the House had we become the Government. The honourable member for St. George( Mr Clay) always brings forward reasonable arguments from his party's point of view. We, on the Government side of the House, contrary to his opinion, also consider that all the people should live in homes. Indeed, we go further and say that all families should live in homes which they own. We would cent, of the families in Australia owning or purchasing their homes. We believe that families who own their homes have a stake in the country and that, in the words of Mr Dedman, who was a member of the Opposition some years ago, they are little capitalists. We believe that little capitalists of the type who own their houses are good for Australia and good for any country. It would appear also from what the honourable member for St. George said that he would like a national authority set up to control the building of new homes. Here, again, we differ from his point of view, because we believe in decentralization of authority, particularly in the home-building field. It was, in fact, a Labour government which initiated the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in 1945, and as a result of that agreement we have housing authorities in each State building homes for",18,Customs Tariff New Zealan D The Last Twelve Years There Has Been A Very Preference Bill
74,Mr Whittorn (Balaclava) [4.16],"people in the lower income bracket. We believe that if a national housing authority was set up in Canberra the cost of its administration would be so great that fewer homes would be built than are now being constructed. [Quorum formed.] The main purpose of this bill is to authorize the provision of an additional £7,500,000 for the purposes of the State housing authorities. Although it is a simple measure, we have debated it for several days. A lot has been said about the State housing authorities, and honourable members opposite have claimed that an additional £7,500,000 will not add much to present building activities. It is estimated that this provision will enable an additional 2,400 to be built, and I assume that they will be built by 30th June next. The amount now being authorized is in addition to the amount previously provided under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement for the current financial year. After listening to the debate it would appear that honourable members opposite do not want this extra money injected into the building industry or that they are deliberately using this bill to make party political capita] out of the needs of low income earners. This type of premise highlighted the Opposition's contribution to ihe debate on the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in this House in May and October last year. On the former occasion, as reported at page 1917 of ""Hansard"", Bird) saidMembers on the Government side seem to cases, one or more of the children also were have lost all recollection of why the State housing working. Admittedly, particularly in Vicauthorities were formed. Yet the bill presented to the chamber last than £25 a week in order to qualify as an October and the bill now before us both applicant, but even though he earns perhaps emphasize the need to assist in the housing £22 10s. or £23 a week and his wife or of low income families. We emphasize that one or two of his children are working he the whole purpose of the Commonwealth is still entitled to put his name down for and State Housing Agreement is to assist in a housing commission home. That was why the housing of such families. Yet on 15th I interjected when the Deputy Leader of March last the Deputy Leader of the the Opposition was speaking to this debate Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) saidSo it would seem, from the latest figures availhomes in Victoria if they earned more than able to honourable members, that the number of houses being built by housing commissions was £25 a week. When perusing the applicaalready being increased before this appropriation tions for State Housing Commission homes was made. Does this mean that the Deputy Leader of the applicants was a family with total earnthe Opposition is opposed to the purpose of ings of £65 a week, and that that applicant this bill and is, in effect, opposed to the building of an additional 2,400 homes for people in the lower income group? In fact, he addedI draw the inference that the additional allocation which we are now making will not in fact provide any stimulus to house-building. It will not, in fact, enable the housing commissions to build at any faster rate during the remainder of this nnancial year than they were already building in the early part of this financial year. What a fantastic statement, coming as it does from a self-confessed statesman, and what a criticism of the State housing authorities which will receive approximately 20 per cent, more money in a given time than the 1961 agreement provided for. Yet, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, these State bodies will not be enabled to build homes at a faster rate. Such an attitude calls for the strongest condemnation not only by the various State housing ministers, but also from members of his own party. I hope that some of them will bring this matter up in caucus at some future date. Members of the Opposition have said that members of the Government do not know the real purpose of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Just prior to the debate on this agreement in 1961 I perused many of the applications made to the State Housing Commission of Victoria and was amazed to find that at least 50 per cent, of the applications were made by families in which there were two or more working as well as the husband or, in soma toria, the breadwinner must earn not more and said that people were not allowed to put down their names for housing commission in VictoriaI was amazed to find that one of",22,Customs Tariff New Zealan D The Last Twelve Years There Has Been A Very Preference Bill
75,The Honourable Member For Batman ( Mr Income,"earners. In other words, the wife waswas still eligible for such a home in Victoria. Admittedly the authorities in that State wisely put a family of that type on a low priority. But from a statistical point of view the name of that applicant and those of families in which there are two or more income-earners still remain on the housing commission's list in Victoria. I do not want to dwell on what has been said about this rather small financial bill but there are two points which I think that Government supporters and the building industry should consider in relation to buildfor Victoria is now 3.2 people per home ing homes for people in the future. [Quorum formed.] The first point is that the deposits now required for building houses are much greater than they were ten years ago. They are much more than the average income-earner can provide. Over the years, what has been referred to as a "" deposit gap "" has been brought about. In or about 1950 it was possible to buy a home on a deposit of approximately 20 per cent. To-day from 35 per cent, to 37 per cent, of the price of a home and land is required as deposit. It is beyond the means of the low wage-earner and even of the middle income-earner to provide this high deposit. So, particularly in the last three or four years, there has been a secondary method of raisingfinanceat a very high interest rate in order to fill the deposit gap. This means that unless the Government shows the way to the building industry and the lending authorities to bridge the gap. the proportion of home owners in the population must fall below the figure of 75 per cent, of which we are so proud to-day. The answer to this problem must be found by the Government, by the building industry, and by the financial institutions. The Master Builders Association of Victoria, The Victorian Builders and Allied Trades Association, the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Council of Trade Unions havefigureswhich prove that the deposit gap is the main reason why people cannot buy homes as readily as previously. I think it was the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson) who mentioned that there were 4,500 homes available for renting or sale in Melbourne at the present moment. People would buy or rent those homes if they had the necessary finance. I believe that the Governsupport the bill, but that I hope the Government and honourable members who support ment will continue its efforts lo ensure that it will make every effort to ensure that more families, particularly those in the low income group, will have additional finance made available to them at reasonably low interest rates. The other point that I would like to make is that, in the last ten years, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, there has been a tendency for fewer people to live in each home. In 1950, an average of about 4.5 persons lived in each home in New South Wales and Victoria. The figure and I think that the figure for New South Wales is 3.4. This tells me that we have built, in the last ten years, for a given number of people, 25 per cent, more homes than were required prior to 1950. This has involved a 25 per cent, increase in the number of builders used to build the homes and a 25 per cent, increase in the amount of materials andfinancerequired. I cannot agree that we had a recession of any consequence last year. But if we run into a real recession there will be a tendency on the part of families to put more people into homes that are already built and tlie building industry, the finance companies and all the organizations associated with the building of homes will really have a problem on their hands. In 1929 some of us saw the beginnings of a period of depression during which the building industry stagnated beyond recognition. I venture to predict that unless the industry, the finance companies and the' Government can show the way to a solution of problems such as the deposit gap we shall have an infinitely greater depression than that which commenced in 1929. As I have said, I believe that the deposit gap is the main reason why more people are not buying homes. More people want to rent homes now than hitherto. If the Government and the Opposition will get behind the organizations that build homes, I feel that between us we shall find the answer. After all, there is enough money in the country to build the homes. The high interest rate on second mortgages, however, makes thefinancingof home purchase a great and hazardous burden for the ordinary income-earner. I conclude by saying, not only lhat I people in the low and middle income groups now. All honourable members know that will be able to buy their own homes. like to make a few brief remarks in reply bungling of this Government. And the to the honourable member for Balaclava present acute housing shortage is the result ( Mr Whittorn). The honourable gentleman of the Government's economic bungling. described the Government's policy as being one of providing homes for the people at a low or a reasonable rate of interest. £7,500,000 to be provided under this bill May I draw the honourable gentleman's is only part of its contribution towards the attention to the fact that his Government restoration of full employment.

That statement is a clear indicafor the corresponding period in 1961-62 the tion of the Government's attitude. The number declined by 10,983 to 45,499. Government does not believe in full employment.

This bill provides for additional loan that the number of homes built by State raisings for State housing of £7,500,000, of government instrumentalities for the first which some £2,250,000 will be made availeight months of 1960-61 was 10,166, but able to the building societies.

The present bill is part constructed in the corresponding period in and parcel of the Government's go-stop-go 196061 and the amount of money spent on policy with which it has blundered through homes by the various governments dropped in recent months. The Government does by £2,601,000 in 1961-62. not know what to do to overcome the problems which it has created, particularly out the Commonwealth dropped from the problem of unemployment.

76,Mr Jones (Newcastle) [4.32],"I should depressions caused by the economicof thisfinancialyear, thefigurehas dropped by £53,664,000 to £178,997,000. emphasize that the decline is over £53,000,000, and all this Government can do to stimulate the economy and provide employment is to make available a paltry £7,500,000. If home building continues at its present rate, then, by the end of this financial year, approximately £46,000,000 less will have been spent on home building in Australia than was spent last financial year. The Government is well aware of the fact that at 30th June last year 76,000 applications for homes had still not been satisfied by the various State housing authorities, yet it continues to pursue a policy which has so contracted credit that, provided home building continues at the present rate, then, even including the £7,500,000 provided in this bill, £46,000,000 less will have been made available for home building throughout the Commonwealth by the end of thisfinancialyear. No honourable be done to provide homes for the 76,000 member on the Government side can deny people whose applications to the various those facts. The Government cannot deny State housing instrumentalities have been that its policy has destroyed the confidence approved. It must never be forgotten that of investors. We know that recently the Government thefinancialresources to build homes withhas been able to borrow larger sums of out aid from such authorities as housing money than it was able to borrow in previous commissions. These are all people who are years. For instance, we know that although obliged either to buy or to rent homes on the Government stated that the loan market the terms laid down by the various State could supply only £165,000,000. it bas instrumentalities, which in turn are dictated already raised £14,000,000 in excess of to by this Government. that sum. This has been possible because insurance companies, superannuation funds Government has required the State housing and banks which had money that could have authorities to charge a higher rate of been made available for home building were interest. I remind honourable members that compelled to invest that money in Governwhen the scheme was introduced first by ment loans. But, after drawing off this money the Chifley Labour Government in 1945, from the economy, the Government is not the interest charged was 3 per cent. Since prepared to replace it by undertaking addithat time, this Government has been respontional expenditure. The Government could stimulate the ecothe present high figure of 4 i per cent. And nomy in several ways. For instance, it could the honourable member for Balaclava says undertake additional public works prothat this Government favours low rates of grammes, it could invest money in industry, interest! In view of the facts that 1 have and it could assist the States to develop mentioned, the Government has an obligasome of their industries. We know that tion to make enough money available to Western Australia has unlimited supplies of it available at low rates of interest so that raw material. This Government could those who buy homes from the State housassist the Western Australian Government ing authorities may be able to pay them off to exploit those raw materials, to develop more quickly and those who are renting industries and in that way do much to assist the provision of employment and the decenI tralization of development in that State. The Government must do these things if the ; problem of unemployment is to be solved. , More could be done to stimulate homebuilding. The Government should be making much more than £7,500,000 available for this purpose. It should make available at least that amount which is necessary to utilize all materials and man-power available. LaterI propose to show that the supply of materials is shorter now than it was twelve months ago, and that the number of people engaged in home-building is lower than it was twelve months ago. I mention these points to emphasize that £7,500,000 is far too little to meet present needs. Much more is needed if the economy is to be given the boost necessary to provide employment for the thousands of men and women who are in need of work to-day. Especially is it important that something these 76,000 applicants are all people in the lower income group, people who have not It must be remembered also that this sible for increasing the interest charged to remedy the housing shortage, and to make homes from those instrumentalities may enjoy the comfort of a home at a lower rental. I repeat that these people are. all in was down 124,000,000 super -feet. A the lower income, group. They, are all people who cannot afford to pay the high rates of interest being charged to-day. During the recent federal election campaign, the Labour Party said that it would make money available for home building at 3± per cent. I have discussed this matter with persons in the building industry and they have assured me that lower interest rates would mean a considerable saving to home purchasers whether they obtained them through housing commissions or building societies. A reduction to 3i per cent, would mean a fall in interest payments of £1 a week on a £3,000 loan or the termination of the contract nine or ten years earlier. The Government has made no attempt to reduce interest rates although it should and could do so. Supporters of the Government have said previously that they are not prepared to make more money available for homebuilding because there are not enough tradesmen or building materials available. Bricks and timber are the main components of houses and dwellings. We know that there is plenty of galvanized iron available. Home builders can easily get all the tiles and pipes, both for water and drainage, that they require. I have not the figures for those materials but statistics recently released show that in 1959-60, the output of clay bricks was 1,030,000,000 and the following year the output was 1,061,000,000. I have the figures for December, January and February last, and production of clay bricks in those three months had fallen by 26,000,000 compared with the corresponding period the previous year. If that decline continues, we will produce 104,000,000 fewer bricks this year than last year. 1 have the figures relating to the proment has severely criticized the trade duction of sawn timber for December and union movement for creating industrial January last. The figures for February disputes and it has brought down represare not available. These statistics show sive legislation to impose severe penalties that in December and January 1960-61, on unions which engage in industrial production 196,000,000 super feet compared with wages and conditions. I have made an 179,000,000 in December and January extract of comparative figures. The 1961-62, a decline of 17,000,000 super publication of the Department of Labour feet equal to 102,000,000 super feet in and National Service entitled ""Training twelve months at the same rate of decrease. The previous year, production similar position exists in relation to hardboard and masonite which is produced near my electorate. Previously, the factory was working 21 shifts a week of seven days but now it is down to fifteen shifts. The decline in the production of hardboard is clearly shown in the figures available for 1960-61 compared with 1959-60. Production fell by 1,345,000,000 square feet and production is still falling. For the months of December, January and February, the output was down by 557,000,000 square feet compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. There is any amount of building material available to-day and the Government could make available money so that employment would be provided in the building industry and the people would be provided with homes. Figures released by the Commonwealth Statistician show that in December, I960, there were 50,701 carpenters in the trade and the number had declined to 44,392 in September, 1961, a decline of 6,309. The number of bricklayers fell from 13,724 in December, 1960, to 11,537 in September, 1961, a decline of 2,187. In December, 1960, there were 21,521 builders' labourers employed in the industry and their number has fallen by 2,444 to 19,077 in September, 1961. I have not referred to plumbers, painters, tilers, plasterers and other employees but the figures all show the same trend. The total number of workers employed in the building industry fell from 138,958 in December, 1960, to 119,677 in September, 1961, a decline of 19,281. These figures show that both materials and labour are available and undoubtedly there is a need for home building. Let me analyse this Government's thinking and its attitude. The Governof sawn timber was action to support their claims for better for Skilled Occupations"" shows, in table 6 under the heading, "" Unemployed Applicants Awaiting Placement"", the monthly average of registered unemployed in the building industry in 1961 was 3,502. There are 250 working days in a year so that the total number of mandays lost through unemployment was 675,500. Those days were lost through this Government's economic policy. These figures do not include the large group of builders' labourers but cover only skilled tradesmen. Honourable members have received to-day a publication from the Commonwealth Statistician which .shows that 48,300 man-days were lost through industrial disputes. So 675,500 man-days were lost through unemployment because of this Government's policy and 48,300 man-days were lost through industrial disputes. That means for every day lost through industrial disturbances the Government created a loss of fourteen man-days by unemployment. The loss of wages through industrial disputes was £229,273, but wages lost as a result of this Government's policy of creating a pool of unemployed totalled £3,377,500. This Government believes in unemployment and tries to suppress any endeavour by the trade unions to improve wages and conditions. In the waterfront industry, the Government has attacked the provisions for long service leave. I ask honourable members to consider how this Government is endeavouring to suppress the trade union movement and cover up the real position at the same time. I want to deal with one other aspect of housing, and that is the role of building societies. Insufficient money is being made available by this Government to building societies. The Government can make additional sums available. It can lay down the minimum amount that will be available to building societies. It can say that 30 per cent, of all money it makes available for housing shall go to building societies, and there is nothing to prevent the Government from increasing its allocation to building societies. Unlimited amounts can be made available to building societies, but let us examine the position. In my electorate, building societies have no money available at the moment. From the last grant, one building society received a little shown clearly that the amount of finance more than £10,000, and that was some months ago. People have lost confidence in home building, because the Government has not made sufficient money available to building societies. Several building societies have established private investment funds. People are encouraged to invest their money in these funds at 5J per cent, interest. The societies then lend tbe money at 6} per cent. A limited amount of this type of money is available. Very little money is made available from the bank «r from the State housing authorities under the housing agreement. Let us compare the rates of interest. Money is available from State housing authorities at 51 per cent., from the Commonwealth Bank at 51 per cent, and from investment funds at 6 i per cent. This is under a Government which allegedly makes money available for housing at low rates of interest! 1 have gone through the last financial reports of some building societies and I find that this is the position: Since 1958-59, banks have increased their loans to building societies from £92,000,000 to £103,700,000. That is not a very big increase. Fire and general insurance companies have increased their loans from £13,100,000 to £14,500,000, an increase of £1,400,000. Life assurance companies had outstanding loans amounting to £20,600,000 in 1958-59 and their outstanding loans now are still £20,600,000. Insurance companies are not investing their money in housing. Loans from friendly societies were £2,200,000 in 1958-59 and have increased by £200,000. Miscellaneous loans have increased from £9,400,000 to £11,400,000 in the same period, and this increase has been brought about only by the New South Wales Superannuation Fund increasing the amount of its loans to building societies by £1,000,000 a year. None of the other lending authorities have increased their loans to building societies. If the Government sincerely wants to ensure that sufficient homes will be available to the people of Australia, it must do a much better job in the provision of finance than it has so far done. I have available has declined seriously. I have pointed out that some 19,000 fewer men are employed in the building industry and that the production of building materials to-day is not as great as it was in previous years. A comparison of the facts and figures shows undeniably that the Government should increase its allocation by far more than this £7,500,000 that is being made available under this bill. genuinely wishes to provide more houses and to create more employment, it will make more money available. comment on one or two points raised by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr on this side of the House all realize that Jones). I think in every speech he has made, whether on housing, the stevedoring industry or any other subject, he has dealt with unemployment and has alleged that the objective of the Government is to increase unemployment. It is very simple to make this allegation. But if the honourable member reads the second-reading speech of the Minister for Air( Mr Bury), as he should before he engages in a debate on the bill, he will see that one purpose of the bill is to stimulate the building industry. in the community. It is ridiculous for Why would the Government want to stimulate the building industry? Obviously, it wants to create employment for people in the building industry. work by the Government. both ways. This measure is designed to decrease unemployment. The honourable member for Newcastle said that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn) tried to deny that there was a large-scale depression last year. Honourable members opposite should be careful that they do not talk people into a state of depression. I do not deny that there was a recession and that unemployment rose to too high a level. However, the measures we have adopted are designed to overcome this state. The honourable member for Newcastle said that we had a large depression last year. I do not think any figures were kept during the depression days of the 'thirties, but I have some very vivid memories of those days. I am sure that most honourable members in this House would remember them, because at that time they would be at an age when it would be vital for them to be in employment. It has been said that the rate of unemployment at that time was about 30 per cent. That figure probably could be juggled around, but most certainly unemployment did not reach that percentage last year. I think the highest rate of unemployment in Queensland last year was ahout 6 per cent. The Australian average at preIf the Government sent is about 3 per cent. the honourable member for Wills will always say that we are prepared to have 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of unemployment. But we the unemployed man does not care whether there is 3 per cent., 2 per cent, or 4 per cent.; he is 100 per cent, unemployed. Honourable members on this side of the House are just as conscious of the problems of the unemployed as are Opposition members. After all, we are all member* of Parliament and we are all here because of the votes of a majority of electors in our electorates. We all realize that one issue in an election is the degree of unemployment Opposition members to say that we on this side of the House want to encourage unemployment, that we want to create a pool of unemployed. you did not mean to cause unemployment? and National Service say opposite should not spend their time in this House referring to what this Minister said or what that member said. The comment of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has been quoted more than has any other comment in this House. During the debate on a bill concerning rehabilitation, he said that 5 per cent, of unemployment was inevitable. I do not say that he now believes that 5 per cent, of unemployment in the community is desirable. 2.5 per cent.

Members on this side of the House speak about the additional £7,500,000 that is being made available to the States; Opposition members speak about unemployment in the building industry. I remind the House that the purpose of the bill is to authorize the raising of this money and to ensure that it is made available to the States. The Commonwealth has no power to direct the States as to the particular housing purpose for which the money will be used. After consultation with the States, the Commonwealth can suggest that a certain percentage be allocated to building societies or that a certain States for housing because there must be amount be used to build homes for defence personnel.

No one would refuse this grant, of course, but I do not think there is a need in my State for any great amount, or for any greater amount than will be allocated to some of the other States, or even for a grant on the basis of population levels as compared with those in other States. I say this because we have not the housing problem in Western Australia that exists in some of the other States. I think it was Leslie) who pointed out that the housing problem in Western Australia has been almost overcome. I do not think any honourable member, on either side of the House, would suggest that there can ever be a time when every housing need will be satisfied. It is just not possible. The honourable member for Newcastle seems to think that this can be achieved by the Commonwealth Government giving £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 to the States for housing purposes, but I remind him that there is a limit on the availability of materials and manpower. power. of materials. that. Let me repeat slowly, for the benefit of the honourable member for Wills and the honourable member for Shortland, what I just said. There must be a limit to the amount of money you can give to the some limit to the amount of manpower and materials available. I should imagine that if you have too much money available for housing, you will reach a stage at which contractors will be vying for labour and offering special inducements to workers to go from one building project to another. more unemployment. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Oxley has a little more intelligence than some of his colleagues. If we reach the situation I have envisaged we will find that labour costs will go up because of competition, and the cost of housing will also go up. No one on either side of the House wants that to happen. If we get to the stage at which everybody who needs housing is provided with a house or a flat, and there is no waiting list at all, then there will be thousands and thousands of unemployed building trades workers. There /nust be, of course, a continuing demand because of natural increase of population. -",29,Customs Tariff New Zealan D The Last Twelve Years There Has Been A Very Preference Bill

Let me tell the honourable member for Newcastle that there were three Commonwealth Ministers in Western Australia last week, as well as all Liberal and Country Party members of the Commonwealth Parliament with electorates in Western Australia. Just to connect my remarks with this bill, let me say that they all spoke about housing. They were in various electorates. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth) was in his own electorate, and the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge) and the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) were in their electorates. The electorate of the Minister for Civil Aviation covers the whole State, of course. I attended sixteen meetings that were held last week in support of Liberal and Country Party candidates. honourable member for Parkes saying, two months before the 1958 election, that I had such a terrific campaigner opposing me that I would lose. However, my majority increased from 1,000 to 7,000. I thank the honourable member for his interjection, because it provides just another indication of the certainty of victory for the Liberal Party candidates in the three State divisions in my electorate. Wben polls on Saturday they will show that they realize that in the field of housing they have had a much better deal than have the people in the other States. a Labour government. If you keep interjecting you must be right some time. Even you must be right eventually. Government member for Newcastle has been looking at my notes, because he is giving me wonderful opportunities to lead in on points that I want to make. [Quorum formed.) I was talking about the housing situation in Western Australia. The honourable member for Newcastle said something about a Labour government. During the last three years there has been a Liberal government in office in Western Australia. In that time the basic wage has increased by about 15 per cent., prices of materials have gone up by about 10 per cent., but the cost of homes built by the Western Australian Housing Commission has remained practically static. I do not think this has occurred anywhere else in Australia. This has a twofold advantage; not only does the cost of individual homes remain at a reasonable level, but more homes can be built for the same amount of money. That is simple arithmetic.

113,Mr Chaney,"1 think the honorablefor homes. Astronomical figures have been quoted with regard to each State. I realize that a person who wants a home is in dire need, but I must say that various speakers have juggled the figures to their own advantage. In Victoria the State housing authority has taken the trouble to examine the waiting list, with some amazing results. I feel that if the same action were taken by housing authorities in other States a similar trend fault of those governments if a person who would appear. At 30th June, 1960, there were 17,233 applications for tenancies listed. During the year 9,091 applications were received, making a total of 26,324. The housing authority then sent a questionnaire to all applicants, and as a result it was a long time. I and other ex-servicemen able to strike off the list 7,084 applications, were prepared to put up with any sort of because people did not reply or failed to keep appointments or had their applications disallowed for other reasons. In other words, there was a false figure, which contained an error of about 40 per cent., showing the number of people on the waiting list. During the year the housing authority allotted 4,816 tenancies, and so at the end of the year there were only 14,424 outstanding. This was a decided improvement on the previous figures. If the housing authorities in other States would do as was done in Victoria, I am quite sure that honourable members would not then be able to cite the astronomical figures that have been mentioned during this debate. As I said earlier in the debate, and as the bells.

120,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) [5.18],"Mr country revolves. Without a doubt, theintense housing shortage which is due principally to the inadequacy of the funds that the States and particularly the housing commissions have received from the Commonwealth Government. Perhaps the most remarkable thing that emerges from a survey of housing is the fact that in spite of the large increase in our population by immigration and the demands of young people seeking homes, this Government was not able until 1961 to better the 1951 building figure, and then the improvement was only about 3,000 homes. It took ten years for the Government to make that progress! In New South Wales there is a shortage of something like 90,000 homes while in Victoria it is in the vicinity of 58,000 homes. Those figures indicate the efforts that this Government has made to overcome the housing shortage. The result of those efforts live in housing commission settlements the has fallen far short of the mark. Nothing has been done to reduce the lag and now, as a result of the credit squeeze, the deterioration in the building industry is greater than ever before in our history. Honourable members on the Government side have suggested during this debate that roof over they we of the Opposition would regiment people into homes in housing commission areas.

In fact, the establishment of housing co-operatives has been called by an opponent one of the socialistic planks of the Labour Party's platform. But to-day honourable members on the Government side find it fashionable and convenient to support what they termed not so long ago a socialistic venture. When accusing the Opposition of wanting to force people to honourable member for La Trobe said that the situation had almost reached the point of being degrading.

It has not given me any pleasure There have been some peculiar twists by honourable member for Penh made some reference to this. My attitude is that the intention of the Government may have been good, but its methods were rotten. The overall effect of the credit squeeze, as has been indicated by Mr Peters, has been a wave of bankruptcies in the building industry. This has created a loss of confidence among people who want homes, and has generated buyers' resistance. The prices of homes have tended to soar even higher. This is a natural sequence when competitive builders are forced out of the industry as the small builders were forced out. They were not able to get money, and found themselves not only losing their occupations, but also their homes, through bankruptcy. That is what must happen when competition is reduced through the small builder being forced to the wall, leaving the field wide open for the big man-indeed , leaving it wide open for the exploiter. The honourable member for La Trobe materials, and the money also has been 6aidHonorable members opposite should understand income group could not afford to pay. that if we ever reach saturation point in homebuilding there will be greater unemployment and Money for homebuilding is money which greater trouble than we have ever seen before.

Every available deposit lies in the £100 to £200 bracket child bom in this country is a potential home seeker. It is almost eighteen months since the credit squeeze was introduced, and despite all the statements by Government supporters it is only now that they have found out the real cause of the housing problem which, they say, is finance. Only after all this time-almos t eighteen months after the credit squeeze was applied-whe n the building industry has been forced to its knees, has the Government brought down a bill to do something to correct the situation. Opposition members have been telling the Government that the root cause of all the trouble in the building industry has been lack of money. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) spoke of building materials and other ingredients of the building industry. The only ingredient for homebuilding that has been missing has been finance.

In order to try to bring the rents within the reach of the pockets of the low income group it is going to rob Peter to pay Paul. What is going to happen? In trying to average out an accommodation basis for rents the commission is going to increase the low rents or those struck in the earlier low-cost periods and drop the rents of the people who have had to buy in periods when the price of accommodation has been very high. We support the bill but emphasize also that we support co-operative housing societies. In fact, we support all measures designed to raise the living standards of the people. We believe that good housing is good living. We believe that many of the evils in this country can be removed by good housing. I say, too, that we will fight for the rights of the individual in spite of what the honourable member for Latrobe says. We will fight for the right of the individual to own his or her own home in any location where they desire to live. I say, also, that it was the Government and not the building industry which brought about the destruction and chaos in homebuilding and that the Government, through its methods of finance, is the root cause of this evil. -Order!

The honourable member for Gellibrand misrepresented what I said by presenting out of its context my statement that there would always be a shortage of houses in Australia. I made that remark in answer to an interjection by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin). My purpose was to indicate the increasing demand for a higher standard of homes and the rapid rate of growth of population in this country. It was for those reasons that I made the remark and not for the reason attributed to me by the honourable member for Gellibrand, who, in the course of his speech, attributed statements to various honourable members on this side of the House and misinterpreted them.

He did not mention what provision the Government intends to make for service housing and, whilst the Government may well have some intention in this direction, it has not been manifested here. This subject is of considerable importance to members of the armed services. Chairman. I submit that when an honourable member is dealing with the bill in committee he must speak to specific clauses. Surely, he cannot deal with the Minister's second-reading speech. honourable member is permitted to continue to show the relevance of what he is saying to the bill. At this stage, I ask the honourable member for Oxley to relate the remarks he is making to the clauses of the measure. the act 30 per cent, of the money provided by the Commonwealth goes to the States for the provision of private housing, mainly through building societies. The other 70 per cent, is utilized by the State housing commissions, and of that proportion a maximum of 5 per cent, can be provided for service homes. In the past it has been the practice of this Government to provide a certain amount of money for service homes. The service homes situation is particularly acute, and as the result of inquiries it has been brought before the Parliament by honourable members on this side of the chamber.

130,Mr Hayden,"My point is that underservicemen and their interests in war service housing. It has been revealed that there is a lamentable shortcoming in the production of war service homes. When we consider the figures for 1959-60 Chairman. Which particular clause are we dealing with? able member for Fawkner that the committee agreed to consider the bill as a whole. The honourable member for Oxley is at the moment relating the matter of his remarks to the clauses of the measure, and he is in order. 5,287 homes sought by servicemen and homes were allotted to 3,170. At the end of this period there were over 4,000 applications outstanding. In 1960-61, the number of home's outstanding was nearly 4,000. I point to the situation in the Oxley electorate which contains the Amberley Air Force Base and on the borders of which there is the Wacol military camp. Many servicemen from these establishments are forced to accept the first accommodation offered to them because of the housing shortage. In many cases it is sub-standard and certainly would not be tolerated under normal conditions. Further, the subsidy which the Department of Defence is prepared to pay on rentals for servicemen who occupy these homes encourages sub-standard housing, and rental rates for the general public in the district are grossly inflated. While members of the services can bear heavy rentals of £8 or £9 a week for accommodation certainly not worth more than £4, the result is that rentals are grossly inflated for the general public. So not only is the Government paying out heavily in this way, but the general public in the area is also forced to suffer. I am informed that the Air Force has a peculiar system at Darwin, where, on' arrival, members of that service enter a sub-standard type of dwelling. This is typical of the poor type of accommodation provided. If they are there long enough they step up into a slightly better class of dwelling and, over a lengthy period, they can reach accommodation which is of a fairly good standard provided that they are not transferred, but by the time they reach that accommodation they are usually ready for transfer. This is the type of criticism that members of the armed services are expressing to me. I would like to know the Government's attitude. Perhaps the Minister for Air( Mr Bury) can inform the committee whether money available for servicemen's homes, and, if so, how much. How many homes will be erected as a result of this money being provided? Can the Minister advise the committee how many applications for service housing will then be left outstanding? Is it-proposed, as an act of policy, to overcome the lag in service housing which has existed for many years and which has shown very little improvement. Will the Minister state the amount expended for the financial year 1960-61 and the estimated amount to be expended for 1961-62 in subsidies on rental payments by servicemen? These points are very important to the people whom they affect-the servicemen. Just because these men have joined the armed services they should not forfeit their rights as citizens. They are entitled to some consideration. They are placed in particularly uncomfortable situations because they are subject to transfer all over the country at short notice. It is often very difficult for them to obtain accommodation. The Government has an obligation to provide suitable housing so that they will not have to suffer the indignity of living in sub-standard conditions. Air) [5.57] -The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) has just raised a number of questions which, by some vast stretch of imagination, could be related to the subject under discussion, but I do not propose to debate service housing fully on this occasion. The honourable member referred to the fact that a subsidy is paid for the housing of servicemen in his area. Of course, the payment of this rent subsidy is not confined to the armed services. It applies to all members of the Public Service who are transferred to certain areas and who cannot obtain accommodation for a fairly low proportion of their salaries. On the whole, this subsidy is an important aid to servicemen, as it is to public servants generally, in obtaining accommodation. Of course, if a tenant's capacity to pay is raised by one means or another, his rent also is liable to rise. That is almost selfexplanatory, particularly when it is applied",37,Customs Tariff New Zealan D The Last Twelve Years There Has Been A Very Preference Bill

134,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forto a small area such as Ipswich and other places in which the services are situated or to which public servants have to go. I presume that the honourable member would not suggest that this subsidy should be removed. If it were removed the difficulties of servicemen and of public servants would be greatly intensified. The subject of service housing is always a difficult one. In the last four or five years, in the Royal Australian Air Force, and presumably in the other services, a programme has been put into force and inroads have been made into the problem. That is not to say that the problem is solved nor that it is likely to be solved in the immediate Section four of the Housing Agreement Act future. But, within a reasonable time, it will be solved. I repeat that this is uot the proper occasion on which to canvass the whole ambit of the housing of servicemen. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the sitting was suspended, I had been asking the Bury) a number of questions with relation to the purposes of this bill and, much to the surprise of the Opposition, the Minister seemed to be taken aback. It was apparent to us that he had not sufficient knowledge of the matters I had raised to answer the question I put to him. This is all the more amazing to us when we remember, first, that he is the Minister who introappropriate Minister of the State. duced the bill and, secondly, that he, as Minister for Air, is responsible for the administration of one of the services directly concerned with one of the questions I raised-the amount of money that the Government intends to provide for the housing of service personnel. First, in a rather devious manner, the Minister endeavoured to deflect the attack from his department, and to cloud the fact that he was not able to answer my questions, by suggesting that I had proposed that the system of subsidized rentals for service personnel be abolished without any additional provision for housing. I never at any time suggested such a thing. My proposal was very clear. I asked quite clearly what the Government intended to do to overcome the lag which it had allowed to occur, and so eliminate the need for subsidizing rentals. I was seeking to promote the best interests of members of the services, of members of the Royal Australian Air Force in particular who, in many cases, are forced to accept sub-standard accommodation. Another point put by the Minister was that the matter which I raised had no bearing on the question under discussion. I submit that it has a very important bearing On the matter, and I direct the Minister's attention to clause 4 of the bill, which readsMoneys borrowed under this Act shall be issued and applied only for the expenses of borrowing and for the purpose of making advances to the States in pursuance of section four of the Housing Agreement Act 1961. 1961 says, inter aliaThe Treasurer may, out of moneys lawfully available for the purpose, make advances to a State in accordance with the agreement executed in pursuance of the Housing Agreement Act 1956 as amended by an agreement executed in pursuance of this Act. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 7 of the agreement sets out the position quite clearly. It Of the advances made to a State in a financial year which pursuant to clause 6 of this agreement are to be used for the erection of dwellings by the State, the State shall set aside for the purposes of clause 13 of this agreement such portion not exceeding five per centum as may be specified by the Minister from time to time or such portion greater than five per centum as may be agreed from time to time between the Minister and the This measure definitely deals with the provision of financial assistance for homes for service personnel. I asked the Minister those questions earlier because I was earnestly and sincerely seeking information for the guidance of the large number of service personnel who reside in my electorate. These people are entitled to know what the Government is doing to safeguard their welfare, but the Minister refuses point blank to answer my questions. know, but I would have thought that in the two hours since the suspension of the sitting he would have had sufficient time to bring himself up to date. His refusal to answer is significant when we remember that the service administered by him, the Royal Australian Air Force, fares worse of all the services, as is disclosed by the fact that on",38,Customs Tariff New Zealan D The Last Twelve Years There Has Been A Very Preference Bill

Nobody should be under the impression that under this legislation we are handing out something to workers who are living in the lap of luxury. In Queensland last year, the average wage of the waterside workers was just about equal to the basic wage. Let us consider the reasons why a stevedoring industry authority was set up. It is almost exactly twenty years since an attempt was made to bring order to the waterfront in Australia by the setting up of a stevedoring industry authority. Before April, 1942, stevedoring in Australia was controlled, first, by the interstate ship-owners; secondly, by stevedoring companies more or less closely connected with the shipping companies; and thirdly, by some companies which carried on their own businesses and did their own stevedoring such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, timber merchants and others. When we consider the industrial arbitration system of Australia, we wonder why such an authority was ever set up. When a crisis faced Australia following the outbreak of the war with Japan, the Labour Prime Minister of the day took action to meet the emergency. On the advice of a representative committee, of which Sir Owen Dixon was chairman, an organization known as the Stevedoring Industry Commission was ultimately set up and it functioned from April, 1942, almost twenty years ago. The commission was conceived as a war-time measure and it relied upon the almost unlimited powers provided under the National Security Act. It had one main objective and, in the words of the Labour Prime Minister, Mr John Curtin, it was chargedTo keep the ships moving and secure all necesin Australia. Employment in it is subject to grave sary tonnage to meet Australia's needs, especially fluctuations, periodical, seasonal and intermittent, in the forward area. At the conclusion of hostilities, the Labour Government was faced with a problem on the waterfront. The Labour Government knew very well that it could not allow the waterfront to revert to the conditions which existed before 1942. It realized that in an island continent, the policy of dog-eat-dog on the waterfront had to end if the country was to develop. Therefore, on 19th October, 1945, the Chifley Labour Government, through its acting Attorney-General, set up a commission to inquire into what should be done for the future since the National Security Regulations would soon expire. The Labour Government appointed Judge Foster and gave him a charter under three headings. They were1. What provision should be made or action taken with the object of ensuring that stevedoring operations in Australia are carried on efficiently and without delay. 2. Whether industrial matters relating to the stevedoring industry should be dealt with by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration or any other Industrial Authority having jurisdiction to deal with any of those matters, or whether they or any of them should be dealt with by an Authority established to deal solely with those matters. 3. Whether it is or is not desirable that steps should be taken to terminate, wholly or in part, the existing system of employment on a casual basis in the Stevedoring Industry and to substitute for it a system of employment wholly or partly on a time basis. That was the charter of the commission. We have to keep in mind the conditions on the waterfront twenty years ago and those that exist to-day in considering what Judge Foster reported to the Parliament through the Labour Government of the day. His Honour saidFirstly it was an industry vital to the economic interests of the Commonwealth, involving foreign as well as local trade, and so affecting export industries and particularly primary industries. What His Honour found in 1942 may be more important in 1962, if Australia is to trade successfully after Great Britain enters the Common Market. The next point made by His Honour was thisNext we note that defence problems are closely associated with the industry, and will be in the' future unless the Atom bomb has changed the face of war or the UN.O. ended it. His Honour made this third pointThen again the Stevedoring industry is almost wholly casual and affects about 20,000 workers yet it demands the continuous existence of a reservoir of labour, withdrawals from which vary greatly according to these fluctuations. Of course, His Honour did not know then that we would have a government of fits and starts that would remove import controls, put them on again, then take them off, leaving waterside workers to work overtime handling all the imports, and finally apply some other form of control in the hope that this would reduce imports. While all this has been happening, the work force has been subject tofluctuationscaused by whatmanner in which the legislation to which ever action the Government may have taken. I have referred was dealt with, it is a The fourth point made by His Honour wonder that we have not had more trouble wasWe should not lose sight either of the fact Honour made a fifth point, which waswhich the records show that this industry is pecularly sensitive to industrial disturbances arising of the problems arising in this industry which in other industries. It is also particularly sensitive to its own in other industries. disturbances. A question was asked in this chamber to-day about a stoppage that bas taken place. The question was unfair and the answer was unfair. The stoppage took place in accordance with tbe practice on the waterfront, accepted by the owners and the authority as well as by the union. It arose from a matter that is causing very grave concern, because it affects the very ""li ves of the men working in the industry. May I say that, as the Parliament has accepted the responsibility to cure the trouble, the Minister would be well advised to learn from the past. He should remember that when he introduced legislation that affected the lives of waterside workers, the union had not been consulted, the Australian Council of Trade Unions had not been consulted and the first that any one knew f the legislation was when it was introduced in this House. course it is true and you know it is. true. it is true, because I was serving on tbe interstate executive at the time and the records show that the first we knew of the proposal was when the Minister made his announcement in this House. If the Minister thinks that he can handle industrial matters in this fashion, he should revise his views. He shoukl not introduce legislation affecting the lives of those working in the industry without consulting the leaders on both sides of the industry. The authority itself in this instance said it did not know what the Minister was doing. Now there is a fight as to who was wrong. The Parliament is entitled to legislate on matters affecting this industry, and it should learn from the past and realize that the first essential is to achieve co-operation between the parties. Having regard to the on the waterfront than we have had. His There is too, a special urgency about many do not arise or which only arise in a lesser degree His sixth point wasThe industry as well finds itself in a special constitutional position. The legislative power of the Commonwealth on industrial matters is in the main limited to Section 51 PI. (xxxv.) of the Constitution in these terms""The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(xxxv.) Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" His Honour said furtherThese words have been the subject matter of continuous litigation, the end of which has not yet been reached. There is, for most of industry, no direct legislative power, but this industry, at all events, insofar as it is an integral part of overseas and interstate trade and commerce, may call, in aid another source of legislative power in PI. (i.) of Section 51 of the Constitution in these terms"" (i.) Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States."" His Honour made this final pointStill another factor differentiates this industry namely, that port facilities, harbours, rail transport and (in the main) wharves etc. are at present provided and owned by the States, and this fact has added difficulties to the task of industrial tribunals and in some respects placed the problems of the Stevedoring industry beyond their reach and that of employers and employees in the industry. Before recommending that the commission should be continued in peace-time, His Honour took the opportunity to review briefly the awards affecting the industry. I do not wish to do that, but I shall requote his comment before he detailed the various awards that had covered the industry until 1942. He saidI do not feel it necessary to write of the history of this industry-d t has a longrecord of turbulence and struggle stretching back into preArbitration Court daysa story of evil conditions, low wages, of unsatisfactory relationships, of bitterness and unrest.

He saidThe alternatives presented areContinue the Stevedoring Industry Commission That is an indication of the attitude of the or return to the Arbitration Court-in each case present Prime Minister towards waterside with appropriate modifications. As has been workers at that time. seen, I have come to the conclusion that the former method is preferable. . . . It is advisable, I think, to go back to the report of the commission and consider whether or not Labour's legislation was effective. Let honourable members bear in mind the situation as described by His Honour. The authority was established in December of 1947, and the proportion of man-hours lost through stoppages in that year was 5.8 per cent. In the following year, after Labour had introduced its legislation, the figure had dropped to 2.2 per cent. In 1948-49, just before this Government took ofiice, the proportion of man-hours lost through stoppages was down to 1.8 per cent. These figures will clearly show whether Labour's approach to industrial problems has been sound or not. It is interesting to read the debates on the legislation that was enacted by the Labour Government at the time of the establishment of the Stevedoring Industry Authority. I ask honourable members to listen to the passages that I propose to quote from "" Hansard"" reports of those debates. It will become obvious that the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who was then Leader of the Opposition, considered at that time that a much smaller amount than £5,000,000 was a considerable burden on the transport industry. This is what the right honourable gentleman had to say, as reported at page 312 of ""Hansard"" for 28th February, 1947But this award grants to the waterside workers wasteful burden on the transport of goods. This The notice this morning, will probably cost approxiof absurdity regarding attendance money exists in two ports which are referred to as "" wireless "" laide should not be overlooked, I am happy to tell him that Adelaide is also a "" wireless port"". notified when they will not be required. This ing uneasily in his bed, may learn from the radio that he is not required that day. that in 1947, and. I presume his attitude has not changed much since then. In the same debate the present Deputy As the result of that superficial examination, I desire to offer several criticisms. I find it extraordinary that, for the first time in our industrial history, the machinery of arbitration will be financed by the particular industry in which the workers concerned are employed. That proposal is without precedent, and the principle underlying it is very curious and unjustifiable. The passages that I have read show clearly the attitude of the present Prime Minister and his Deputy, at the time when the Labour Government attempted to do something towards settling the difficulties of the waterfront on the basis suggested by the report of Mr Justice Foster. I invite honourable members to bear in mind what I said earlier about the danger of introducing a measure of this kind. Let us consider the movements in the stevedoring industry charge since it was first imposed. In 1947 it was 4 i d . In 1949 it was reduced to 2id., increased to 4d. in 1951, and further increased to l i d . in 1952. In 1954 it was fixed at 6d., and was increased in 1956 to Is. 7d., in 1957 to 2s., and to 3s. in 1958. On 1st July, 1959, it was reduced to 2s. 6d., and it has remained at that amount since that time.",42,Stevedoring Industry Charge Circumstances It Is The Responsibility Of The

146,Mr E. James Harrison,He said,43,Stevedoring Industry Charge Circumstances It Is The Responsibility Of The
147,Prime Minister ( Mr Mcewen) Said,"The consideration of this matter should not be passed over lightly. Transport costs represent one of Australia's national difficulties. Yet we have this legislation brought before the Parliament without any consideration having been given to the effect of imposing an additional burden of £5,250,000 on one section of the transport industry. That section will have to carry the whole of a burden which, I suggest, might properly be spread over the whole transport industry. It is completely, wrong, in my view, that the matter should be treated in this way. If you are going to increase the burden on one section of our transport industry by £5,250,000, you should have a very good reason for doing so, because there is a grave danger of an inflationary effect upon thc whole national economy. Let me now consider one or two other aspects of the legislation. It is true that as from July, 1959, annual leave payments to waterside workers became, by decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the responsibility of the Authority. In the financial year ended 30th June, 1961, annual leave payments amounted to £1,094,174. These payments, prior to the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, were made from a trust fund controlled by the employers. This fund was built up by a self-imposed levy on the employers themselves, which amounted to, on the average, 9d. a man-hour. Let me now refer to the increase of dropped to 30,269,000 and the handling rate 4s. 3d. a day in attendance money payrose to .921 tons for each man-hour. ments. The Minister said, in his second reading speechFurther, as from 1st November, 1961, the daily rate of attendance money payable to waterside workers was increased by a decision of the I would draw that interjection. Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from 24s. per day to 28s. 3d. per day. Attendance money payments have, for this reason and because of the falling off in shipping activity, risen considerably. Let me remind the House that this falling off in shipping activity was the result of the Government's credit squeeze, which resulted in a considerable diminution of imports. Another cause was the higher production standards of the waterside workers themselves. Let me further consider this latter suggestion. I say again to the Minister that when introducing legislation of this kind, providing for an increase in the assessed charge, you should not leave the matter so that people in this House, or outside it, must find out for themselves the effects of, and the reason for, the increase of 4s. 3d. a day. After all, an increase from 24s. to 28s. 3d. is fairly steep, and surely we in this Parliament are entitled to have a clear statement about it from the Minister introducing the measure. In addition to showing how the 4s. 3d. a day increase was arrived at, I want to prove as conclusively as possible that one of the reasons for the falling off of work on the waterfront is the increase in the work output of the waterside worker himself. Let us have a look at what was said in the judgment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I only wish that I had sufficient time to read the whole judgment. All it does is to restore a standard that was set in 1956. That is what the Minister for Labour and National Service should have said if he was to be fair to the Australian Stevedoring Industry waterside worker. I invite examination of the part of the judgment which I am about to read. It proves my case on both points. The judgment statesIn the year ending 10th June 19S6 the total tonnage of cargo handled by waterside workers was 24,518,000 and total man-hours worked was 38,821,000, the handling rate per man-hours therefore being .634 tons.

The judgment continuesThere has been an increase in tons handled per man-hour of 45%. These figures of total tonnage include bulk-cargoes handled by waterside workers and Mr Menhennit argued that such cargoes should be excluded. That is what honourable members opposite think should be done. The judgment then a rate which remains stable over a perioda rate goes onI do not agree when the question at issue is with little warning, and to build up some reserves burden to the industry. Let me pause there. That, again, illustrates able. the difference between the thinking on the I hope, Mr Speaker, that this is not the final Government sile of the House and the commitment of the Government with respect thinking on our side.

I crave the indulthe additional output as a result of the gence of your good self, Sir, and of the introduction of the kind of machine he is House to cite three cases to show why this using. Let me continue with the judgment, sort of thing is taking place. If the Minister which goes on to sayIn any event when bulk-cargoes are excluded is now 65 years of age and who has served it appears that there has been a substantial increase in the handling of non-bulk cargoes since 1958. 40 years in the industry.

Despite the fact worked decreased while the tonnage of bulkcargoes increased by over 40%.

He attendance money to its 1956 level will not impose an unfair burden on the industry. In other words, all that the commission did regular roster to the irregular roster in when it increased attendance money by 1950. 4s. 3d. a day was to restore the standard shade of attaining eight years' service. of 1956, which is lower than the standard He has no entitlement to long service leave, accepted by the full bench of the commission because he has not accumulated eight in assessing the present basic wage. After all, years' credits on a regular roster. Yet, the full bench accepted the 1960 level in in 1959-60 ten days' annual leave and in assessing the new basic wage. The waterside 1960-61 seven days' annual leave accrued workers talked about by Mr Justice Foster to him. This is a man who was registered go back to 1956 for the assessment of the from 1942 to 1960 and who broke his leg real value of their attendance money.

154,Mr Snedden (Bruce) [8.53],"M yfor waterside workers and a whole host of other benefits. No industry has better fringe benefits than has the waterfront industry of Australia. If the waterside workers were employed by individual employers the cost of all these things would be met by the individual employers, but because of the very nature of the industry and the fact that the men work for one employer to-day and a different employer to-morrow, it is in the interests of the waterside workers to. be entitled to these normal accretions to the award conditions, such as annual leave, sick pay and a most important addition, the attendance payment. It is in their interests that funds to meet the attendance payments be collected and disbursed. The authority is merely the vehicle for the collection and payment. This legislation imposes no greater burden than would be imposed if the industry were left in the jungle conditions which applied before 1942 and of which my honourable friend from Blaxland was so critical. There are his two major weaknesses in logic. Then the honourable member went on with a galaxy of completely wrong statements which cannot be supported in any way. I have noted only the major ones. Let me deal with them. He claimed that it is the responsibility of Parliament to examine a piece of legislation like this and to have in mind the cost to industry. I have already pointed out that industry has been saved the cost for three years. As for the Parliament examining the legislation, as the honourable member himself pointed out there have been six or seven amendments to the amount of levy since 1947. It is worth reminding the House that on every occasion on which a piece of legislation of this kind has been .'before it, the Opposition has said .that the Parliament should examine the legislation, but has not put forward a single argument to warrant such examination. Moreover it is worth reminding the House also that there has never been a division at either the second reading or the committee stages of the amending legislation. Again to-night a member of the Opposition who sits on the front bench has said, "" We do not oppose this bill"". What does that mean? Of course the Opposition does not oppose the bill. It cannot oppose the bill. Here the honourable member's third error of logic crops up. If the Opposition opposed the bill and the Government failed to pass it, the waterside workers would be denied annual leave, attendance payment, sickness benefits and all the other fringe benefits which are accretions to the award. The honourable member then stated that the average pay of a waterside worker in Queensland is £15 15s. a week. He included in that average all Queensland ports which embrace those B class ports which operate only for short periods to meet seasonal conditions. Surely the honourable gentleman knows that the average income of a waterside worker in A class . ports such as Sydney and Melbourne is nearer £30 a week on an annual basis. Mr E. James Harrison -That is completely wrong. ber has only to look at the report, of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority which is before him. Then the honourable member stated that prior to 1942 the waterfront had operated under jungle conditions. The question then arises, ""Why was an authority set up?"" Clearly the answer is that there had come into the industrial thinking of Australia realization of the necessity to provide for men in a casual industry who, by the very nature of their work, were offering for employment regularly and whose employment had many of the aspects of regularity, but who were casual employees in the sense of changing their employers almost daily. The honourable member then said that the criterion of this was expressed by Mr Curtin, the wartime Prime Minister, who issued a directive in 1942 to keep the ships moving. The prime object in 1942 was to keep the ships moving. But what is the prime object to-day? It is to put no inhibition upon the trading capacity of this nation. So to-day we have a completely different position from that which obtained in 1942. The honourable member then said that an unfair question was asked* in the House to-day to which an unfair reply was given. He alleged that the question was unfair because a certain piece of legislation relating to long service leave had been introduced into this House last year without the",46,Stevedoring Industry Charge Circumstances It Is The Responsibility Of The
155,Mr Snedden,"The honourable memknowledge of the people who were to be affected by it. The honourable member for Blaxland, of all people, should have known that Mr Monk of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and officers of the Waterside Workers Federation were in this building meeting with the Minister for Labour before the bill was introduced. If he has any recollection of the Minister's second-read'ing speech he knows that the Minister said that he had had those discussions, and that certain proposals in the bill had been changed in deference to representations to the Minister by the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The honourable member then went on to talk about other things. He said it was a wonder that we had not had more trouble than we have had. The truth of the matter is that the great bulk of waterside workers give us an old story. He quoted from a want peace on the waterfront. They do judgment in which the court said that a not want jungle conditions. They want worker was entitled to benefit from the long service leave as an accretion to their increased efficiency brought about by award conditions. They have got the right machinery. He said, "" For once the court to that leave now and, furthermore, have was on our side "". This is not the way to made good use of it. Thefiguresrespecting approach an arbitration court or commisthose who have taken their long service sion, or the arbitration system generally. leave entitlement are quite illuminating. Then the honourable member went on to issues and reach a reasonable and proper give us a long story in which he said, by decision on the facts before it. I believe implication, that Labour Governments had that it does so. It is a well established achieved everything for the waterside principle of the arbitration commission that workers.

He Let me now come to other aspects which seemed to find this true in logic, although I wish to bring before the House. TheI hope to point out that it is untrue in logic. waterfront industry is certainly a turbulent And what of this statement that it would industry. As long ago as about 40 years be inflationary? Neither he nor any member Mr Justice Higgins, one of the great of his party had any concern about inflation only a few months ago, when they thought that by denying there was a boom they could gain a few votes for themselves at the general election. He then went on to say that the increased standard of efficiency of the waterside workers themselves has brought about a falling off in the amount of work available on the waterfront. Let me remind the House of the tremendous resistance that the waterside workers put up to machinery handling methods on the waterfront. So strong was this resistance that in Queensland the Waterside Workers Federation lost the right, on a demarcation basis, to do certain work. That work went to the members of another union because the Waterside Workers Federation refused to have anything to do with bulk handling methods. The honourable member then went on to That is a system under which the arbitral authority is supposed to look at all the Those are the matters that the honourable",47,Stevedoring Industry Charge Circumstances It Is The Responsibility Of The
156,And National Service ( Mr Mcmahon),"judges in the Australian arbitral system, described this as a turbulent industry, and his words have been repeated by many people. The casual nature of the industry has brought about a great deal of militancy. The jungle conditions which existed before the last war, to which the honourable member for Blaxland referred, in themselves brought about militancy. In the course of time those causes of friction have been eliminated, but the conditioning of the past has remained. So we now have an industry with very fine working conditions, with what I believe to be a good rate of pay and with amenities which coud not be challenged by any other industry, but which is still dominated by militancy of outlook. In this industry the past has conditioned the present It is true that many of the advantages 28th October of that year.

It is from that figure of of conditions on the waterfroni. I want to turn to some history which I believe is accurate, because I have studied the legislation and the debates concerning the operative date-1s t July, 1959-fro m it. The first levy was in 1947. It was which the Australian Stevedoring Industry introduced to finance the payment of statutory holidays and sick pay which had been granted by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The levy was then 4id. In 1949, it was announced to the Parliament that a surplus had built up in the fund, and that it was proposed to introduce legislation to reduce the levy to 2£d. In 1951, the then Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, introduced legislation to increase the levy from 2£d. to 4d. He pointed out at the time that the money collected was to pay attendance money and provide cafeterias, transport of workers on the waterfront, amenities generally, and the administrative costs of the authority controlling the industry. He said that 2±d. was inadequate as a levy to cover the increased costs. In 1952, the levy was increased from 4d. to lid., to operate from It is important, while considering those 2s. 6d. that this bill proposes to increase the levy. It is interesting to find that that is Authority had the responsibility of paying annual leave, whereas prior to that date the responsibility had rested on the individual employer. It may be, in retrospect, a pity that the amount was not left at 3s. instead of the surcharge evaporating and coming down to 2s. 6d. But in any event, what happened was that from 1st July, 1959, no levy was collected either by the shipowners or by the authority to meet the cost of annual leave; and that cost is approximately £1,200,000 a year. Prior to 1959from 1947 when annual leave was first prescribed by the commission-the employers had' levied themselves in order to pay the annual leave requirements. Then in May, 1959, the employers made an interim application to Mr Justice Ashburner, who was considering the whole range of the award, to change the responsibility for payment from the individual employers to the authority. It is most interesting to read the transcript of that application and to find the reasons for what was done. Let me mention a few of them. One of the reasons for which it was done was the great difficulty employers had in knowing how much the leave should be, because it operated on the basis of the man-hours worked. And when you get a port like Gladstone, which at certain times of the year has more hours in attendance money than hours worked, it makes a differential between Gladstone and other ports where the normal pattern of working operates. It is also true that at that time-as it still does to-day-the authority maintained all the records from which the entitlement to annual leave was worked out. When this application came before the commission Mr Docker, the industrial agent for the Waterside Workers Federation, put up a merely formal objection to the application"" formal"" is the only word which would describe it-and I think the decision given by the presidential member, His Honour Mr Justice Ashburner, is worth reciting briefly. On 9th June, 1959, among other things he saidI think this is the apposite paragraphIn my view the application should be granted. The reasons which actuated me in 19S6 in ordering that payment for holidays not worked and for sick leave should be made by the Authority rather replying to the honourable member for than by employers apply to the matter of annual leave. In an award dealing with annual leave I would not impose obligations on "" employers"" vaguely, as is done in clause 3 of the existing annual leave order. I think it much more appropriate that payment should be made by the Authority, and I cannot see that waterside workers will, in any way, be prejudiced by the change. I draw the attention of the House to the words used there by His Honour, "" I would not impose obligations on ' employers * vaguely "", because in this hearing the whole question arose as to whether there was any legal entitlement of waterside workers to annual leave payments. When this matter was put to Mr Docker by the presidential member, Mr Justice Ashburner, he sidestepped it completely and his words, as I recall them from the transcript, were "" These matters of annual leave have been worked out in a normal and proper fashion between the employers and the employees, as they ought to be "". That was according to Mr Docker, and that is the situation on the waterfront to-day. The relationship between employer and employee ought to be proper and normal. I believe that with the assistance of legislation introduced last year by this Government that objective has been achieved and that the only great danger to peace on our waterfront and the development of our transport industries is statements that are not only untrue but also positively encouraging to turbulence on the waterfront. I support the bill very strongly. Mr O'BRIEN (Petrie) [9.16] Mr Speaker, it has been rather pleasing to listen to the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) support the bill. His support for the measure implied that the shipping industry can carry a levy of 3s. 4d. for every man-hour worked; and there are considerable man-hours worked in the Australian stevedoring industry. According to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority's report for last year there are some 30,000,000 man-hours worked on the Australian waterfront annually, handling import and export goods. Therefore the Government supports the additional loading on this industry and the loading of the stevedoring industry levy has been accepted by all sections of the community as one of the grounds for the increase of freight rates by the conference lines. The honourable member for Bruce, in Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) started off by being an analytic gentleman, infusing logic into his argument. First he said that the honourable member for Blaxland was completely in error in saying that this levy could be a burden of from £5,000,000 to £5,250,000 on the Australian people, exporters, or industry generally. I recall that eight days ago the conference lines increased their freight rates from Australia by 5 per cent. Glancing at an old newspaper clipping I note that in 1959 the freight rates for Australian goods were the highest charge against our overseas reserves, totalling over £100,000,000, and 5 per cent, of £100,000,000 is £5,000,000. Let us have some more logic. The honourable memberI notice in the left-hand corner of the House officials with a pile of stevedoring industry reports-sai d that waterside workers receive £30 a week, but, in fact, the authority's report shows clearly that the average earnings of the waterside workers, with all the benefits mentioned, amount to £22 8s. l i d . To deliberately distort a figure by 40 per cent, is symptomatic of the attitude of members on the Government side of the House. With his knowledge of the industry, and not forgetting his logic, the honourable member said that in 1947' a levy of 4d. was imposed by this Parliament to provide for sick pay and holiday pay. In fact Mr Justice Ashburner awarded sick pay and holiday pay in 1956. However, Mr Speaker and gentlemen, let us get on to the facts of the case. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority was set up as a government authority to ensure the mobility of labour from employer to employer. Because of fluctuations in the industry, no employer could employ a permanent pool of labour. Because of personalities in the industry, some waterside workers would not work for a specific employer. If work was plentiful, a particular employer conld wait for labour indefinitely if he was not considered a good boss. It was a Labour government which recognized its responsibUity to ensure mobility of labour by means of a stevedoring industry authority. Only when the control of this country passed into the hands of the Liberal Country Party coalition did the levies start to increase. I was going to make an analysis of the increases which the Government has introduced, but that has been done by the honourable member for Bruce. In line with its current economic thinking, because a small levy was imposed in 1947, the Government has proceeded, year after year, to load this industry with increased levies until to-day it is proposed that the levy should be 3s. 4d. per man-hour worked. At present, 30,000,000 man-hours are being worked every year. When will the Government realize that this cannot go on? It has been proved in succession in the Tate report, in the Basten report and in the Forster report that the conference lines, which control shipping for all exports of Australian goods, load the stevedoring industry charge on to freight rates. The Government, fully, aware of this, continues to introduce bill after bill increasing this levy without assuming any responsibility for the result. Thus, costs to exporters and importers are being increased because of the increase in freight charges. It is time that the Government realized that it has to do something to control increases in freight rates if we are going to compete on world markets. Quite obviously, the introduction of this bill was instrumental in bringing about the 5 per cent, increase in freight rates which the Conference Lines demanded. As I shall presently show, there should have been a decrease in freight rates, but there has been an increase, and the levy is to go up to 3s. 4d. per man-hour. When will the Government realize that there has to be a new approach to this question? The employees of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority are public servants performing a public service in controlling the mobility of labour. No other section of industry is changed with the maintenance of a government department and its employees. The previous Minister for Labour and National Service, when introducing legislation to increase the stevedoring industry charge, said that one of the reasons for the increase was to pay superannuation to the authority's staff. Why should the industry be inflicted with these continuous rises which are affecting all Australia as the ninth greatest trading nation in the world? This Government is continually burdening tbe exporter and the importer by its practice of increasing the levy which was introduced in 1947. It is time that the Government decided to subsidize the administration by the authority, to reduce the levy, and so to bring down freight rates. I have here figures from the Stevedoring Industry Authority's reports. Australian waterside workers completed 40,358,012 man-hours. worked 10,088,794 fewer than in 1955. Cargo handled in 1955 amounted to 24,919,000 tons; in 1961 it increased to 27,886,000 tons. The number of men employed in 1955 was 24,927; to-day the number is 21,589. In 1955 working visits of vessels to this country carrying out cargo to all ports of the world numbered 11,375. In 1961 they numbered 13,043. What is the reason for this phenomenon? Men on the waterfront worked 10,000,000 fewer man-hours and there were 4,400 fewer men. But they handled 2,967,000 tons more cargo! They handled 1,668 more visits by vessels! And what has been the result? Freights have gone up! In November, 1958, the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" published a report on freights as follows:Improved turn-round of ships in Australian ports the heading "" Shipping Lines to Seek Big was helping to keep down overseas freight rates, Freight Increase"", readingthe Managing-Director of the P. and O. Company, Mr A. J. N. Crichton, said to-day. He said no increases in freight rates or passenger rates were Shipping Conference are expected to press for likely in the near future. "" We are very much encouraged by the better They are asking for a mere 13 per cent, turn-round of ships in Australian ports which is helping to keep our costs down"", Mr Crichton increase! In 1956, Mr Justice Ashburner said. In March, 1959, the ""Daily Telegraph"" the average gang on a ship from 21 men published the following report:The Graziers' Association of New South Wales maintained is shown by the 3,000,000 tons yesterday called for a Royal Commission into increase in cargo handled in 10,000,000 shipping freights.

It was noted by the Graziers' saving, even on wages alone, of at least Association that increased freights imposed in 1953, 1955 and 1957 amounted to a total increase of 14 per cent, and that the annual freight bill of more than £100,000,000 was of 1956, which could easily work out at the largest single item in Australia's balance £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 a year.

The Melbourne "" A g e "" of 18th July, 1959, contained a heading "" Freight Costs Losing Markets "". That is exactly what is happening. If the Government continues with this stupid attitude of increasing the levy on shipping, which is passed on to our industries, we shall price ourselves out of overseas markets. There must be a realization of that fact. In July, 1959, the president of the Wheat and Wool Growers Association complained about this position. On 3rd October, 1959, exactly nine months after Mr Crichton had said that there would be no trouble at all, the MelRepresentatives of the Australian-European substantial increases in shipping freights . . . issued an interim award reducing the size of to fifteen men, and the employers expected the volume of cargo handled to remain unaltered. That the volume has been fewer man-hours. Working on a conserva£400 in respect of each vessel as a result of the introduction of the Ashburner award enjoyed that nice increase from 1956 to 1959, members of the Conference line now How foolish are the Australian people In the "" A g e "" of 6th September, 1961, are charging so much. Going down to the wharfs, one finds that many of the line's vessels are manned by Indian and Lascar crews, and that there has not been a variation in their wages for many, many years. The ships are mainly old ships, but there are some new ones, and we know that under the formula we have paid for these. We ask ourselves where this increase is going. Honourable members opposite say that high wages in Australia are pricing us out of competition and that we cannot run an overseas shipping line because of the high wages payable to Australian crews. Looking at the Melbourne "" Age"" of 12th May, 1959, we read that lower freight rates are to be charged in respect of the Strait ships of the Australian National Line. The report readsAnnouncing this yesterday, the Chairman of the Australian National Line (Capt. J. T. Williams) said ment consider that there should be an the basis of fixing freights for the service would be radically different from that for orthodox tonnage. In the same month we read that coal shipment rates were down. A report on 30th May, 1959, statedThe Minister for Shipping and Transport, Senator Paltridge, to-night announced that following an examination of the various coal trades, thc Australian National Line bad been able to reduce coal freights. The new cuts will apply from June and range from 2s. to 7s. 6d. per ton. Over the years ships of the Australian National Line have been operating with the leavings of cargos of other shipping companies and with Australian crews who, according to honourable members opposite, are too expensive, yet this line has been able to reduce freights while the rates of the Conference line are increasing. to bulk handling. Mr O'BRIEN I was coming to the bulk handling question, which is important. What provision will be made by means of this levy for waterside workers displaced as a result of mechanization? Is there to be some provision for transferring tbem to other jobs? Is there to be any mechanization fund or any care for waterside workers? Diving out of the alley and getting back to the subject-ove r the years we have found that the Government has not provided the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority with sufficient money to give effect to the provisions of the principal act, which was Act No. 53 of 1956. It has not ensured that the authority has in hand sufficient funds to improve amenities and facilities on the waterfront. One of the main purposes of the legislation was to assist waterside workers and to make the industry less turbulent. That has been repeated in this House on dozens of occasions. Section 17 (j) of the act states that one of the functions of the authority ;s to provide, or assist in providing, medical attendance, canteens, cafeterias and dining rooms. For many years now the authority, after paying for its administration and for various provisions ordered by the Arbitration Court, has been left with insufficient funds to provide amenities in this industry. The Minister has stated that of the lOd. increase, 9d. is for annual leave and I d . for attendance money purposes. Does not the Governaccumulation of funds sufficient to pro«ide amenities for waterside workers, which are deplorably lacking in many ports? Is the authority to continue to provide a medical centre in only one port and only inadequate first-aid facilities in nearly half the ports of Australia? Does the Government say that there will be an increase in work on the waterfront and in the number of man-hours worked, which will thus provide a surplus of funds? The question in my mind is whether the Government has given any consideration at all to the cost of long-service leave. Is another levy to be introduced? We know that in 1963-64 the main bulk of the men will commence to go on long-service leave and that the cost could be as much as That is due £600,000 a year. Will there be another levy, another burden on the industry to be passed on to the exporters, or will there be some other, new method? I am sure that a new government, wh'ch will introduce a new method, will be in power. For many years now the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has been charged with the responsibility of introducing methods to facilitate and expedite stevedoring operations. It has under its control at the present time an inspectorial staff, but that staff has not been given sufficient power under the act to improve the efficiency of the industry. Further, the authority has not sufficient money, nor has it the power, to send ita",48,Stevedoring Industry Charge Circumstances It Is The Responsibility Of The

We must presume that a good deal of the revenue from this levy will be used to make long service leave payments. As everybody knows, a tremendous number of anomalies arise under the long service leave legislation. called upon to reconsider this stevedoring For instance, at the port of Melbourne there are certain coal workers who, because of a technicality, are deemed to have commenced service in 19S3, for long service leave purposes. In actual fact, those coal workers were being picked up in the Melbourne bureau and were registered with the authority as far back as 1942, but, because they did not come directly under the control of the authority, their years of service prior to 1953 are not taken into consideration when calculating long service leave entitlement. I know that 1,205,000 tons of coal were handled in the port of Melbourne in 1953. Looking over the figures for the years from 1952 back to 1947, I find that the average tonnage handled each year in that period was approximately the same as that handled in 1953. Somebody must have handled that coal in the years between 1947 and 1952, but the long service leave legislation does not cover those who handled it during that period. In 1951, a pensioner roster was set up ment by the stevedoring companies for the for the veterans at Melbourne. It was a service of providing the labour. roster covering men who worked on the wharfs where cargo was received. The term "" pensioner roster "" was just as much -Order! The honourable member's time a misnomer in those days as it is to-day. has expired. The men covered by that roster are denied long service leave privileges. Certain men at Rockhampton are being denied long see a very big change in the attitude adopted service leave rights. Again, waterside by the Opposition when it is proposed to workers who enlisted in 1939 and 1940 and amend the Stevedoring Industry Act with a returned in 1945 and 1946I know of at view to increasing the stevedoring industry least 300 of them in Brisbane-ar e being charge by an amount made necessary denied continuity of service for long service because of the introduction last year of the leave purposes, although workers in other long-service leave legislation.

Not only did by at least one-third. In those circumstances, we must expect to see introduced into this Parliament before very long another stevedoring industry bill, designed to impose a further loading on the export industries of this country. It is time this Government gave consideration to subsidizing the administration of the Stevedoring Industry Authority, in order to permit our goods to be sent overseas at reasonable freight charges. It is time the Government was industry levy and to adopt Labour's policy, under which the Commonwealth would accept responsibility for the administrative costs and the payment of the employees of the authority who operate the bureaus which facilitate mobility of labour. The honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) asked for suggestions for controlling turbulence in the stevedoring industry. One suggestion I have to offer is that, perhaps, under the terms of the Constitution, the Commonwealth could enter into an agreement with the States under which tbe Commonwealth would control the employment of waterside workers, who would be employees of an Australian authority. These employees could then be divided into gangs, working under regular foremen and supervisors. The gangs would be hired out to the stevedoring companies which control the stevedoring of ships. These companies would be chargedsomething in excess of the wages payable to the waterside workers, this excess being regarded as paythey oppose it, but they recruited bus loads",53,Storm On Overseas Freights

159,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson) [9.46],"W eof waterside workers from nearby coastal ports to come to Canberra and make a show of their opposition to it. Unfortunately for them, that legislation has proved so successful that on this occasion the only way in which they can make even a pretence of opposing the measure is to misrepresent the facts completely. As the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) pointed out, the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr likely reason for the increase is the drop in E. James Harrison) completely misrepresented the average wage earned by waterside workers in Queensland. The honourable member for Blaxland lumped B class ports together with A class ports. I have said before, and it will bear repeating now, that Queensland has a number of B class ports, at which work is subject to rises and falls in primary production. Unlike the major southern ports, the Queensland ports have no established industry, because that State suffered 40 years of misrule by a Labour government. Now honourable members opposite are endeavouring to use those facts against us. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr O'Brien) followed the same line of misrepresentation as did the honourable member for Blaxland. The honourable member for Petrie claimed that the honourable member for Bruce had said that the average wage earned by the waterside workers was £30 a week. The honourable member for Bruce said definitely that £30 was the rate for Sydney and Melbourne. There can be no mistake about that. Then the honourable member for Petrie went on to say that the stevedoring industry is meeting the cost of this tremendous increase to 3s. 4d. a man-hour. When introducing the bill, the Minister for Labour and The fact is that the increase of lOd. proposed is only Id. more than the average levy which employers had previously imposed on themselves to meet the cost of annual leave. The remaining Id. represents the net increased costs and potential little bearing on increased efficiency on the costs attributable to the other factors already mentioned. That obviously blows out the suggestion by the honourable member for Petrie that this proposal represents a sudden imposition on the industry. Another suggestion made by the honourable member was that this levy has meant gested that we could do better with our an increase of 5 per cent, in the freights national shipping line, and referred to charged by the conference lines. That was a very interesting point. If we disregarded other considerations, we might be tempted to accept that argument, but I point out that the Australian ports constitute only one end of the service. The ships travel betweentwo countries. Yet the increase at this end is said to be responsible for increasing freight rates. I think the more the export trade between Great Britain and Europe and ourselves. After all, to ensure an efficient and profitable shipping service it is necessary to have cargoes each way, and there has been a considerable falling off in our exports to Great Britain. In the seven months ended December last our exports to Great Britain were valued at £119,000,000, by comparison with £147,000,000 worth of exports in the previous seven months. Obviously, that is a tremendous change. For another thing, the balance-sheets of the overseas shipping companies show a great decline in their profitsa tremendous drop in their profits. a shareholder. Of course, it is very easy to make this sort of claim. [Quorum formed.] Perhaps the reason for the lack of interest shown by the Opposition in this debate is that the previous speaker virtually cleared the House. He emphasized the fact that there has been a considerable increase in tonnage handled on the waterfront with relatively fewer manhours being worked, but he did not take into consideration the tremendous increase in bulk cargoes, which have had a great influence on this apparent increased efficiency of manual labour on the waterfront. The honourable member for Blaxland said that modern machines had very waterfront. I have no doubt that he would suggest that the old pick and shovel are as efficient as endloaders, bulldozers, scrapers and other modern equipment. This is the sort of reasoning that honourable members apply to this measure. The honourable member for Petrie sug-",54,Storm On Overseas Freights

The honourable member has not suggested that any general cargo rates are being reduced and the reductions that he mentioned apply to the handling of coal, wheat and sugar. The bulk handling of all these cargoes has been made necessary because of inefficiency on the waterfront. I can recall as, no doubt, can the honourable member for Petrie, the great interruptions, industrial disputes and turbulence in the port of Mackay in Queensland where a few years ago 300 watersiders were employed. To-day, with bulk handling of sugar, only 28 men are at work in that port. That change has been brought about by the turbulence and industrial lawlessness to which the honourable member referred. We are one of the great trading nations of the But the honourable member for Bruce said world, despite our population of only 10,000,000, and trade, particularly in our export industries, is vital to us.

As the Minisas shown by the figures that I have quoted. ter for Labour and National Service has said, it amounts only to an increased charge of Id. for each man-hour, and it has been caused by increases in the basic wage, margins and so on.

It has been suggested that there is bitterness among waterside workers and that they have been forced into this industry. I should say that if there were any such bitterness an Australian Labour Party man would not have been elected secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. There would have been a Communist in the position. That would have been an indication of bitterness. The fact is that a Labour man succeeded the Communist, Australian Labour Party, as has been made quite clear. The honourable member for Petrie referred with pride to the duys of long ago when splendid work was done on the waterfront under a Labour government. on one occasion that the 20,000 waterside employees out of a total work force of cent, of the man-hours lost in this country.

When you find that one charge alone in this levy amounts to more than £1,000,000, it is evident that the impost could not be absorbed in any other way. One would expect that at least some members of the Australian Country Party would have considered the fact that the country people-the primary producersmeet this charge. Primary products form a large percentage of Australia's exports, and an increase in freight as a result of the charge we are considering could be vital when we are selling our produce in Europe. A few pence can price Australian products off the European market. This is most important to our primary producers, particularly at a time when they are likely to be the victims of arrangements made through the European Common Market.

In one year, it had only 1 per cent, to pay this levy. The shipping company of bad debts and so it made a profit out collects the money from those who export of bad debts. We have been told that these charges They have to carry the impost while suffering are not always made and that there have a disability wherever their products are been occasions when they have been lifted marketed. Very often the charge, or even because the accumulated fund has warranted such action. What happened? If the original charge was put into freight rates and at some stage we did not collect the levy, the shipping companies virtually put it into their pockets. There can be no other inference. That is not misrepresentation. Has any move ever been made by the Government to have freight rates adjusted when the levy was not in effect? If that had been done even for a short period of years, we might have expanded our markets in Europe for primary products; but the opportunity has been missed. Speaking of misrepresentation, it has been said that at times the waterside workers have received attendance money for longer periods than they received wages. The port of Gladstone was quoted in that connection. That is misrepresentation. The honourable member concerned did not explain that attendance money is We might have expected some consideraproduce. The companies can pass on the charge, but the farmers cannot do that. an amount which was not levied, is included in the freight rates and is carried forward into the prices of goods at the other end of the world. As a result, our producers have been priced out of markets unjustly. These are matters that we could reasonably expect members of the Country Party to consider. Speaking of the prosperity of the waterside workers, we have to remember that mechanization does not profit the waterside workers. In Gladstone, the number of persons employed on the waterfront fell in the three years between 1958 and 1961 from 97 to 77. The numbers employed at Rockhampton fell from 268 to 206 and in Bowen from 164 to 64. In Mackay the number has fallen from 132 to 95. The honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) said that in his opinion no group of workers enjoyed better conditions than did waterside workers. But I know of no workers who have less security in their jobs. That is something that must be considered. The average person earning a living has continuous access to his job. That is as it should be. A man's job should give him an income for 52 weeks in the year, including annual holidays, but waterside workers do not enjoy that privilege. As I have reminded the House, waterside workers in Gladstone get nine hours' work a week. When a port is classified as a B port the waterside workers may register for unemployment benefit and obtain work of a temporary nature. But, as I have already told fibe House, they must leave their temporary fobs and return to the waterfront if called ""upon to do so. Then, if work again -becomes unavailable, they must wait two weeks before being eligible to receive social service payments. The things that are financed by the levy are things to which the waterside worker . is entitled because of the nature of his work. Mallee supports the Government, which It may be taken for granted that the Arbitration Commission would not have granted those conditions of employment to waterside workers if they had not been warranted. Honourable members opposite have 'been careful to point out that the commission is an independent body whicb carefully considers evidence and grants conditions that it thinks are justified. I agree with that point of view. Therefore, it must be accepted that waterside workers have been given no more than they are entitled to receive. To argue to the contrary would be to argue that the arbitration system is not functioning properly. We cannot have it both ways. If we take it for granted that the waterside workers are entitled to the conditions laid down by the commission, we must have regard to the amount of work that is available to them and to the effect that this levy will have. Honourable members opposite have asked what we would substitute for the levy. I suggest that a different method of applying the levy could be deviseda method that would equate it fairly with the tonnage that passes across the wharfs and not only that portion that is bandied by waterside workers, which is a shrinking percentage of the total tonnage. on to the primary producer whichever way you do it. only alternative.

The honourable member for Mallee should cease interjecting. chamber do not claim that the waterside workers should not receive the amenities paid for by the levy but we claim that the levy is wrongly imposed. The levy is based on man-hours. Man-hours on the waterfront are diminishing. I have already referred to the handling of sugar. Originally sugar was handled by men, but it is now handled mechanically and no levy is paid to the authority in respect of it, but the shipping companies still make a charge to cover what would be the cost of the levy if it were applied. The levy has not been reduced even in circumstances where it is no longer applied. The Government should inquire into matters such as that without seeking to increase the levy. The Government should also have regard to the fact that the authority is in effect a government instrumentality and should be financed as any other government department is financed. The cost of its operations should not be applied to a section of the community that is no longer able to carry this burden. Those are some of the criticisms that we on this side of the House offer to this bill. We earnestly suggest that the Government endeavour to apply this charge on a more just basis. The country will then be that much better off. support the bill, which has as its purpose the increasing of the rate of the stevedoring industry charge from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 4d. a man-hour. The Minister for Labour and doubt in his second-reading speech about the intention of the bill. He saidAs to annual leave payments by the authority, it was recognized from the outset that the stevedoring industry charge would have to be increased to finance these payments to replace the self-imposed levy of the employers. However, it has been possible to delay this step to date because the employers handed over to the authority their Annual Leave Trust Fund of some £1,200,000 and because of the authority's earlier strong reserves from which payments for annual leave have been met since the trust fund was exhausted. What the Minister meant was that if the shipowners had not set aside an amount of money that was derived from a selfimposed levy at an average rate of 9d. a manhour, the Stevedoring Industry Authority levy would have had to be increased much earlier than this date. The implementation of the levy as a statutory charge has been delayed because of the amount of money that was accrued by shipowners for annual leave purposes. Honourable members opposite have used this debate as a medium to disperse throughout Australia the type of propaganda that the Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers' Federation wish to be dispersed. The Opposition claims that it has no association whatever with the Communist Party, but honourable members opposite have been spreading Communist propaganda. The attacks that Opposition speakers have made on the bill, and, through the bill, on the Government, are in line with the attacks that Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have made over the years on constitutional authority, to which they are naturally opposed. Opposition members become emotional when they speak of waterside workers. I want to make it abundantly clear that I have the highest esteem for the waterside worker as a man. He is loyal to his country and wants to do a good job for the wage he is paid. He does not purposely try to take advantage of his employer. But unfortunately the waterside worker does not control his own destiny. He is told what to do by the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, which is a very militant union. Let me get back to logic and away from the emotionalism of Opposition members. We must consider the purpose of the increased levy. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, at page 92 of its report for the year ended 30th June, 1961, sets out clearly the reason for the increased levy.

Additional payments were made for sick leave and long-service leave, which is now becoming a substantial item in the accounts of the authority. The authority is, in effect, called on to establish a larger fund out of which commitments to waterside workers can be paid, including benefits granted to the waterside workers by the court, the authority and, particularly, the Government. "" The honourable member for Petrie( Mr transfer in this way. When they so desire O'Brien) attacked the Government for increasing the levy. He contended that this will lead to an increase of freight rates. He stated quite boldly that already overseas freight rates had been increased by 5 per cent. Obviously, he has not taken the ..trouble to ascertain the facts. The Australian Overseas Transport Association, on which overseas shipowners and various export organizations are represented, has agreed that an increase of 5 per cent, can be applied during the next two years, should this become necessary.

In what other field of employment can a man transfer to the same type of work in some other place if he is dismissed from his present employment? None! From that point of view, the waterside worker has very definite security. His union has a monopoly of the work and he may transfer to any port he chooses. Men do in fact and their economic position is sound, they transfer perhaps from Brisbane to Hobart and make a holiday of it. of direction of labour. These men can elect to go to any place that meets their convenience. No direction of labour is involved. The honourable member for Capricornia suggested that conditions of employment are not very good and that the waterside worker is at a disadvantage when compared with employees in other industries. Of course, that suggestion is not correct. The waterworker is particularly good. Through his union, he has obtained many benefits from the court, and he has rightly grasped these benefits with both hands. Frankly, I like to see the waterside worker succeed enough for him to abide by our constitutional laws.

The Supply and Development Act is designed to meet the requirements of the munitions factories and other defence establishments operated by the Department of Supply and all wages staff employed therein are subject to the provisions of that act and to the relevant industrial awards. Although there is no provision in the act to permit the appointment of permanent staff, there is no limitation to the term of employment of wages personnel, who enjoy similar long service leave, recreation leave, sick leave and emergency leave to permanent officers under the Public Service Act. They may also be granted benefits under the Superannuation Act after the completion of three years' service. Telephone Services. Mr Allan Fraser asked the Postmaster General, upon notice1.

If there is.no plan to restore. Sunday service or to establish a rural automatic exchange at Dalgety, why is it that a busy wool-growing area cannot obtain the service which is given to a purely seasonal pleasure resort? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. Continuous telephone service is justified at Dalgety but the non-official postmaster is not prepared to provide service from 9 a.m. to midnight on Sundays. However, he is rarely absent and will give service on urgent calls. Tn addition, a multi-coin public telephone at the Dalgety Post Office is connected direct to Cooma when the Dalgety exchange is not attended. 2. No. 3. Preliminary planning work is at present being carried out so that firm proposals may be prepared for the installation of automatic exchanges at Dalgety and other places in the district.

As all television companies work on a free licence issued to them by the Government, does the Government agree that this is a very handsome profit? 5. Do these television stations pour out every night outrageously low-grade overseas programmes which are screened not once but sometimes repeated four or five times? 6. In these circumstances is the viewing public getting a fair deal? 7. If not, will he instruct the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to require these programmes to be preceded by such notices as "" This film is 21 years old, therefore is an adult Western "", "" This film has been repeated three times on this programme. If you miss it this time, tune in again next week"", or "" This is not an Australian film and has provided no employment for out-of-work Australian actors, actresses, script writers, cameramen and technicians ""? honourable member's questions are as follows:1, 2, 3, 4.

193,Mr Davidson,"The answers to themy practice, nor has it been the practice of former Postmasters-General to disclose or comment publicly upon the financial results of a particular station or group of stations as disclosed by the information which they forward for the purposes of the act. The stations do not operate on a free licence. Licensees of commercial television stations pay an annual licence fee of £100 plus 1 per cent, of gross earnings from the televising of advertisements or other matter in accordance with the requirements of the Broadcasting and Television Stations Licence Fees Act 1936. 5. The honourable member's remarks about television programmes do not reflect the general opinion having regard to the evergrowing popularity of the services as emphasized by the increasing number of viewers' licences which are being taken out. There is naturally room for improvement in programmes in some directions, but the great progress made over the past five years is being maintained. Opportunities for Australians in television programmes have increased. Sugar. Mr Harding asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1.
