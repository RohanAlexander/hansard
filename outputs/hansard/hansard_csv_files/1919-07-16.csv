0,"#3ouse Of Sslepresematibes. Wednesday, 16 July, 1919. Took The Chair At 3 P.m., And Read; Prayers. Mt. Groom (Darling Downs","Minister for Works and Railways and Acting: Attorney-General) [8.1] -(B y leave.)In reaffirming the attitude of the Government in relation to the present disastrous strike, it is both desirable and necessary that the circumstances surrounding it be clearly set out. Moved by the experience of many disastrous strikes, the -community decided, and has repeatedly endorsed its decision,, to adopt arbitration as the means f o i the orderly settlement of industrial disputes. That .decision is embodied in thelaw of the country, and the necessary legal machinery has been created to give effect, to it. That machinery ia available to the members of the Seamen's Union, yet they not only decline to avail themselves of such means of obtaining consideration of their claims, but have openly declared that they will not proceed by the orderly and regular method's of arbitration, but intend instead to enforce their decisions by paralyzing the-'industries of the country. They seek to win, not through the* merits of their case, but from the suffering they hope to inflict. They no longer disguise either their objects or their methods, both of which constitute onopen challenge alike to the law and the community. From the . inception of the strike the Government has worked with but one object. It has taken every stepthat offered any prospect of leading to a peaceful settlement of the dispute short of an ignominious surrender to the demand that direct action should be permitted to triumph over arbitration, the law, and the established institutions of the community. In the hope that the good",21,Setup
1,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson);,"sense of tie majority of the men would ultimately reject the sinister advice of their leaders, and that the growing manifestations of publio disapproval would convince them of the folly of continuing to follow that advice, the Government has, with great patience, Tefrained from any action at all likely to complicate or extend the struggle, or to embitter the minds of those who have created it. After the Court had been openly flouted the Government took the action which again enabled the men, without any loss of dignity or prejudice to their case, to again obtain a hearing. But again they made it clear that they were defiantly determined to enforce bheir claims by war upon the community rather than submit them to the adjudication of the Court. The Government ia now, as it always has been, willing to further any proposal making for the proper and orderly settlement of the dispute, but it cannot, and will not, yield bo the methods of direct action, or the revolutionary threats of those advocating that policy. The present position cannot be allowed to continue; caused great industrial dislocation, with the accompanying widespread privation to 'thousands of innocent people, and serious material loss to the country. Those grave oan sequences will intensify with every day's, prolongation of the struggle, which, if allowed to proceed, would ultimately strangle all industrial activity, and with it the people's means of subsistence. The Government realizes fully its duty in the present trying conditions, and is not assisted in its discharge by the advice of ill-informed critics. It is, however, in possession of information indicating that steps are 'being taken to secure a .peaceful solution of the ipreseat distressful problem. It does not intend to jeopardize this movement, but, on the 'contrary, will do everything in its power to help it to a successful issue. Tihe Government is not without hope that this movement will succeed, but, should it unfortunately fail, it will bake all steps necessary to secure the restoration of industry to normal conditions. Mr Qroom. The Government desires at this critical juncture to make a final appeal to the men imanedia'tely concerned to, even now, present their claims to the -proper tribunal rather th'an to continue to wage^ wiar upon the entire community and the forces of constituted authority. The Government presses this appeal with all sincerity and all earnestness, and it asks .the co-operation of all the leaders of organized Labour, who aire in a position .peculiarly fitting them to influence the decision of the Seamen's Union. It will do what it can to overcome any difficulties whioh may appear toexist in the acceptance of this appeal. leave) I regret exceedingly tnat the Government have seen fit to come down to-day with the statement just read by the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) without acquainting mo, or, so far as J know, any honourable member of our party, of their intention to do so. We have been told in the press, and by honorablo members on the Ministerial ride of the House, that honourable members Already the strike has on this side are. in a measure, at all events, responsible for -the unfortunate industrial dispute that at present exists, so that we might at least have been advised through the Government Whip that it was .proposed to make such an announcement. I do not know whether the explanation is that the decision to refer to the matter in the House was arrived at by the Cabinet only a few minutes ago; but I presume 'that it was decided upon yesterday, and if that is so, I should have Ibeen advised. Regarding the dispute itself, I certainly share the hope of the Government that a .peaceful solution of it will soon be found. It is fairly well known that a fortnight before the strike actually occurred I took the secretary and the vicepresident of the Seamen's Union to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt), who, with Rear-Admiral Clarkson, discussed the matter with us for an hour and a quarter. I certainly did my best to bring about a peaceful solution of the trouble, before it started, but I do not think ' that the action of the Government in bringing down this",21,Seamen S Strike Attitude Op The Government
2,Mr Ttjdor (Yarra) [3.6],"(B ystatement to-day will assist to that end. My desire has been from the outset to deal with Che question in a way that will not widen the dispute in any shape or form. Before the strike actually took place I did my utmost to avert it, and now'that it has occurred I am anxious to do everything possible to bring about a peaceful solution. I do not know what is ihe motive of the Government in submitting this statement, in which there is a .reference to "" ill-informed critics."" The critics referred to are probably the newspapers that usually support the Government, but which are'denouncing them at the present time for tlieir attitude in le1 r rard to the strike. I certainly hope that Ministers are in receipt of information that we do not possess as to a satisfactory settlement of the difficulty, and that we shall have an early end to the struggle. If we 'have an opportunity to discuss the merits or demerits of the dispute, I shall be prepared, as the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) has said, to put .the case of the workers, and to show that they, at all events, have not been to blame in respect of the requests they have"" preferred to the ship-owneTS. -Are the Government aware that the seamen are willing to come to an immediate agreement on three points, namely-(1 ) a six-hour day in port; (2) insurance; and (3) increase of wages; and to submit all other points to the judgment of some tribunal? Are the Government aware that the only man in this country who objects to accepting those points is the representative of the Government? Are the Government aware that. the shipping managers are willing to settle the dispute at once on those points? Johnson) -Order! The honourable member appears to be endeavouring to impart information instead of seeking it. ment instruct their representative to take up a less dictatorial attitude towards the 3eamen, and to open up negotiations with a view to an. immediate settlement? ter of Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [3.12] -The Government are well aware of the facts in dispute between the two parties, and of the attitude they should adopt. That attitude has been already indicated. Admiral Clarkson is not an obstacle to the settlement in the way suggested by the honourable member. He is a courageous oflicer, who is impartially doing his duty in the public interests, and the Government support him in the action he has taken. ister for Trade and Customs take the necessary action to arrange that the shipping space for fruit to be sent from Tasmania to Europei n the coming season shall be controlled by the' co-operative growers ? take steps at an early date, through the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, to do what is possible in the organization of the fruit-growers, and we shall consider whether, as a result of that organization, something can be done in the direction indicated by the honourable member. for the Navy still a member of the Public Accounts Committee? If not, when did he resign? my appointment to the position I now hold, I sent to the Prime Minister's Department my resignation as a member of the Public Accounts Committee.

26,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Mintbe meantime, tbe question of adjourning over Friday may be considered. most anxious to know what the Government propose to do about meeting on Friday. I do not object to meeting at 11 o'clock to-morrow if we are told at what hour we are to adjourn to-morrow. If we meet at 11 o'clock, and sit until the usual hour of rising, it will mean only two hours' extra sitting, and my parliamentary experience does not lead me to the belief that extra sitting time means more business done. We might sit the whole clock round and not do as much as we would do at another, time in a couple of hours. The Minister said something about the motion 'being necessary in view of the lighting restrictions. ment of the train and tram services. that we shall not continue sitting after the trams stgp running? if we can, night sittings. ideaa real daylight saving. members' opposite worrying about this? question was raised by honourable members from other States, who mentioned the matter to me, with a desire to know what the intentions of the Government were. In a number of the. States, the Peace celebrations begin on the Friday afternoon, particularly in the case of the school children. Isi t the idea of the Government that the House shall rise in time for honourable members to catch their last trams home? I welcome the suggestion that we are to have day sittings. Politics is a serious business, which, like any other business, should be conducted in the day-time; and then we would not have the fool game of Parliament being carried on as it has benn since the war commenced. T hope ib is the intention of the Govermnent that every child who may be hungry on Saturday shall have at least a warm meal, as suggested in to-day's Argus by a l'idy, Mrs. Woolcott, OBE., whose ietter I commend to the consideration of the Leader of the House. I do not blame the honourable gentleman at all, but this is a matter deserving his attention, and the exercise of his well-known humanitarianfeelings. Johnson.) I think the honourable member is going beyond the motion. ter because I think an assurance of the kind I have indicated would prevent debate; and I am sure that nothing would give the readers of the Argus and the Age more pleasure than the knowledge that not a single child will go hungry at this time of joy. Question resolved in the affirmative. ister for Home and Territories inform ua as to the progress of the arrangements -for boring in the oil-fields of Papua? made with the Imperial Government about the end of January to join in the further testing of certain fields in Papua. One of the geologically examined fields is at present being tested, and three others are practically ready for testing; and we have arranged with the Imperial Government to spend about £100,000 in this work. The chief difficulty has been to get experts, but in answer to a telegram from the Commonwealth Government, we havereceived a reply from the Imperial Government,, saying that practically all the experts desired had been obtained, and would soon be sent out. The original request was for an additional geologist, an expert manager, to be appointed by the Commonwealth Government at the instance, of the Imperial Government, and nine expert drillers, and it is hoped these will soon be at work for Home and Territories inform the House as to the details of the agreement entered into with the Imperial Government, in regard to prospecting for oil in Papua, and state what return will be given to the Imperial .Government for their advance of £100,000 which they are devoting to the assistance of the Commonwealth in this matter?",24,Special Adjournment

These fields cover an extensive area, and although there may be geological indications of probable success, there is a good deal of gambling in the matter of actually putting down bores in a particular place. with the Imperial Government is that they will help us with their experts, and they have agreed to bear half of the projected expenditure of £100,000, which w ill be devoted to thoroughly testing the area. The amount may not be adequate, but . if the results justf y it , we may make a further arrangement with them to continue the work of development.

100,Mr Groom,"T h a t is so. These datesextended by the operation of the regulations. The second schedule deals -with the Active Service Moratorium Regulations, which came into operation in the first place on the 28th July, 1916. In respect of the principal money under a mortgage, payable by a member of the Forces or a female dependant of a member, the regulations provide for the postponement of the due date to a date six months after the termination of the war, or six months after the discharge or death of the member, whichever last happens. I refer honoraible members to Active Service Moratorium Regulations 3 and 4. Even if the War Precautions Act disappears, these extensions will continue under this Bill. Payments of money due in respect of the purchase of land are similarly postponed. an extension of the date in cases where payment is to be made by instalments. These regulations also protect soldiers and their female dependants from seizure of . chattels, furniture, and clothing, &c., to the value of £100, under bill of sale, distress, hire agreement, or hy other process. Protection is also afforded, except in certain cases, to members of the Forces, parents, or female dependants of members against increase in the rent of dwelling-houses, and against ejectment therefrom, and landlords, in certain cases, arerequired to allow members of the Forces, their parents, or female dependants, to rent a dwelling-house on its becoming vacant.

Regulation 7 provides for portion of the Bill with which I propose to deal is that relating to wheat. The manner in which control has been, exercised over the Wheat Pool requires a good deal of investigation. Attempts have been made in the State of New South Wales to get a Royal Commission appointed, and if the information I obtained in that State, and the rumours which are current in* Victoria, are approximately true, an investigation should certainly take place into the operation and control of the Wheat Pool in both States. I understand that it is an admitted fact that over 1,000,000 bushels of wheat has been stolen out of the Wheat Pool in New South Wales. cording to yesterday's Age. tained in Sydney was that 1,000,000 bags had disappeared, but on returning to Melbourne I was not sure whether my informant said .bags or bushels, so I referred to bushels in order to be on the safe side. Men have been already convicted for stealing some of the wheat, and. what we have to discover is, how much they stole who have not been convicted. Of course, the gigantic nature of the operations of the Wheat Pool prevents a close supervision of details, but one cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, regard the loss of 6,000,000 bushels as a detail.

108,Mr Boyd,"The information I ob-.Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -""We do things on a big scale in our State. as to astonish the people of this country. In addition to the laxity of control and supervision, certain concessions were given to Government agents in connection with the sale and shipment of these, and it was understood that only those concessionaires would he allowed to ship wheat. Then the question arose of .gristing, and the shipment of flour oversea. firms in Melbourne and Sydney desired to ship flour to Egypt, where there was a big demand. Western Australia. On behalf of the Sydney firms, I interviewed the Wheat Boardi n Melbourne, and I was told that information had come from the Old Country to the effect that certain Australian flour was being hawked around the Balkan States for sale. Whether that was correct or not I am not in a position to say, but on probing the matter I found that this flour was supposed to be from two Japanese shipments. It had been sold by certain agents to Japanese, and the two cargoes were under the charge of the firm of Messrs. Mitsui, Busan, and Kaisha Limited. This firm got certain 'agents here to purchase for them in the ordinary way of business-and I believe there was nothing wrong with the transaction-and when I asked that the principle to be adopted should be either "" a l l in or all o u t "" that British firms or Australian firms should have the same right to buy wheat, grist it into flour, and dispose of it in a British Protectorate like EgyptI was told that no further concession would be given to any person, and that' only the Wheat Pool would be allowed to export wheat. W it h that I was quite satisfied, and said that if that were the principle laid down, the firms on whose behalf I was speaking would be satisfied also. A few weeks later, when I was in New South Wales, I heard, rumours in connection with the gristing of wheat that somewhat surprised me, because, if true, they amounted to chicanery of the worse kind. which I do not propose to relate here; but I certainly urge that it is the duty of the Government to make inquiries into what has been going .on, so that the truth may be known. Another wire came to me from Sydney to say that, notwithstanding the report I had made with regard to the attitude of the Wheat Pool, the New South Wales Government, through the Ministerf o r Agriculture, had granted permission to certain indiCertain viduals to grist wheat independently of the Wheat Pool. I naturally went back to the Pool and made further inquiries. I was told that the members of the Pool were quite sure my information was And also one firm in wrong; and I said that if they would give me a guarantee that no wheat would I was not aware of that. be exported except .under the Pool my mind would be at rest. I left the matter as if it were settled; and, later on, Mr. P it t , the secretary of the Wheat Pool, rang me up to say that he found the information I had given was true, and that the Pool was taking steps to prevent the flour going out of Australia.. In this, I believe, the Pool has succeeded. WhatI wish to bring particularly before the Government is that if there is to be any concession to anybody it ought to be granted openly in free and f a i r competition. When Australian firms are prepared to do business they ought to get that business. No matter whether Japan or any other country is an All y of ours, it should not have concessions over Australian citizens who are prepared to do Australian business with Australian flour on terms equitable to the farmers and the whole people; that is a view I desire to emphasize most forcibly. AlthoughI cannot claim first hand knowledge, I understand that a certain concession is granted t'o millers, in the matter of price, with regard to the gristing of wheat into flour. But a concession was given to an exporter of wheat named Georgeson, who at that time was not a miller, but who proceeded to purchase a mill. This man, or firm, was then able to get a gristing agreement with other millers to grind wheat, which would not have been possible if he had desired to grind it for his own particular purpose, I made certain investigations, that is, for home consumption: It is",36,Commercial Activitiesbill Second Reading

I venture to say that,, under the system by which the wheat of Australia was disposed of before the war, it would have been impossible for such a condition of things to arise.

129,Mr Blakeley (Darling ) [ 4 . 3 4 ],"Ition of our various Boards and Pools, and the lack of representation of consumers and the general public, and of the employees in the various industries concerned. Personally, I believe that the pooling system is good. I regard the bulk handling by organization of any commodity or raw material, or the public management of any utility, as better than handling by private enterprise, provided the organization is equal to that of private enterprise. As I say, there is no provision for the representation on these Boards and Pools of consumers, who are just as much in terested as producers, and there is absolutely no reference whatever to the representation of those who do the work. The grower, so f a r as wool is concerned, does very little work in its production, with the exception, of course, of the small men. W it h the big man, his capital is employed, but he goes no further. On the other hand, the employee, the man who is actually engaged in producing wealth, using the owner's buildings, machinery, and capital, is just as vitally concerned as is the wool producer. Yet there is no reference in this B ill to the giving of representation on' any Board or Pool either to the consumers or to employees. This defect we shall endeavour to remedy in the Committee stage. Most of us favour the pooling system, because, after all, it is a modification of Socialism; but this B i ll makes one think that the Government are selling a gold brick. Can the Commonwealth Parliament pass this measure 1 Certain legal opinion has been quoted, with which the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) agrees, to the effect that, when the War Precautions Act has gone out of operation, the Commonwealth will have the power to control wool, wheat, cheese, butter, and sugar; but if it can control these commodities, surely it will have power over any other commodity produced in this country, or any utility used by t h e . people of this country. matter of fact, the position is that if the Government are asked to handle some other commodity or utility on behalf of the people of Australia, they say, "" We have not the power."" In the past two referendums on proposed alterations of [401] the Constitution have been held because eminent barristers have been of the opinion that the Commonwealth does not possess the requisite power to control commodities produced by the people of Australia or utilities used by them. That is why this measure is a "" gold brick. "" The Government are seeking to place it on the statute-book merely for the edification of lawyers. It is common talk that when the War Precautions A ct ceases to operate three months after the ratification of peace, the constitutionality of the measure w ill be tested by the jam manufacturers, and possibly by others. The Government know that it will be tested, and that, if the legal opinions which have been obtained for a considerable number of years past stand for anything, it must be declared ulira vires. There is an alternative if the Government would only be courageous enough to accept it , and that is not to sell a "" gold brick "" to Parliament, but to have a referendum taken immediately, and set the people's decision upon the matter. The' people's verdict could be obtained before the War Precautions Act goes out of existence. W ill Ministers adopt that course, which is sure, or will they continue to pursue that which is far from being sure? If they proceed as they are doing-enactin g a measure which, in all probability, will be found to be unconstitutional-the y are not fulfillin g their dnty either to the producers or to the consumers. I wish to say a word now in regard to the position of the Wheat Board irr New South Wales. Last week I asked*, eleven questions about certain operations: of that Board. My curiosity has evidently caused a disruption in New South Wales, and a considerable amount of uncertainty as to where some people stand. Immediately. the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) replied to my questions, Mr. Holman. the Premier of New South Wales, issued a reply, and Mr Beeby resigned from the New South Wales GoAs. a vernment. The information given in reply to my questions would have caused a Ministry to resign in the past. However, Governments do not go out of office over such matters nowadays. I elicited from the Acting Prime Minister that 72,000 tons of wheat had been sold to Japan by the, New South Wales Wheat Board for ex-. port at the rate of 4s. 4£d. per bushel. The purchaser was really a person named Georgeson, and he in turn sold it to Japan. I was also informed by the Acting Prime Minister that the Victorian Wheat Board has disposed of inferior wheat to Japanese buyers at 5s. 7£d. per bushel. The most extraordinary feature of the two sales is that the Victorian, wheat went as high as 58 lbs. per bushel, whilst the New South Wales wheat was 54 lbs. per bushel, and Victoria could get 5s. 7£d. per bushel for her inferior wheat, whereas New South Wales could get no more that 4s. 4£d. for wheat which. was not more than 4 lbs. or 5 lbs. per bushel inferior to the Victorian. cannot be beneficial to the primary producers or the people of Australia."" Por months past comimercial vultures have been hovering over the wheat of New South Wales, and great have been the gorgings. An extraordinary feature of the Georgeson contract is the secrecy about the whole matter. Despite an agitation in New South Wales, the State Wheat Board were as oysters. In fact, the Australian Wheat Board were also like oysters in regard to the transaction. Board know anything about it? formed about it. It was sueh an extraordinary piece of business that I am told that Senator Russell went post haste to New South Wales, and threatened to cancel the contract. However, he did not do so, but the Australian Wheat Board could have done it. If they had cared to exercise their functions, the contract could have been cancelled either by them or by the State Board. In my questions to the Acting Prime Minister, I asked if he would cause an investigation to be made, and appoint a Royal Commission to deal, not only with the Georgeson wheat sale, hut also with the whole of the operations of the New South Wales Board? I was told, in Teply, that it was entirely a quesing, if the primary producers cannot detion for New South Wales, and not for the Australian Wheat Board. What are the powers of that Boardi f it is not to exercise supervision over State Boards? Here is another extraordinary occurrence. A contract was entered into by the State Wheat Board, to supply 72,000 tons of inferior wheat, although at the time the Board knew that it did not have that quantity of inferior wheat on hand, and, not being in a position to supply the. quantity of inferior wheat, f.a.q. wheat had to be substituted. In other words, wheat worth 5s. 9d. per bushel is being sold for 4s. 4|d. per bushel. The State Wheat Board knew that it did not have the quantity of inferior wheat that it contracted to supply. good wicket. This been supplied with 72,000 tons-that is to say, 3,000,000 bushels of wheat-a t 4s. 4^d. per bushel, he would have made a profit of at least £100,000, but, seeing that a considerable proportion of the 72,000 tons has to be made up with wheat worth 5s. 9d. per bushel, he will make an additional profit of £100,000 or more if the contract is not cancelled. Immediately the Acting Prime Minister, replied to my questions, Mr Beeby resigned from the New South Wales Government. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -As the result of the action taken by the honourable member ? though other peoole may do so. The replies given in this House may have precipitated matters. Mr Holman's explanation was .an extraordinary one. Mr Campbell, the secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association in New South Wales, was asked his opinion of the Georgeson sale, and he said that he agreed with it. Mr Trethowan, the president of the Farmers and Settlers Association, was not approached before the sale, but he approved of it after the contract had been consummated. The president of the Farmers and Settlers Association is also a member of the State. Wheat Board, and one is justified in askpend upon the officials of that association for protection from robbery, upon whom are they to depend ?

The New South Wales Government say that they will grant a Royal Commission to deal with the Georgeson sale only; but I am not satisfied with the way in which Royal Commissions are carried out in New South Wales. The Federal Government should not take cognisance of any Commission or inquiry instituted by New South Wales. Their duty is right here, to inquire, not only into the Georgeson sale, but into other matters which I shall mention. bushels of wheat were purchased at 2s. 9d. per bushel. It was supposed to be of very inferior quality-wha t some call chick food-bu t the trouble in this transaction was that 50 per cent or more was f.a.q. wheat. One man has been sacked over the business, but more than one were concerned in that particular robbery. H a l f of the wheat alleged to be chick food, and sold at 2s.< 9d. a bushel, was worth 5s. 9d. a bushel! more than one man was responsible ? the honourable member, as a supporter of the Government, to back up my demand that a Royal Commission be appointed to investigate the truth or otherwise of the statements I am making. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Boyd) mentioned to-day that a good deal of wheat had mysteriously disappeared. We find now that when they came to supply the' Georgeson contract of 72,000 tons of inferior wheat, they had not got it . They are in such a bungle in New South Wales that for the last two and a half years a highly paid staff of accountants has been trying to find out where the 1915-1916 wheat has gone. 1915-16 Pool has not yet been completed, and never will be completed, if that is any news to honourable members, because they do not know what has become of the wheat. It has gone, to the great joy of some of the vultures in New South Wales. The loss of wheat in New South Wales alone was mentioned as 1,000,000 bags, or 3,000,000 bushels, by the honourable member for Henty. As a matter of fact, it is 6,000,000 bushels. That quantity has been lost, and. most of it has been stolen. What are the Australian Government going to do about it? Do they propose [401]2 to stand idly by, and see the New South Wales Government appoint a Royal Commission, to investigate one of the small affairs, or will they appoint a Royal Commission themselves to investigate the whole business? monwealth, because there are other States where wheat is missing. other States can come anywhere near the operation of the State Wheat Board of For instance, about 70,000 New South Wales, I . pity them. mier State so far as that is concerned. is concerned, apparently. Minister did resign; in South Australia he was kicked out. good many more will resign if a Royal Commission is appointed. The following appeared in a recent issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph:Recent developments ih connection with the It is the duty of 1916-17 stocks of wheat, as affecting the sale to Mr Georgeson, have disclosed a remarkable position. There was at the time apparently an extraordinary miscalculation of the amount of wheat remaining to the credit of that particular Pool. When this deal was first proposed the management of the State Wiheat Office submitted' a statement showing that 21,000,000 bushels had been disposed of, and it was estimated that there were 11,000,000 bushels still available for sale. It was shown that the sales to that date, which represented the pick of the stacks, had given an average return of 4s. 5d. per bushel. Mr Drummond advised the Board that he could make this sale of 3,000,000 bushels for Japan at that figure, the wheat to be the second pick of that which remained and of a standard of 54 lbs. and uncier per bushel. The local millers were to The have first pick to make up the 25 per cent, of this wheat which they were called upon to grist. The millers refused to take this wheat for the manufacture of flour for local consumption. The extraordinary fact is, however, that, instead of there having been 11,000,000 bushels of 1916-17 wheat on hand when the sale was made, it is now authoritatively stated that only 5,000,000 bushels remained. The pick of the wheat, which would have gone to the local millers had they accepted it, will, after gristson. It appears that some scraping up will be necessary to give him the amount of grain he purchased, and incidentally, it is said, ho will receive a better average sample than he bargained for.",40,Foster Th E New B I L L Depends On The War Precautions Act

At any rate, not only were the firm bound over for this or some similar offence, in the first place, in a sum of £2,500, but a second offence occurred, and now. I believe the Central Wool Committee is holding £5,000 as a bond from that firm, binding tbem to be of good behaviour, and to keep strictly to the moral path in future. The question occurs: Should that firm be allowed to continue to handle wool? Surely a representative of that firm ought not to remain on the Committee. Not only should the firm be disallowed representation on the Oommittee, but it should not be permitted to participate in the handling of the business. I wish now to deal with another phase of the activities of the New South Wales State Wool Oommittee. Honora'ble members generally have received copies of a pamphlet issued by Messrs. John Bridge and Company Limited, of Sydney, which is a most interesting publication. If one-half of the statements contained in it are true, it constitutes a grave indictment against the State Wool Committee and those who are handling wool in New South Wales. If , on the other hand, these statements are untrue, Messrs. John Bridge and Company are liable to be prosecuted for criminal libel; but evidently they are convinced as to their accuracy. This pamphlet has been circulated amongst both State and Federal members, and it deals at length with the question of dumping. It sets out that Sir E. Owen Cox, K.B.E., is chairman of the Overseas Shipping Representatives Association in New South Wales, chairman of the Overseas Central Committee of the Shipping Administration, and chairman of the Wool Administration, consisting of Messrs. Gilchrist, Watt, and Sanderson; Flood and Company Limited; Brown's Wharf Limited; Sydney Stevedoring and Wool Dumping Company Limited; Dalgety and Company Limited; Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company Limited, and the Fitzroy Stevedoring Company; Mr Alcorn McKell being the secretary. In a footnote it is stated thatIn the companies' returns at the RegistrarGeneral's Department the name of Edward Owen Cox appears as holding 1,600 shares in the Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company Limited. According to this pamphlet the Central Wool Committee had asked John Bridge and Company Limited to install a dumping plant for double-dumping bales. This request was no sooner carried out than John Bridge and Company found that they were up against the State Wool Committee. That Committee consists principally of people wh'o belong to the Wool Ring. Messrs. John Bridge and Company, I presume, do not belong to the Wool Brokers Association, and were, therefore, considered to be outside the pale, and not eligible for any benefits that might be accruing. The State Wool Committee decided that John Bridge and Company should not be allowed to dump wool, and it was only after the Central Wool Committee had given fairly curt instructions on the point that the firm was given any dumping to carry out. When wool so treated by the firm was sent on for shipmentTo the great surprise of the Central Woo! Committee, the agent of the Ellerman Line, the owners of the ship, refused to take such wool on board or to pay for the dumping of the wool, or any wool dumped by John Bridge and Company Limited. Bridge and Company were not in the Combine, and, therefore, the owners of this vessel refused to carry wool dumped by them. It is further stated in this pamphlet bhat .subsequently seven vessels were held up because of the fact that this firm had been dumping wool against the wishes of the Wool Ring. It would seem that the Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company, and certain other firms, had had in the past a monopoly of dumping operations, .and that when John Bridge and Company came in the shipping companies were induced to refuse to accept wool dumped by them. In this way produce was held up. The charge for taking the wool from Messrs. John Bridge and Company's stores to the",42,Foster Th E New B I L L Depends On The War Precautions Act

Even now the wheat-growers are not sufficiently represented. There should be two, or even three, representatives of the wheat growers of each State on the Central Board. On the Butter Board we have a chairman, deputy, chairman, and three -Government nominees,and a dairy expert; whereas, on the Central Butter Board there were two representatives of New South Wales, two of Victoria, and one each of Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. The cheese industry had one representative of New South Wales, one of Queensland, and one of Victoria. Thus the producers had eleven representatives on the Board as against four Government nominees. presentative. member think that if the consumers had been represented, butter would have been cheaper than it is to-day? member mention any other place in the world where butter is cheaper than it is in Australia? If the representatives on the Board had considered only their own interests, a great deal more of the butter would have been sent out of Australia, and local consumers would; have been paying 2s. 6d. and 3s. per l b . ; instead, the Board gauged the requirements of the home market, and the people are getting butter at a reasonable price. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) spoke eloquently of the.trials of dairy farmers in Queensland, and described a man and his wife and five children, working from early morning till late at night for a net result of £2 per week; yet some honourable members opposite would sweat those people further. They are already the worse white slaves in Australia, working fourteen and fifteen hours a day in order. to provide cheap butter for honourable members and their supporters. If the men whose cause mem, bers of the Opposition espouse were only to, work half as long and . hard as do the dairy farmers, we should have greater production and a reduced cost of living. The Central Wool Board comprises two growers, in the persons of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) and the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), both of whom were appointed before they were elected to this Parliament; three buyers, one manufacturer, and one fellmonger. They are all producers or experts in the businessthere is no Government nominee. As a result, tbere has been no complaint by the wool-growers regarding the operations of that Pool; they are all abundantly satisfied with the manner in which the wool has been handled. The Board classified the wool into 800 grades. All wool found its way into one of those grades, and the result was that every 'grower received the value of his product. Honourable members on the opposite side have said that one reason why the public have to pay so much for woollen goods is that the graziers and wool-growers have combined, more or less, for the purpose of exploiting the public. One honourable member said that so high was the price of wool in Australia that it would pay local manufacturers to buy it in London. So far from that being the case, manufacturers. obtained wool during 1916-17 at the appraised price, which was very conservative and below the flat rate. They were allowed to go to the Wool Pool, and choose . the wools they required for their own purposes at 12.59d., or nearly 3d. per lb. less than the flat rate. The graziers had to bear that loss. The actual. consumption iby Australian manufacturers in 19.17-18 was 14,318,332 lbs., which sold at an average price of 12.59d-. per lb., instead of the flat Tate of 15£d. per lb. represented. a present of £45,336 by the growers to the consumers. In addition, if that wool had been exported to England the growers would have had an . opportunity of getting 50 per cent, of any profits made by the Imperial Government on its re-sale. In the early stages of the Pool-a great deal of wool was ab-' sorbed for military purposes. I am glad to. say that the, wool-growers readily assented to every proposal made by the British Government. They said nothing",44,Foster Th E New B I L L Depends On The War Precautions Act

The Imperial Government offered the growers a price, and they accepted it . year before the war the price of wool averaged lOd. per lb. all through; since that year the manufacturers have been getting their wool for 12.59d. fore, the only increase in price which the grower received was 3d. average wool consumption for the whole of Australia at 14,318,332 lbs., the manufacturers have used 3 lbs. of wool per head of the population per annum. If the graziers have exploited anybody they have exploited the public, and the amount of that exploitation has been only 9d. per head per annum, or less than Jd. per week. Surely the grazier is entitled to some share in the increased value of his commodity. As soon as the price of wool, was fixed at 15^d. the shearers approached the Arbitration Court, and were awarded an increase in wages from 24s. to 30s. per 100, because Mr JusticeH i g enough to survive have large areas of gins said that the price of wool had been raised 55 per cent. ""We made no demur, and I mention the matter merely to show the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) where the shearers "" come in . "" I am sure we are all pleased to see the men get the increased wages. Justice Higgins should be shifted off the Bench for awarding the increase ! Justice Higgins made all kinds of impossible conditions when he practically raised the rate of wages on the various stations by something like 100 per cent. These increased wages are only made possible by the increased price of wool, and, while we like to see people well .paid, the employer must also be well paid, in order to meet the new conditions."" The general expenses of graziers have been' considerably in creased during the period of the war. Wire netting has gone up 400 per .'cent., while ordinary fencing wire has risen from £ 8 to £ 5 0 .

I am completely in favour of the GoTherevernment taking over the functions contemplated by this B ill , and controlling Taking the commodities, primary and secondary, by means of Boards. My only objection is to the constitution of the Boards and the fact that their operations do not go far enough. I do not say for a moment that the average farmer is not entitled to a good price for the commodities he produces. I know that some dairymen work very hard, and I agree that the pioneers uf the country, who have cleared the bush and made the land habitable, are entitled to all they can make by their labours. But, as has already been remarked, the pioneers, or the majority of them, are dead, and those who have been lucky country, from 600 to 1,800 acres, which they do not work themselves, but leave to others, while they live at Menzies' or the Hotel Australia. the poor, struggling farmer, cannot buy land worth £ 1 0 0 or £ 1 2 0 an acre, and has to be satisfied with the share system, by means of which he gets 8s. out of every pound's worth he produces. That is the tragedy of the dairyman, and it ought to be prevented by the Government making land available to those willing to work it , and confiscating the land of those who will not work it . dairy land in New South Wales worth that price. know of some supposed dairymen who could "" buy "" up the members oi"" the Federal Parliament. be dairying on tlie share system on such a small return as that mentioned. avenue of employment for some of them^",45,Foster Th E New B I L L Depends On The War Precautions Act

Of course, I felt somewhat annoyed under the ""circumstances, and asked the"" manufacturer why, if wool was cheaper here, he was charging as much for his cloth as for imported cloth. We had a little argument on the matter, and, of course, he talked about increased wages, and so forth , though the increased wages represent only about 15 per cent. However, the Wool Board ought to so regulate matters that when a manufacturer purchases wool at a certain price there should be a stipulation that he shall manufacture cloth at a certain price. The Pools or Boards would then serve some useful purpose. It appears there is"" no check upon what these men may charge for the articles they produce.

Sir Owen Cox has too many activities on bis hands, and I consider he should be displaced by some one who can devote more time to the Government's business. on the Central Wool Committee. are my views. TheB ill , as f a r as it goes, meets with my approval. I leave legal gentlemen to fight out among themselves the question as to whether the-Commonwealth has the power to continue the functions referred to, but if its activities? can be extended in some directions, I see no reason why they should not beextended in others It is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth Government should take f u l l control over the' primary and secondary industries of Australia at the present time, for monopolies arenow at work, and men interested in them are on the Boards controlling them. I favour the appointment of a Royal Commission to find out how the Boards have been operating, to s if t the dust from the grain, and to constitute them on a proper basis, not only to control the selling of commodities, but also to fix the prices of them within the Commonwealth. I want to know what has become of theprogramme of the Government. We understood that they were individualists,, and believed in private enterprise., b u t apparently they have become Socialists. I do not complain if they are sincere, if they mean business, if they"" propose to do the thing properly, and if this measure is not the gigantic bluff which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) believes it to be. I do not think that the B ill is constitutional, but if it is perfectly, in order from that point of view, and if the Government have abandoned their -many, activities. For, inindividualism and private enterprise, L presume they will make it more, comprehensive, and, at the same time, abandon their abuse, their misrepresentations, and their defamation of this party, which they have held up to ridicule and contempt as being the "" Socialistic tiger."" In my opinion as a layman, the B ill is unconstitutional. Having seen in the Senate half-a-dozen lawyers on one side and half-a-dozen on the other take opposite views about the Constitution, and having seen lawyers in this House at loggerheads, I consider myself justas capable of forming an opinion on the constitutional merits of this B ill as any other honourable member, and my long A t any rate, those experience in politics has given me the audacity to give expression to that opinion.

When war was declared against Germany, it was very speedily discovered -that it was necessary for this Parliament -to. pass a War Precautions Act, giving the Government absolute power to properly defend Australia. By means of 'that measure the Commonwealth Government was able to take away from the State Governments every power they possessed prior to the war. It was not a difficult matter for the Government to justify some steps it took under the power conferred by that Act, but it will be a very dimcult matter for it to justify certain other steps. The State Governments had been fixing prices, but the Oommonwealth Government took away their control in this respect, and fixed the price of meat, sugar, bread, and a host of other commodities. Some people object to the War Precautions Act because of the unfair use of it made by the Government. . It abolished free speech, trial by jury, indeed, any sort of trial; and it imprisoned men, it deported them even, without informing their relatives. A wise Ministry would have used its authority with discretion as well as with firmness, but I venture to say that the present Government have not done so, and now, after the war, it is attempting to take to itself powers which belonged to it during the war only. I think the attempt must fail the moment this measure is challenged in the Courts. Germany has ratified the Peace Treaty. It will not be very long before there is an "" exchange of ratifications."" During the war, it was a very easy matter to prove that it was necessary for the Government to have complete control of wool, in order that our soldiers might be properly clad, and so that the enemy's soldiers might be prevented from being properly clad. It was also a very easy matter to pTOve that it was necessary for the Government to take control of foodstuffs, in order that our soldiers might be fed, and so that, if possible, the soldiers of the enemy might be starved into submission. But now that Peace has been declared, who will affirm that, in the interests of Australia, it is necessary for the G overnment to control the production of wool? to control the production of wool. tribution of wool, the Government to some extent control its production. The Ministry have sought the assistance of a number of legal gentlemen. men. chell, among others. Their opinion was sought as to the competence of the Bill. I .apprehend that "" competence"" means the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. I have no wish to say anything against the ""Devil's brigade."" I have a great admiration for them. I am sorry that I am not one of them, because it must be a very fine profession, a very interesting one, and, indeed, a noble one. But I can imagine these gentlemen givingan opinion in such an off-hand way considered opinion. They devoted a great deal of time to giving it. sparing of words when they gave it. It may be the practice of lawyers to be sparing in the use of language when they are not paid for giving an opinion. I do not suggest it in this connection; but I came to the conclusion that these legal gentlemen felt themselves to be in a very great difficulty, especially Sir Edward MitchelL It is not long since this party sought to effect an alteration of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to deal effectively with trade and commerce, corporations, companies, industrial matters, combines, and monopolies, and Sir Edward Mitchell deemed it his duty as a prominent lawyer and a leading citizen-for so he has been described in this Parliament-to make a few observations about our proposals.

Referring to the proposal to amend the Constitution some years ago, he saidAs regard tlie division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States, it is possible that more questions would arise under the amended sections than remain for decision on those for which they are to be substituted.

In fact, my strongest objection to the first proposal of the referendum is based upon this extended power of legislation as to domestic trade and commerce, and is fundamental. He took exception, not only to the wide proposal that we should have power to deal with trade and commerce as a whole, but also to our dealing with any one item, and pointed out the problems that would arise if we dealt with any branch of trade and commerce. ently, he sees no objection to our dealing with wool, sheep skins, sugar, dairy, produce, and flax. but in a time of peace. honourable member says, in a time of peace. Sir Edward Mitchell's opinion goes onIf carried by the people, it would transpose a Constitution framed by the delegates of the people-the leading statesmen and lawyers of Australia at that time-afte r years of skilful care and thought, a Constitution which evoked the highest praise of British statesmen when I apprehend that he brought before the Imperial Parliament, into If he had an unscientific kind of mongrel between two entirely differing kinds of Federal Constitution, and would soon make the position of the States and of the people of Australia so intolerable under it that Unification would become a necessity. If the proposals that we put before the people in 1911 were going to make a "" m o n g r e l "" of the Constitution, what will be thought of the proposals in this B ill , which deal with only a section of the trade and commerce activities that would have been covered by our proposals? He said alsoMy deliberate opinion is that the amendments now proposed would give to the Federal Parliament powers of so wide and sweeping a character that, in the absence of any protections similar to those afforded by the Canadian Constitution, the result would be a kind of mongrel Constitution between the two systems, which would be found impracticable in working, and would naturally result in Unification as the lesser of two evils. Under the Federal Constitution-if amended as proposed-n o such restrictions would exist, so that, upon every one of the vast number of subjects coming under the term "" trade and control of the whole of the liquor traffic), the powers of the Federal Parliament would be supreme, and every law of every State passed on the same subject-matter would have to give way to it.

According to this advertisement, Jones and Company's agent was offering 7s. per case for f r u it which realized 19s. 3d. per case, and he was giving the public to understand that his firm had been given space for 10,000 cases, when the producers of Western Australia were told that there was only space for 8,000 cases available for them. I was anxious to get space for the export of grapes, but I was told that the British Government would not give a permit for the importation of anything but apples from Australia. BecentlyI received the -following letter from one of the biggest firms in PerthThe point we wish to bring under your notice is, that whilst the apple crop was extremely light, the crop of pears was exceptionally heavy, and these, without export, were ference in the metal industry. Why has sold at very low rates indeed. We, as the largest exporters, on behalf of growers, did our very utmost with the authorities to try and obtain space to ship 10,000 to 20,000 cases of pears, but were regularly advised that no space was available for either pears or grapes, without accepting any legal responsibility, and we wore unaware that space had been allotted for pears to any State in Australia until we Tead the cable referred to above. The prices mentioned are per tray, and there aro three trays to a case. Therefore, growers in the eastern States obtain from £2 3s. 6d. to £4 13s. per case. The cable referred to stated that the steamer Bakara was discharging apples and pears, and that the latter had been auctioned at Covent Garden at phenomenal prices-fro m 14s. 6d. to 25s. per tray, and some Winter Nelis pears from 28s. to 31s. My protest is this, that if pears were to be exported, every State in the Commonwealth should have been advised of the fact. One section of the community should not get favoured because the Government and Government officials are right alongside them, while the industry of another section of the community is destroyed. I do not say that there has been any dishonesty in regard to the matter, but there has certainly been incompetency. Men aro attempting to run businesses who have never done a day's commercial work, and do not understand the ramifications of huge industries. Victorian pears came from Harcourt. they came from. If Australia was to be permitted to export pears, the people of Western Australia should have been advised of the fact. Bendigo electorate. has written to me advises me that Western Australia will be able to ship from 200,000 to 250,000 cases of fruit next year. If Government control is to continue, we must see that solid business people are placed in control of these activities, and ample provision made for export. I have spoken in the House time after time in regard to the Government's interno .explanation been made in regard to the position of that industry? Why are we told that the Government must take control,, when, without any regulation, or they have placed difficulties in the way of producers who do not join a certain organization. I was speaking to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) the other day about a big copper-producing mine at Cobar, New South Wales, employing over 300 men, and, I suppose, providing employment for another 1,000 persons. They have their own smelter, and their own electrolytic plant. They are able to sell in the markets of the world; but for the last twelve months they have been unable to secure an answer from the Grovernment to.their request to dispose of their product.

They are prepared to start work to-morrow if the Government w ill tell them that-they can sell their product free of Combine control. They want to sell it only in approved markets, but the Government will not give them a permit to carry on unless their business is done through the Copper Producers Association, which means that they must hand over to that association the absolute control of their property for the next fifty years. Western Australia, are differently situated from the producers on this side. We are producing base metals only on a very small scale, but many of our mining ventures may grow into very big concerns if there is some freedom in connection with the disposal of their products. We are producing now t in , copper, and lead. I told honourable members the last time. I spoke, of three men who made a marvellously rich discovery of lead at Ajana, 100 miles north of Geraidton. produced over £70,000 worth of lead out of a little pocket in two years, and the only profit they got out of it was less than£4,000. Under the wretched regulations it 'all went into the hands of the people who have got control. I have a letter here fro m a t in producerin Western' Australia. These people were compelled to send their t in oxides over here for treatment. They applied for a permit to sell, and there was such a delay in the Prime Minister's Department in giving that permit that the market dropped over £6 0 per ton, and they in curred a loss of that amount. Here is a further instance of Government interference. The letter beginsSome weeks ago we had some tin concentrates ready to ship, and had received the .permission of Mr Poynton to ship. It was sold in Liverpool subject to shipping being available. JKfr. Gregory. I am not complaining of the ActingM in ister for the Navy( Mr Poynton). I have been too pleased with his workA few days afterwards, Mr Watt, the Acting Prime Minister, refused to allow it to be shipped on the ground that it was against the policy of the Pederal Government to ship ores out of Australia, and that they must be smelted in the Commonwealth. That means that we have to send that t in ore from Western Australia to Sydney to have it smelted, and then dispose of it , I suppose, in the best way possible. The Government have been pursuing "" that policy in regard to lead and copper right away up in the north-west of Western Australia. The Whim Creek Company have been compelled to ship, their ore round to Port Kembla. They sent 11 per cent, ore, with copper worth over £100 per ton, and the cost of shipping, handling, and realization charges at PortI t is scandalous i We, in Kembla brought, in the treatment of that ore, a dead loss. Even though it produced ore worth over £ 1 1 a ton, that mine has been closed down, and several hundred men have been thrown out of employment, owing to the conditions imposed by the Government, and their in sistence upon these metals being treated within Australia. They policy. I do not believe even the greatest fool of a Protectionist would urge that actions of that sort were beneficial to Australia. able member rather have the ore smelted in Japan? yes, if by that means we were able to have a big mine, in f u l l working order, employing thousands of men. Tf we cannot get white men up there, we shall soon be driven out of that part of the country. I suppose the honourable member would prefer that the mine should be closed down ? The letter relating to t in export continuesThis blocked the sale.

If the Government are maintaining control over this industry, why do they not include it in this B ill ? Why do they not make it clear that they are controlling mining, and let the public know what manner of control it is ? If we want this country to produce, surely the Government, if they intend to carry on a policy of that sort, can tell the House straight out what they propose doing, and let us come to some decision on the matter. Some honourable members seem to be very satisfied with the action of the Government in regard to the wheat business. I am not. While we realized that Government assistance was necessary, I certainly had no sympathy with any scheme which meant compulsion. The Government made a distinct promise, which was included in the preamble of the B ill introduced into the Victorian Parliament when the war was in its early stages. an agreement made by the Prime Minister and the Ministers for Agriculture of the several .producing States, that the price to be paid for wheat in Australia was to be on the basis of the London parity. That sacred promise was broken almost immediately after the Wheat Pool started. The London parity for wheat was 5s. I d . per bushel, and because the wharf lumpers in Melbourne declined to let wheat be loaded for the use of our troops and onr Allies, the Government immediately broke their promise, and reduced the price of wheat in Australia to 4s. 9d. a ibushel. The promise made at that time was clear and definite, as the following extract, taken from a statement made by the Prime Ministeri n 1915, w ill show:As soon as possible after the sale of the last cargoes the Minister is to ascertain the net average prico realized for the whole of the wheat shipped by his State, and each farmer is to be credited with this rate on thc whole of the amount delivered to the Government agent. They were led to expect f u l l payment about September in the year following the delivery of the wheat. To-day the Government have not been able to clear up any of the Pools. I realize the difficulties they have had to meet, but I urge that after the last big sale in London there should be no reason why the Government should not immediately pay to the farmers at least the guaranteed price for their wheat. I received some -time ago a circular about the Wheat Pool, giving the comparative prices in Australia, the Argentine, America, and the United Kingdom. It was prepared by a large number of producers in South Australia, and addressed to the wheat-growers of Australia. by a very small number, and is not representative of the opinions of the South Australian farmers. about twenty-six gentlemen, representing farming interests in South Australia.

Notwithstanding these drawbacks, Argentine shipped about 4,000,000 tons of cereals during the 1915-16 season-fou r times that shipped by us-and paid their farmers cash on delivery J early stages, appointed as shipping agents for the Pool two firms which did not make it a part of their general operations to deal in wheat,and did not understand the ramifications of the business. The Prime Minister's announcement, on 11th Noyember of the first year of the Pool, and the promises he made in regard to shipping, were never realized in any shape or form . The Wheat Pool was compulsory. Our people were forced to put their money into it, the Government have sold their wheat, and it is the duty of the Government now to provide sufficient money to pay the farmers at least the amount they guaranteed them. facts concerning, the huge shortage of wheat in New South Wales referred to by the honourable member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley), but in the Wheat Pool we have the Central Board controlled in Melbourne, and we have various State Boards, which have absolute control of all matters in their own States. I believe all sales for export have to go through the Central-Board, but I understand that there has been some breaking of that agreement in connection with the administration in New South Wales. But all matters of handling and general, administration are purely the concern of the State, and it is the farmers of New South Wales only who will suffer by any bad administration in this regard. New South Wales authority may have made a mistake in selling wheat for export without the permission of the Central Board. I do notlike the look of things in connection with the Pooli n that opposing any State, b u t the Commonwealth Government would not be justified by anything said in this House to-night in interfering in the. administration of what is purely a State matter. It is the farmers of New South Wales who will gain or lose by the administration of the State Board, and it is their duty, if they think fit, to demand a Commission of inquiry. The Government have given to the Butter Pool absolute power to make contracts and to supply the people. I sympathize with that to some extent, but there is one point in regard to which an explanation should be. made to the House. The Butter Pool is not given' absolute control within a State, but it does control all butter leaving the Statei n which it was manufactured. Western Australia u r : gently required butter recently, and, al-""though it was selling in Victoria-for 177s. per cwt., the people of the western State were required to pav 198s., plus all freight and cartage charges.

331,Mr Gregory,"I can only judgeWe are giving to these authorities statutory power to sell the whole of their products, to expend enormous sums of money, and probably pay large commissions, and surely there should be an absolute control by Parliament through the Auditor General. I remember reading the articles of association of the Zinc Producers Association, one ofwhich enabled directors to pay gifts or commissions to any person who may not directly or in directly do anything of advantage to the company, if , in the opinion of the directors, it was in the interests of the company to do so. That was the most extraordinary power I ever saw in articles of association. A t that time Sir John Higgins was looking after the registration business, and he was the principal influence in enforcing men to join the Combine. I must admit the necessity for the B ill . I wish the Government had gone further and shown, if they are compelled to interfere, how far their interference is to go. T regret that it is necessary to have Bills of this kind, but contracts have been made, and the Government must be given the necessary powers. am not a constitutional lawyer, but it seems extraordinary to me if this legislation is valid. Ts there any l i m it at all to the powers of the Government, if , after the war is over, we can give effect to legislation of the kind. assured, authorities, that this legislation is within our powers, and we must accept the opinion. approval of the States. ing said as to the approval of the States. The Government should see that every protection is given to the producer by Bills of this kind. In every one of the Pools more control ought to be given to the producers themselves. I realize that when the Government make advances, as in the case of wheat, they must be strongly represented; but in the case of wool, what need is there for more representation than is necessary to see that the obligation on the part of the Government to give the people a square deal is carried out? all these Pools, wheat, wool, butter, and so for t h, the whole of the representation should be in the hands of the producers. I quite approve-of the methods used in the formation of the Butter Pool. The Government representation is right and just, while the rest of the control is in the hands of the producers. conceive of more satisfaction amongst producers than in the case of the Wool Pool. abroad, because it is thought that the producers have been getting a good price for their wool. But right throughout the back country there is a great feeling of. loyalty to the Old Country, and a desire to help, although in doing so tlie producers know that they are getting a lesser price than they otherwise would. I am quite sure that if the producers had had. more representation the monopolies we have seen would not have been given to certain firms. There is a large cooperative company in Western Australia -the Western Australian Producers Company-wit h some 5,000 shareholders, I nearly every one of whom carry sheep, and desire to do their business with their own concern. But they were refused the right to act as agents, and the business was most unfairly given to other people. There has been a similar tenWe are dency to monopoly in connection with however, -on the highest most of the Pools,and T resent it .

The other night the Leader of the Opwe get the position ( Mr Tudor) spoke about the increased cost of living, and that in creased cost, I take it , is due to the action' of the Government in interfering with industries. We had an instance last year in connection with the purchase of woolsacks, when the ' Government compelled the ordinary business people to stand on. one side, with the result that the sacks were not so cheap to the producer as they otherwise would have been. For the last ten years there have been all sorts of interferences and restrictions on trade and commerce by regulations and enactments, and I am convinced that the more we have of it the more the Beyond that, in prices are inflated, and the more hard-",61,Isxpoht Aprr Es

335,Mr Gregory,"There is that ideasbips are inflicted on the workers of the country. So far as the Wool Pool is concerned, there has been a very f a i l deal given to local industries, and wool is obtained at a lesser price than that at which it is sent to the Old Country. My own opinion is that it is because of the Protective policy that prices have gone so high as they are. The Leader of the Opposition knows a great deal about the hat-making industry, and he must remember that in one ship the whole of the space was taken up with a consignment of hats sent from America by parcels post. We had exported the raw material, in the shape of rabbit skins, to America, where the manufacturers were able to make up hats and send them here at the extraordinary rates chargeable during war time, and compete with Australian manufacturers. as to this, and they told me it was a pure fabrication. tihalt. As to boots, we ought to be exporting tliem -all over the w o r l d ; but the people in Australia have had the restric1 tions so long that, not only have they got used to bhem, and are willin g ito pay the extraordinary prices demanded, but are actually asking for still 'higher duties. I shall support the second reading, but hope thai in Committee there will be some alteration made in the methods of forming the Boards of some of the Pools. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gi -egory) has expressed .some apprehension about our constitutional powers in regard to this B ill , and, as to that, I shall have something to .say in a moment. I . cannot help congratulating my own party and honourable members opposite on the great measure of support bhat some of the latter have given to the policy of the Labour party in reference to the B ill . The honourable member for Dampier, like others, is most emphatic that, whatever may be the cause of the in flated, prices and the high cost of living, which are the tragedies of our social life of to-day, they cannot be laid at the door of the primary .producer. I remember listening with great interest not so long ago to my amiable and' exuberant friend-, 'the honourable member for' Grampians ( Mr Jowett), who was at pains .to defend the primary producer from any change of the kind. I join w i th those honourable and distinguished members opposite in saying that for a number of 1 years the Labour party's apostles have been touring the Commonwealth declaring that the primary producer is exploited by the middleman, or some unascertained combination of middlemen. The newspapers, the supporters, and claquers of honourable members opposite, said that the Labour party was trying to win the suffrages of the farmers, b u t that the farmer was not to be deceivedas to who his real friends were, and, therefore, could not be expected to vote for Labour. When the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) came here I asked the Postal people his first declaration was that the small land-owner, dairyman, and primary producer was a working man like I know better than those on this side, and was not exploiting the people, b u t merely getting a fair wage. Whilei t was admitted that the cost of living was f a r too high, it was held that that could not be laid at the door of 'the primary producer. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr. Jowett) carried the argument a little f u r ther, and proved that the high prices were -.really attributable to the operations of Trusts and Combines. Has the Labour party never so declared? Hasi t never attacked Twists and Combines? Did the Jjabour .party not ask for extended constitutional powers to deal with bhem? Did honourable members opposite support us ? Honourable members opposite know that the Labour party asked for those powers on two occasions, and might have asked for them on a third occasion, if it had not been for the action of a certain distinguished absent member of this House. curred. member for Batman( Mr Brennan) make his point, whatever it is. made the point (sufficiently obvious by what I have said My point is that",62,Isxpoht Aprr Es

341,Mr Brennan,"I thought I hadmembers on tbe Ministerial side now declare, with the Labour patty, that the people of this conn-try are 'being exploited, and the honourable member for Grampians. ( Mr Jowett) has proved that they are. Andi t is further declared that the exploitation is not by the farmers and producers, whose votes in the past we on this side have -successfully solicited, and hope to successfully solicit again , when1 it is found where exactly the exploitation arises. I now come more closely to the Bill before the -House. The measure is remarkable in the -manner of its presentation, its form, and its subject-matter. Tihe manner of its presentation to the House is not a mere formal matter that may be brushed aside as not requiring further discussion, for I conceive that it involves a very grave departure from well established precedent, founded on la\y and common sense, and involves--also something which, I am sorry to say, is, though I am sure it was never intended to be, very little less than an affront to honourable members on both sides. Why do I say so ? May I remind the honourable gentleman who moved the motion for the second reading of the responsibility which he has as Acting Attorney-General and Chief Law Officer of the Crown. presents a Bill involving intricate technical constitutional considerations and law points, and reads to the House a short certificate of three lines signed for the guidance of a responsible Minister, by an utterly irresponsible Committee of persons outside, and says, "" Here is the B ill ; they, say it is constitutional ; and I ask you' to accept it. as being so."" Although this was not intended as a deliberate affront to honourable members, it bears that appearance, and seems to suggest that the honourable member considers the Bill too difficult, too complicated, and too complex to submit reasons or arguments in support of it to honourable members whose duty it is to criticise it, and perhaps oppose it. What is involved in this certificate, experts to furnish the Acting Attorneywhich the Acting Attorney-General has General with a certificate that it was very presented? says that' the Committee have given' the competence of the Commonwealth. Mr Brennan. us the best that is in them. All I have to say is, that if they have given to us as a Parliament the best that is in. them they have not rendered themselves very much poorer by what they have given, and have not made honourable members of this House very much richer. They give us a certificate unsupported by argument, or analogy, or by authority of any kind whatsoever; a certificate which appears to me to be very doubtfully in harmony with the decided law of this country. Their certificate is that they have carefully considered the Bill, and come to the conclusion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. Those members of the Committee who reside in Sydney, calling in aid that great Department controlled by the Postmaster-General, have written over to say that they too have carefully considered the Bill, and think it is within the competence, of the Commonwealth Parliament, but subject to the important qualification that in regard to sugar the Bill should come into operation before the end of the war. I doubt if there is any sufficient reason for distinguishing sugar; but would.it have been too much for the Acting Attorney-General to have told us that the Melbourne members of this honorary and irresponsible Committee He concurred in that qualification? We have not been told that much. Perhaps .there might have been in the minds of the Melbourne members of the Committee a little mental reservation in regard to that point."" I may be permitted, without presumption, t'o offer my humble opinion in this Parliament to which I have been elected. Although we have not had the benefit of any legal expert opinion in regard to this question, and, apparently, we are not to have it, I venture to state that it is quite possible the Bill is within , the competence of the Commonwealth.

But my point is, not as to whether this B ill is within the competence of Parliament, as they baldly state it to be. The main question is, when and where and in what circumstances this B ill , when it becomes an Act, as to any of its severable parts, . w ill be challenged. leading decisions on measures of this kind is to make it perfectly clear that the validity of anything done under them cannot be determined in advance. B ill clearly involves an interference with local trade and commerce. not think the Acting AttorneyGeneralj would volves the fixing of prices, not only in regard to sugar, as those distinguished members of the New South Wales Bar seem to have felt, but also of any or all of the commodities dealt with in the various regulations. It certainly involves a power over trade, not only between States, as we may trade under the Constitution, but also within the bounds of any one State, as we may not trade under the Constitution. Surely the Acting Attorney-General, apart from his own personal knowledge of the law on this subject, has not forgotten the various manifestoes and pamphlets issued by the gentleman who is now his honourable Leader, in which that distinguished King' s Counsel of another country ( Mr Hughes) has quoted cases which lay down the principle that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to interfere with or restrain the local commerce of any State within its the honourable own boundaries. Mitchell said that? O h , no, not i m of the Opposition ( Mr Higgs) quoted probably one of the most eminent-a t all events I am sure he considers, himself one of the most eminent-member s of this committee, which has given us the certificate referred to by the Acting Attorney General, as having said that this Parliament has no power to invade the intrastate regulation of trade and commerce, whose yet this B ill involves it in the regulations, which become part of ' the Act as a schedule to it , and which were formerly based on the power given by the W a r Precautions Act. founded on the plenary power of defence? power has been carried in the leading case on this subject, Burvett v.

351,Situation Are; Those Are For Mr Brennan,"But this B ill doesthey will go to, and that they are so extended only because at the time the decision was given we were at war, I shall quote a few words from the leading judgments. The Chief Justice, at page 440 of the report, as contained in the bound volumes for 1915-16, saidNo one disputes tliat an attempt by the Commonwealth Parliament to fix the price of food in time of peace would be a trespass on the reserved powers of the States. Barton, J., said at page 448I t is not to the purpose to say that they involve the exercise of powers which are the proper province of GovernmentsHe was referring to the fixation of prices. In this case the price of bread had been fixed in Victoria, and the power to fix that price was challenged in the High Court. These observations were made in the judgments in which it was decided that we had that power. Barton, J., continuedwhich have no direct concern with that duty. If they are admittedly so in time of peace, it does not follow that they are so, or exclusively so, in time of war. And , again, a t page 449Subjects whicli before that battle seemed only indirectly or remotely connected with defence as thc means of winning the war may, after the battle, be seen quite clearly to be within it . That gives the same illustration that I gave a moment ago regarding the effect that one battle might have upon the nation's fortunes and, consequently, upon the meaning of our Constitution. page 450 he sums up the matter in these wordsI cannot but think that, as a mere war precaution, though in no other way or guise, and not in time of peace, this legislation, and the derivative regulations and orders arc, as far as they are impeached, authorized by the Constitution Those are the Judges who gave the majority decision upholding the extreme step we took at that time in fixing prices. tice Isaacs. chief, Mr Justice Isaacs has always stood for an extended and liberal interpretation of the Constitution. He has gone much further than ever the Chief Justice did in time of peace, and, therefore, although I rather prefer to side in the interpretation of our Constitution on this occasion with those who disagreed with him, I have always commended him for his consistent interpretation of the Constitution on the well-known American line of extending its power by judicial decision as far as possibly could be done consistently with his judgment as a constitutionalist aud a lawyer. He said, at page 453Thc defence power may be exerted in times of peace, but, so far only by way of preparation. Actual defence, and a il that it connotes, comes only when we are at war. War creates its own necessities, proportioned to the circumstances, and not measurable in advance of the occasion, and defence is only complete when it meets those necessities, whatever they may prove to be. While peace prevails, the normal facts of national life take their respective places in the general alignment, and are subject to the normal action of constitutional powers. I shall not quote the judgments, able and scholarly, of the two learned Judges who dissented from those views, except to say that I have the honour of entirely agreeing with the reasons and arguments they put forth, especially where Mr JusticeD u f f y made the scathing reply to the argument addressed to him, which was not an argument, but political propaganda, invitin g him not to withhold these powers from the Government in time of national stress. The learned Judge replied that it was a strange argument to address to men who were bound by their oath to administer the law without fear At or favour. The incident shows in b r i l liant light just where we have come to in our constitutional relationships as the result of the demoralizing hysteria incidental to the war which has now happily passed away. I hope the Acting Attorney-General will not treat the House with contempt in this matter. I hope, also, that what I am saying will not end the pleasant interchanges between those irresponsible persons and' himself, but I Unlike his distinguished trust that he will not continue his attitude of studied disregard of the intelligence of honourable members 'on both sides of the House, particularly tliose who are opposed to him, and who expect to be taken a little into his confidence respecting these matters.

352,I Come Now To The Judgment Of Mr Jus,"it is not too late, if he' has considered the constitutional position himself independently and fairly, how he squares his sign. ing that hlunt certificate as to our constitutional iDowers with the arguments which he so ably addressed to honourable members of this Chamber when contending for the limited powers of the Australian Constitution, and arguing that the powers which we were asking for should be reserved for the States. Let it not be thought that I am desirous of restricting or helping to restrict the powers we enjoy under the Constitution. honour to stand with those who have asked for much fuller, if not plenary, powers for the Australian Parliament as representing the whole of the Australian people. But if we are to have those powers, and the day cannot be much longer postponed when we shall enjoy them, let us have them in an orderly way at the direction of the people who created the Constitution, .and whose instrument it is, and by whose means alone it can be adequately fashioned to their needs. Let not this patchwork continue, under which a Bill is brought down from time to time, and the responsible Minister has to satisfy his own conscience, and the conscience of the House, by getting irresponsible persons outside to say, ""You may tread a foot or a yard to-day, and another yard to-morrow""; while for every move we make we must have a certificate from some eminent legal gentlemen outside that we are treading in the right direction, and have not overstepped the bounds of our powers. As we do not know either the time when, or the circumstances in which, this Bill may be challenged, so we do not know what is involved in the Bill itself. I am not permitted to quote literally the debate so far as it has proceeded, but I presume I am at liberty to remind honourable members of one incident. When the Acting Attorney-General made his speech explaining the Bill on the motion for leave to introduce it, when we had not the Bill before us-for he did not make a speech when moving the second reading-and when he came to the question of wheat, the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson) Mr Brennan. ""And the price?"" "" Oh, the price,"" said the Acting Attorney-General, "" there is an arrangement made between the Governments, but I am not, at liberty yet to -tell you what it is or what the price is."" quite wrong. I said I had only just received the information a moment before I came into the House that an agreement had been completed, and that I had not the particulars with me. that the honourable member said he was I have had the not in a position to go into the details. only just been communicated to me before I came into the House. other honourable members interjected, the honourable member said that no doubt the Acting Prime Minister would come down later and tell the House what was involved in that arrangement. The Acting Prime Minister has not done so yet, and it was not intended that he should before the Bill becomes law. The point is that we are expected to pass this Bill with only the haziest notion as to what the arrangements are in regard to prices and other commercial activities. All these things are in a maze of uncertainty. We do not know now what is really involved in the measure, because there are a number of subsidiary arrangements connected with the Bill which are not to 'be disclosed until in good time ' the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) is disposed to tell us what they may be. The Bill contains in its schedule a number of regulations which are printed in extenso. True they only come to us as a schedule, and the Chairman of Committees will dispose of them in due time by saying,"" That this be the schedule to the Bill. Those of that opinion say ' Aye' ; to the contrary, ' No' ; the ' Ayes' have it , "" and that will be the end of it. But I thank the Government that for the first time these legislative enactments, which take the form of regulations, have been placed on the table.

Finally, I ask the Acting Attorney General not to tinker with the Constitution in the way that is involved in this B ill . Now that they have confessed by this measure the necessity for getting greater powers for this Parliament, let the Government ask us on this side to cooperate with them in securing a liberal amendment of the Constitution designed to achieve the very things which Ministers are now seeking to achieve, and they will have our support.

A f t e r all, this B ill is only for the purpose of continuing the And under those reguactivities commenced in 1915, and I am asking myself about the consistency of those gentlemen opposite who stood solidly behind the Government when the' pooling system was instituted. Surely, we had no learned opinion at that time SoI congratulate the Government that the activities of the Wheat Pool could be ended at any given date. Yet every one of those honourable members, like unnatural parents, would leave their offspring to perish on tlie doorstep now that -the war is over. As a man interestedi n the f a r m in g industry, I ask wihat alternative is suggested by honoraible members opposite, unless it be found in the concluding proposal of the honourable member for Batman that we should commence an agitation for in creased constitutional powers for the Commonwealth P-ai'liamjent. Are we, w*hose wheat, aud wool and every security is wrapped up in 'those Pools, to await the issue, of a contentious warfare waged firom one end of Australia to the other?

But we found that in its administration' it practioally destroyed tflie small wool buyer in the country. We saw men who had spent a life-time in building up the wool industry in country towns, and whose sons had gone to the Pront, having their businesses of existence, as though they were enemies of the Empire. tralization was expressed in excelso by the administration of that Oommittee. I failed to see ""tihe necessity for Chat policy. We were told that it was in the interests of the small grower that he should be. deprived of the right to sell his wool to country merchants who bad expert staffs well qualified to classify the wool, and who could have actually assisted the appraisers; but, in the interest of the small grower, it was alleged, they were refused the right to do itbat.

Lyneh. cember, 1916, before the inferior wheat, which was grown as a result of the rust, left the farmhouses throughout Australia, I approached the Prime Minister When that function was ( Mr Hughes) w it h a scheme to prevent it going into the wheat reserves for human consumption. I urged that it should be set apart to be used in the pig, poultry, and dairy industries, and turned into profit whilst the produots of those industries were returning very high prices. The Prime Minister decided that he could not interpose at that stage; but later on, when wiped out the mice plague of 1917 occurred, I again saw him. That plague was a terrible visiThe principle of centation, scarcely conceivable by those who did not visit some of the farmhouses. Prom ordinary barns cartloads of mice could be taken away, and even people were nibbled in their beds. It may sound like a Baron Munchausen story, but I , at that time, saw pigs w it h their backs all nibbled by mice while they slept. My appeal to the Prime Minister and the Wheat Board was by means of a memorandum, as follows: Owing chiefly to rust visitations, 1916-17 grown wheat includes a large proportion that is of little or no milling value. This is especially true of the New South Wales crop, as the grade deductions on certificates will show. In December, 1916, when this damaged crop was being harvested, I made suggestions that wheat-growing. all wheat unfit for human consumption should be carefully kept apart, and should be made of the Wihe'at Pool, available for pig and poultry raising at its Tlhose real feeding values. I submit that, in view of the present positions, which I shall shortly critics review, that it is incumbent upon the authoPool, and who a rities, even at this late hour, to deal with the violent question and avert future losses to farmers against the Government of through holding on indefinitely to an asset of very questionable value. Speaking as a wheat-grower for the past twenty-seven years in New South Wales, I 1916-17 wheat being can say that we produced more bad wheat last on the millers, are now year than in any ten aggregate years within because the worse elemy experience. If the Pool .had not been in of that crop were sold to existence to advance 2s. 6d. per bushel for all this inferior stuff, practical farmers knew speculator, and the. Wheat there would be no real market for it at all. to him first The present position is: We have pooled the They cannot have it good and bad wheats; how far they have been I wish to explain this matter kept separate in stores and stacks is not clear. We have advanced to ourselves .2s. 6d. per bushel, upon which "" the Pool,"" I.e., the farto do mers, must pay interest. Tlie mice plague, by cutting the bags, has assisted in mixing In Dethe grades, and thus intensifying the problem. \ Big expense has been, and is being, incurred in reconditioning, bagging, restacking, & c , the bad wheat as well as the good. None of the very inferior stuff has been sold, or can be sold, at home or abroad at the nominal face values, interred from the certificate deductions, and that range from i d . to ls. 3d. per bushel. The official opinion expressed during the passage of Wheat StorageB ill went to show that, even if the war ended quickly, many years must elapse before the last of the surplus wheat grown, or that w ill be grown during the years we must await shipping, can leave these shores. Such being the case, the question arises, and must be faced-whethe r it is wise to go on incurring and paying interest, storage, and otlier heavy charges on the inferior wheat-o n the doubtful chance of an ultimate payable return for it overseas, or will we take the practical view, and admit that, sooner or later, the stuff must be fed to animals, and that we should make every possible effort to turn it into highly valuable foodstuffs in Australia while high prices for such foodstuffs obtain both at Home and abroad ? I suggest that the following course of action be taken to assist in averting the tremendous losses that confront us if the policy of d r if t on this matter be continued, and that has already involved the farmers and community generally in much loss since harvest time:'.Che Australian Wheat Board, in co-operation with State Pools, should got definite information under the following heads:(a) Expert millers' advice as to the poorest grade of 1916-17 wheat that experience has shown it profitable to farmers, no attention whatever was paid mill. (&) Obtain from each State Pool the quantities stored of each grade, and i i [ j i grades. { I { tend), to devise scheme for dealing with the problem, (tl) When conference decides upon prac, ferior wheats at real feeding values, and according to grades, to the pig, poultry, and dairying industries, then a ballot of the wheat-owners be taken.

The Prime Minister put that memorandum before the Board, and here is the official reply, dated 1st October, 1917Prime Minister's Department, Melbourne, 1st October, 1917. Dear Sir,-With reference to the memorandum presented by you, dealing with the problem of inferior wheat, I desire to inform, you that this matter was brought under the notice of the W.heat Board at its conference last week. The conditions referred to by you do not aipply generally throughout the pooling States, but are confined practically to New South Wales, and' efforts arc being made to realize, as profitably as possible, the wheat on hand in that State. The conference considered that the scheme suggested by you would be of no practical benefit to growers. Yours faithfully, M. L . SHEPHERD, Secretary. It is clear that when the opportunity presented itself to members of the House, to the press, and others outside, to support a proposal that would have been of inestimable value to Australian to the matter. It shows what a lamentable rut we have fallen into when, for party definite information as to the extent advantage and the wheedling of votes, matto which poor-grade wheats have ters of this kind are neglected. The statebeen kept separate, or may now be ment by the Wheat Board that the ""probseparated, from payable milling lem of inferior wheat was largely con(c) Getf u l l case printed when all facts fined to New South Wales is absolutely and figures are collected, and hold correct. As a wheat-grower of over thirty conference (which farmers' repreyears' experience, I can say that the averscntatives should be asked to atage man can have but a poor conception of the wretched stuff that was produced in large quantities owing to the rust visitatical scheme for loosing such intion of 1916-17. No doubt the system of handling that crop was well meant, but it was a wrong one. We fixed the f.a.q. at 57 lbs. to the bushel, with a scale of deduction ranging from i d . to ls. 3d., (c; That with each ballotipaper be sent but it was largely a matter of guesswork, as the result showed. For wheat that was 58 lbs. there was no penalty, but after that the penalty began at i d . and went on until the ls. 3d. maximum was readied, mounted to only 45 lbs. to the bushel or under. bags that would not weigh 40 lbs. to the bushel, and practical millers tell us that anything below.50 or 51 lbs. is not worth milling for human consumption. object was to give the farmer who was unfortunate enough to be hit heavily by tbe rust trouble a fair and square chance, and we paid 2s. 6d. a bushel, irrespective of what the grade might be. We have only to look at the value of the f.a.q. wheat in the 1915-16 Pool and the value of the wheat in the 1918-19 Pool. The value can be ascertained by adding the sums we have already obtained to the selling value of the certificates to-day, and then comparing either with the f.a.q. wheat in the 1916-17 Pool. wheat in the Central Pool is worth from 5d. to 7d. a bushel according as the certificates fluctuated. That is because J there were men who delivered nothing but f.a.q. wheat, and there was a fair proportion of such who adopted better farming methods, or were more fortunate in their conditions, whose wheat ran from 60 lbs. to 64 lbs. to the bushel-and they are the real losers. myself, put in a quantity of good and ibad wheat-in a"" few thousand bushels of many .grades we put in some of the best and some of the poorest. as the certificates were claimed by the grower, the f.a.q. man, no matter how good the quality of his wheat, was paid 2s. 6d., and was given the next payments of 6d. and 3d. as they came along. Another man might have had 4,000 bushels-2,000 of it f.a.q., and 2,000 subject to' ls. reduction. livered the wheat at the siding, and received one certificate, when the second payment came round he was told that he was entitled to that amount on 2,000 bushels of f.a.q., but that, as there was a deduction of ls. on the other 2,000 bushels, he would be credited with 6d., and he would get no cash. Some of the farmers, however, did hot "" come into the country tomorrow,"" and they put in the wheat in iwo lots. Mr Lynch. when the wheat grade delivered, they claimed a certificate for 2,000 bushels, and when the inferior wheat I saw wheat going into was put in, they claimed another. There was no objection to that, because we had, unfortunately, much against my desire, legalized the right to deal in scrip. ConOur sequently the man with 4,000 bushels, which was delivered under two certificates, drew his dividends of 6d. and 3d. on the f.a.q. portion, and did not mind what happened to the inferior wheat, because he knew that if there had been no Pool it would hardly have been worth carting from the farm. I am as confident as I stand here that what Mr Grahame, the' Minister forAgriculture in New South Wales, stated is absolutely correct. The wheat stacks of 1916-1917 were raked over and over again for the purpose of We find that the f.a.q. getting wheat the millers would accept, and there was a great outcry, which practically debarred the Government from doing anything,' further. When the splendid deal was made from the producer's point of view, and a sale was effected at something like 4s. 4d., the cry was that the speculator had been able to make a profit .out of it. I hope the speculator will make a profit. Where there is dealing in an indiOther men, like vidual or corporate capacity, there will be fluctuations in prices, that speculative kind of profit from which the poor suffer so much, until-we devise some better sysBut tem' of co-operative effort Perhaps some of my wheat was in that particular lot which this gentleman secured, and I wish him good. luck. It was no good to me. Theevidence goes' to show that the deal was a splendid one for the farmers. If he deLast December we heard the Actrailway ing Prime Minister reading' volu-. minous correspondence showing the of 6d. great efforts the Prime Minister (A.r. Hughes) had made to sell our wheat. The best price offered was 4s. 6d. por bushel for f.a.q. prime milling wheat, and it was hedged round by such conditions that Australia could not afford to accept it ; but, fortunately, for us, a change has come over the scene, and the wheat market has improved. When the f.a.q. wheat' was The Prime Minister is now able to sell 1,000,000 tons and a possible additional 500,000 tons ofwheatat 5s. 6d. per bushel, and there w ill be a corresponding increase in the price of inferior wheat which w ill enable the speculator to make good on his purchase. He may do so; but we do not know the price at which he is going to deliver the wheat. I do not care about giving the ' show away,' but unless the people of New South Wales used up that worthless rubbish,as I suggested, it was the only way in which this inferior wheat could be got r i d of to bring in any return to the farmers. I cannot conceive of any Government allowing such stuff to be used for human consumption, and that was the only province in which they could interpose in the interests of public health. If we look at this question from a f a i r point of view, away from this atmosphere of party wrangling on the eve of an election, and if we regard it. from the point of view of the producers' interests, we must see tliat the State Government ^acted, not only in the interests of the farmers, but in the interests of the general community, and we ought a l l to rejoice. If success attends the efforts' of those who, from motives best known to -themselves, are for ever directing theirdaTts against the Boards and Governments who are compelled to control these industries during the time of war, does it benefit the producer or the consumer? No t at all. We had a striking instance of it in connection with the jute question. among those who opposed the action of the Goveniment in giving up the control of the importation of cornsacks. would like to have seen it perpetuated if possible, and I believe now be done in that direction, but a large section of farmers-no t a majority of them, I am glad to say-condemne d the Government for having interposed at all. Tbey said that if the Government had kept their deadly grip off they would have got cheaper bags for their wheat. The British Government used their in fluence with the Indian Government, and the Commonwealth had £4,000,000 in order to purchase bags for the Australian farmers. But because'of [402]2 bitter criticism and constitutional difficulties against carrying on this particular activity any longer, the Government had to give over their control and sell the remnant of their bag purchase. I believe they sold bags at 9s. 5d. or 9s. 8d. per dozen, with the result that they are now quoted at 14s., and we are told that they w ill be about 15s. for the coming harvest. There is no l i m it to the cupidity of people, and there is no distinction between classes in this respect. We take where ever we can lay our hands on anything, and it is due to that selfishness that is everywhere predominant in the majority of us; in fact, it is said that unless his Satanic Majesty gets hold of a good many of us there will be a miscarriage of justice. People howl for juster and truer systems, yet every one is seeking an outlet by which' he can get round his fellow, whether it be in the matter of war-time profits taxation or income taxation, or. whether it be in regard to the obligation to yield an honest -day's work for an honest day's pay. I can see no better method of reform than by starting w i th ourselves. Before this inferior wheat l e f t our farms I endeavoured to get something done that would at least safeguard the people's health and the character of the Australian wheat-grower, so that the farmer would only deliver the rubbish at its real food value for animal use. I hope I shall always endeavour to adopt the same attitude. While my sympathies are I was with the under dog, I have no sympathy with an opposition to the Government that would render it impossible for them. I to make progress even on the crutches on which they are now hobbling along, and only seeks to bring about turmoil and that something will have, to chaos. I hope means will be provided by which the Commonwealth Government, can conduct the sale of our wool for quite a number of years. In fact, I would not mind if it went on for ever doing so. But I have no hope of being able to maintain the price of Is. 3^d. per lb. I have no desire to see that price maintained, because the tee*ning millions of people who must proto spend vide the market for the wool would need a tremendous increase in their remuneration if , in addition to providing food, they are to have sufficient means to provide garments for themselves. In our efforts to get away from the industrial unrest from which every country is suffering, we must devise some method by which a more scientific system of production and distribution can be achieved. We want new doctrines that will bring the obligation home to every person to play his part. clined always to lose no opportunity take the other fellow down, but imperfect, pystems are those which are logically nt for us to live under. a daily rate of pay unless we can devise systems which will fix on an average what is a fair value for foodstuffs and raw material for the industries to work up into the thousand and one required by man. wrangling and fighting, and by a better system of distribution, problems. take' our coats of f , and get to work. It is the only road worth pursuing. had it said on very good authority if all incomes over £500 a year were absolutely wiped out and distributed those whose incomes amount, it would mean a share of 3s. 9d. per week only to each man, woman, and child. would Le possible to distribute the human family would be ably greater under a proper system than could be attained under any system. But while we are looking out for ideal methods we must begin with the lowest rung of the ladder, that is, with ourselves, and determine, as we must do, that the part of self-sacrifice and selfabnegation leads to the highest and the highest progress. Our track must be blazed clearly before our vision, instead of taking the short cuts that satisfy the ears and leave us not even in our present imperfect standard, but_turn the wrong path, and destroy those processes of evolutionary effort it is still possible to maintain, and which, I am pleased to say, are still visible in the British Empire. We have much to be thankful We have a fearful price to pay for our participation in the war, but if we derive nothing more than the Mr Lynch. to go on and do things as Australians can do them, then events are moving in the right direction. If people will only refuse to listen to the talk of class war there is in the community, to the talk that there must be a conflict for ever waged'between labour and capital, and if they will only realize that land, labour, and capital are the great factors, labour If we are criminally inbeing the predominant partner-that is to to say, the creator of the one and the in nothing heritor of the other-labou r will come immoral, and tyrannous into it3 own, but that will only be when it is capable of giving expression to the It is idle to fix highest virtues of co-operative citizenship.
