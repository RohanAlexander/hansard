What the bill does: Nonetheless, the act as originally drafted Exemption from discrimination provisions has led to some unintended consequences that The act currently prohibits price discriminanow need to be corrected in the light of tion by a dominant carrier, except where the experience in an increasingly competitive discrimination is based on differences in market. This is essentially finetuning of a costs. The bill retains the anti-discrimination system that is working well. provision, and recasts the exemptions so that the following types of discriminatory tariffs Purpose of the bill will be permitted: In broad terms, the bill is intended to do (a) Those that are generally available; that two things. Firstly, it will remove any doubt is, of broad appeal to customers and potenthat a dominant carrier can offer certain tial customers. Tariffs under which a sercharging options that would otherwise be vice is available to be acquired on the same discriminatory and hence in breach of the terms and conditions by major customer Telecommunications Act.

Secondly, it will enable Austel to those that are narrowly targeted, in such a disallow tariffs that materially and adversely way that competition is inhibited or the benefits of competition are narrowly fobroadening of exemptions from the anticused, will not. This change will, among discrimination prohibition. other things, effectively permit the majority Accordingly, the bill proposes a new power of existing Telecom flexiplan tariffs. There for Austel to disallow a tariff of a carrier that are currently some 2.3 million flexiplan is in a position to dominate a market if it is customers; anti-competitive. To ensure consistency with (b) Those where discrimination-even if the government's overall pro-competitive narrowly focused-is, in Austel's opinion, regulatory framework for telecommunications, justified by differences in the 'carrier's an anti-competitive test is defined quite costs. Some Telecom SPAs would be specifically as one that would materially and expected to be assessed under this proviadversely affect the development and/or sion. This approach provides significant maintenance of commercially sustainable practical scope for Telecom to demonstrate competition in a market. This test, which only its commercial case to Austel as to the cost applies to tariffs of a dominant carrier, is justification of specific tariffs. The amenddeliberately different from those applicable ments will explicitly allow broad network under the Trade Practices Act. This reflects cost savings to be taken into account and the still developing nature of competition in will provide considerable flexibility to telecommunications and the barrier to compeaccommodate the commercial realities of tition that would otherwise be represented by the industry; Telstra's incumbent position. . (c) Those justified by the community It should be noted that the new power to interest in promotion of universal access to disallow anti-competitive tariffs will extend to the standard telephone service. This would tariffs that are permitted by virtue of the new include, for example, existing community discrimination exemptions. That is, a tariff and pastoral call rates offered by Telecom; that is exempt from the anti-discrimination and provisions, for example because Austel considers the discrimination is cost-related, (d) Trial programs, pilot programs and may still be subject to scrutiny and disallowdemonstrations, such as Telecom's current ance because of its anti-competitive effects. trial of calling line identification.
