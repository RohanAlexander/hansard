6,Mr Fadden,"I submit that this isZealand, New Caledonia, or the Netherlands East Indies. Can the Government logically argue that the members of the Militia may be sent from Tasmania to Cairns, but not from Tasmania to New Zealanda much shorter distance-in order that Australia may be defended? Such a contention would have no sound basis. The point that I desire particularly to make is, that the Opposition does not require that the Militia shall be sent anywhere. It is not advocating that it shall be sent out of Australia, but it does put the view that the existing legal impediment must be removed in order that any plans which the Government may consider are necessary in order to meet a contingency may be expeditiously implemented, in accordance with the advice of those who are competent to form a sound judgment. That legal impediment can be removed only by this Parliament. Its removal in advance is just as necessary as planning in any other regard. It is an indispensable part of any adequate planning for the proper defence of Australia. In April, articles appeared in the Australian press which were obviously inspired by a. Government spokesmanthat mysterious overworked phantom of the night. Then the Adelaide Advertiser of the 7th April last statedProvisions of the Defence Act restricting compulsory military service to Australia and its territories will not stand iu the way of the utmost freedom of disposal by the Supreme Allied Commander in the southwestern Pacific (General MacArthur) of Australian forces under his command. It has been known practically from the beginning of the Pacific war that the War Cabinet considers that no technicalities can l i m it the effective use of Australia's protection of Australia's armed forces . . . It can now be authoritatively stated that the Government will regard as territories of Australia for the purpose of the Defence Act any territories which are occupied by Australian forces for the purpose of resisting Japan, and which consequently de facto come under the Australian flag. The newspaper went on to suggest that the Government would not accept kindly any move to have the Defence Act amended by Parliament in order to give formal expression to powers that it might need to exercise before the end of the war. We do not know what is the War Cabinet'3 real mind on the matter. I give the most emphatic denial to the suggestion, if it be made, that any move il/r. Fadden. by members of the Opposition to have tlie Defence Act amended is actuated purely by party political motives. I am fortified in that denial by the letter that I wrote to the Prime Minister, dated the 17th December last, which in temperate language conveyed to the right honourable gentleman the view that the Opposition then held, and afforded incontrovertible evidence of our desire to co-operate in this particular regard. That letter was in the following terms:A t a meeting of the Opposition to-day a discussion centred around the dangerous position iu which Australia finds itself, and which you have publicly stressed in many of your recent utterances. The Opposition took into f u l l consideration the difficulties that confront you and your Government in the defence of Australia and gave very careful consideration to the disabilities that may arise in Australia's defence from the fact that your Government is unable to send militi a troops abroad or to the neighbouring islands or the Dominion of New Zealand owing to the provision in the National Security Act. It appears to the Opposition that it is all important to create an Australian army for the defence of the Commonwealth which the Government can employ anywhere without any statutory restrictions whatsoever. Malaya and the Pacific Islands are as truly part of Australia's defences as are our own coastal forts. In our opinion the Government must be able to employ as it may wish, and as the necessity demands, any Australian troops anywhere, be they voluntarily enlisted or raised under the Defence Act. As the law stands at present, it would bo impossible to reinforce the sister Dominion of New Zealand, or even to send troops to Timor, other than Australian Imperial Force personnel. The Opposition stresses the importance of meeting the enemy outside the shores of Australia as well as within, and the distinction which must be drawn between Australian Imperial Force and militi a at the present moment may seriously hamper the strategy of your Government and interfere, the Opposition feels, with the adequate defence of this country. While having no desire to raise any controversial political question, but animated with a sincere wish to free the hands of your Government, the Opposition would be prepared to give unanimous support to a measure amending the National Security Act in such a manner as to enable the Government to employ any of our troops in any area vitally necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth. The Opposition unanimously desired me to convey the intimation to you in the friendliest possible spirit, and we are animated, I was asked to assure you, by the single desire to assist the Government and to free its hands of what may prove an embarrassment. Swift action may be necessary, and i l appears to us that whilst Parliament is still in session the opportunity should be taken to amend the act so that the Government will not find itself hampered by lack of power, but may by regulation as it thinks f it meet a situation which we all hope will not arise. No action has been taken in connection with that matter. The Opposition is sincere; the Opposition-has been patient. It from the general Opposition, that we have no desire to play politics. The importance of this subject transcends all political considerations. Leti t be clearly understood that the desire of the Opposition to have the Defence Act amended arises only from its anxiety that Australia should be placed in a proper posture for defence and offence against its enemies. to tlie letter? Australia published the statement to which I have previously referred as coming from an authoritative Government source. On the 7th A p r i l , the Brisbane Courier-Mail published the text of a broadcast, which had been made during the 7 o'clock new3 broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It was as follows :The Government will send Militia troops outside Australian territory if necessary. A high Government authority made this clear to-day. The Supreme Commander of the ANZAC forces in the South-western Pacific (General MacArthur) can send troops wherever they lire most needed. The Australian Government had asked that all forces in the South-western Pacific should be under General MacArthur's control. Obviously this request included the Militia as well as the Australian Imperial Force. According to tlie press, no confirmation of this statement was forthcoming from the Prime Minister, or from any other Minister or from any Government authority, but the fact remains that the statement which was first broadcast, and later published in the press, has never been denied by the Prime Minister or by any one on his behalf. I know that speakers will get up on the other side and accuse the Opposition of advocating conscription. Let me point out that, at the present time, we have a very effective form of conscription in Australia. Under Statutory Rule No. 102 the entire manpower of Australia may be conscripted, and rightly so. We have conscription for the raising of a militi a force for use within Australia and its territories, but who knows where the defence outposts of Australia may be in'the future? They may be in the Dutch East Indies, in New Zealand, or in New Caledonia. W ill any one say that the Defence Act should not is clear from that letter and be amended so that our militi a forces attitude of the may be used for the effective defence of Australia in the manner indicated in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's broadcast? We are seeking to put our house in order so that we may be in a position to meet all possible contingencies. We ask that the fighting forces of Australia shall be available for the defence of Australia, if necessary in areas beyond those which Government supporters describe as the continent of Australia. W ill any one deny that we should be able, No . The press in if necessary, to send M i l it i a troops to the defence of New Zealand? If our military advisers say that it is necessary to send forces to New Guinea or New Caledonia, should we not be in a position to send them ? We have merged the Australian Imperial Force and the Australian M i l it a r y Forces. The Australian Imperial Force was originally enlisted for offence and defence wherever they might be required. TheM i l it i a was raised for defensive action within a certain denned area. Now they have been merged into the one force, and if it be found necessary to send troops to the assistance of New Zealand how are we to cull the one section from the other so that only those who enlisted for overseas service may be sent? Surely honourable members opposite can visualize the hopeless chaos which would result from any such attempt. If the proposed amendment were made the decision to send forces for service overseas would still he one for the Government. The Opposition is not trying to dictate to the Government in this matter, or to say where forces should be sent. We merely say that legal power should be taken now to send the forces to any place which the military authorities may recommend, and the Government approve. Now is the time to make the necessary amendment. Wo should not wait until the actual need arises. I have heard it",12,International Affairs Review Of War Situation
7,Mr Holt,Was any reply received,14,International Affairs Review Of War Situation
8,Mr Fadden,"said that there is no legal obstacle to the employment of our military forces overseas, that Australian forces can be compelled to serve wherever the Australian flag ia planted. It is suggested that wherever we plant our flag becomes, for the purposes of the Defence Act, Australian territory. That seems to be a dishonest way of getting round the difficulty. We have been urging this amendment since December last, and I give the lie direct to anyone who says that the Opposition is motivated by political considerations. Our only purpose ia to arm the Government with such powers as may be necessary to enaible it to meet whatever contingency may arise for defensive or offensive action w it h in Australia or beyond it , and it is in that spirit that I submit the motion. Minister) [10.55] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has said that, in order to defend Australia, we must take the offensive, and that the proper place to defend Australia is somewhere at a good distance from Australia. and therefore it is necessary that the M i l it i a , who have been compulsorily called to the colours, should be available for use in the areas so chosen. Let me point out to honourable members that, from the day the war commenced, the present argued that the true defence of Australia was to be conducted at points f a r distant from Australia, and that our fighting forces could be most effectively employed in our defence by being sent to distant theatres, thereby preventing an enemy from acquiring the requisite strength to approach our shores. That was their argument then, and that is their present opinion. Well, what are the facts? The facts are that, notwithstanding these legal impediments-which , by the way, were never discovered while the previous Government was in power-relativel y vast Australian forces did actually fight in distant places,, not in one theatre of war only, but in two-namely , the Middle East and Malaya. due to the Labour party. argument that there exists a legal i m pediment which would prevent Australia fro m reinforcing New Zealand. said that there was a legal impediment which would preclude the use of Australian M i l it i a Forcesi n New Zealand. right honourable gentleman? are doing so, and he should know. gentleman said that the reason for this motion was that there is a legal disability which prevents Australian forces fro m being used in other than Australian territory. In reply, I point out that Australian forces have been used effectively m several places outside Australian territory. honourable gentleman. was hoped that this matter would be discussed calmly. All right, it may he, the Leader of the Opposition. the Leader of the Opposition than his own supporters have. liberate misstatement.

63,Mr Iwtchinson (Deakin) [11.16].,"the brave hearts of the British people, who fought the battle for Britain, democracy by now might have vanished from smashed, what would be the position of the democratic world ? The great United States of America would 'be caught between the forces of the east and the west. Democracy is now threatened because the leaders of democratic countries failed, until nearly too late, to face realities. By his speech to-day, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has shown himself to be another democratic leader who has not awakened to the realities of the situation. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) was directed entirely to one specific point, but in his reply the Prime Minister skated all round the subject, without coming to the real point. It was obvious from the outset that this war would take the new form of total war. That was admitted on all sides. Even before the war started, we had been told very clearly by the Nazi leaders that every man and woman and all materials would have to play their part. It was obvious to every body that we should have to meet the Axis powers on a footing of total war if we were ever to defeat them. The expression "" total war "" has been used as freely by members of the Government as by members of the Opposition, but to talk about total war and not to enact it is mere lip service. If , Force and the Australian Military like ourselves, Great Britain and the United States of America were to fight this war on a purely voluntary basis so far as man-power is concerned, we should not be so optimistic about the outcome as we now are. Times are dark indeed, but they _would be infinitely darker if the powers ranged against the axis countries adopted the voluntary principle in warfare. It was apparent at the beginning of this war that Australia needed one army. Instead of that, owing mainly to the unrealistic attitude of the Labour party, we were given two armies, the voluntary Australian Imperial Force, and the conscripted Australian Military Forces. Many months have passed since it was impressed upon me that, by having two armies, Australia multiplied its dangers. member wake up to that? ter refers to Hansard he will see that in 1940 I warned Parliament of the danthe world. With Britain gers inherent in the two-army system. Men in the Australian Military Forces were invited to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, and they responded in great numbers, witb the result that, whereas the training should have been continuous, in 'both armies, it was constantly interrupted-in the Australian Military Forces by enlistments to the Australian Imperial Force and in the Australian Imperial Force by spasmodic instead of regular increases of recruits. In order to show the dislocation that was caused, I cite the Militia unit at Seymour which was left at one stage, after the men had enlisted, with a few officers, one sergeant and seven men. The existence of two armies, one a voluntary offensive unit, and the other a conscripted defensive unit affects morale. Esprit de corps and the highest possible morale can be gained only when you have one army trained in the psychology of offence. The fact of having in the background a second army that will fight only if the enemy actually invades our territory damages morale and is not calculated to foster amicable relations. In recent months the bitterness and rancour which existed between the Australian Imperial Forces has lessened, but it is still in existence, breeding a lack of confidence between troops. Proof that this is recognized by the Government is to be seen in the fact that the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) has recalled from abroad units of the Australian Imperial Force, because we need them here to stiffen the ranks of the Australian Military Forces. His military advisers no doubt have pointed out in no uncertain terms that, now that Australia is in danger, it would be disastrous not to merge the two armies into one, in order to increase morale and bring the forces as close to perfection as possible in order that this country might be defended, and in order that we might take the offensive at the earliest possible time. We have at present with us a great general who has been appointed to take supreme command over all forces in Australia. Undoubtedly there is some force in the",17,Government Members Withdraw

65,Mr Hutchinson,"If the Minisargument that American troops have come here to save this country, but it is more true that Australia has achieved a position of great strategical importance in the development of the war effort of the Allied Nations. This country must be held, not merely because it is Australia, but because it it, as has been admitted by the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Army, an important base for offensive action. No one believes that when General MacArthur assumed supreme command he visualized sitting behind the seaboard of this country merely to save Australia from its enemies. His immediate object is to save Australia, but his ultimate objective is to develop a force in this country that will permit of offensive action overseas to bring about the ultimate defeat of our common enemies. The Axis powers know that General MacArthur will go after them whenever he can, and we all hope and pray that the day will soon arrive when that will be possible. Acting under government instructions our military forces are being merged into one army; distinctions are being abolished The Government has claimed responsibility for the invitation to bring to Australia General MacArthur to take supreme command over the forces. It is not difficult to visualize that the time will arrive when the danger to Australia will have been removed, when the necessary arms and equipment will have been so built up that General MacArthur and Sir Thomas Blamey will be able to decide that the time has arrived to go after the enemy. It is acknowledged that we cannot win the war in Australia. The Prime Minister said this morning that there were sufficient numbers of the Australian Imperial Force at present in Australia to undertake an offensive expedition. By interjection, I asked the Prime Minister whether his statement was supported by his military advisers, and I defy the right honourable gentleman to prove that his military advisers consider that the number of effective troops for overseas service from Australia is considered to be sufficient for that purpose. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister for the Army can truthfully make that claim at present. Mr Hutchinson. able member know that Ministers cannot truthfully make that claim?

It is no use side-3tepping thiB question, as was done by the Prime Minister to-day. Sooner or later a demand for offensive action must come if we are to win the war-and I believe we are-and we must have adequate forces prepared to meet the demand. If the broadcast speech by the Prime Minister to the people of Great Britain meant anything, undoubtedly we must clear the decks in Australia at once. When the moment, for decision does arrive are we to be expected to meet in this House and take such action as would clearly indicate to the enemy that Australia considered it had reached a stage of efficiency which justified the Army, the Navy and the Air Force in setting forth on an offensive action ? The Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Military Forces are being built up together, with officers returned from theatres of war taking control of the Australian Military Forces at the direction of the Minister for the Army, under what I assume to ibe the considered Government policy.

We would speak with greater power and OUT utterances would be immeasurably more important in councils overseas if appropriate action were taken at this stage. Great Britain, the United States of America and New Zealand already have conscription without territorial limitations; Canada is moving in the same direction, and Australian opinion would be considerably strengthened if our spokesmen were able to say, "" Australia is now on a total war footing. There is no obstacle in the way to what we should do toward winning the war."" Australia would be uplifted as a nation in the eyes of the world, and we could justly demand the right to make our voices heard in the councils of the world. The legal impediments that exist in our Defence Act are a cloak of dishonour on the shoulders of the nation. Our allies know as much about the limitations of our Defence Act as we do. They knew that the impediments existed when we appealed for help in such a way as to give the impression that we were squealing. Surely, it is strange that our allied nations could truthfully claim that while we seek their help we are not prepared to go the whole way ourselves, that when it comes to any action overseas we are ouly prepared to ask men to volunteer for that service. If we continue to intermingle the Australian Imperial Force with the Australian M i l it a r y Forces at a critical period there will be dislocation throughout the whole Army. For the safety and honour of Australia we should remove existing legal impediments in the Defence Act. We must be able to inform our allies that when the time for offensive action arrives we shall be prepared to accompany them. Opposition members have claimed great credit for the manner in which they have co-operated with the Government in the war effort, but to-day we have witnessed a fair example of what they consider to be co-operation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has been driven unwillingly hy a section of his followers to launch what is tantamount to a motion of censure, and to create embarrassment .to remove legal impediments, not only to the Government of Australia but also to our allies overseas', in an effort to bolster the fast-fading political fortunes of their ex-leaders. The Leader of the Opposition laid stress on broadcast statements alleged to have been made by that mysterious individual whom nobody seems to be able to track down"" a Government spokesman "". I propose to read an extract from a report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph in Telation to a rowdy Opposition caucus meeting held yesterday, to show what is really behind this move. The report is as follows:The Opposition's decision to press for thiB is the first serious reverse for Mr Fadden as Opposition leader, and a triumph for the Menzies group. Fadden against it. The proposal was moved by Mr Menzies, who was supported by a strong section of Victorian members, and an almost solid vote from the South Australians. Among his supporters were Messrs. McEwen (Victoria), Spender (New South Wales) and Senator McLeay (South Australia). Those gentlemen probably still think that there is a chance to form a new government. The report continuesThe Menzies group said it was ridiculous for' the Government to talk of merging the Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Militia Force when it could not send the Australian Militia Force outside Australian territory. They also argued that American troops in Australia were mainly conscripts, and Australia could not expect America to send maximum aid if she was not prepared to send all her own troops to any theatre. Mr Fadden, the United Australia party leader ( Mr Hughes), Mr Spooner (New South Wales) and Mr Anthony (New South Wales), opposed the proposal. This report, which indicates an intimate knowledge of happenings at the Opposition caucus meeting yesterday, concludes with the following remarks:Mr Menzies' success in the party room to-day is significant because of persistent reports that he intends challenging Mr Hughes for the United Australia party leadership. It is reported also that if he succeeds hf will later attempt to oust Mr Fadden fron. the Opposition leadership. It is argued that Mr Menzies was certain of victory to-day because the majority of the Opposition has always advocated conscription. In a fight for the leadership he might not command such strong support. It is obvious that this amendment has been moved not in the interests of Australia or of the Commonwealth Government, or of the war effort, but as",19,Government Members Withdraw

The purpose of the mOve is to enable Mr Menzies first to decapitate the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) as leader of the United Australia party and then to become a Richmond in the field against Mr plank from its platform-whic h is not Eadden for the leadership of the Opposition. As that is what is behind this move, it was not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition showed such a ' noticeable laek of enthusiasm in submitting the amendment. have been told that the object of the Opposition is to remove a legal impediment. That impediment could have been removed at any time during the two years of war for which the present Opposition held the reins of government, particularly as throughout that period it commanded a majority in both Houses of the Parliament. But no action to that end was taken. It is only since certain members of the Opposition have found themselves on the left of Mr Speaker that they have felt this itch to remove the so-called legal impediment. Wo have been told that this move is not designed to introduce conscription for overseas service. Oh, no! Perish the thought! Honourable gentlemen opposite realize that "" conscription for overseas service "" would not be a popular cry in the electorates. They know, too, that the position of the Curtin Government has been strengthened greatly by its action in bringing the Australian Imperial Force back to Australia. The Opposition would not openly advocate conscription for overseas service at the moment, for that would not provide them with good political capital. But, in a hypocritical spirit, they have not hesitated to hold up the business of the country in order to promote the political ambitions of certain of their former leaders. The so-called legal impediment which they profess t,o desire to remove has existed for about 40 years. This amendment has been moved, 1. repeat, not to assist the Government but to assist individual members of th-; Opposition. If the Government desired to take such action as is implied in th? amrtidtneittj it could do so without the assistance of thu Opposition. But this Government is pledged to give effect, to the platform of the Labour party, one plank of which provides that appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that no Australian citizen shall be conscripted for military service overseas. If the Labour party desires to remove that ' the case-ther e is a means by which effective action can be taken. Why did not the Opposition take action to attain its desired end when it was still in control of the affairs of the We country? Obviously, honourable gentlemen opposite arc relying upon the old shibboleth that the defence of Australia should be conducted anywhere but in Australia. They are standing by the theory that they have held for years that Australia should be defended wherever there is, or may be, a war frontier. But that idea has been exploded. This war has proved to be too mobile for theories of that description. A situation has now arisen which has made it necessary for the Government to bring back to this country the many thousands of men that the previous Government sent away from it bo other theatres of war. The Prime Minister has informed us that without a provision such as is sought in the amendment we have at present more volunteers available for overseas service than were raised and sent to war theatres overseas by the last Government. We must bear in mind that Australia is so seriously menaced to-day by the Japanese that we cannot afford to send our soldiers overseas. All the talk of the Opposition about conducting an offensive immediately must be regarded as sheer humbug while Australia is menaced in the north by greatly superior forces of Japanese. As we could not see any prospect of obtaining help from Great Britain to defend this country, we have relied upon support from tie United States of America. Because American assistance has been forthcoming we have been able to gather substantial forces to help us to save the country if it should be invaded. But however fast we may be able to manufacture munitions and mobilize and equip our armies, we shall be hard pressed, with the forces at our command. Everything possible is being done by the Government to mobilize the resources of the country in order to keep",20,Government Members Withdraw

No more deadly blow could have been aimed at the Australian people than the moving of this amendment. I cannot conceive of a more effective fifth-column job being done outside this House than is being done inside it by the Opposition to-day. statement. rageous or not I shall substantiate it . The honourable member for In d i ( Mr McEwen) knows very well the degree to which Australia is dependent upon the United States of America for assistance in the immediate future, but, in my view nothing could be more calculated to embarrass this Government endeavours to secure further assistance fro m America, nothing could do more to strengthen isolationists and America, than the moving of this amendment in this Parliament. Opposition is this morning providing ammunition for those people overseas who are working in the interests of the Axis and against those of the United States of America and Australia. Sections of the American press will certainly cite this debate as a reason for stating that the people of America should not continue to help Australia, because the Australian Government is not prepared to conscript Australians for overseas service. repercussions should not surprise us. There was no need whatever for honourable gentlemen opposite to raise this issue, for it can do nothing to help the war effort. In our present circumstances, it is humbug to talk about conducting an offensive from. Australian territory in the near future. Our first business is to organize ourselves so that we may meet the menace that faces us in the north. We must do everything possible to prevent the Japanesef r o m landing in Australia. The carrying of this amendment could do nothing effective to achieve that end. No one can tell when, or where, the war will end. It may he that it w ill end with the American colleagues still on Australian territory, but our present necessity is unquestionably to concentrate our forces within Australian territory. T t is for the reasons I have given that I consider the moving of this aanendment to be a deadly fifth-column job; the contention that the action has been taken to assist the Government carries no weight whatever with me. Without question, what has been done w ill em'barrass the Government and hinder its efforts to protect the in terests of the people and to help in the T h a t is an outrageous winning of the war. -The Prime Minister( MrO u r t in ) stated in his concluding remarks that the amendment had been moved because of the desire of certain dissatisfied members of the Opposition to .rehatdlitate themselves. in its ter far Labour and National Service( Mr. Ward) thinks that I tun included in that number, he is welcome to his' opinion; the hands of the but I shall certainly support the amendfifth columnists in ment.

My most intimate friends here and elsewhere know that I have always opposed the view that we should have conscripted our men early in the period of this war and sent them overseas to fight. I have on other occasions given my reasons for that view. The conscription issue is not behind this move. The fact is that the men of this country have alSuch ready been conscripted. The ground upon which a battle is fought influence.' the result very greatly, but it matters little to the soldiers engaged. OnceI am compelled by law lo fight, the spot whereon T fight does not interest me at all. We have heard in the past about industrial conscription. Industrial conscription is now in force.

I remind the House that the forces are mixed to-day. Men who enlisted and were trained in the Australian Imperial Force are now being attached to Militia units, and officers taken from the Australian Imperial Force have been transferred to the Australian Military Forces or the Militia, as it is commonly called; yet the one section will be sent wherever needed, whilst the other will not. The word "" morale "" is freely used. I have heard it in this House, over the air. and from the pulpit. the opinion that quite a lot of those who use it do not know its meaning. I hope that the Prime Minister does. I cannot imagine anything that would be so detrimental to tlie morale of any force as to be regarded as inferior. Certainly, the Australian Military Forces are to-day regarded as inferior by members of the Australian Imperial Force as well as by the people generally. I regret that tremendously. To the degree that my influence can'be exerted, I have used it in order to prevent this conflict between the two forces; but, unfortunately, it exists. The one decisive way of removing it is to place all on the same basis. If for no other reason, I am bound to vote for the amendment because of the effect which the present position must have upon the young members of the militia force, many of whom were willing and anxious to fight outside Australia but were not allowed to do so. I suggest with all respect that the Prime Minister has never been heard to greater disadvantage in this Parliament than he was to-day. He did not answer any of the points that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr well as happenings in the party rooms, Fadden). opnortunity to replv. . opportunity permitted by the Standing Orders, and was not nearly so greatly interrupted as was the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think that he himself could complain of the treatment that he received. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) cannot he excluded from the ranks of those wh« offend by interjecting. The Prime Minister said a lot about what he would term "" strategy "". That word also is loosely used. As a matter of fact, there is little scope for strategy in Australia today. What is perfectly obvious will, of necessity, be done. We do not know at what point in Australia the enemy may land, but in his offensive war he is not handicapped, as is our high command, by not being allowed to use any of his forces wherever they are required. In reply to an interjection that I made, the Prime Minister said that there is a sufficient number of Australians in this country I am of to take the offensive at any time. That is a completely absurd statement. I do not know precisely the number of Australian troops that we have at our disposal to use overseas, if necessary, but it is not greater than three divisions. Even if they were up to full strength, they would not be nearly sufficient to recover what has been lost and drive the attack right home to Japan; and if there should be fighting in Australia, obviously their ranks will be depleted. The Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) has definitely stated that no militiamen are to be permitted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. How, then, does he propose that the Australian Imperial Force shall be reinforced ? tralian Military Forces are daily being enrolled in an Australian Imperial Force reserve, and when the Government decides that it is necessary to send forces outside Australia they will be available for service at any point at which they may be required, as members of the Australian Imperial Force. which often misrepresents Ministers as has definitely stated that the Minister said that no member of the Militia would be allowed to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force.

I am not one of those foolish people who think that they can predict what the enemy is likely to do; the best brains in the Army are merely guessing, but it will be acknowledged by any thinking man that it is not unlikely that Japan would send a force sufficient to occupy New Zealand at any time suitable to its purpose.

We could not hold up onr heads if we did not apply to our own men a degree of compulsion equal to that applied to the forces from America, who are here in our country ready to help to defend it, and ready to take the war to the enemy's territory. Surely we are willing to do our part! We should be shamed in the eyes of the world for ever. We should be ashamed of ourselves whenever we looked an American in the face. The overwhelming majority of the militiamen would be ashamed of themselves if they had to go into battle side by side with the Australian Imperial Force, and were, not on precisely the same footing of being obliged to_ fight wherever the High Command said that the fight should take place. If there were no other reason, that would be sufficient, to warrant the action proposed by the Opposition. We should not wait until the time arrives to "" raise the flag "" outside of Australia. How can the flag be raised outside of Australia if we will not use our force out of Australia?

My feeling of relief arose from the fact that,' on the 6th April last, the statement was broadcast throughout Australia that this Government, by an evasion of the Defence Act, might conscript persons for overseas service. Statements to the same effect appeared in the daily newspapers on the following day and during the following week. The answer made by the Prime Minister to this amendment dispels, I think, any fear that the Government will resort to compulsion for overseas service by either an amendment or an evasion of the Defence Act. For that reason, I am glad that the amendment has been moved, whatever may be the fate of it. I am pleased that the Government is nailing its colours to the mast, and has declared that it will not depart from the traditional policy of the party and the movement that it represents. However, from one point of view, I regret that the amendment has been moved, because I regard it as tending to divide the people of Australia, and to put fear into the hearts of the parents of those men who are being called up for the defence of Australia. ashamed of their boys. is that there is no moral obligation on Australians to fight for the defence of any territory other than Australian territory. That is my view and the view of the party with which I have been associated for a long time. That is also the view of the people of Australia. is now talking about the "" conchies "". do not recant my opinions so quickly as does the honourable member for Bendigo. It is not so long ago since he made a declaration in this House against conscription for overseas service, pointing out what might be the result if Australia were denuded of men by sending them to serve overseas. opinion. Defence Bill introduced in this House in 1901 contained a provision which, upon examination, showed that it was the desire of the Barton Government to be able to send Australians to serve, not only in any part of Australia and its territories, but also in any place on the face of the earth. Credit for exposing that design-becaus e it was wrapped up in words-is due to the late Mr Justice Higgins, who was then a member of this Parliament. When the exposure was made, the whole House rose against the proposal, not the Labour party only, but the rank and file of all parties. The bill reappeared in 1902 in an amended form, but even then it did not satisfy members of the House, and they were not content until a provision had been inserted to the effect that no member of the Military Forces, even of the Permanent Forces, could be required to serve outside of Australia and its territories without his consent. The only issue which divided them was whether the prohibition should extend to the territories of Australia. Some, including Mr Higgins, thought that men should not even be sent to the overseas territories of Australia withoul their consent, whilst others thought thai there should be power to do this. Section 49 of the Defence Act stood unaltered and unaffected until 1939. In that year the government of the day introduced a bill which, in my opinion, and in that of some others, extended the obligation of military service, because it specifically provided that Australians might he compelled to serve in the mandated territories administered by Australia. The position to-day is that no member of the Australian Military Forces, even if he be a professional soldier, can be required to serve outside Australia and the territories of Australia and the mandated territories administered by Australia without his consent, or unless he has specifically enlisted for that service. That position has not stood without challenge. There were two attempts to alter it. In 1916, the Government led by the right honourable member for North Sydney a.= he now is ( Mr Hughes) asked the people by referendum to say whether they were I have not changed my prepared to give the government the same power in relation to service overseas as it enjoyed in. regard to service for the defence of Australia.

Tbat referendum was taken, not because the consent of the people to the alteration of tbe act was necessary, but because a majority of honourable members in both Houses, and especially a majority in the Senate, were opposed to any such alteration. It was thought that a favorable expression of opinion from the people would overawe them. In spite of the fact that every organ of public opinion in Australia, except the Labour party, was in favour of the alteration, the people of Australia refused to approve. During the next election, the right honourable member for North Sydney had to give a specific pledge to the electors that the question would never be raised again. Ifc gave that promise in 1917, and broke it at the end of the same year. He did i.'ike another referendum, and the people again rejected his proposal, this time by M larger majority. In this referendum, not only did New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia vote against conscription, but Victoria also voted against it. The Labour movement of Australia passed through the fire of that struggle, and many of the men now prominent in its direction owe their position to the stand they then took. I refer particularly to the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin), the Minister for Social Services( Mr Holloway) and the Prime Minister himself ( Mr Curtin). As young men, their opinion upon this subject was formed in the course of that st ruggle. I speak as one who is no longer a member of the political organization of Labour, but I believe that there is no possibility of the Labour party unitedly accepting conscription, or even of a majority accepting it. I honestly believe that this motion is now being pressed largely with the intention and hope of breaking up the Labour movement in Australia and dividing the political Labour party. Several honourable members have said that there is no difference in principle between compelling a man to serve for the defence of his own homeland, and compelling him to go overseas to fight, f believe that there is a great difference. think, perhaps, that this is a favorThoughI dislike military compulsion of any kind, my objection to compulsory service for home defence is quite different from my objection to compulsory service for overseas. I object to compulsory service for home defence, because I cannot conceive of any adequate protection being afforded by the law to that small, honest minority which the honourable member for Bendigo despises so much, the conscientious objectors. There are not many of them. They have not many votes, and some never vote at all, but they honestly believe that it is wrong to bear arms in any circumstances, that it is wrong to resist evil by means of evil. The law of Australia does not protect them. There is. however, a vast difference in principle between compelling a man to serve in defence of his own homeland and compelling him to serve overseas. When a man is fighting in defence of his homeland he is fighting against an enemy who has come there as an unmistakable aggressor. Every natural instinct compels him to defend, not only his beloved soil, but also his wife, his children and his parents. Natural instinct, apart from law, would call .upon men to rise in defence of their homeland. The law .of nations recognizes this, because it is provided that if an army invades another country, the whole people of the country are entitled to take uo arms to repel the invader. It is recognized that although the people may rise without military training, and fight without military organization, they will, if they act openly, be regarded as combatants, and be entitled to be treated as such. There is no real difference between the levee en masse-the organized rising of the invaded people-and the citizen armythe same people organized. Compulsion to serve for the defence of one's homeland is vastly different from compulsion to serve in another man's country. Once a man takes the oath of enlistment, he is bound to obey orders, and he may be given orders which violate this natural instinct. Men so enlisted may be required to carry war to other countries against whose people they have no quarrel whatever. They may be required to put down insurrection among the Burmese, the peoples of India or of Indonesia who able opportunity to rise for the liberation of their country. Australians can have no conceivable quarrel with coloured peoples who wish to win their freedom from the white races, and there should be no risk of Australians being employed against them. When a man is called npon to defend his own soil, there can be no doubt that the person assailing that soil is his enemy, and the enemy of the institutions he holds dear, but when he goes overseas to fight, he may find himself opposed to those with whom he has no quarrel. The essential difference is that in the one case compulsion merely enforces a moral obligation, and is instrumental in providing an effective organization; in the other, compulsion goes against a man's natural instincts. A good deal has been said of the fact that American conscripts are serving in Australia. The fact that they are here constitutes a breach of the promise given by the Government of the United States to its own people. The provision for the selected draft would never have been accepted by the people of the United States of Americai f President Franklin Roosevelt had not given a solemn promise that conscripted men would never be sent to serve overseas. The selected draft provides for service in the United States of America, including the territory of the Philippines, but not for service beyond those areas. Speaking in October, 1940, President Roosevelt said :Your boys are not going to be sent to any foreign wars. They are going into training to form a force so strong that by its very existence it will keep the tnreat of war far away from our shores. In December of the same year he invited his hearers to nail down as deliberate lies any talk of sending armies to Europe, tt is not my wish that Americans should he compelled to serve in Australia. After the alteration of the American act, I read statements in newspapers published in the United States that there was as yet no question of compelling conscripts to serve overseas, and that forces required for service abroad would comprise volunteers recruited from among the selected draftees. Be that as it may, the fact that the United States of America, Great Britain and New Zealand have imposed conscription upon their people, for oversea service, whilst Canada may follow suit, does not influence me. Those countries Mr RJaokbitrn. introduced conscription during the las; war. In New Zealand, persons who were conscientious objectors in 1914-18 are now vigorously enforcing the conscription of the young manhood of that dominion. Australia rejected conscription in 1916 and 1917, and I believe that the opinion of the country is still opposed to it. The greatest difficulty will be experienced in securing men for military service if they understand that there is a danger of their being compelled to fight in distant theatres. If the Government allows them to believe that, after having been recruited specifically for home defence, they may later be despatched overseas against their will, that belief will destroy their morale. Any one who wished to demoralize and divide the Australian people could achieve his purpose by no device so effective as the means to which the Opposition has resorted. However, the amendment will now provide Parliament with an opportunity to decide the matter. It will not be necessary to resort to an evasion of the Defence Act. The position in Canada is that during the last war, the French Canadians as a body were opposed to conscription. A national government, consisting of Conservatives and Liberals from Provinces other than Quebec, was formed, and it succeeded in imposing conscription upon the people. The present Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Mackenzie King, was defeated because he opposed it. No intelligent person believes that the recent referendum in Canada makes certain the introduction of conscription. The Liberal party, which depends upon the support of Quebec, would hardly dare to introduce it, because 72 per cent, of the electors in that Province voted against the proposal. Indeed, the purpose of the referendum was only to secure the release of the Government from its election promise not to impose conscription. At the federal elections in 1940, most explicit pledges were given by the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) and other members, including the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), that the United Australia party-United Country party Government would not introduce conscription. In fact, the right honourable member for Kooyong was so anxious to make his position clear that in 1939 he inserted in the national security legislapleas of honourable members opposite, to tion a clause designed to prevent the introduction by regulation of conscription for service overseas. When, in 1940. the right honourable member for Kooyong again amended the National Security Act, he inserted a provision to the effect that no regulation made under the National Security Act shall enable the Government to impose an obligation of any kind of service overseas. That provision recognized the instinctive feeling of the Australian people. The conception of liberty is embodied in certain principles. Edmund Burke said that to British peoples liberty is not an abstract generalization but crystallines itself about some definite immunity or freedom. Eor the English people, the most important immunity was that of freedom from taxation without representation. To us here it is the freedom from compulsory overseas' service. The greatest blow which the Labour movement of Australia struck for liberty defeated the conscription referendums of 1916 and 1917. Ever since, the Labour movement has been alert to preserve and encourage a widespread feeling against conscription for service overseas. honourable member for Dalley( Mr( Mr Hutchinson) supported the motion Rosevear) stated, the platform of the Labour party contains a provision that an anti-conscription plankshould be included in the Commonwealth Constitution. Once it was placed there, it could be amended not by Parliament, but only hy the people. Whatever happens in Australia, it will never be found that a government led by the right honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) and containing such members as the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin), and the Minister for Health( Mr Holloway) will be responsible for amending the Defence Act for the purpose of sending men overseas against their will. If that amendment is ever carried, the government responsible will be composed of members of the United Australia party and the United Country party. Perhaps a national government might force the amendment upon the country, but such an action would not be taken with the approval and consent of the Labour movement. Is the House prepared, after hearing the weak adopt a policy which will be opposed at every stage by the Australian Labour movement ? The plea has been made that units of the Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Military Forces are so intermingled that they cannot be disentangled and that in the circumstances, the Government must send all or none overseas. That position was foreseen long ago, because the Defence Act provides that no member even of the Permanent Forces shall be sent abroad without his consent. If the Government desires to raise forces for service in distant theatres of war, the men can be recruited. That is not beyond the capacity of the country. Some honourable members opposite declare that it is an insult to say to the Australian Military Forces that they cannot be compelled to serve abroad. That is absurd. The insult is offered when a man is told that he will be forced to serve. If a man is prepared to fight overseas, no obstacle is placed in bis way. I hope that the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition will meet the fate that it deserves. As the The honourable member for Deakin unreservedly.

Health( Mr Holloway) is entitled to his view. There is plenty of scope for differences of opinion upon this subject, but it is a legitimate matter for discussion. I deeply regret that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). should allege that party political considerations compelled the Leader of the Opposition to raise the matter. the allegation of the Prime Minister that the discussion was promoted by a few disappointed politicians who sought to rehabilitate themselves. In this Parliament, no mind is more resourceful in debate than the mind of the Prime Minister, and the fact that he was obliged to descend to such an allegation seriously reflects upon the case which he was called upon to justify. ing the truth. is great harm in damaging the cause of democracy. The Parliament of the Commonwealth is one of the few remaining legislatures founded upon democratic principles.

The facts confronting Australia to-day form the basis upon which the issue should be discussed. I repeat that this dominion and the Dominion of New Zealand are in graver jeopardy than any other belligerent nation. When I say that, I speak in the widest terms, because history provides many instances of nations, particularly in Europe which have gone to war and been defeated and yet have maintained their national existence, but one could not imagine that the terms of any peace compulsorily imposed upon Australia and New Zealand would contain any less a condition than a termination of the right and privilege, which both countries have hitherto exercised, of controlling the character and volume of immigration. Roth countries are sparsely occupied and are near to other Pacific countries occupied by teeming millions. If we were to lose, even for a decade, the right to control immigration, the British character of the population of the two dominions would pass for ever. Australia would cease to be a British nation. That is why I say that Australia and New Zealand are confronted with grimmer possibilities in defeat than any",28,Government Members Withdraw

121,Be Mr Moewen,"The importance ofother nation. It behoves us, therefore, to marshal every military resource of which we are capable for the achievement of victory. Happily, we are not -oalicd upon to fight alone. We fight in combination with very powerful allies, -our British kinsmen, the English-speaking people of the United States of America, and, in this theatre, the Dutch, .and, in other theatres, with other allies. Those who are fighting with us in this theatre came here, not specifically for the purpose of ensuring the security of Australia, but to concentrate their forces in order, we hope, to fight outside Australia so that the security of, not only Australia, but also every other allied country, might be procured by tbe defeat of our enemies. It is impossible to contemplate the securing of Australia merely by preparing to repel invaders from our shores. Eveni f we were successful temporarily in keeping the enemy from Australia, the threat to our national security would continue while the enemy remained undefeated. So, our allies come here, solicited and unsolicited, voluntarily and conscripted, for the purpose of achieving a powerful allied concentration in order that the enemy may be defeated. We welcome them, because we are glad to have their help, but it would be neither the heart nor will of the Australian people, by placing limitations upon our co-operation in the great objective, to play any less a part in the defeat of the enemy than that which our allies have set for themselves. Does any one think that the Japanese Empire can be defeated merely by preventing the Japanese from landing in Australia? Of course they could not be defeated by that means alone. Security can be achieved only by the defeat of the Japanese, which can he obtained only by fighting them wherever they be, on these shores, if they come here, or overdebate is to continue that education of seas, if they do not. That is the objective of the Americans and the Dutch, and I am sure that it is what the Australians intend to do, and to achieve that objective we must marshal all our military resources. The Prime Minister has intimated that the Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, but only certain units of the Australian army, are available for that purpose. That does not indicate a complete marshalling of Australia's military strength. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition does not give a direction to the Government; it intimates that it is the will of this Parliament that the Government should place itself in possession of the authority which would enable Australians to go forward with our allies to the ultimate defeat of our enemies. Surely an issue so important as that must be accepted as being lifted above party political alignments. It is unworthy to suggest that differences of opinion which exist indicate an endeavour to obtain personal advancement. We have men of the Australian Military Forces stationed on the mainland of New Guinea where they are subjected daily to enemy attacks. On that mainland there are Japanese forces which, we believe, are concentrating preparatory to an attack on this country. There is an artificial boundary which divides the mainland of New Guinea into three sections-the Australian Mandated Territory, Papua, and Dutch New Guinea. The Australian Military Forces stationed there are legally debarred from passing the boundary into Dutch New Guineaan intolerable situation. No Australian will claim that our militia should not be guarding our outposts. Yet, there was a time when members of the Commonwealth Parliament resisted vehemently the proposal that it should be made legally possible to send Militia forces to New Guinea. They do not continue their resistance to-day. In other words, the circumstances have shown that the precaution then taken to give to the Australian Government legal authority to garrison New Guinea was right and proper. Certain elements, not only in political life, but also in the outside community, have to be educated to the military necessities. The purpose of this those who need it to the point of understanding why it is necessary for further legal limitations on the disposition of our forces to be removed. If it be right that, the Militia should be on the mainland of New Guinea, could it be wrong for them to be stationed, on the adjoining islands of Timor, Amboina, New Caledonia, and the Solomons. long way from New Guinea.

If compulsory military training had been introduced in this country before the war, not only would there have been perhaps 250,000 trained men at the outbreak of war, but also, and more important, there would have been the equipment for them. The refusal of the Labour party to accept the doctrine of compulsory military training in days of peace is the basic explanation of the shortage of equipment at the outbreak of war. The policy which was objected to by Labour in days of peace is now accepted. Immediately after the outbreak of war opposition was raised in this House by the present Prime Minister and the Labour party to the despatch of an expeditionary force from Australia, but supporters of the Government now agree that that was a wrong policy to adopt. Because the Labour party lags behind in this matter, it is not to be expected that the people will realize the error of their ways, unless the facts are brought before them lucidly. The purpose of the debate is to continue the education, in the interests of the security and the honour of Australia, It is an uncomfortable feeling to realize that whilst we are prepared to accept the Dutch and British personnel, and have asked for their assistance in the defence of the country, we are not prepared to organize the military manhood of the country on a basis that will enable our allies to be accompanied beyond the shores of Australia, shoulder to shoulder, in the final effort to overthrow our enemies. We have sought aeroplanes and equipment from overseas, and the aeroplanes that we have received were partly made by women industrially conscripted in Great Britain. Yet, while asking for and accepting this help, we still maintain a legal condition which renders it impossible for the greater part of the Austerritory. It is a reflection on the honour of Australia, as well as a contriI ask honourable members to reflect on these subjects. I regret the temporary absence from the chamber of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles). He forwarded to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), who at the time was Prime Minister, a letter in which he set out 21 points clearly and concisely, as expressing his considered views on what should be done to enable Australia to play its part in the allied cause. The point promoted to first place wasTo prosecute the war till victory is won, supplying men and materials wheresoever the Government considers essential. That is the essence of the subject now before the chamber. The contention that it would be militarily practicable to disintegrate the Australian Army by selectively withdrawing certain personnelthe memhers of the Australian Imperial Force at present being merged in the Australian Military Force-fro m it and then despatching that selected body of troops on an overseas expedition is a figment of the imagination. One of the main lessons to be learnt from this war is that it is essential that a military expeditionary force shall be adequately trained before it is called on to fight.

The honourable member for Indi said that he wished to deal with the subject calmly, but, in fact, he delivered a most impassioned speech, which I consider can do nothing but harm.

Not by any stretch of the imagination can the changein the military situation be advanced as a justification for the changed attitude of the honourable gentleman. For this reason, I consider that the stand he is now taking is dictated by political' considerations. A leading article which appeared in the Canberra Times this morning on this subject contained the following paragraph:The promised debate will serve to acerbatefeelings on an issue which will solve itself when the time comes for action. Meanwhile, a debute on the issue at the present time cannot fail to create doubts and misunderstandings in Allied countries to whom we have pledged ourselves iu the fight and to whom we look for assistance. We in Australia know that our pledge will be kept, but nothing could be more mischievously calculated than a move which would needlessly disturb public opinion in other countries where perhaps a higher sense of responsibility exists even n.uioiigs.t the politically frustrated and rejected. Undoubtedly this step by the Opposition will adversely affect public opinion overseas in respect of Australia, and, for that, the politically frustrated and rejected honourable gentlemen opposite ' will be responsible. Undoubtedly, also, the action of the Opposition in raising this disputatious issue which, historically, has created more dissension in this country in yeans past than any other issue, has been so ill-advised and destructive of national unanimity that even sections of the nonCanberra Times, which has never been a Labour newspaper, has correctly designated this amendment as politically mischievous.

There can be small wonder that this amendment is being regarded as mischievous, because inevitably it must cause strife. Its jarring effect will undoubtedly cause disputation and heated controversy at a time when all our efforts should be concentrated on the winning of the war. An .amendment of the Defence Act such as that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition could not add one iota to Australia's war effort, but it undoubtedly will add to the unfortunate influences which are making for disintegration at a time when cohesion is desirable because our national existence is in peril. The honourable member for Indi held the portfolio of Minister for Air in the previous administration, and he must know as well as I doI have followed him as Minister for Air-that members of the Royal Australian Air Eorce are prepared to go anywhere on active service. That also is true of the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Imperial Eorce. Many men in the Australian Military Forces are willing to serve abroad, but they realize clearly that their best service in these days can be rendered in this country. In fact, it is far more necessary that they should serve here now than that they should be sent to some other theatre of war. If the need arises to send them abroad they will willingly undertake that service. In these circum.stances I must express my regret that honourable gentlemen opposite should have selected this particular time to introduce this contentious subject. Their .action can do nothing to promote internal harmony or increase goodwill to Australia abroad. The Leader of the Opposition, cannot feel proud of the support that he has received for his amendment. It has been almost pathetic to hear the declarations of some honourable gentlemen opposite that this move to amend the Defence Act has not been introduced in order to strengthen the case for conscription for overseas military service. The Prime Minister has put the attitude of the Labour party clearly, and I do not think that there is anything further that I can say usefully on the subject. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) have also dealt effectively with such criticism as has been offered of our attitude. I conclude by asserting that honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber are just as loyal and patriotic to Australia and desirous of playing their part in the war effort: as are honourable gentlemen opposite.* We have no desire to introduce any issue which will have a damaging effect on public morale. We believe that, this move has been made for purely political purposes. matter now before the House is not. one for allegation and counter-allegation concerning the loyalty and patriotism of honourable members. The problem before us requires careful and considered judgment and should be regarded as of first-class importance. I have been disappointed in the two speeches delivered by Ministers. Each honourable gentleman has attempted merely to score some minor debating points. I am not concerned about what might have appeared in the pages of Hansard years ago. If I am told that I failed to meet the position when my Government was in office I admit quite frankly that I must accept my share of the responsibility. It is true that as Prime MinisterI did not introduce a measure to give effect .to this proposal. But the House itself must also accept responsibility. Public opinion has taken a long time to develop in Australia, and the general public, too, must carry its share of responsibility. But what will it boot us if , because action was not taken in the past, we merely examine what Jones, Brown or Robinson may have said without taking action in the present? What we have to deal with now is the problem of 1942. What we do with this -problem in 1942 may have a great deal to do with what will happen to us in 1943.

Maybe that is right in one sense, but in another sense it is quite wrong because it is based upon the fallacy that men may be sent outside Australia on-a sudden inspiration. How did the Japanese come down upon Malaya with such diabolical swiftness and in such vast numbers? They did it because, for months, and for all we know, for years, they had been practising combined operations in the use of aircraft, naval craft, and armed forces. Doubtless the Germans also engaged in such practice operations before Is it designed simply to defend Australia they actually employed them in war. The capacity to perform such operations does not spring full-fledged from nowhere. It is the result of long planning and careful Australia that we could escape invasion organization. What is our position in Australia?' moment we have back with us large numbers of the Australian Force. It is also true that we have here large armies belonging either to new formations of the Australian Imperial Force, or to reinforcements of it, or to the Australian Military Forces, commonly known as the Militia. I ask the Minister for tbe Army to consider these questions: Is he keeping these various arms of the fighting services separate? Is he proposing to aggregate them in one force? Doas he intend to placard one section of tbese forces, "" Not to go abroad"", and another section of them "" To go abroad "" ? Who am I , who is any one in this House, The whole essence of the army re-organization plans about which we have read in the newspapers recently is that we shall have one force. Allied Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, and he has under him the Mr Meneies. Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey, who,, in turn, has under him staff commanders and commanders of corps and divisions. Is it intended that any corps shall contain only militiamen? Of course notl The corps will consist partly of militiamen and partly of members of the Australian Imperial Force. These two forces will be blended into one organization which, at its apex, will have one supreme commander. In the last resort thesupreme commander will be related to oneallied strategy. We may say, in effect, that the total force at our disposal in Forces, and the American Forces which,, together, will form one army under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. That seems to me to be a state of affairs which does not call for a lot of tediousantiquarian research on the subject of conscription. It requires the application of horse sense in the determination of whst we ought to do in the face of such circumstances. The next step is this: That being our organization what is it designed to -do!' from actual invasion? If that be the whole purpose of it, I take leave to remind this House and the people of and still lose this war. It would be a It is true that at this miserable, narrow conception of this war were we to say that the only function Imperial of this great army, including the Americans, is to prevent the enemy from actually setting foot upon Australian territory or conquering it. Why, sir, it is clear to every body that Australia's prime significance in this war arises from the fact that this country is visualized by so many people as a base from which ultimately blows may be delivered against the enemy where thp enemy lives. Consequently, this is a force that is provided and organized not only for defence, but also for an offensive. to say when an offensive shall come? Sitting in our chairs, we may say that it looks as though many long months We have a supreme must elapse before we can act on the offensive. One thing that has happened in this war is that the prophets have been, falsified every tima remember a solitary time-table worked out in this war that has not been proved utterly absurd in the final event. With that general picture of the position, I merely want to indicate very shortly why I support the amendment. Perhaps the reason is implicit in what I have already said. The first point that I want to make in elaboration of what .1"" have been saying is-and it is a commonplace of this war-the utter fluidity, the utter mobility of the events that have taken place in it. At one time it might have been said that to take an army to a hostile country, in rugged territory, through jungles, for a distance of 500 miles, was an operation that might be expected to occupy months. It has been proved in this war that it might occupy hardly more than a few days. It might have been said, as recently as the beginning of December of last year, that , it was impossible for Japanese bombers to raid Pearl Harbour; yet they did it ! If there is one thing that we ought to have learned, it is that fluidity is of the the Australian Imperial Force. We know essence of this war. Fancy the absurdity of having this great land army built up in Australia organized on a completely inter-mixed basis, and at the same time preserving a state of affairs which, until it be altered, will make immobile a portion of that army, will make it necessary to break up that army in order to achieve mobility and to send it to another place! It is time that we re-organized our ideas on the subject of armies. If this war has taught us anything, it should 'have taught us that. What would we say about a ship of war, some of the crew of which, were bound, not to leave Australian waters except of their own free will, and the rest of the crew of which had enlisted for service in any part of the world ? Every body, of course, would laugh at such a spectacle; they would say "" This is an utter absurdity. The shiD carries one set of guns, as one operaone way in which that may be secured, tional purpose, yet some of its men are bound to stay here and some are bound to go there"". What essential difference is there, in these days, between the organization of a battleship and the organization of a military division? What would we say of a squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force if some I cannot of the members of its crews had enlisted for service anywhere in the world, whilst others, coming in under compulsory training, were not bound to go anywhere in the world? What sort of mobility would a squadron of that kind have? Yet, Ministers and members who would never dream of suggesting that such an illustration was anything but fantastic, see nothing fantastic at all in an army corps in Australia, under one commander, having one division that can go abroad, a brigade of another division that can go abroad, two brigades which cannot be sent abroad, and so on, each element not kept separate but woven inextricably into the total fabric. That, sir, is a denial of every military principle. The second thing that I want to say is thisI talk about this quite bluntly, because, we are grown-up people and might as well face some of these unpleasant circumstances: There is at this moment in this country a good deal of mutual criticism between the two armies -the Australian Military Forces and perfectly well-w e hear it on all sidesthat there is in the Australian Imperial Force, with the best will in the world, a disposition to make side remarks at the Militia, to suggest that the Militia is a secondary force; that, not having gone abroad, the members of it are, so to speak, chocolate soldiers. right honourable gentleman was Prime Minister. to know when it, started, but I am very much concerned to know what its results are to-day, when these two forces must, for the safety of this country, be welded into one force. There cannot be morale in a total army unless there be mutual confidence and respect among the component parts of it. There is only and that is by making it clear that every man who belongs to the Australian Army, who is side by side with American troops in the total allied armies in this country, serves on the same terms, has the same reward-suc h as it is-ha s the same rights and exactly the same liability. No man who stands side by side with another on even terms, with the same liability,",34,Government Membees No

151,Mr Menzies,"I am not concernedcan afford to criticize the man who is next r,o him. I believe that we cannot make a more magnificent contribution to a really high fighting morale in our forces than by equalizing in every sense the terms of service of tlie Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Military Forces. Finally, in a military sense-and this has ibeen abundantly pointed out by previous speakers-wha t sort of absurdity is it to-suggest that, although this kind of change may be necessary if we drive the Japanese on to the defensive, and are able to chase them back into their own islands, it will be time enough to deal with the matter when that happy hour arrives? member says is quite right:-giv e them notice; say to the enemy: ""We think that we are ready for an offensive, so we are going to ask Parliament to free us from all restrictions in order that we may use all our troops in that offensive "". That, in a military sense, would be grotesque. But what is more important still is the point to which I made a glancing reference earlier: the essence of this war is long, painful, careful, hard training-muc h longer than was previously thought necessary-and swift, ruthless action when the time for action arrives. In the circumstances of modern warfare, an army cannot be trained in a few weeks, after Parliament has passed the necessary legislation to enable troops ro be used abroad. If we are to have an Australian army, if we are to bave an allied army, capable of taking Amboina, Timor and Java, and of rolling the Japanese back into their own territory, then the time to commence to train, not a portion of that army, not a selected few, but the whole of that army, is to-day. Wc have no time to lose. How can you begin to train an army on the assumption that it is one army, serving on one condition, when the truth is that it is two armies, with a different basis of service and a markedly different morale in consequence? orable gentleman told that there were attack with 20 per cent, of its members thousands of men in the Australian Miliextracted from it, it would be like a unit tary Forces who had offered for enlistgoing into battle after having lost 20 per ment in the Australian Imperial Force? are. permitted to do so?

But that would not enable the army to be moved forward.

It continuesf am amazed to find, in this, the second week of war, that Australia is drivelling along with a small volunteer force, and apparently is not intending to re-proclaim that system of compulsory universal training which, on the occasion ""of the last great war, provided ws with some assurance that we had within our own borders a body of partially trained and equipped men who could immediately be put into the field to defend our own country. I am quite aware of the difficulties which tlie heads of the .military services have raised with regard to the training of the men who would be called up under a system of compulsory universal military training. WhilstI would not dispute that there are severe complications associated wit h the introduction of compulsory universal military training, 1 »ay that war is war, and that we cannot be fobbed off with any story from the military experts to the effect that trained men are not available to train our manhood. If we were confronted next week wit h an attack by an enemy country whose shores are lapped by the same ocean as laps the shores of this country I w is h to make a perI was there obviously r e f e r r in g to J a p a n , The effect of the our present enemy. The extract goes o n and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility, because these things develop and break between nations so quickly-w e would not tolerate for one moment the story that it was impossible to put men in training because trained men were not available to train them. There are in this country thousands of experienced ex-soldiers who are quite capable of giving preliminary, elementary training in warfare, and of instilling discipline into bodies of men, which is the very first step in preparing them for actual warfare. I believe that In if this Government were as earnest as it should be, it would lose no time whatever in taking the formal step of re-proclaiming compulsory universal military service for the home defence of this country, and that then it would not tolerate any advice given to it by it * experts to the effect that it is impossible to find men capable of training Australian manhood for the defence of their own land. I am I propose now to read not one of those who believe that compulsion should be applied in connection with the raising of troops for overseas service which might at any time he sent from Australia.

However, l e t me continueI really believe that the mind of the Australian people was sufficiently clarified on this issue during the last war for one to be able to say with reasonable assurance and accuracy that there could not be found to-day one man occupying an important place in the public life of Australia who would advocate compulsory military service for Australians abroad. In my opinion, that is an accurate statement of the position. I think that it is a crystallization of the public mind, brought about by the conscription referendum cam paigns of the last war. For my part, I accept that willingly as being a proper policy foi this country. On the other hand, I believe that the ultimate fate of Australia may well be decided without one shot being fired within the borders of this country. A land. 3,000,000 square miles in area, with so sparse a population as we have a mere T.OOO.'WO people-is entirely incapable of the utmost efforts of its manhood and its resources which would be necessary ultimately to ensure it "" own protection against attack by a powerful and populous militar y aggressor. That drives me to the conclusion that, irrespective of any necessity with which wo may be confronted immediately to defend our own country, our fate could well be sealed by the defeat of Great Britain abroad.

I understand that several memhers of the Opposition realize that the amendment which the Leader of the Opposition was forced to move to-day does a great disservice to Australia at a time when the enemy is thundering at our gates. I believe that the action of the Leader of the Opposition was dictated by those who have always favoured conscription for overseas service. Against the advice of their leaders, they forced this distasteful task on the Leader of the Opposition. The moving of this amendment strikes a blow at national unity at a time when it is absolutely necessary that we should have the fullest possible measure of harmony and co-operation. It is also a gross infringement of a promise ment when it took office, namely, that it would co-operate in every way possible, and would refrain from party politics. Every body realizes that it is vitally necessary to strengthen our armed forces at this time, so that we may effectively defend Australia against attack; yet here we have an amendment the purpose of which is to send Australia's I should have prearmed forces out of the country. The Leader of the Opposition referred to members of the Australian Imperial Force now in Australia. For security reasons, I do not propose to + state the exact number, but I may say that there are many more thousands of members of the Australian Imperial Force in Australia to-day than the last Government sent overseas while it was in office. There is no legal impediment to the sending of members of the Australian Imperial Force overseas should it become necessary. They volunteered to fight either here or overseas. Consequently, the time is inopportune to bring forward a proposal of the kind moved by the Leader of the Opposition. There was no need for it We, as a Government, have done everything that the Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces in the Western Pacific has asked us to do, and everything that our own military advisers have asked us to do. There are powerful interests in the United States of America opposed to the sending of aeroplanes, soldiers and equipment to Australia, and prepared to put every difficulty in the way of their own Government. No doubt, they will seize eajgerly on this debate in the House to-day as a reason why the Government of the United States of America should decline to send us any further help. Although the actual position is well understood by the President of the United States of America, by his Cabinet and by his chiefs of staff, it is not so well understood by the 130,000,000 people of that country.

They are using every conceivable method in an endeavour, by hook or by crook, to interrupt the flow of men and materials to Australia. By engaging in this bitter party political strife, the Opposition is helping those people at a time when our security is endangered as never before. Members of the Advisory War Council, who know the true position,, are not free to tell the facts to the House. All the forces that we can muster in Australia must be properly trained and equipped to defend this country. We have more than 100,000 men of the Australian Imperial Force, many thousands of whom have not served abroad. In addition, many thousands of men of the Australian Military Forces, who have been placed on the Australian Imperial Force reserve list, can be called up at any time to fight in the Australian Imperial Force either in Australia or abroad. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Much has been made of the fact that, as McEwen) stated that the Government has refused to organize the inanhood of Australia. Surely he was not serious! He knows that the number of men in training in Australia is more than two and a half times the number in training six months age. He is also aware that the strength of the Australian Imperial Force in Australia was never greater than it is at the present time. No legal impediment debars those men from being despatched overseas.

The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) and other speakers have criticized the contentions of the Opposition in various ways, and I shall not go over the same ground. The honorahle member for Bourke correctly pointed out that the previous Government gave all kinds of undertakings that men would not be compelled to fight outside Australia. The Labour Government has been criticized for having omitted to amend the Defence Act for the purpose of permitting the despatch of the Australian Military Forces to distant theatres of war. If honourable members opposite believed in that principle, why did not they amend the act when they had an opportunity to do so? At that time, the need to retain troops in Australia was not so urgent as it is to-day. Honourable members who have attended secret meetings of the House realize the dire necessity for improving our defences. We have not yet reached the stage when we can afford to release our troops to fight shoulder to shoulder with our American allies in the defence of New Zealand or elsewhere. Considerably more than 100,000 men are willing and anxious to be despatched abroad to any point where they will come to grips with the enemy. certain units of the Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Military Forces are being trained side by side, it is not fair that one section should be sent overseas, whilst the other is not. The point was rightly taken by the honourable member for Bourke that section 49 of the Defence Act provides that no member of even the Permanent Military Forces shall be sent to a distant theatre of war unless he consents. Honourable members opposite know the policy of the Labour party. In the past, we stood definitely for the volunthe tary enlistment of men for the Australian Imperial Force, and for reinforcements.

It was not alone in holding that view. A former Minister for the Army, the late Mr G. A. Street, stated on one occasion that this war was vastly different from the war of 1914-18. In view of the threat from Japan, he could not visualize the despatch at that time of an expeditionary force from these shores. Some time later, the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) admitted that members of the United Australia party were criticizing him because the Australian Imperial Eorce had not been despatched overseas.

As Minister for the Army, I state that a dire necessity exists for us to strain every nerve in order to improve our defences. Any honourable member, who introduces a note of dissension and plays the game of politics, does a disservice to Australia. -Last evening we witnessed consternation among government supporters when the House debated Statutory Rule No. 11; but that consternation was as nothing compared with the devastating effects apparent when this amendment fell among them with the force of a 5,000-lb. bomb. The Government has not completely recovered from the shock, and most Ministers appear to be ""bomb happy"", in the way in which they have delivered their speeches. I have a high regard for the Prime Minister( Mr able members opposite have spoken glibly Curtin), whose clarity of speech and fertility of imagination provide an object lesson for all honourable members; but the right honourable gentleman was never seen to greater disadvantage than he was toI have adapted my day. I admire the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) for his logic; he takes his stand on the highest principles. But to-day, he succeeded only in explaining that political and industrial Labour was opposed to the amendment of the Defence Act for the purpose of enabling the Australian Military Forces to be sent to distant theatres of war. For the first time, the honourable member forsook those high principles and placed his party before the national need. AlthoughI was not privileged to listen to the speech of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), I have no doubt that he also succeeded in ranging himself on the side of the Government. The Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) endeavoured to make clear to the House something about which he himself was obviously not clear. I shall be generous Forde), because he is called upon to do a most difficult job. I pay him the tribute of saying that he carries out his responsibilities quite successfully and I shall not criticize him. Doubtless he would be much happier in mind if he knew that he had one army under one commander-in-chief responsible for Allied operations in the Pacific theatre of war, in order to obtain the maximum results from the forces. As I see it, there are two courses open to Australia: We can, as' a nation, organize purely for the purpose of defending Australia, or, as one of the democracies and a member of the British Empire, organize in order to encompass the defeat of the enemy. If the Government proposes to adhere to the first policy, it means that we shall not seek to regain for ourselves and other countries their lost democratic privileges, but we shall pursue a policy of isolation. Incidentally, some honourable members opposite are noted for their advocacy of that policy. If we adopt their outlook, we must recall all our troops who have been despatched abroad. Without them, the complete defence of Australia is not possible. Some honorof the man-power that is available in Australia.

It has been said by some honourable members and the press that General MacArthur, for whom I have the highest regard, will be given the right to use troops when and where the occasion demands. That specious argument will not cut much ice with the people. In the first place, General MacArthur is limited to the number of troops that the Government is prepared to make available to him, and, secondly, he has no control over the southern Pacific zone, so that, if New Zealand were invaded, notwithstanding all the flapdoodle and poppycock about his being able to use his forces according to necessities, our sister dominion would be left without aid from this country. go to New Zealand would be made available. ripe! The Government's attitude reminds me of the drought-stricken farmer who, having lost all his feed and stock but one dying horse, pleaded, ""Live, horse, and you will get hay "". When the time is ripe, men will be made available to General MacArthur! What an attitude! The tempo of modern war is so rapid that if the Government waits until the time is ripe to take action, the opporPrime Minister. We have patiently tunity will be missed. ThusI place no reliance whatever on that statement. donia ? Zealand is a sufficient example. I believe firmly in the principles of democracy. Governing is the responsibility of the Government, and, with all deference to General MacArthur, for whom I again express my admiration, I have grave doubt whether it would be competent for him to do the Government's work. Nor would he be prepared to do it. He would not presume to attempt to govern this country by directing the Government to supply his full needs or by demanding the amendment of our law. He would take what was given to him by the Government, and, even if not satisfied, would make no public demur. The Government cannot burk the issue. It has a job to do and should do it. I intend to vote for the amendment, because the present position is impossible. I cannot conceive that when the ultimate offensive is launched the Government will say to the Australian Military Forces"" Halt! You have gone as far as the confines of Australia. We shall now declare peace on your behalf. Forward, Australian Imperial Force! Go abroad and clean up the enemy"". The Australian Imperial Force would not shirk that order. It is carrying on the traditions of the Australian Imperial Force in the last war, when I saw battalions, sadly depleted, fight on and hold almost impossible positions because of their undaunted and unconquerable spirit. The Australian Imperial Force will go abroad, but now that the men in the Australian Military Forces are in khaki, they also will want to go forward marching side by side with their comrades in arms, to finish the war. Government supporters have charged the Opposition with playing party politics. I am firmly convinced that on reflection they will not try to pin that charge on the Opposition, but the Opposition can, in truth, match their charge, because ten days after the United States of America came into the war, we, because we were tired of waiting for the Government to act, sent a letter to the awaited a reply to that letter, but he has not had the courtesy to answer it. Our patience is not inexhaustible, and we were compelled to-day to proceed with this amendment in oroler to indicate our stand. Honourable members opposite live in the thick of party politics.' The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) showed that when he said that the Government was afraid that, if it lifted the embargo against Australian conscripts going overseas, the trade union movement would wipe it out of existence.

Previous speakers on the Government side of the House have replied on certain aspects, but I propose to quote an extract from an important Victorian country newspaper published in one of the major towns in my electorate, which, to my mind, fairly aud accurately reflects public opinion on what appears to be a censure motion launched by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden). The article was published in the SwanH ill Guardian on the 27th April, and is as follows:NOT TRUE "" AUSSIES."". People would Resent Unpatriotic Act. Every loyal Australian is disgusted at the had the Opposition members had their announcement that the launching of a censure way I believe that units of the Australian motion against the Curtin Government is being mooted by a Bection of the Federal Imperial Force which are at present Opposition. decision. The sponsors should be aware of the odium another debacle such as was experienced with which they will be regarded if they at Singapore. I express my gratitude to persist in their intention when Parliament fche leaders of the Government for the next assembles. Such an action at this critical stage of our trating as many of our troops as possible national war effort would savour of something near to treason and would earn the righteous within Australian boundaries' while there Indignation of every loyal and patriotic citizen is .such a great menace to our native in the Commonwealth. In the people's opinion the Curtin Government is tackling its huge job of conducting the war effort in the face of unprecedented difficulties with courage, ruthlessness, sincerity, common sense and patriotism. No act or omission by that Government justifies a censure motiona luxury in peace time, but despicable and dangerous at this crucial point in the nation's destiny. To resort to the old party political dodge of fomenting turmoil to the embarrassment of the Government suggests that the real motives are selfishness and petty ambition. When in opposition and at a less critical phase of the war a9 directly affecting Australia's defence, Mr Curtin exercised scrupulous forbearance. What a self-righteous howl went up from unctuous members of the then administration when there were suggestions that the Menzies Government should be censured I The people are satisfied that the Curtin Government is performing a real job. It should be left free to continue conducting the war effort undisturbed by the veilings of selfish place-seekers. At no time has that newspaper been an upholder of the policy of the Labour party. Honourable members must take notice of the views expressed in that article, which was published in a newspaper which has a long and honourable history. It indicates clearly that the Australian people are satisfied that the Government is doing a good job, that it came to the rescue of the nation when it was most needed, and that it has had the onerous job of pulling the chestnuts out of the fire. In its political zeal the Opposition is desirous of continuing the disastrous policy that it pursued while it occupied the treasury bench. As a result of the policy of the previous Government we had the dissipation of our armed forces over many theatres of war. We lost more than a division at Singapore, we lost large numbers of troops in Greece, in Crete, and in Malaya, and overseas would have been sent to various It was a unanimous .theatres of war in which to-day there is no air support whatever. Possibly, We should have experienced sane policy they have adopted of concenland. Much has been said about the distinctions that have been made between the Australian Military Forces and the Australian Imperial Force. I direct attention to the epic story of the fight put up at Rabaul when the Japanese landed there, <a story that will go down in history, relating the heroism of a force which was largely composed of militiamen against overwhelming odds and tremendous difficulties. Those members of the Australian Military Forces put up a marvellous fight, yet there are still some people who desire to make a distinction between the two branches of our military forces. distinction that has been created.

The newspaper article I have read fairly accurately expresses the feelings of the general public towards the amendment now before the House. Mi-. ANTHONY (Richmond) [4.10] There is an air of unreality about the proceedings in this chamber due to the contrast between the tone of the debate .and the tone of the war news that we have heard to-day. The news indicated a very critical situation for the Allied armies in Burma and the possible encirclement of the Chinese forces, and it carried the gravest implications for the people of this country. After hearing that, we came into this chamber only to hear honourable members still mouthing their old shibboleths, still stubbornly supporting outmoded planks of their party platforms, regardless of the enormous changes taking place at this moment which threaten not only our civilian rights and cherished beliefs, but also the very lives of our people. I regret that this debate has taken place. It was no wish of mine that it, should be initiated. But the duty of the Opposition is to enunciate the principles upon which it believes that the defence of Australia should be founded and to do so with all the force and clarity that it can command. I sincerely regret that it should have been considered necessary to move an amendment which will require a division of the House. It is a bad policy to divide the Parliament on an issue such as this. There have been faults on both sides in the administration of our war effort, but the Government was gravely at fault when it refused to-day to accept power to conscript Australians for overseas service in the event of such action becoming necessary. Only yesterday, it asked for complete power over every individual and all property in the Commonwealth under Statutory Rules 1942, No. 77, so that in any emergency it should not be hamstrung by lack nf power. All that this proposed amendment provides is that the Government yhnll not be embarrassed at any time during the war owing to lack of power to send Australian troops abroad. Why on earth the Government could not accept that offer of power is beyond the comprehension of any reasonable individual. If it does not wish to exercise such power, owing to a fanatical belief in the principles of the Labour party's platform, tliere is nothing to compel it to do so. But the events of the war may occur so rapidly that the Government will find itself, willy-nilly, obliged to do things in contravention of all its beliefs, including preservation of the White Australia policy, about which we have already heard something, and no conscription for overseas service. These things will all go by the board if the danger threatening Australia is great enough. I shall not contrast our war effort with the war efforts of the United States of America, New Zealand and Great Britain, but I can properly compare our effort with what has happened in Canada in the last week. What was done there is merely what the Opposition desires to do here, by means of the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Canada is not introducing conscription for overseas service at this moment, but it has taken a referendum for the purpose of freeing the Government from the pledge, which it gave on the election platforms, that it would not .introduce conscription. Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, because alongside it are all the power and resources of the United States of America. However, the Canadian Government considered it necessary to have a free hand to conscript citizens for overseas service should it be desirable to do so at any moment. In effect, that is all that the Opposition desires to do here. But the Government, instead of accepting this power, looks upon the amendTiient as a challenge to its authority and treats it as a motion of censure. Could anything be more ridiculous in view of the danger that confronts us and in view of the Prime Minister's threat yesterday to resign if he were not granted the power provided in Statutory Rule No. 77. The right honourable gentleman did not threaten to resign to-day, because he does not want the power which the Opposition seeks to give to him. This",44,Censure Motion Would Be Neab Tbeasok

It is not a conscription cerely desire to help the Government. issue. The amendment does not expressly request the Government to send conscripted troops overseas. If honourable members on the Government side of the chamber earnestly believe that we shall win the war, as I do, they must know that it can be won only by the Allied Nations taking the offensive. It can never be won by merely defending Australia from aggression. It can be won only by driving the Japanese out of New Guinea, Timor, Java and the Philippines and. forcing them back on to their own territory. We shall have to send men, munitions and weapons on to Japanese soil. In the final analysis, that means that troops from the Allied Nations will have to invade Japan. Who will supply these troops-Australia , New Zealand, Canada, Gcreat Britain or the United States of America? Of course, the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), with his usual scorn of Great Britain and everything British, and his tribute to the people of the United States of America, regards the amendment as a fifth column effort. honourable gentleman believes that it will prejudice Australia's chances of obtaining adequate aid from the United States of America. He fears the effect of this amendment upon American opinion. He is afraid that American conscripts will not be sent to Australia to help him and to save the Labour party's platform and everything for which it stands. That is all that is worrying him. Such a line of thought does not do credit to either the honourable member or this nation. Time after time in this House, I have heard the honourable member belittling the British troops, and everything that has been done for this country by Great Britain during the last 150 years. If I rightly judge what he has said from time to time, his sentiments would receive endorsement if Great Britain were given a good drubbing. In my opinion, division of the House on an issue such as this is not desirable. Nothing is gained by raising an issue that will be misrepresented in the country at this particularly serious stage of our On the 17th December last, a week or ten days after Japan had entered the war, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) wrote to the Prime Minister what I believe every body will agree was a very reasonable letter, in which he offered the complete co-operation of the Opposition, without any desire to embarrass the Government, in securing an amendment of the Defence Act which would enable the Government to act swiftly in any emergency that might arise. By the same token, the Opposition supported the request of the Government, for the endorsement of Statutory Rule No. 77. Although, as I said last night, I have some misgivings as to the administration of that statutory rule by certain Ministers, I nevertheless supported it, feeling that the Government ought to have the powers that it confers to act swiftly. That is the only reason for our acceptance of the statutory rule. After listening to the present debate, I believe that it is unlikely that the Government would exercise the power that the Opposition now offers to help it to obtain. That is regrettable. There would be no merit in giving such power to a Cabinet that would not use it in appropriate circumstances. The time must come when every member on the Government side will be obliged to recant what he has said to-day. If the Government does not take the action now advocated by the Opposition, Australia will not be able to pull its weight with its allies in this war. Whatever our private beliefs may be at the moment, force of circumstances will compel us to do our duty and play our part. We have to win this war. We have to make Australia secure for both ourselves and our children, and the only way in which that can be done is by defeating the enemy. We shall defeat the enemy only by taking the fight to his door. I have said that, had the matter been left to me, I would not call for a division or have made this an issue in a debate. Even though the vote may be on party lines, I do not intend to record a vote.

In common with the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), I do not feel very happy at the thought of some of those who may have the administration of Statutory Rule No. 77; but in spite of that fact, I believe that it is vital to our national existence that the Executive should have such powers, and for that reason I voted for it, and am prepared to support it. Throughout the last war, and from the day that I entered this House, I have held one view in respect of conscription and the defence of Australia. I have always regarded as extremely stupid the pacifist views of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), but have given him credit for being sincere and honest in holding them. That honourable gentleman has said that I have changed my views. That is a deliberate untruth. In the first speech that I made in this House, disregarding my formal speech in seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, I said that I believed that Australia would have to send troops to the defence of Singapore, and to assist in the defence of the Netherlands East Indies and other islands to the north of Australia. gentleman said there should not be conscription. thing of the kind. WhatI said was that I was not prepared to conscript men to take part in a European war, because I believed that we could obtain a sufficient number of volunteers to do our share, as we did on the last occasion. I voted against conscription at both of the referendums submitted to the people during the last war, and I have not since changed my mind in any way. To-day, the position is different. One does not need to be a great tactician or strategist to realize that the previous war was 17,000 miles away. To-day, it is across the Torres Straits, right at our doorway. The enemy is belting at islands, to the defence of which the honourable member was not prepared to allow one militiaman to be sent. He would permit the enemy to become established on an island that is only a step from our own cities. to compel any one to go there. my view; I always stand by what I say. We should not rely upon defending Australia inside its borders. Unfortunately, we have allowed Timor, the Solomons, and other islands, to be seized, because our manhood was noi compulsorily trained or armed and we were consequently not in a position to provide troops who would have helped to defend those places. man possessed any knowledge of the Timor incident, he would not say that. What he has said is not a fact. men were sent there.

The honourable reasons arose with regard to the defence of Java. to Singapore where there were two white divisions and some native troops, and we lost the key to our defence. Singapore was as much the key to the defence of Australia as Sydney or Newcastle is. We sent a few men to Singapore to be sacrificed to a paltry political shibboleth, that honourable members opposite have preached. that they had encouraged the Greeks to resist the Axis powers and promised to help them, if the British had not sent troops there, they would have gone down in history as a race of skunks.

That would be a fair share for Australia to contribute to the defence of the Empire; but when an appeal is made to us for the defence of this land and the liberties we enjoy, self-preservation is the first law of nature, and every man in this country who is capable of bearing arms should be prepared to defend it.

Those men would have taken it as a personal insult if they had been denied the right to stand alongside their comrades in the Australian Imperial Force in the defence of Australia, to go to Java, Singapore or anywhere else to assist their allies, the Americans, the Canadians and the Chinese, and finally to defeat and destroy the common enemy.

I am reliably informed as to what happens in the Caucus meetings of the parties opposite. Honourable members opposite believe that their Caucus meetings are secret. We have ways and means of finding out what happens at those meetings. Let us examine the motives behind this proposal. I repeat that the right honourable member for Kooyong has decided that this is an appropriate time to make another bid for leadership of the Opposition parties; and, in order to achieve his ambition, he hasforced into action his unwilling partner who happens to occupy that position now. At the outbreak of the war certain honourable members who now support the Government, took a very realistic view of the situation. We determined that it was to the best advantage of the allied cause, and the cause of this country, that no man should be sent out of Australia for service overseas. We came to that decision because we believed, as it was obvious to anyone who had made a study of the matter, that Australia must be retained as a base from which operations might be directed against our enemies. So, we said that the maximum man-power must be retained in this country in order that Australia should be adequately defended as a. base, and as a source of supplies for the allied cause. What has happened since that time ? The Opposition, when in power, even pressed upon the British authorities the need for sending an Australian expeditionary force overseas. The British authorities did not make the original request to the Australian Government to send troops abroad at all. However, because certain honourable members who sat on the Government benches in this Parliament at that time, wanted to win favour in certain quarters, they pressed upon the British authorities the need for despatching such a force overseas. All that they were concerned about was to get Australian troops on to the battlefield. They were not concerned whether our troops were properly equipped, or as to whether they were actually being sent to be slaughtered, owing to the fact that they were not properly equipped. statement, unworthy of a member of a national parliament. It is a damnable statement. mind that the Opposition which now makes this attack upon the Government was itself in part responsible for what happened in Greece, Crete, Libya and ; Malaya. It was not a Labour government, nor a Labour Minister, who sent those men into battle ill-equipped and without proper air protection. We were not responsible for those things. This Labour Government has laid it down that wherever troops are required to serve under a Labour government, they will be properly equipped, and thus enabled to meet their enemies at least on equal terms. To-day honourable members opposite are parading their patriotism.

245,Mr Ward,"Every one should bear incountry for party interest and advantage, and are prepared to-day to sacrifice the interests of the nation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), as a member of the Advisory War Council, is in a position to know exactly what the situation is. Only a few days ago he was shown cables dealing with the international position. Despite that, he is still prepared to launch an attack upon the Government in an attempt to divide the nation in the hour of its greatest trial. Are not such men guilty of a real disservice to their country? Are they not guilty of raising an issue at this moment which will divide the nation from end to end? Why do they raise this issue? It is not because they want to help the country in its hour of danger, but simply because, as the Leader of the Opposition himself has said, they feel greatly perturbed over the actions of certain Ministers, who, they allege, are, under the cloak of war emergency, capable of trying to introduce phases of socialism into the government of the country. Thus this attack is not designed to assist the nation. It is an attempt to destroy the Government, because honourable members opposite believe that vested interests are in danger. They are more concerned about protecting vested interests, and their privileges, than about defending the country itself. But to the Labour Government the interests of the country mean everything. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that no matter what brand he might place upon the politics of the Labour Government, I should not worry in the slightest if the Government should entirely sweep aside all vested interests if such action were necessary for the protection of this country against aggressors. But as soon as legislation, or regulations, are introduced, which adversely affect vested interests, honourable members opposite are prepared to seize on any issue in order to divide the nation in the hope that it will mean the destruction of the Labour Government. I feel sure that it will be said that Australians must be compelled to fight against the enemies of this country. That has never been the case in the past; it will never be so in the future. I think that it was the right honourable member for North Sydney Nr. Ward. ( Mr Hughes) who once said that if a man was not prepared, voluntarily, to defend his country, there must be something wrong with his country. Australians will respond to the call of their country; they will readily make the sacrifices involved in the defence of their country; and they will volunteer to defend it wherever they are required to do so. What is the issue before the House? It is nothing more or less than the issue of conscription for overseas service. 1 do not want to be always quoting what Labour members say, because honourable members opposite will not accept our views. But the right honourable member for Kooyong himself, during the last war, was opposed to sending men compulsorily on service abroad. On this matter he was attacked by the then Leader of the Country party, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sii Earle Page), just after the death of Mr Lyons. All honorahle members are aware of what the right honourable member for Kooyong was accused of on that occasion. I shall not repeal those charges, except to remind the right honourable member that he then reserved to himself the right to say whether he should have served in the last war. I ask him whether he can, now, after he has passed military age, consistently support an amendment which takes away that right and liberty from the individual to determine for himself, according to his own special circumstances, what service he is able to render-the right which the right honourable member so zealously reserved for himself in the last war. I take from Hansard the following statements made by the right honourable member for Cowper on that occasion:The Australian Government needs a leader with not merely the qualities I have mentioned, but also the three qualities of courage, loyalty and .judgment, in such degree as w ill ensure that the people of Australia will give the last ounce of their energies and never resources in a united national effort to ensure our preservation . . . I come now to the third incident: by a third party on a member of the House are not relevant to the subject matter of the debate.",50,Censure Motion Would Be Neab Tbeasok
246,Mr Speaker,"Order! CommentsSpeaker, say the quotation has any hearing on the subject or not, it certainly appears to be inconsistent for any honororable member to take advantage of a situation, for party purposes, to reverse a decision which he had previously made in regard to the course that he himself must pursue. Three years ago, the right honourable member for Kooyong stated that for private and personal reasons ho had not been able to offer his services in the last war. Many Australians are in a similar position at the present time. Every man who doe's not join the Services is not necessarily a coward, or a person who does not wish the Axis to be defeated. He may have real private and personal reasons for not offering his services. In proportion to our the right to make his individual decision population, more men are serving in Australia to-day than are serving in the armed forces of Germany. What would happen if the proposal of the Opposition succeeded % Australian troops could be compelled to fight in distant theatres of war. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) stated, many thousands of men in Australia have already volunteered to serve either in Australia or overseas. The previous Government, disregarding the advice of the Labour party, despatched expeditionary forces to the Middle East and Malaya. Recently, the necessity arose for the Labour Government hastily to recall them to Australia for the pur? pose of defending this country. The previous Government, which was responsible for sending them ill-equipped into battle, endangered tbem in the conflict and subjected them to risks of disaster on the return voyage to Australia. There will be no doubt as to the co-operation of the Labour party with our allies in defeating Naziism and Fascism, and the Labour party, supported by organized workers, will do everything to assist in the overthrow of our enemies, wherever they may be. But the Government will pursue a policy approved, not by vested interests, but by the Labour movement. Those persons who clamoured for an all-in war effort, will have an all-in war effort, though not of the kind that they expect. Honourable members opposite who endorsed action to restrict the liberty of the worker and to you, Mr peg wages, now object strenuously to the policy of the Government, because it affects their friends. I should like to know why the right honourable member for Kooyong now supports a policy that he opposed in May, 1939, when he saidI have already said that compulsory military service overseas in time of war is not part of the policy of this Government, and that the Government stands against it. In respect of its defence, Australia is in a better position to-day than it has been at any period since the outbreak of war. The improvement has been effected by the Labour Government during the last six months. This morning, I listened to the speech of the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson). WhilstI concede to him upon what he should do or is capable of doing, I deny to him the right to make personal attacks upon the Labour Government which is genuinely doing its best to ensure the adequate defence of the country. What is the position of the honourable member? An ardent advocate of conscription for service overseas, he announced in the House on one occasion that he would be on the first transport that left Australia. he was not? the boat. So he was not on the first transport. that the honourable member was rejected by the medical examiner. be fair. will allow me a moment to explain, I shall be strictly fair. The honourable member for Deakin offered his services. I understand that he was rejected because of faulty vision. He failed to satisfy the doctor that his eyesight was up to the standard required of a soldier. But the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) has informed me that the physical standard has been reduced, and that possibly some of the men who failed in the medical examination on a previous occasion might succeed now.

The need for his services as a Minister no longer exists. We may rightly ask this man to explain why he did not return to the Army. pared to come with him? the honourable member for Bendigo, I should be quite certain of returning to Australia. I should be quite safe if I remained with him. that that is an offensive lie. pression "" offensive lie "" is objectionable, and I must maintain the dignity of the House. Any more of these expressions will have to be unequivocally withdrawn. bers of the Opposition will be consistent. Every one cannot be in the Army, the Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force. As I stated previously, the proportion of men in Australia who are serving in the fighting forces is greater, in proportion to population, that it is in any other country, including Germany. We must maintain and expand our essential industries. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) has complained of difficulties caused by the lack of man-power in the rural industries in his electorate. What will happen if the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition be adopted? Persons in the electorate of Bendigo, who are now appealing to the Government to make more labour available to them, will be placed in a worse position than ever. In addition, Australia will he ""bled white"" of its manhood. We must have some regard for the future of the country. During the last war, the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), believing that the conscription referendum would be carried, converted show grounds and race-courses into camps for the purpose of receiving large numbers of men. The right honourable gentleman also had in the harbours of Australia ships carrying coloured labour that was to take the places of Australians to be called up for military service. truth in the Minister's bed-time story. It is a lie. honourable gentleman must withdraw that remark. gentleman will not deny that there was coloured labour aboard ships in Australian harbours at the time the referendum was submitted to the people.

We want the Opposition to understand that they are doing an actual disservice to this country. In my opinion, some of them unconsciously-I can say that of some of them because they have been unconscious for years-and some of them consciously, have been guilty of fifthcolumn activities.

National Parliament. responsible for the scene that discredits Leader of the Opposition and those members with him who introduced such a question at this time. They know the facts, for they have been shown secret cables, and yet they seek to injure the nation and stab the Government in the back by submitting an amendment which they know is designed for one purpose only. That purpose is not to assist the Australian war effort. There is no suggestralian Government that have not been tion that Australian troops will be required to go outside this country. We have been appealing to the United States of America to send troops into this country. I ask the Leader of the Opposition why he has raised this question. The amendment means that members of Parliament who are condemned at present to be in Opposition, but who wish to cross to the Government benches, think that this is a favorable opportunity to destroy the Government. The Australian soldier does not want conscription. He declared himself against it when he had the opportunity on two occasions. He is a. volunteer. scription under Statutory Rule No. 77. tion for overseas military service, which is an entirely different matter. Although the Leader of the Opposition may refer to it as conscription, the Government, when drafting the regulations for the conbest for this country and its allies, with trol of the man-power of this country, did what the previous Government would never have done. Before the restrictions were imposed, we conferred with the representatives of the workers. There was convened in Melbourne the greatest trade union congress that has ever been held in this country. The regulations were not enforced on the workers, who, however, voluntarily accepted them through that great trade union congress. They voluntarily forewent the liberties they had long cherished, and they did so because they wanted to serve the nation in its hour of need. They responded as the Australian workers have always responded. If there is any doubt in the minds of honourable members on that point, let them indicate one instance of the Australian workers being called upon to strike a blow for this nation and refusing to do it volunthis Parliament are the tarily. If members of the Opposition wanted to serve this country and to do the best thing possible for the workers and the nation, they would not at the present time be sowing the seeds of discord between Australian and overseas troops. They are sowing discord also in the minds of the American public. The Government of the United States of America has not made any demands on the Ausmet. The American people, however, will not be fully aware of the situation, but will believe that their forces are being hampered in this country because of the failure of the Australian Government to co-operate with the American Government. America has made no complaint; there has been no suggestion of it, but, on the other hand, there has been the greatest possible measure of co-operation between our American ally and the Australian Government. This debate, reports of which will be broadcast, will tend to create an impression in the minds of the American people, whom we are anxious to influence in the direction of taking a favorable view of sending reinforcements: and equipment to Australia, that there is some doubt whether the Australian Government and the Australian people are worthy of assistance. This Government will govern. It will get the maximum war effort and do the whom we shall work in the closest cooperation. But there is no need for the bogy of conscription to be raised.

The people do not want the right honourable gentleman as Prime Minister. He, in my opinion, would be one of the most unlikely of choices. The workers in this country have not forgotten his action against the Port Kembla waterside workers, who struck work and refused to ship pig iron and other metals to Japan. have been more appropriate to the debate yesterday. accept the decision of an impartial Speaker. I used the instance of the Port Kembla strike to emphasize that there is HO need to coerce the workers into co-operation in the war effort. The Port Kembla waterside workers struck work with the highest of motives, not because they wanted more pay or better conditions, but because they refused to ship pig iron to a member of the Axis. Rut those men were coerced into shipping that metal to Japan. The honourable member for Barker( Mr open. Since there has been some talk Archie Cameron), who is striving to interject, I remember, defended the action of the Commonwealth Government in assisting in the closing of the Burma Road so that Japan could be assisted against our gallant Chinese allies.

We find ourselves in a strange position in this House to-day. It is a sad position. We had the spectacle last night of honourable members opposite who spoke one way and voted another, and the spectacle of a divided Opposition. able member must not refer to the proceedings last night. not get off this question just by that. We have a divided Opposition. We have an Opposition which has proved conclusively in the last 24 hours, no matter what may be said to the contrary, that, as at present constituted, it cannot assume the responsibilities of office. That statement ought to go out to the people of Australia. The Minister for Labour and National Service has said that the Government can find out anything that goes on in our party room. The name "" Quisling"" is too kind for some of the people who were at, our meeting yesterday. "" Judas"" would be more appropriate. Throughout the war we have heard of leakages from the party rooms and from Cabinets where men have taken oaths to maintain secrecy. It is time that the Opposition took its courage in its hands and cleaned these people out. orable member may not proceed further on that subject. pursue it on the adjournment, because I have a lot to say on the subject. A country at war and threatened with invasion of its own home soil and actually invaded so far as some of its territories and colonies are concerned, finds itself in a delicate position when it has division, disunity and treachery inside the very headquarters of Parliament and the Government. I shall now get down to one or two of the things which really matter in connection with this debate. We were told last night that the Government required total and unrestricted powers in order to [20] wage war, but to-day, like King Canute, endeavouring to stop the advance of the tide, the Government says, in effect, "" We have gone thus far, but we shall go no farther. We do not want that total power. We want everything but that"". No country with an ounce of self-respect in its makeup pan call upon conscripted soldiers from other parts of the world to come to its assistance without first providing for the conscription of its own manhood. During the last few months many people in this country have blamed Great Britain, quite wrongly, because British forces have not been disposed to their liking. Apparently, these people are prepared to have British naval, army and air conscripts sent tp the limits of the' earth, and beyond this planet, if possible. Already we have American conscripts in this country, and an endeavour has been made by the Attorney-General( D i . Evatt) to induce Canadians to come to the assistance of their friends in the south Pacific; but apparently those individuals who cry out for help from the conscripted soldiers of other countries are not prepared to apply similar conditions in their own country. That is a paltry and contemptible attitude. The whining, wingeing and squealing by some Australians including leading members of the Government-ove r the air and through the press, is deplorable, and we, who have one of the proudest fighting records of any small nation, arc being held up to ridicule and contempt. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) referred to an incident which occurred at Port Kembla some time ago, when wharf labourers refused to load pig iron destined for Japan. I ask honourable members whether it is any worse to send pig iron to Japan than to send wool to clothe Japanese troops ? But not one member of the present Government raised any objection to the sale of wool to Japan. The Minister also said that at the time when the dispute in regard, to the loading of pig iron took place, Japan was actually a member of the Axis, and for that reason the action taken by the Port Kembla wharf labourers was justified.

If a vote be taken upon the amendment, undoubtedly the House will be asked immediately afterwards to vote on the original question, and there will be no further opportunity granted to debate the various phases of the war situation has generally been passed on to me tion as outlined by the Prime Minister. 'Chat is most unfortunate, because honourable members have little opportunity to discuss what is, after all, the most important matter that could come to the notice of the Parliament at this critical period. Members are told very little hy this Government-the y were told less by previous governments-abou t the changes in the war situation. Recently, a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held in Melbourne to discuss, among other things, uniform taxation. After internal politics had been disposed of, a meeting was arranged at which the Premiers were addressed by such important persons as the Prime Minister, General MacArthur, Commanderin-Chief of the south-west Pacific area; General Sir Thomas Blarney. Commanderin-Chief Australian Military Forces and Commander Forces in that area; Rear-Admiral Sir Guy Royle, Major-General R. K . Sutherland, Chief of Staff to General MacArthur; Lieutenant-General Sturdee, Chief of Staff, General Head-quarters; and Air Vice-Marshall W. D. Bostock. Deputy Chief of the Air Staff -VO MORE FRONT LINE JOBS FOR State Premiers have no constitutional right to be addressed, advised or consulted upon matters concerning the defence of this country, but they were given the fullest information on the war situanorth. tion direct from the mouths of the military advisers to the Commonwealth. Although they are an estimable body of menI am personally friendly with most of them-the y have no right to be so addressed whilst members of Parliament, who have a constitutional responsibility to the nation, are ignored. We have received no information of a worthwhile character from the Ministers and, as a Parliament, we have not been given the opportunity of hearing General the Parliament is told is contained in a typewritten document that has been prepared for the information of the House; it is read to us, and then we are invited to ask a few questions. As a representative of the people I protest against that practice. Any information I have received in recent times on the war situaby pressmen who, by the very nature of their calling, are in closer touch with the Ministers than are most' honourable members. I hope that the Government will, in the near future, alter the existing practice; but while it continues to exist I shall, with justification, continue to protest. I am afraid that the debate on the amendment may have the effect of further inflaming the minds of parents of youths, aged eighteen years, who are already at operational stations throughout the country without having received any previous military training. There is agitation in the minds of many parents because the instruction that the Minister said he had issued has in most cases been ignored. I have received a number of letters and press cuttings from people of the Allied Land who desire that their protest should be heard in opposition to the policy of the Government of sending youths direct to battle stations. The first press cutting is from the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial of the 20th March. It readsWAR COUNCIL SAYSAs a result of a decision by the War Advisory Council, youths of eighteen are to be removed from battle stations. The decision affects youths of this age who have been sent to advanced posts in the near No time was lost by the military authorities in carrying the Government's instruction into effect. It was stated yesterday that one youth was taken from a troop train which was on its way to another State. In recent months parents have complained that their sons had been sent to battle stations after completing only a few weeks of military training. It is understood that the Federal Government is also considering a proposal to give youths up to twenty more intensive training in the instruction depots before they are given active duty. That paragraph was followed the next day by a sub-leader in the same newspaper in the following terms:Not only the parents of those affected, but public opinion generally will endorse the decido not appreciate the efforts of that sion of the War Advisory Council to remove youths of eighteen from battle stations. These youngsters are in no way fitted to stand the strain of front-line warfare and protests against the sending of them to advanced posts are tinged with justifiable bitterness when militiamen in the twenties are still serving their country in office chairs by day and returning to their homes at night. While in the Philippines, General MacArthur made a scientific survey of his Japanese prisoners and has reported that their average age was 23 with the eldest 31, and they had hud eighteen months' military service. There must be no question of sending mere youths lo do battle with soldiers of this calibre. The are now receiving. Those who wish to place for the under twenties is in depots to undergo intensive training until they reach manhood. I ask the Minister for the Army to tell the Parliament how many youths up to the age of twenty years have, in accordance with his instructions, been brought back from Port Moresby and Darwin; and how many youths aged eighteen years to nineteen years, details of whose cases have already been furnished, are still at operational stations to the west and north of the continent. Many parents are concerned because their young sons, in addition to being sent to operational stations, irrespective of the decision reached on the amendment we are debating, may at some future date be sent to the islands north of Australia when offensive action is taken. If there be any merit in the amendment -and I claim that it has no meritsurely this is not the time to draw comparisons between conscripted American troops and non-conscripted Australians. The honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) painted a lurid picture of how the people in America would probably say that their sons were being sent away from home to fight for a country that refused to fight for itself. What a fine contribution the honourable member has made to the case for isolation that has arisen in the United States of America, a case that has been built up over many ypars by stupid talk Mr Cnhicll. everywhere in the British Commonwealth of Nations about war debts owing to the United States of America by Great Britain. Continual talk about the lack of an all-in Australian war effort has helped to promote that growth of ill feeling in fhe United States of America, and has assisted those who claim that we country on our behalf. A considerable body of public opinion in that .country had to be worn down by President Roosevelt before the United States of America would agree to the lease-lend legislation, and, subsequently, to agree to an active participation in the war. If the Japanese had not attacked the United States of America, that nation would probably not yet have entered the war and we should probably not be receiving that active assistance which we serve the best interests of Australia should avoid the comparisons which have been made to-day and should avoid trying to exacerbate American public opinion just as they should avoid inflaming Australian public opinion. I remind honourable members opposite that no Americans under the age of 21 years are conscripted, but if the proposal implicit in the amendment now before the House were accepted by Parliament and acted upon by the Government, eighteen year-old Australians who have no votes would be liable to conscription for overseas service. matter of administration. thing is a matter of administration. If the House agreed to the principle of compulsory overseas service, youths of eighteen would be sent overseas as well as being compelled to give military service at home. are liable for home defence service. If they were liable for service at home there would be nothing to prevent them from being sent overseas.

I know, from my own experience of handling justifiable claims for exemption from military service, how certain military gentlemen act. When one talks to a general one usually finds him to be a reasonable man who has no airs and graces and discusses a subject quite intelligently. But when one comes down to the rank of colonel one begins to sense the importance that some people attach to their rank, and when one reaches captains and lieutenants one finds that one is really talking .to military gentlemen who have no doubts about what ought to be done with politicians who interfere in their domain. They have no hesitation, in many cases, about telling privates, who dare to mention the names of members of Parliament, what they think about them and the set-up of Parliament generally. tened to the politicians in this House. any difficulty in talking with a majorgeneral, and I include the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) in that statement. Honourable members opposite have overlooked one vital point. There are 7,000,000 people in Australia, which is an area almost as great as the United States of America. There are 130,000,000 people in the United States of America. If the whole of the manhood of this country were to be conscripted and sent overseas, the contribution in point of numbers would not be very great. It would not be sufficient to determine the issue of a. major battle in the Pacific, the Atlantic or elsewhere, but if Australia were denuded of its man-power, the future of the nation would be dark indeed. even if we win the war. Europe may be quiet in another 25 years, but while Australia remains an outpost of white civilization and insists upon the maintenance of the White Australia policy and while we have very few people in this country, we shall naturally excite the avarice and covetousness of our coloured neighbours to the north. their just indignation. them that they have cause for just indignation at our exclusive policy. If we are to remain a white race, we can do nothing else but maintain the White Australia policy. If we cannot get a population of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 people in this country within a generation or so by means of immigration and an increase of the birthrate, the day of the white race in Australia will be finished. Many white people might continue to live here for another generation or so but afterwards there would no longer be a white Australia. ber's party objects to the immigration of Europeans. could honestly object to the immigration of white people under proper conditions and provided that they were not sent here in order to relieve their native countries of an unemployment problem. If the problems of industrial development and migration are related, I would welcome the arrival in Australia of many hundreds of thousands of white people from the other side of the world. servation? immigration policy would depend upon the best statesmanship of which we were capable in order to make adequate provision, by means of water conservation and other developmental works, to afford opportunities to the new citizens to live in the standards of decency that we desire to maintain. I hope that all honourable members will endeavour to ensure that the people of Europe, who will be tired of two blood baths in one generation, shall have ample opportunity to come to this country and settle after the It will be' dark enough, war. When I see the splendid specimens of American manhood walking the streets of Australian cities and recollect that America has been, for more than a generation, a melting pot for European nations, I am satisfied with the result of the amalgamation. We should lose nothing by adopting a similar policy. It",59,Youngsoldiers

British. suicide. uo future for Australia unless it has a population prepared to defend it when a militarised Asia, not a militarised Japan, moves south at a time when Europe will probably have settled its many quarrels and when America may be disinclined to give us any further assistance. There are grounds for believing that we have already called up for military training in this country many more thousands of young men than we can provide with proper equipment. It would have been far better to have left a number of these men in the farming districts in order to harvest the crops. I believe that the man-power officers in our country districts are rendering a grave disservice to the nation by sending into camp every man whom they consider to be physically tit for training. I should like to see our man-power regulations scrapped and jurisdiction over exemption claims handed back to the military authorities. Military "".officers at least mete out a rough sort of justice, but man-power officers' give only legal interpretations of regulations in which there is no humanity and no justice. In many cases so many misfits have been placed in positions of authority that grave abuses of power are committed, and injustices are perpetrated upon families and individuals. WhatI have said about the Department of Labour and National Service is equally true of the Department of War Organization of Industry. That department organizes nothing and disorganizes everything. It was most unfortunate that a broadcast was made over the national and commercial radio networks earlier this month which gave rise to the suspicion that the Government was toying with the subject of conscription for overseas service. It was a perfectly legitimate deduction to make from the broadcast that there was a feeling in higher government circles that, at some time or another, when we moved north on the offensive, Australian manhood should be conscripted for overseas service. Next day the press published a statement in almost identical terms. The subject-matter of both the broadcast and the press reports could not have been confused. The report could not have been a press and radio conspiracy. It emanated, in my opinion, from a Minister, or from a high ministerial attendant. I am certain that the report was not a concoction. It was most unfortunate that it should have been published. I hope that we shall not hear any more statements of the kind. I heard the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eadden) incongruously describe the government spokesman mentioned in the report this morning as "" an overworked phantom of the night"". I asked the right honourable gentleman, first, by interjection, whether he'had ever seen a phantom of the night, and, secondly, whether he had ever seen an overworked phantom, but I did not get a reply. Finally, I remind honourable members that no evidence has been submitted today to the effect that, the high military command has asked for the conscription of the man-power of this country foT overseas service. I believe that they feel that they have a full time job in training, for the defence of this country, the men that they already have available for this purpose. It will be a considerable time before we are in a position to use the man-power at our command to take the offensive. If I am cognizant of anything at all, it is that it will also be a considerable time before we shall be able to equip our troops in such a way as to enable them to launch an attack against a wellequipped and well-trained and disciplined enemy.

During the current week, as the result of a resolution passed in the Senate, cerdisallowance. I am astonished that when tain provisions were deleted from the National Security (Conscientious Objectors) Regulations. The effect of their deletion was, in substance, to destroy those regulations, because there is now no provision for the hearing of either an original application by an objector or an appeal by him against the dismissal of such an application. But the whole of the regulations have not been repealed, and so long as they remain unrepealed conscientious objectors will be prevented from taking advantage of the protection afforded by the Defence Act to objectors to combatant service. Section 61 and subsequent sections of that act provide that any person who objects to render combatant service but is willing to render non-combatant service may establish his objection before a court, and shall have the right of appeal against an adverse decision. Those sections of the Defence Act are suspended while the National Security Regulations continue.in force. The regulations continue in force in name, hut not in substance, because those of them which enabled a conscientious objector to establish a claim or to appeal if his claim were rejected, are gone. It would appear to be very difficult for the Government to include in the regulations the equivalent of these provisions, by virtue of the provisions of the Acts Intercompletely altered. It seems to me almost pretation Act. But the Government should nevertheless consider the matter, because it is of no use to allow the regumoney for the erection of these works. lations to remain nominally in force when their whole substance is gone and conscientious objectors are prevented from availing themselves of the provisions of the Defence Act. Some conscientious objectors who have objected to perform combatant service but have been willing to perform non-combatant service have nevertheless been ordered to perform combatant service. So long as these regulations remain in force, such persons cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by the Defence Act. I hope that the appropriate Minister will consider the whole subject from every point of view; because it is a calamity that regulations which took such a long time to become enacted should have been destroyed in the Senate without a division having been taken on the motion for their these regulations were challenged the motion challenging them, the carrying of which has destroyed them, should have been allowed'to pass on the voices. I have received a letter from Golden Mayfair Proprietary Limited, wholesale and retail provision merchants, who have a number of grocery stores in my electorate and serve 4,000 customers a week. The letter was sent to me by express delivery, and informed me that this firm is unable to supply any of its customers with salt. The position seems to be most curious, especially as I understand that a large quantity of salt has been harvested in Geelong. I trust that the appropriate Minister will look into the matter. I have previously spoken, in appeal rather than in protest, against the proposed establishment of abattoirs at Canberra. In answer to a question that I asked yesterday, I was informed by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) that the construction of these abattoirs was approved by the Public Works Committee. That body, however, recommended an expenditure of only £35,000, and by a bare majority of its members. Since then, much water has run under the bridge. The financial position of Australia has a sin that, at a time like the present, the Government should provide so much I know that some persons believe that my opposition to them is dictated by the fact that there are abattoirs in my electorate. If the history of the matter be studied, it wilL be found that I was opposed to the construction of these works when I was Minister for the Interior, and that abattoirs had not then been established in Nimmitabel. This would have been a waste of public money when circumstances were much better than they are to-day. The Treasurer informed me yesterday that the amount of the lowest tender was approximately £43,000. That tenderer has not been",62,Imperial Force Units Imperial Force

319,Mr Perkins (Eden,"Monaro) [6.17].signed up, and it is now proposed to accept an even higher tender. If that be done, it will be a public scandal. In my electorate, and I dare say in other electorates, there are many persons who have been very hard hit by the building regulations of the Government. I can call to mind a number of men who sought authority to expend a few hundred pounds in order that they might be enabled to carry on their businesses, and the right to do so was denied to them. Yet, in Canberra, the Government proposes to erect works of this description, which can be made a success only if they supply meat to outside areas. They will have to go to Queanbeyan to sell meat; yet, because of certain regulations, Queanbeyan is not entitled to return the compliment by selling its meat in Canberra. At a period when the people are heavily burdened with almost unbearable taxation, and the Government stresses the necessity for an all-in war effort, it is proposed to expend over £40,000 in the construction of works that are absolutely unnecessary, merely to suit the whim of some departmental officials. When the matter came before the Public Works Committee, the estimated cost was given at £55,000. The committee would not listen to a proposal for the expenditure of such an amount and wrote it down to £35,000. If the Minister has the power to override its recommendation, what is the use of having the committee inform this House that it considers that £35,000 should be the limit of expenditure ? By ignoring its report, and expending a considerably greater sum than it recommended, the Government is making a laughing stock of the committee. I doubt whether such an expenditure as is proposed would receive the approval of the Auditor General. I opposed the building of abattoirs for Canberra because I regarded the project as unnecessary. There is a serious lack of hotels and housing accommodation in this capital city, and I find it hard to understand why the Treasurer is prepared to expend over £40,000 on the erection of abattoirs that are totally unnecessary when he is also assuring the people that all money that can be secured is necessary for the successful prosecution of the war. [30] I should like the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Beasley) to indicate whether he has given any consideration to my request made two days ago that an investigation should be made into certain matters affecting the administration of the police force in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not wish to reflect on the officer in charge of the force, Colonel Jones, with whom I have enjoyed a personal friendship for many years. I had indicated that if the Minister intended to hold a public inquiry, evidence would be readily forthcoming. As rumours have persisted for many months with regard to certain happenings in this Territory, I hope that the Minister will announce whether an inquiry is to be held. [6.22] -The Government has indicated that a select committee of the Cabinet has been appointed to consider the manpower problem in regard to the production of foodstuffs, and I desire to know whether anything can be done to expedite inquiries into the hardships of widows and invalid fathers whose sons have been called up for military service, thus placing the parents in a most awkward position with regard to the harvesting of their crops. This matter should be looked into in the light of the necessity for carrying on those industries which are of value to the war effort. I also bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), the case of a soldier who was dismissed because of physical disability. The reply to my representations indicate that whilst the soldier claimed payment for service in camp from the 2nd September to the 30th November, he has received pay at the rate of 8s. a day only to the 31st October. It seems to me that a soldier suffering from an admitted disability due to life in a military camp and who still has a month's pay due to him should receive that amount. I hope that the Minister will consider the matter. ter for Supply and Development) [6.24]. -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) referred to the disallowance by the Senate of a regulation relating to conscientious objectors.

As this matter calls for consideration, in view of the effect of the Acts Interpretation Act with regard to the course that it is necessary to take, I should like the honourable member to know that the matter is under consideration. The subject of salt, which affects the Department of Supply, is a problem that arises owing to a demand made by the New Zealand Government for 26,000 tons of salt due to the acute shortage existing in that dominion. The Government was particularly anxious to assist New Zealand in this regard, and the position there affected the salt position faced with the necessity for meeting the in Australia to some extent, although I was unaware that it affected it so much as was suggested by the honourable member. W""e had a problem later in connection with man-power, because salt has to be harvested within the salt season. I took .«teps to secure man-power for the purpose of trying to catch the season in time, but the control of the industry has not been altogether satisfactory. Those in charge have not availed themselves of the time at their disposal to gather in the quantity of salt that they would ordinarily have collected. The New Zealand situation upset our plans and we had to cut down supplies to some extent. The matter will have my immediate attention. Following on the statement by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr the demands of the services and the muniCalwell), on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Wednesday, the Solicitor-General has called for a report to be submitted on the points that he has raised regarding the Police Force in the Australian Capital Territory.

Wheni t comes to hand, the Government will consider what steps shall be taken. for the Army) [6.27] -The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) has referred to the withdrawal of the grey background of colour patches from certain men who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. This was not done as the result of political interference, as insinuated, but evidently is the result of a decision reached at military headquarters. I shall make an inquiry regarding the matter and furnish the honourable member with a reply. Regarding the call-up of young men on farms in Queensland, and the dire hardship of some of the elderly parents who are left to work their farms unaided, I have the greatest sympathy for the people on the land to whom the honourable member for Wide Ray( Mr Bernard Corser) has referred, because many persons in similar circumstances are to be found in my own electorate. This is not an easy problem to solve. The Government is wishes of its military advisers, who have asked for a gradual increase of the Army necessary to defend Australia, and a great demand has been made upon the manpower required for munitions and other industries, including those manufacturing foodstuffs for the fighting forces. As stated by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) today, the whole subject is receiving close attention, and I hope that it will be brought before the War Cabinet early next week. A committee of experts has been investigating it, and it is to be considered by a special committee of the Cabinet. We are most anxious to meet the demands of the primary producers, who are doing very important work in providing foodstuffs for our forces. However, it is impossible to give an assurance that we shall be able to meet tions factories, and also allow men out of camp to carry on these various undertakings. Already, during the harvest season, 27,000 men were exempt from military service to enable the harvest to be gathered. In addition, others were released for the harvesting of salt. It is very difficult for the Government to meet all these demands, but it is doing its best. The protest of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) regarding what he calls the unnecessary expenditure of £42,000 on the erection of new abattoirs at Canberra will be referred to the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings).
