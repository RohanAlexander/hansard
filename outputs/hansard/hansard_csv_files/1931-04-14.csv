76,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [3.48],"is true that during the month of March there were heavy interest paymentsheavier than occur in a normal monththat there were heavy payments on account of exchange, and that in addition there was a payment of £592,000 which was rendered necessary by the repudiation and default of the Government of New South ""Wales. It is true, also, that the receipts from income taxation w ill decrease the deficit in the final three months of the year. But it is equally plain that the great leeway in Commonwealth revenue is not being made up, and that an enormous deficit is certain at the end of the current year. When the Prime Minister( Mr. Scullin), as Treasurer, introduced his budget last July, he budgeted for a surplus of £11,230. In the course of his nnancial statement he saidParliament must recognize, however, that no further drift in Commonwealth finances can be permitted, and that the balancing of the budget is an essential step for the restoration of the credit of Australia. The Government proposes to watch the financial position closely throughout the year, and, without waiting until the end of the financial year, will not hesitate to take immediate steps, if such action appears to be necessary, in order to prevent any serious disturbance in the budgetary position. When the Treasurer presented budget he was told that not one of his estimates would, or could, be realized, and experience has amply borne out the t r u th of the statements then made from this side of the House. But the Government, heedless of warnings, insisted on its budget. backward d r if t to the extent of £2,000,000 a month, and as early as Augusti t was necessary to assemble a special financial conference in Melbourne, at which the heads of the various Australian governments agreedThat the several governments represented at this conference declare their fixed determination to balance their respective budgets for the nnancial year 1930-31, and to maintain a similar balanced budget in future years. This budget equilibrium will be maintained on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia of existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. Further, if during any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure, immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the budgets shall balance. Ifr. Latham. Everybody knows that, owing in large measure to the absence of a policy on the part of the present Commonwealth Government, it is now beyond the bounds of possibility to balance the Commonwealth budget in this financial year. A t the end of the October quarter there was a deficit of £6,747,000, and a new budget was brought down in November by the then Acting Treasurer, the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Lyons). Admittedly, the proposals therein made were inadequate; but the Government ever since has permitted the affairs of the country to d r if t . No action at all has been taken to deal effectively with the budgetary position. been hindered by the Opposition. any action of the Opposition that has hindered the Government from dealing with the situation, though the difficulty of the problem has been aggravated by tbe conduct of the Premier of New South Wales, which has caused further charges to f a l l upon the Commonwealth revenue. How have the commitments of the Government been financed? They have been met largely by means of treasury bills. On Saturday last a warning by the Commonwealth Bank Board was directed that to the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to the effect that there must be some l i m it to the issue of treasury-bills in future. This is a very grave warning, indeed, because it means that we are in imminent danger of default. The treasury-bills that have already been issued and utilized to raise Immediately there was a money are producing a dangerous inflation. This cannot go on indefinitely; in fact, it cannot go on very much longer. The financial proposals of the Government, which provide for the issue of what is called a fiduciary currency of £18,000,000, make no contribution to the solution of the budget problem. It is interesting to observe that, since these proposals have been introduced, the word "" fiduciary "" has changed its meaning in Australia instead of suggesting good f a it h , it is now a common word for anything that is a sham and a pretence. The Commonwealth Government is proceeding with its proposal to issue the so-called fiduciary currency, notwithstanding all the dangers incidental to this "" desperate and",18,Deficitin Accounts Formal Motion For Adjournment

Eevenue from imports has declined more than it was possible to predict at the beginning of the financial year. electors that this Government would remedy that. that, for the last nine months, Australia has been in the trough of a trade depression caused by circumstances for which this Government is not responsible. Internal trade and commerce and industry have been seriously disturbed; and our overseas trade has been so gravely affected that it would have been impossible for any government to balance its accounts, no matter how heroic the measures adopted. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) referred to the agreement arrived at in Melbourne in August last by Commonwealth and State Ministers, the object of which was to secure the balancing of budgets during this financial year. It was then the earnest desire of the Ministers representing the Commonwealth and the various States to balance their accounts this year, but there is scarcely one who, to-day, will not admit the impossibility of giving effect to that undertaking. never attempted to honour the agreement. Opposition attacked this Government for Does the honourable gentleits failure, as he put it, to balance its wish the people to believe budget in accordance with the Melbourne agreement of August last. to do so. point to any State Nationalist Government which has balanced its budget, and thus honoured the Melbourne agreement? Let me remind the House that Mr Bavin and Mr Stevens, the then Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales, were parties to the agreement. Did they balance the State budget? do that. The Bavin Government allowed Parliament to be dissolved and the general election to take place in October without even submitting to Parliament the annual budget. They were defeated at the elections and left the finances of New South Wales in such a condition that in that State a deficiency of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 was in prospect. Queensland also, under a Nationalist Government, has a deficit for the nine months of about £1,750,000 and it is expected that, at the end of the year, the deficit will be £1,000,000. Honourable members do not criticise the Nationalist Government of Queensland. They excuse the failure of State Nationalist Governments to balance their accounts, and concentrate their attention upon the administration of the Commonwealth Government. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that on an earlier occasion he indicated how the Commonwealth might balance its budget this year. He offered what he termed a policy of sound finance, and was indiscreet enough to submit his proposals in detail. Let us examine the scheme",20,Deficitin Accounts Formal Motion For Adjournment

By reductions in public service salaries he proposed to save £1,000,000. He would also have saved another £200,000 from the amount set aside for maternity allowances; £146,000 from bounties paid to industries; £1,500,000 from the moneys made available to the States under the roads agreement:; £1,000,000 from the money appropriated for unemployment relief; £150,000 from the amount intended to assist the coal-mining industry by way of export bounty, and assistance to repatriate excess miners; and £3,000 by cutting out the expenditure to finance the industrial peace tribunals, making a total saving, according to the honourable member, of £3,999,000. _ May I remind the House that even if his proposals had been adopted in full there would still have been a deficit of over £10,000,000? He was going to withhold £1,500,000 due to the States under the Boads Agreement. He was going to renounce that agreement, under the plea of economy; I do not suppose he would admit that that would have been repudiation. The withholding of that money would merely have effected a saving for the Commonwealth Government at the expense of the State governments. Then, the honourable member proposed not to spend £1,000,000 which had been allocated for the relief of unemployment. What wonderful economy that would have been! He would withhold money that was intended to relieve the distress of unemployed persons. He would deny them the succour of which they stood in need, and call that economy!

This is the third bill which the Government has introduced during the present session to grant relief to the wheat-growing industry, and perhaps a brief review of the two measures that have preceded it may be necessary in order that we may accurately assess its importance as well as that of the problems involved in it . With a view to carrying out a promise made by the right honourable the Prime Minister in his appeal to the wheat growers of Australia to produce a record crop, a bill was introduced last April providing for a cash guarantee of 4s. a bushel to the growers upon delivery of f.a.q. wheat at railway sidings. As a result a record area was put under crop. I do not suggest that, in any circumstances, even Bank Act-Regulation s without the proposed guarantee, a very large area would not have been cropped; but, undoubtedly, in the wheat-producing States a considerable area was sown with wheat that would not have been cropped but for the anticipated price for which provision was made in the bill then before this chamber. appeal was made by the Government to the wheat-growers. also be remembered that the bill was introduced in April, when the wheat seeding season had already commenced. It was debated in April and May, but, unfortunately, was defeated in another place in circumstances well known to all. says "" unfortunately "". ber does not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett). attempting to square my views with his on this matter.

122,Mr Stewart,"I have since heardbill, particularly in the light of what might have happened had that legislation been passed. I take this opportunity to say that, although the wheat-growers' occupation is one that has drawn expressions of sympathy from all sections in this House, and although no political party has ventured to suggest that the wheat-growers should not be given assistance, the only difference of opinion being as to the form it should take, it is most extraordinary that, after twelve months of endeavour to get something practical done by legislation, not one wheat grower has yet received one pennyworth of assistance from the Federal Government. failure of the Government. various reasons for this. But I want at once to express my disagreement with the attitude taken up by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and the Deputy Leader( Mr Gullett) in connection with this matter. I listened to their speeches with great disappointment. They took up the most extraordinary and untenable position of ridiculing the promise made by the Prime Minister, and embodied in the Wheat Marketing Bill, claiming that a guarantee of 4s. a bushel would have involved the Commonwealth in the loss of from £15,000,000 to £18,000,000, and describing it as a fantastic financial proposal which it would be impossible to carry out. But strangely enough, during the passage of the bill last year, the Leader of the Opposition moved the following amendment :That this House is of the opinion that, while the present circumstances justify a guarantee by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of a minimum price of 4s. per bushel for f.a.q. wheat, season 1930-1931, delivered at railway siding, legislation providing for such a guarantee should be introduced separately from any legislation providing for the establishment of a monopoly in the marketing of Australian wheat by means of a compulsory pool. In other words, the honourable gentleman committed himself, and incidentally his party, to a guarantee of exactly the same amount as was offered by the Government, and said that circumstances justified such a guarantee. When a few weeks ago he scathingly criticized the Government's proposals because of their financial impracticability, he overlooked the fact that such criticism could be directed with even greater force against his own proposals, because in the light of subsequent events it is clear that his proposal would have involved a greater loss. Attached to the Government's guarantee of 4s. a bushel was a scheme for controlled marketing; the price for the local market would have been fixed, and the Government would have been relieved of any possibility of loss upon the home consumption quota of approximately 33,000,000 bushels. The marketing of the wheat is not yet completed, but on present appearances there would have been a loss of 2s. a bushel on the 150,000,000 bushels of wheat exported. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition would have involved a loss of 2s. a bushel on 180,000,000 bushels. There is a moral obligation on this Parliament to assist the wheat-growers. People have asked why the wheat growers, more than any other section of the community, are entitled to State help. Other sections, we are told, are receiving less than production costs, and if the Government is morally bound to assist the wheat-growers, it is equally under an obligation to other classes of producers. I refer such questioners to the appeal made by the Prime Minister to the farmers to grow more wheat in order to assist to reduce the adverse trade balance which was then, and is still, one of the outstanding problems confronting us. That was indicated again by the statement of the right honourable gentleman this afternoon that it was inadvisable to reduce the export of sugar because of the need for maintaining credits abroad at as high a figure as possible. ber agree with that policy in connection with sugar? sugar at the appropriate time. So far as I am aware, no appeal was made to any other section of the community that is comparable with that made to the wheat growers. To a man of my fiscal views, it is significant that the Prime Minister made no appeal to the boot factories, woollen mills, and other secondary industries in his electorate, to work three shifts daily in order to produce morti",26,Paekee Moloney

There is an unlimited market overseas for blankets, boots and shoes, provided they are sold on the same conditions as the wheat-growers are expected to sell their product, namely, at world's parity prices. The secondary industries not only failed to put forth any special effort to l if t Australia out of the financial mire, but they actually threw their machinery out of action and turned hundreds of their employees into the streets to join the ranks of the unemployed. To the wheat-growers, however, a definite and direct appeal was made. member endorse it ! all the State Governments that were interested.

It is undeniable that the whole nation was behind the Prime Minister's appeal to the producers. offered a guarantee of 4s. a bushel; but the farmers did not get it. Who was responsible ? farmers out of the deficit of £19,000,000. knows is that a direct appeal was made to him; a promise was made by the Government and it has not been honoured. Certainly the Government has proposed successive measures for assisting was the Wheat Marketing with the accompanying offer of 4s. a bushel. That was defeated, and just before last Christmas another measure was introduced to provide for the payment of 3s. a bushel. That, too, went amiss. Later, the Loan Council proposed to float a loan for the payment of a bounty of 6d. Then Mr Lang made a speech, or something else went wrong, which led to that proposal being abandoned. Now the Government is offering 4^d. Eirst, 4s.; then, 3s.; then 6d., and now, 4Jd. The last offer is attached to one of the most contentious financial measures ever presented to this House, and we are told that if wo do not pass the Fiduciary Notes Bill, the farmers will receive nothing. I strongly object to being told that I must vote for a financial measure of which I do not approve, or bear the accusation of being unwilling to assist the wheat-growers. Such tactics are unfair to all honourable members who are opposed to the Fiduciary Notes Bill. divided on the subject? ings of farmers have expressed support of the Government's proposal for the creation of paper money. But always they have been told that by that scheme alone can they get anything. assist them. the Fiduciary Notes Bill is not evidence that they approve of the principle of it ; rather, does their willingness to support almost anything that they think will help them to survive, exemplify their desGovernment perate position. Many farmers have said to me, as they have said to other honourable members, ""We do not like the Fiduciary Notes Bill, involving the creation of paper money, but our difficulties the are such that when the Government assures us that this is the only means by which w'e can be assisted, we are forced to pass motions in favour of the scheme "". That is convincing evidence of the dire necessity of the wheat-growers. I regret that the Government has tacked this proposal to the Fiduciary Notes Bill.

Indeed, I consider that the best way of getting relief for the wheat growers, having regard to the fact that all parties are agreed that something should be done, would be to appoint a committee representative of all sections in the House to meet and produce within 48 hours a scheme of relief that could be supported by all honourable members here and in another place. Surely that is practicable, and I commend that course to the Government for consideration. scheme than the proposed guarantee of 4s. a bushel which the Commonwealth Bank agreed to finance. ber for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), has again brought up the subject of the 4s. guarantee. I suggest to him that we arc not discussing that now, and that we gain nothing by discussing the past. We have to decide what we shall do now to assist the wheat-growing industry. I assure the honourable member that the position of the growers in the wheat-exporting States is tragic. Of course, I do not place Tasmania and Queensland in the category of wheat-exporting States. This Government has made a great deal of the failure of another place to pass legislative measures which would undoubtedly have assisted the wheat-growing industry. Actually the Government has done nothing, although it has attempted to do something to alleviate the position of the industry in Australia to-day, in relation wheat-growers. But at the same time it has extracted hundreds of thousands of pounds from their pockets by means of the primage duty on cornsacks, superphosphates and other necessaries of production. This is being done at a time when the wheat-growing industry is up being demoralized by the relentless pounding of economic forces and the tremendous collapse of wheat prices throughout the world. Practically every Government of the wheat exporting countries throughout the world, with the exception of Australia, has done something to assist its wheat-growing industry. We have done nothing to assist the wheat-farmers; on the other hand we have placed additional burdens upon them. This year there will, unfortunately, be a large reduction in acreage in Western New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. The wheat-growers are unable to obtain supplies of superphosphate with which to sow this year's crop. sene. kerosene for use in their tractors. In many cases they cannot obtain the necessaries of life to maintain their families. no better I referred a little while ago to the moral aspect of this question in respect of which there is an unanswerable case for something to be done to assist the wheat-growing industry; but in addition there is the humanitarian aspect to be considered. Hundreds of the finest citizens of this country-me n who have been farming all their lives-ar e to-day being driven off the land. Every country newspaper that one happens to read contains numerous advertisements of sales of assigned estates by mortgagees, terms being strictly cash. Behind every one of those advertisements is a tragedy. In addition to the moral and humanitarian aspects, there is to be considered the economic aspect taken in relation to pounds, shillings and pence and our national solvency. We shall never l if t Australia out of its present difficulties unless we place our primary and exporting industries on a sound footing. The greatest to employment, and its beneficial effect upon railway revenue and secondary industries, such as superphosphate and machinery manufacturers, is the wheat growing industry.

Labour party. terjection of the honourable member, because it is an endeavour to keep alive the party spirit in this debate. I am not one of those who think that this industry can be placed upon the road to permanent prosperity by a grant from public funds or by a bounty. I believe that in the last analysis we shall have to cut production costs. If this Parliament tackles the problem of reducing production costs in the wheat industry, it will soon become possible for Australia to compete favourably with any other country in the markets of the world. ber including Russia? produce a quality of wheat that Russia cannot produce. Wheat prices to-day are far below production costs in Australia. But at the same time. I do not think that Russia or any other country can produce wheat profitably at the present prices; so there is hope for this industry in Australia. The following is an expression of opinion which appeared in yesterday's Age. THE Adelaide, Sunday. Giving evidence before the Federal Public First, we should have an Australian-wide Accounts Committee on Saturday, Professor system of bulk handling of wheat. New Richardson, director of the Waite Institute South Wales pioneered that system, and, of Agricultural Research, said he did not fear like all other pioneers, made mistakes, the competition of Russian wheat. If Australia could get back to the pre-war ratio of which the other States can avoid if they internal prices to export levels and provided adopt the system. New South Wales research and educational services could be expended large sums in erecting silos maintained we could grow wheat in comjust after the war, when the prices of petition with the world. He said about a million pounds a year must be charged to the cement and steel, and all construction agricultural industry in South Australia for costs, were at the peak. Notwithstanding depreciation of farm machinery. South Australia was absolutely dependent on primary production, and particularly on wheat, which was the least pampered industry in Australia. I have for many years been associated with Professor Richardson in connection with agricultural research work, and I know of no man better qualified than he is to express an opinion in regard to the tion costs. We should aim at placing this industry upon a sound and permanent basis. During the last wheat growing season, the price received at sidings for f.a.q. wheat was somewhere between 4s. 3d. and 4s. Sd. a bushel. This year the price has ranged from Is. 6d to Is. lOd. a bushel. There has, within the last twelve months, been a collapse from an average price of 4s. 6d. to an average price of Is. 8d. No other industry has suffered such a tremendous reduction in prices. Honourable members have talked about a 10 per cent, reduction in wages and a 25 per cent, reduction in share values on the Stock Exchange; but those reductions are nothing in comparison with the reduction in wheat prices. Por that reason it is essential that the industry should be given some temporary assistance in the form of a grant from public funds, but only as palliative. To place this industry on a proper basis, we must reduce production costs, and there because we can are many ways of doing that. It can be done, not only by legislative action, but also by co-operative action by the growers themselves. In the past they have, in connection with the marketing of their wheat, been lacking that co-operative spirit which should have been shown in their own interests, and in the interests of the industry generally. Let me indicate briefly one or growing industry to compete successfully in the markets of the world.",29,Paekee Moloney

152,Mr Stewart,"Yes,that, it cannot be said that the bulk handling system of New South Wales has been a failure. is steadily gaining favour among the farmers. We spend millions of pounds per annum in purchasing imported sacks, filling them up with wheat and sending them out of the country. Instead of that we should institute the bulk handling system. We should adopt a basis under which we can sell wheat in various grades, and at a price which will give the grower some incentive to produce wheat of a better quality. Under the present f.a.q. standard, tbere is no incentive to produce wheat above that standard except in certain towns in which the millers, knowing the milling value of the varieties of wheat, are willing to give a premium for better wheat. Under the f.a.q. standard we have bred wheat to produce the greatest bulk yield. We have not bred wheat to produce high flour strength and milling qualities such as would be produced if a premium were given for them. We have found, in experimenting, that wheat of a high milling strength does not as a rule return as much as that of low milling strength. It oftens happens that one variety of wheat, because of its actual milling strength, is worth from 3d. to 4d. a bushel more than another variety, but under our present system both varieties would be classed at the siding as f.a.q., growers to increase production and to and no price incentive is given to grow wheat of a higher quality. We must reconstruct the whole Bystem of wheat-growing by 'the of bulk handling and the adoption of a system of payment in accordance with the quality of wheat produced. Even under the f.a.q. standard we produce wheats that are sought by millers, and are famous in the markets of the world. I maintain that the standard can be materially improved if we set to work systematically along the lines I have suggested. standard the quality of our wheat in a normal year is equal to that of the world's best. greatly sought after as our merino wool in the markets of the world if we tackle the matter in the right way. An f.a.q. standard for wool would be absurd. This is one of the lines along which I suggest we can lower production costs. Marketing costs are a more contentious subject. To-day there is a considerable leakage under the open competitive system of marketing. In the station yards of all the wheat-producing States we have the spectacle of four, five, six or more buyers, each with different stacks, and a different set of lumpers, and each scrambling for the trucks that are made available, and are rationed out by the railway departments. Those departments run special goods trains of 20, 30, or 40 trucks that may be consigned to half a dozen different consignees. In Victoria some may be taken off at Williamstown, others at Geelong, and others at various flour mills at Kensington. The shunting and sorting of trucks causes a considerable amount of economic waste, and in that avenue there is room for a big reduction of production costs. There are many other directions in which costs could be reduced. Professor Richardson has shown that there is room for tremendous improvement in the continuance of research work concerning the breeding and production of wheat. I can say on behalf of the wheat-growers that they are alive to the importance of that aspect of the matter. I know of no body of men who are keener than the wheatimprove yields. I do not question for a moment the Government's sincerity in attempting to introduction assist the industry; but I do doubt the wisdom of its proposals, and the form in which they have been put forward. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), on behalf of the Country party, has made a proposal which, if adopted, would provide means for giving assistance to the industry. If the Minister believes that it is not possible to raise a loan, the Government at least has the power to impose a sales tax on flour. able member for Wimmera knows quite well that such a proposal is opposed by the Ministers for Agriculture in the States that are taking steps to fix a local price.

The Minister knows better than any other honourable member opposite how desperately urgent is the need of the farmers. If any form of assistance is to be granted to them it ought to be made available this month, so that they will be in a position to plant next year's crop. Government has imposed a tax on flour, but has not given any relief to the wheat growers. against the suggestion of the Minister. for Agriculture in New South Wales has taken the necessary steps to introduce the required legislation. favour of doing something for the wheat grower, yet nothing is being done because of continual wrangling regarding ways and means. When the Government introduced its fiduciary note issue proposal, upon which the financing of this measure is dependent, I said to my colleagues in the Country party: "" It is useless our opposing the proposals of the Government unless we are prepared to suggest something constructive to take their place."" That is what has been done; and action along the lines suggested can be taken even now. is no difference of opinion regarding the necessity for helping the wheat-growers. I commend to the Minister the suggestion that a committee be appointed to investigate the whole matter thoroughly. It is not my intention to move for the appointment of such a committee; that is the responsibility of the Minister. He is unable to plead that he cannot command the votes of a majority of honourable members of this House; he can do as he wills in this matter. If I were to move for the appointment of a committee, and the Minister were to oppose the proposal, failure to carry it would be inevitable. Yet within 48 hours a committee of honourable members representative of all the wheat-growing districts would be able to bring forward a proposal that all parties, both in this House and in another place, could support. Something must be done immediately to help the industry. The wheat-growers are scattered all over the country and cannot mobilize as can other sections of the community. Honourable members who are not in touch with the position in the industry cannot realize its absolutely desperate nature. I have never encountered such a spirit as that which exists to-day in the Mallee and Wimmera districts of Victoria and the back Mallee country of South Australia. The spirit of the pioneers, about which poets have so often written, is broken to-day. In other words, they "" do not care a damn"". They are broken in pocket as well as in spirit. Having made commitments in the light of the promises of this Parliament, not one of which has been fulfilled, they suffered the greatest collapse in wheat prices in the history of the world, and are now being pursued by their creditors as though they were criminals. That is a position which this Parliament cannot ignore, and which it should take steps to remedy. like the bill, and fear that it will prove to be a "" dud "", as has been the case with similar legislation passed within the last twelve months. it that if you like. it effective.

I feel sure that none will be given under the provisions of this bill. The Government will have an opportunity to show whether it is sincere in its desire to help the wheat-farmer, when I propose certain amendments in committee. I have been informed that those amendments will not be accepted ; but I intend to have them circulated and incorporated in Hansard. The Minister and the Government will then have thrown on them the responsibility of turning them down. I believe that they embody the only solution of the difficulty. Honourable members on this side are perfectly satisfied that the Fiduciary Notes Bill will not pass another place. The Government also holds that belief. What is the use therefore, of proceeding with it? I shall vote for this measure even in its present form; but I maintain that it can be improved materially. The position of the Australian wheat growers to-day is so serious that one need offer no apology for endeavouring to help them. The honourable member for Wimmera explained the position of the wheat growers in Victoria, particularly in the Mallee district, where the conditions are comparable with those in many parts of the other States. As the honourable member for Wimmera explained, fully SO per cent, of the wheat producers are insolvent. I do not know whether In large areas in Victoria there are districts in which, prior to last season, practically no wheat had been grown for several years, and where, in view of the Government's promise, the growers expected to reap a good crop and to obtain some return as a result of the 4s. a bushel which the Government guaranteed. Seeding operations have now commenced in many districts in Victoria, and also in the other States, and I have been informed by the honourable member for Wimmera and others, that, in some instances, farmers are sowing the seed on land which has not been fertilized. How, I do not know. The in the name of Heaven, they expect to reap a crop without the use of artificial manures, is beyond my comprehension. They might as well leave their holdings as expect a return in such circumtorian Government will do something to assist the wheat-growers in that State; but it is undoubtedly the responsibility of the Federal Government to render some financial assistance to all the wheat growers in Australia who are in necessitous circumstances. vernment is at present paying 4s. a bushel, and growers in the other States could have received a similar amount. more wheat than is required for local consumption the price would, probably, be in the vicinity of 7s. 6d. a bushel. Queensland than elsewhere in Australia, although the growers in that State are paid approximately 2s. a bushel more than is paid in any of the other States. with the price of wheat as it affects the price of bread. The honourable member for Wimmera dealt very extensively with the campaign initiated by the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and supported by the State Premiers, in which the wheat growers were urged to grow more wheat.

180,Mr Hill,"I propose to deal laterremains that the proposal to grow more wheat was taken np so enthusiastically by the wheat-growers that, instead of an average crop of 120,000,000 to 130,000,000 bushels being produced, approximately 209,000,000 bushels were reaped. Hadi t not been for a dry spring and an abnormally wet harvesting season, it is probable that the production last season would have reached 225,000,000 bushels. safely assert that the appeal of the Prime Minister and the State Premiers, and the promise of 4s. a bushel, increased the yield from wheat by 50,000,000 bushels. The Australian wheat-growers produced approximately 50,000,000 bushels more than would be reaped in a normal season. The additional quantity harvested did not assist them, but was actually a factor iu depreciating prices. The growers, relying upon the promise of the Government of a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, incurred additional expense in sowing larger areas. If a farmer put in only an additional 100 acres he would have to spend an additional £25 on fertilizers, £20 on seed, and also incur further expense for sacks, horse feed and labour. By sowing bigger areas the growers actually incurred greater losses. A measure providing for the payment of 4s. a bushel was passed by this House, but rejected in another place. There is no doubt that the rejection of that measure was of great relief to the Government, whose enthusiasm for the measure waned considerably during its passage through this chamber. trary to what the honourable member has stated previously. ter sincerely desired the bill to be passed by both branches of the legislature; but as time went on the price of wheat dropped to such an extent that by the time it Teached another place there were many supporters of the Government who were pleased to see it rejected. Having been relieved of the liability to pay 4s. a bushel at country sidings it was the duty of the Government to introduce another bill providing for the payment of a smaller amount. The Minister will remember that he was interviewed from time to time by various honourable members, and by deputations representing those engaged in the industry, who pointed out that, although the measure providing for the payment of 4s. a bushel had, rightly or wrongly, been rejected, the Government had been relieved of a great responsibility and liability. Prior to the adjournment for the Christmas vacation, when some wheat had actually been harvested, a measure providing for the pay""We eau ment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. was passed by both Houses. That measure has never been proclaimed, and the wheat-growers are continually asking why they are not being paid 3s. a bushel as provided for in it. been told why. to stand up for the act by having it proclaimed, and if not, why not? The Government has made no pronouncement in regard to its intention with respect to the act. gatherings of representatives of wheat growers which I attend, I am always being asked when the Government is to make the money available. Up to the present it has not made any move in that direction. We were informed in the first place that the Government proposed to borrow £6,000,000, of which £3,500,000 was to be used in paying a bounty of 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus of 140,000,000 bushels, and that by raising the export parity the price for local consumption would automatically rise. Those who understand the marketing of wheat know that that is not correct. Had the bill provided for a bounty of 6d. I believe that the Minison all wheat exported, the local price would have been increased by that amount. This measure does not provide for a bounty of 6d. a bushel on the whole of our exportable surplus, but on only 75 per cent, of the wheat produced, and sold or delivered between October, 1930, and October, 1931. It is assumed that the exportable surplus this year will be 75 per cent, of the total quantity available for marketing overseas. On the latest estimate it is calculated that*instead of there being 75 per cent., equivalent to 141,000,000 bushels, for export, at least four-fifths or 80 per cent., equivalent to 153,000,000 bushels, will be exported.

186,Mr Hill,"A t conferences and the bill provided for a bounty of 6d. a bushel on all wheat exported, tbe local price would have been increased by that amount, and the farmers would have received an extra 6d. instead of 4£d. a bushel. Although the Government proposed to raise a loan of £6,000,000, that was not proceeded with, because the Government knew that there was no possibility of raising such a loan until it had reduced expenditure, placed its house in order, lived within its income, and restored the confidence of the investI n one of the suburbs of Melbourne the ing public. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), offered to co-operate with the Government in any action which might be considered necessary to adjust our finances, so that the whole of such an unpleasant responsibility should not be placed upon the members of one party. That offer, which was declined by the Government, would not have been made by the Labour party had it been in opposition. The Government now proposes under the Piduciary Notes Bill to issue £18,000,000 worth of additional notes, £6,000,000 of which are to be spent in relieving necessitous wheatis being perpetrated by the bakers who growers. My contention is that if the wheat-growers were to accept money raised in this manner their position would ultimately become worse. If the bounty were to be paid on all wheat, excluding seed and feed wheat, instead of on 140,000,000 bushels, the amount involved would be £4,750,000 instead of £3,543,000 -no t a very large increase. The easier and most equitable manner of raising the necessary money is by imposing a sales tax on flour, and I urge the Government to accept an amendment to provide for that. About 650,000 tons of flour are used well able to pay it. An increase of 6d. annually for local consumption, and the per bushel in the price of wheat would quantity is gradually increasing. This is add only .429d. to the price of a 4-lb. equivalent 32,000,000 bushels of wheat. a 209,000,000 bushel harvest, including than through a sales tax on flour. If Queensland, we should have, after deductthe present price of flour remained firm, ing 20,000,000 bushels for seed and feed, and a sales tax of £2 10s. per ton were a balance of 189,000,000, or, say, imposed, the increase in the cost of a 4-lb. 190,000,000 bushels. A sales tax on flour loaf of bread would be less than a halfof £2 10s. per ton on 650,000 tons of flour penny. over a period of about four and a half years would provide exactly 6d. per desperate struggle against heavy odds, but bushel all round on the 190,000,000 the Government has done nothing but Mr mil. bushels, and also allow £2,500,000 for distribution among necessitous farmers. This proposal would appeal to growers in all States as being equitable. The Government's reply to this proposition will probably be that its acceptance would result in an increase in the price of bread. My answer is that the price of bread need not be raised materially, if raised at all. Bread is selling at from 8d. to l i d . per 4-lb. loaf in various parts of Victoria. price was reduced to 6d. per 4-lb. loaf by a bakery firm. I am prepared to vouch for the accuracy of the statement that an opposition baker then opened a number of shops in the area supplied by the baker who was selling for 6d. and sold bread over the counter at 4^d. cash for the 4-lb. loaf. It was thought that this would effectively deal with the man who was selling for 6d., and put him completely out of action; but the result was that the baker who was selling for 6d. cut his price to 3Jd. per 4-lb. loaf, cash over the counter. This shows clearly that one of the most gigantic swindles ever known are charging 9d., 10d., and l i d . per 4-lb. loaf for bread at the present price of flour. In my opinion, a sales tax of £6 a ton could be placed on flour without causing bread to be any dearer. In fact, bread should be cheaper in the areas where 9^d. and l i d . is now being charged. The value of the wheat in a 4-lb. loaf with wheat at 4s. 6d. per bushel, after allowing for the value of the offal, is 2.691d., or less than 2fd. per loaf. Even if the price of bread were raised slightly, the great bulk of the people would be to from 31,500,000 to loaf. There is no means of bringing With about a uniform price for growers other The farmers of Australia are waging a pile up the costs of production.

Each crop has, therefore, to pay two years' interest or rent. I quote these figures merely to show the utter impossibility of continuing under present conditions. The farmers want something more than promises. The Government should set its house in order, live within its income, cut down its expenditure, remove the hindrances with whicli the farmer is beset, restore confidence, and abandon its fiduciary proposals. The people recognize that if the man on the land goes down, all others will go down with him, and 1 believe that they will admit the justice of the proposal put forward for a small sales tax on flour. Two things which the farmer must have are sustenance and fertilizers. In almost every instance he has seed> feed, and machinery; but without the wherewithal to provide sustenance and fertilizers, he cannot produce another cirop. It may be argued that wheat is not worth growing; vvbat then is he to do? Is he to abandon the land and live on the 'dole in the city? I am not one who believes that these low prices oan continue for any length of time, notwithstanding the f act that wheat growers the world over are in much the same position as we are here. I believe that if the Government will remove the hobbles that hinder us, and give us some practical help, with the object of removing our present disabilities, the wheat growers of Australia will prove to the people of this country, ana of the world, that they aTe not afraid to meet competition, Mo matter from whence it comes. Only remove our bonds, 'let us stand on our own feet, and give us a fighting cu!a'nce, and we will show what we can do. Are those engaged in the secondary industries prepared to make a similar declaration? The wheat-grower gets no benefits from the Arbitration Court. He aiid his family and workmen labour Under Mr BiU. conditions much worse than those of other industries, both as to hours and pay. The moment his wheat reaches the station the Unequal conditions apply. The lumper takes charge of the grain, and sumer the labour employed in handling it is subject to Arbitration Court awards and provisions. This year machinery merchants obtained assignments over farmers' wheat to the exclusion of fertilizer companies, storekeepers, and others. These assignments were secured under threats that, where accounts were not paid, machines would be taken away, or duplicate parts would not be supplied, in which case the crops could not have been harvested. I Urge the Government to accept the suggestions put forward by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). What is to be done must be done quickly. No time should be lost. The farmers' immediate need is sustenance and superphosphate. Most of the growers have seed, feed for stock, and the necessary machinery. The Government's duty is clear. The growers have been patiently looking for assistance for months. How much longer must they wait? In con elusion, I shall read an editorial from the Manitoba'Free Press of the 6th December last, which describes 'the position of the wheat-farmer in Canada. While this article sets out the position of the prairie farmers in Canada, one cannot help feeling that in doing so, it just as accurately describes the position of the wheat-growers in Australia. It is headed, "" The Emergency in the WestThe Eealities of the Situation,"" and reads as follows:Canada, as everybody in the Dominion by this time is f u l l y aware, is fighting with all the collective strength 'and intelligence she has, in a general trade and industrial 'depression on a scale, and of a gravity not hitherto encountered during her history as an organized and progressive country. In Western Canada the depression has hit agriculture, and as agriculture is the foundation on which the west has been built, and by which the western -social structure is maintained, a serious depression in western agriculture has adverse consequences on the fortunes of the West country. That is, upon ourselves in Manitoba, and on our neighbours tin the provinces of Saskatchewan .and Alberta. The facts as they are now affecting us can. in some degree, be Stated simply and witli accuracy. All of the west has grown up on tlie large-scale production and export sale of cereal grains; wheat being the great cornerstone of the farming edifice. What is happening in Western Canada can begin to be measured by what is happening to Canadian wheat, and that can be seen by comparing the prices wheat was fetching one year ago, and what it is fetching to-day. Grain prices, as published in the grain tables, do not represent the amount of money the farmer receives for his grain; they represent considerably more, and this has to be allowed 1 for when! discussing what the farmer actually is getting. from the tables, and in round numbers only, are as follows:No. 1 Northern cash wheat, December 4th, 1929, 1.43 dollars ( 5s. l l j d . ) ; same date this year,. 1930, .60 dollars (2s. 6d.) Ifrom these figures there would have to be deducted some seventeen cents (8Jd.) for average freight and other charges, and the farmer to-day getting the quoted price of 60 cents a bushel for Noi1 Northern wheat would, actually receive,, in. cash, 43 cents (Is. 94d.)These are the prices for the top qualities. When the wheat grades lower than No. I Northern, or when it is "" tough "" or damaged, the price falls in proportion to the lower quality. Fully one-third of. a l l western wheat delivered during. November, graded "" tough ""\ which meant a further reduction to the farmer of about three cents. The farmer, therefore, whose wheat was graded No. 1 Northern tough last month received in actual money 40 cents a bushel for what he sold. grade was No. 2, or No. 3, or No. 4, the price came lower stall. These are the prices as they affect the individua l farmer, and represent his cash income for his year's work in wheat. Taking the larger figures, which show the relation of wheat sales to the national income, the following comparisons t e l l the story:From August to October, 1929 -Western farmers delivered, to country elevators 173,891,000 bushels: net money valuation of this wheat, 220,546,101 dollars. For the same period of this year, 1930Tliere were delivered 17.9,650,000 bushels, w it h a net valuation of 107,359,511 dollars-. For six million more bushelsdelivered this year the valuation, therefore, is well over a hundred and thirteen million dollars less. This represents the shrinkage in. value of the stocks1 of wheat we still, have to-offer. We may be able to sell them, but on the basis of the above figures, we must sell them for less than last year; the goods on the national shelf have fallen in value. On what has been sold we can find the comparison, tooFrom August to September, 1929, sale of Canadian wheat and wheat flour totalled approximately 45,000,000 bushels, valued at nearly 04,000,000 dollars. For the same period this year, 1930, exports of wheat and flour were approximately 85,000,000 bushels-, valued at 711,000,000 dollars. These figures represent commercial transactions, actual trading and sales, and they show that in three months of this year, 1930, we exported over 40,000,000 bushels of wheat and flour more than we exported during the same three months in 1929, and received only. 7,000)000 more dollars in return; which, on the comparison of the two prices;, means that in 1930 we sold 40,000;000 bushels of wheat for 7,000,000dollars. These figuresdemonstrate clearly two facts; first, the buying power of the western farmer has been more than cut in t w o ; and, secondly, the Dominion of Canada The comparative figures, taken has suffered a loss of 51,000,000 dollars on the export of approximately 25 per cent, of her surplus, wheat on the basis of last, year's values. These are part of the statistics of the situation w it h which Western Canada has been at grips for months, and wit h which we must all' be prepared to grapple with increasing vigor as the months come on. The national income has shrunk. Translated into human terms what does this mean?' Western Canada is one of the strongest and best endowed areas on the world's surface. Its people have hadsteady prosperity for many years.. They have created an agricultural empire on the great western plain, which extends to the foot of the Rockies. They have built great cities, such as our own city of Winnipeg; their industry has enormously enriched the entire dominion, and they have accumulated capital reserves which even in this crisis enable them to face the future with courage and without panic. Ruti t is a crisis. It is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude, When the world-wide in its complications,, and this gigantic depression, which has h it our country like an earthquake, and against which our people: areas helpless as though it were a plague blown, down on them from, the air, is beginning to strike disastrously into our communities. Shrinkage by hundreds of millions in the national income means straitened conditions throughout the country. We are now ; at the place where actual physical suffering may be forseen as the crisis continues. Shortage of food, of clothing, and of fuel, whole districts, perhaps up against destitution, with, nothing coming in from the crops, and the rigors of winter now upon them. The country is bursting w it h wheat and grain and fuel and resources of every description, and yet by the inexplicable operation of world conditions our western people, in considerable numbers, may be caught and. squeezed in the iron pincers of a poverty they do not in the least deserve to suffer. The situation is emergent. It is partly on us now, and it will have to be faced and dealt with as a national responsibility and as a national duty. There will be many districts able to stand thiswinter's siege on their own resources, but there w ill be weaker districts needing help, and there w ill be necessitous cases in the better-situation communities who w ill need help too-wh o may be needing it now, And help, by one device or another, will' have to be provided. There is danger of large-scale suffering on the western plains this year, and the equipment to relieve it should at this moment bei n preparation, or in readiness. The emergency constitutes a national condition with which the Federal Government will have to grapple as a problem in relief. It is not a question of politics, or of who may be to blame. It is a question of devising remedial machinery for the prevention of a catastrophe which, if allowed to develop, may shake the country to its roots. The west is looking to Ottawa for action. Time is running on. The action should be immediate, comprehensive and sympathetic to the struggles the west itself is making to fight its way through to more solid ground. The Government is well aware that it is unable to finance the scheme. When the bill is in committee I intend to submit certain amendments in order to throw upon the Government full responsibility for its failure to assist our wheat-growers. I shall move for the omission of clause 4 with a view to providing that a bounty of 6d. a bushel shall be payable upon all wheat of the season 1930-31 sold or delivered for sale before the 31st October, 1931, but not payable upon wheat sold for seed purposes or used for seed. If this amendment is accepted, I shall move for the insertion of a new clause to provide for the imposition of a sales tax at the rate of £2 10s. per ton of 2,000 lbs. upon the sale of flour, meal or other gristed products of wheat for home consumption. The revenue to be derived from this tax will be applied exclusively to the repayment of moneys borrowed under the provisions of this bill and to the payment of interest and administrative charges. by the millers? sponsible for the tax in respect of all sales. to pass it on to the general public ? means that if, prior to the imposition of the tax, flour is quoted at £6 5s. it will be sold at £S 15s. honourable members opposite will support that amendment? bill is iu committee. I intend to give the Minister an opportunity to put himself right with the wheat-growers of Australia. They expect this Government to bring forward a practical proposal. If the Minister will father the amendment which I have outlined, I will stand behind him. Honourable members opposite are now bewailing the fate of our primary producers. They were not so much concerned last year when the Wheat Marketing Bill, introduced by this Government to provide for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, was before another place. The honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) has just indicated an amendment which, he suggests, will test the bona fides of the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney). If he and his friends are really concerned about the welfare of our primary producers, why did not they bring pressure to bear upon members of another place last year? The farmers will welcome this scheme, which will make available to them £6,000,000 of currency, negotiable in Australia, and storekeepers in all States, to whom primary producers are heavily in debt, will be glad of the relief which it will afford them. What objection can there be to this proposal as against the raising of £6,000,000 in an unfavorable market at 6 per cent, or 6^ per cent.? Our wheat-growers are in a desperate plight owing to the collapse of overseas markets. Honourable members declared last year that the Government could not finance its proposal to pay a guarantee of 4s. a bushel. On that point all I wish to say is, it was the responsibility of the Government to find the money, and they would have done their part if honourable members opposite had brought pressure on their friends in another place to pass the bill. Reference has been made in this debate to the position of wheat-growers in Queensland. The State Government is paying 4s. a bushel for wheat, and bread is as cheap in Queensland as in any other part of Australia. is favor of our proposal to impose a sales tax on flour. vernment, acting under powers conferred upon it by the Sugar Acquisition Act, has commandeered all flour from the millers, and is able to pay wheat-growers an additional 2s. a bushel for wheat sold for",36,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

197,Mr Riordan,"The Queensland Gohome consumption. Other State Governments could do likewise, and wheat growers throughout the Commonwealth could get an additional 4d. a bushel without any guarantee from the Government. What has been done in Queensland is due largely to legislation passed by a previous Labour administration. Honourable members opposite for many years supported a government which took no action to organize the marketing of our primary products. This Government has been in office for only eighteen months. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. seems to be very worried as to where the money would have come from to finance the wheat pool had the Government's Wheat Marketing Bill been passed over twelve months ago. I remind them that the responsibility for raising that money rested upon the Government, which had received an assurance of support from the Commonwealth Bank authorities. In another place the friends of honourable members opposite threw out the bill, for reasons which are well known to honourable members both on this side of the House and on the other. The agitation against the bill did not come from the farmers, but from those who have been farming the farmers all their lives. The middle-men moved heaven and earth to have the bill defeated. The so-called representatives of the farmers in another place answered the crack of the whip, and did the bidding of the middle-men because those middle-men supply their party funds at election time. Their troubles about the farmer! Honourable members opposite say that the Government sent the bill to the Senate knowing that it would be defeated. What an opportunity the Opposition, in the Senate had of putting the Government in a hole, simply by passing the bill! Had that bill been passed through the Senate, the farmers would now be receiving 4s. a bushel for their wheat, the people would be paying no more for their bread, and the Government would have been able to finance the whole scheme at very small loss. Such loss as was incurred would have been more than compensated for by the fact that the farmers would have money to spend, and would be able to provide employment for those out of work. At the present time the price of flour is down to bedrock. The farmers, for whom honourable members opposite are pleading, are unable to sell their wheat, yet bread in Sydney is 5^d. a 2-lb. loaf, and 6d. a loaf booked. The price of flour is lower than it has been for a number of years. The price of bread at Cloncurry, in Northern Queensland, is hardly more than at Sydney, although the flour used in Cloncurry has to be carried by boat from Sydney or Brisbane up the coast to Townsville, and then railed 500 miles inland. Who is getting the rake-off? Not the farmer, who gets no more for his wheat, and certainly not the people, since they are not getting cheap bread. Those who have benefited are the persons who were lobbying the Senate just before the wheat pool bill was defeated twelve months ago. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), who stated his case broadly and without party feeling, said that he was not going to support the bill. member said that he would not support the Government's financial proposals which are essential to finance this bill. The Government has endeavoured by negotiation with the Commonwealth Bank authorities to finance some scheme for helping the wheat-farmers. Some of the negotiations were conducted by these two heaven-born statesmen, who are now chasing about the country conducting a campaign against the Government. We had them with us for eighteen months, and they were not able to do anything for the farmers. If they are able to do anything to save themselves, let alone the nation, within the next three months, I shall be very surprised: This matter of assistance to the wheat farmers has been frequently before the House. I remember on one occasion the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), speaking on the adjournment of the House, said that the Government had an obligation to do something to assist the primary producers. His remarks were supported by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons), and other members on this side of the House. They pointed out that the farmers had been asked to grow more wheat on the understanding that they would receive 4s.",39,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

200,Mr Riordan,"Well, the honorablea bushel for it . Members of the Senate practically gave an undertaking to the Government that the Senate would pass the necessary legislation. However, the Opposition in the Senate had no qualms about repudiating that undertaking. Ever since this Government assumed office it has been hampered by party intrigue. In the eyes of honourable members opposite, nothing it has done is right. Every measure it has sent forward to the Senate has been defeated. It is strange that members of the Opposition in this House can state quite definitely that our financial proposals will not be agreed to by the Senate. Is the Senate an independent chamber, or is it not? Can it be said that the Senate did its duty by the country and by the primary producers when it turned down the Government's proposal for the assistance of the wheat-farmers, a proposal for which the Government was to accept financial responsibility? When the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr ment was placing burdens on the primary Fenton) was Acting Prime Minister, he appealed to the banks tofinancethe wheat pool. After the wheat pool bill was defeated, the honourable member for Wimmera, and other honourable members representing wheat-growing constituencies, met at a non-party conference, and decided to approach the banking authorities to see if something could be done for pay income tax. the assistance of the farmers. The banks very generously offered to guarantee a price which was about 7^-d. a bushel less than, could at that time have been obtained for wheat in the world's markets. The Labour party was prepared to guarantee the farmers 4s. a bushel for their wheat and the Commonwealth Bank undertook to finance the proposal. Subsequently, when the proposal for guaranteeing the farmers 3s. a bushel was submitted to the bank board, it was turned down. Who, I ask, is to lay down the policy of this Government, the Commonwealth Bank Boara, or the elected representatives of the people in Parliament? Representative government becomes merely a. mockery if governments are to be dictated to by banking authorities. Objection was taken by the honourable ment to assure primary producers satismember for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), and factory prices for their products on the the honourable member for Echuca( Mr one hand, or, on the other, to control the Hill), to the methods by which the price at which the product was offered to Mr Biordan. Government's proposal for helping tha farmers is to be financed. I am not surprised at that. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) must remember that the then Opposition took exception to the Fisher Government's financial proposals, which involved the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank, and when a Commonwealth note issue was proposed they declared that ""Fisher's flimsies"" would not be worth 2s. each at the end of a few months. Later, when the war broke out, those same notes were found to be worth a great deal. The Government now proposes, instead of burdening the people with a loan of £18,000,000, to issue notes to finance its schemes for assisting the farmers, and for the relief of unemployment. This does not savour of heaping burdens on the primary producer, as complained of by the honourable member for Wimmera. producer through the sales tax and primage duty. in as bad a position as the honorablo member claims, they cannot be paying anything, either in sales tax or primage duty. You cannot get blood out of a stone. If a man has no income he cannot sacks is a heavy burden on the primary producers. was passed only a few months ago, and it is possible under that legislation to give relief to any section deserving of it. I believe that the farmers should be given relief. The Government has always been sympathetic to those who have difficulty in paying taxation. Special treatment has been granted, for instance, to selectors and graziers in my electorate who have been unable to pay income tax for which they were assessed immediately preceding a severe drought. They were sent before appeal boards, and they have been treated with leniency by the department. No effort has ever been made by any government other than a Labour govern-",40,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

The wheat farmers receive a fixed price for their wheat, and the public are not exploited when they buy bread. These things have been done through legislation passed by Labour governments. MrM . CAMERON -It is of no use the honourable member quoting what has been done in Queensland, because there is hardly enough wheat grown in that State to supply its own requirements. orable member objects to my quoting anything which does not suit his case. I maintain that the experience of Queensland has proved that the farmers can be guaranteed 4s. a bushel for their wheat without the consumers being charged exorbitant prices for their bread. The honourable member for Echuca referred to the prices of wheat, flour and bread, but he would not, I think, agree to any proposals for fixing the price of flour, because that would hit the class which contributes to his party funds. There are two schools of thought among members of the Opposition-the Nationalists, who do not believe in pricesupport at the next election. They fixing at all, and the members of the Country party, who believe in fixing the price of wheat, but who are not prepared to carry the thing to its logical conclusion. The honourable member for Wimmera is prepared to support the Government in financing the farmers to the extent of 6d. a bushel on their wheat, but he refuses to do anything for the country's 300,000 unemployed, and rejects the proposal of the Government to make available £.1,000,000 a month to relieve unemployment. The project of the Government to raise £18,000,000 by means of a fiduciary issue, £12,000,000 of which would relieve unemployment, aud the remaining £6,000,000 finance our wheat-growers, would give all sections of the community considerably enhanced purchasing power, which is so badly needed at this juncture. Surely it is admitted by all that the case of the unemI n Queensland the ployed is even worse than that of the farmers. They are unable to obtain credit, and in many cases have not a roof over their heads. Only the other day I received a letter from a man in the Canberra Hospital, asking me to send him along a little tobacco. He hails from Burketown, and is one of the finest workers I know. The whole thing is tragic. Let honourable members go to Vaucluse, Sydney, and see the unemployed camped under the sandhills. It is a crying shame to any government. The honourable member for Echuca cleverly tries to place the responsibility upon the Minister for Markets and Transport. Most of the present trouble arises from that very desire to shift the blame on to the shoulders of some other person. There is too much wrangling among those who should be endeavouring to overcome the difficulties that confront the nation. This Government proved its sincerity by taking upon itself the responsibility of introducing the Wheat Marketing Bill. The measure was rejected in another place. That fact cannot be burked. Honourable members of the Opposition are seeking to undermine the Government by tempting its supporters to cross the floor of the House. To any member of the Labour party who is prepared to shirk his duty, they offer immunity from Nationalist attack and will go to any lengths to push the Government out of power. Despite their intrigue, the Government will continue in office. Only recently in Western Australia, Senator Colebatch debated the Fiduciary Notes Bill with a member of the Labour party before an audience of some 300 farmers, who overwhelmingly declared in favour of the measure. "" Happy Harry "", from Henty, smiles. His smile will be a wry one when the farmers and the people generally deal with the honourable member at the next election.

The important thing is to give our farmers an immediate bounty of 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus so that they may purchase their seed and fertilizers for the coming year.

That is a very astute political move, but, though it may give the honourable member'fi party a considerable amount of kudos, it will not give the farmers any money.

It has to be freighted as Treasurer were always crying a poor up to Queensland. There must be a fair rake-off for the southern middlemen. Because of the price fixing legislation which operates in Queensland, bread sells in Townsville at the same price as it does in Brisbane, while as far out as Mount Isa the cost is only I d . a loaf dearer. During bread price wars I have seen it as low as 4d. to 4£d. a 2-lb. loaf. The Queensland marketing boards operate at very little cost to the people, and similar organizations could be instituted for the whole of Australia. Honourable members will remember that when the Wheat Marketing Bill was being debated the lobbies were well packed with representatives of South Australian and New South Wales home consumption, fix the middle men, who urged members to resist the measure. We were inundated with sheaf after sheaf of letters claiming that the farmers would be ruined if the bill The honourable were passed. That had its effect in another place, and, as a result, the farmers have received no assistance, and are now in a precarious position. This Government should go further than it proposes to do and guarantee the farmers a price for their wheat over a number of years. There will be fluctuations in the price of the grain, but during boom periods the amount in excess of the guarantee could be placed in a trust fund and utilized to meet losses during lean years. The methods of finance proposed by the Government are encountering the serious objection of honourable members opposite. It is merely a repetition of the old, old story. I have already referred A similar price to the Jeremiahs who decried the banking legislation introduced by the late Mr Andrew Fisher, and have related how scornfully his "" flimsies"" were received.

213,Honourable Member For Calare ( Mr Gib,"Yet those very same gentlemen have just appointed a publicity agent to their diminutive party at a salary of £1,200 a year; a man who was previously receiving £900 a year from this Government for similar work. Assuredly the task of balancing their budget will be a difficult one. Such methods of finance are beyond me. Evidently, there is a fairy godfather watching over them. While theso "" saviours of the country "" expound their theories on finance, the workers and the primary producers may starve, and be hanged. This party has but one policy, to assist those in need. The Opposition is seeking desperately, but ineffectively, to put the Government out of office before it can give effect to its policy. Despite all obstacles the Government will assist the unemployed and the primary producers, and do its utmost to make order out of the chaos that reigns after seven years of Nationalist government, dictated by business interests. I made my attitude on this issue very clear when I spoke some weeks ago on the no confidence motion that was then before the House. At that time. I took the opportunity to say that I was opposed to this proposal, both on its merits and because it is based on afinancialprinciple that is hound to end in failure. The Government knows as well as does the Opposition that the measure has no possible chance of becoming law. this side of the chamber and it is known in every political quarter by those who give any thought to such matters, that this legislation has no chance whatever of getting through another place. That is as well known to the Government as it is to the Opposition and that is why I question the sincerity of Ministers in this particular respect. course open to the Government to help the wheat-growers of Australia in the crisis through which they are now passing is one which it has studiously refused to follow. This is the third attempt in this Parliament to render some assistance to the very long time now, thanks to Labour wheat-growers. The first, a bill to prolegislation. vide a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, was an ignominious failure. rejected by another place. I was one of those who voted for the measure, and if the same conditions existed to-day I should do so again. ThenI had some faith in the sincerity of Ministers. To-day I have positively no faith in their sincerity. The second attempt, a bill to guarantee 3s. a bushel to the wheat-grower, ended in an equally ignominious failure. And now we have this third proposal to provide £6,000,000 to help the farmers, not with real money, but with fiduciary notes which we know will be so much rotten paper as soon as they are issued. When interrupted by an interjection, I was saying that the only possible course the Government could have followed to render useful assistance to the farmers was one it had not taken. That course was to impose a sales tax or excise duty on flour. When the matter was brought up earlier in the evening by the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill) the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbous) interjected that the State of New South Wales had imposed a tax on flour, but that it had given no assistance to the farmers of the State. I am not in a position to question the honourable member's assertion, but I can say that a similar policy when applied in Queensland rendered substantial assistance to the wheat-growers of that State. I believe that if the Commonwealth Government had had the courage to implement a similar policy a similar degree of assistance would have been afforded to the wheat-farmers of Australia generally, The position in Queensland is quite well known. Having absolutely no faith in the Commonwealth Government's proposals to help the wheat-growers, the The only possible Moore Government took steps to implement a sales tax on flour on the lines of an excise duty, and to-day the position of the Queensland wheat-farmers is better than that of the farmers of the other States.",43,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

219,Mr Mabtens,"And it has been for as not to realize that tbe Government of Queensland has opportunities to help the farmers of the State that are not available to the other Governments of Australia, but the principle for which I am contending remains unaltered. Queensland Government, exasperated at the failure of the Commonwealth Government to do anything useful for the wheat-growers, implemented a tax on flour and has thereby succeeded in rendering very valuable assistance to the farmers of the State. I do not propose to repeat remarks I have made upon this subject on other occasions in this House, but in passing I may say that we shall never have a prosperous country until our primary producers are That, I think, is axiomatic. However much we may disagree as to details, that root principle remains unchallenged. The only reason for giving to any section of the community anything beyond what it can get in the open market is the fact that it is handicapped by costs of production. That the farmer needs assistance is definitely established. He is facing a crisis; he is confronted to-day with conditions such as he has hitherto never faced; he is asking for assistance; he expects it and by all the canons of right doing and justice he ought to get it. The causes that have broiight him into his present position may be grouped under many headings, including not only the cost of labour on the farm, but also many costs away from the farm, which press very heavily upon him, such as handling charges; railway freights; shipping; loading; costs of machinery; supplies, and interest. He has to pay rates of Wages fixed without any regard to the economic conditions that prevail to-day. The cumulative effect of all these being, pressunduly handicapped by heavy costs of ing on the farmer with such undue severity, makes it necessary to apply, shall I call them, adventitious aids, or at any rate the aids which we are seeking to bring to his relief. Any one with a knowledge of the subject knows that the farmer works fifteen hours a day and for much less than the basic wage. Whatever conditions are laid down by arbitration tribunals he has still to keep his nose to the grindstone and work out his own salvation. Tariff-mongering has produced conditions that press unduly heavily upon him. He lacks the shelter afforded to almost every other worker in the community. He labours under all The these difficulties, yet the present Government has nothing better to offer him than the political shoddy contained in this bill. member would not even have that. and I say definitely now, that I would not have it under any circumstances. ber claims to represent farmers. pared to do all that is humanly possible prosperous. to assist them, but I refuse to make myself a party to any attempt to further mislead them. On three separate occasions this Government has misled them, and has brought about a state of turmoil among them which is a positive discredit to it. I believe that it will continue to mislead them so long as it remains in office, and so I propose to take a definite stand against this bill, hoping that it will not be long before we get the present Ministry off the treasury bench. We shall then have an opportunity to implement measures that will give the farmer some definite, real relief. That he will never get from this Government. The theory of honourable members opposite seems to be that civil servants and workers who are unionists must be sheltered and must get their bread at a price which will leave the farmer no hope of profit. The only workers in this country who seem to be regarded as not requiring some degree of shelter are the very people who, as I have said before, are entitled to a greater degree of help than any other section, because they are production. I repeat that we shall not get back to any degree of prosperity in this country until our primary producers are prosperous. No Administration has so misled the primary producers as this Government has done. This proposal to provide £6,000,000 of fiduciary notes for the assistance of the farmers is absolutely insincere.",44,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

I ask him to withdraw the statement. allegation of insincerity; nevertheless, I believe that the proposal to offer £6,000,000 of rotten paper money to the farmers is beneath contempt. Despite what has been said by Government supporters I know that the right thinking section of the farmers recognize that the offer is worthless, and will not help them in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if this scheme is implemented, it will do the farming community, and incidentally the commercial community, incalculable harm. It is not a serious attempt to help the farmers, and is not so regarded by them. In view of the fact that, although the bill may be accepted by this House, it will not have the slightest chance of being passed in another place, I question the seriousness of the Government in submitting it. Relief for tbe primary producers is imperative and urgent and something must be done. Parliament was elected this matter has been trifled with. The Government has worried itself with various legislative proposals, but the net result has been nil. ""We have heard from this side of the House, and from the ministerial bench, that the farmers are in such dire straits that the Commonwealth must go to their aid immediately; yet we never get past, and are not likely to get past, the stage of talk. This Government will merely continue to repeat that something must be done, and nothing will be done. The fact is that unless the Government is prepared to impose a sales tax or excise duty on flour, it will have not the least prospect of achieving anything to relieve the farmers, and all its protestations of concern will continue to ring hollow in the ears of the people. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) was generous enough to express appreciation of the sincerity of the Government in its attitude towards this subject, but my conviction is that there is no sincerity in it at all. able member has already been called to £400,000,000 worth of this so-called order for charging the Government with ""rotten paper money"" was raised in insincerity, and he is now aggravating his offence. I again call upon him to withdraw the statement and to apologize for having repeated it. ing unconsciously repeated an expression to which you, Mr Speaker, have taken exception: I withdraw it and apologize. I regard this measure as a contemptible bribe-a n electioneering ruse to benefit the Government at the expense of the primary producers, particularly the wheat-growers. I dislike it generally, and I have no faith in it because the financial legislation to which it is attached has no possible chance of being accepted by this Parliament. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, as a proposal for the relief of the farmers, the bill is an absolute farce. sible and practical speeches of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) were in marked contrast to the observations of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan), who Ever since this has just resumed his seat.

If that amount of fiduciary currency could be issued to help Australia play its part in the war, why cavil at a mere £6,000,000 to help the farmers out of the desperate plight in which they are to-day? would have us believe that the issue of £6,000,000 of paper money to l if t the farmers out of their desperate position would r u in Australia, but if "" rotten paper money"" was good enough to finance the war surely it should be good enough to meet the existing emergency in the wheat-growing industry. I can see no justification for opposition to a proposal to raise £6,000,000 for the purpose of l if t in g the farmers out of the mire. The Government's first legislative proposal for the assistance of wheat growers was the Wheat Marketing B ill which proposed a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for f.a.q. wheat at railway sidings. The offer of such a guarantee was justified by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) who, speaking on the second reading of the Wheat Marketing B ill , said:Having regard to the difficulties of the existing situation, and the invitations of the governments in those States in which wheat is grown, I am prepared to support the guarantee of a minimum price of 4s. a bushel for this season's crop. To-day the Deputy Leader( Mr Gullett) said that the rejection of that bill was the best thing, that ever happened Australia. The honourable member for Wimmera on the other hand said that the bill was "" unfortunately another place."" member differs from the Deputy of the Opposition. whence obtained to finance the 4s. offered by the Government., to overlook the fact that the scheme to which he and his leader subscribed would have involved the Commonwealth much greater loss than would have arisen under the Wheat Marketing Bill. wheat harvest for last season was approximately 205,000,000 bushels. If we allow 15,000,000 for seed wheat and fowl food, 190,000,000 bushels is left, of which 33,000,000 bushels would have been required leaving 157,000,000 bushels available for export. Mr Jones. marketing scheme would have involved the Commonwealth in a loss of approximately 2s. a bushel on probably 157,000,000 bushels; no loss would have been sustained in respect of the 33,000,000 Members of the Opposition bushels gristed in Australia because the home market price would have been controlled by the pool. The scheme endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy would have caused a loss of 2s. a bushel on 190,000,000 bushels, because the guarantee would have applied to all wheat marketed and no machinery was contemplated for the regulation of the home consumption price. Therefore, the loss under the Government's scheme would have been less than under the proposal of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked where the money would have come from to finance the Government's guarantee of 4s. a bushel. I ask hi m whence the money would have come to finance the greater loss that would have been involved in the proposal to which he and his leader subscribed. The Leader of the Opposition, having said in his second-reading speech that he was prepared to support a minimum price of 4s. a bushel for this season's crop, went on to sayI conclude by distinguishing again between the two proposals of the bill-the guarantee of 4s. a bushel which I am prepared to support and the compulsory pool to which I am to strongly opposed.

The farmers themselves realize that position and refuse to tolerate it any longer. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that the primary producer should be assisted in every way by means of the tariff. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has asked why should the farmers complain of the sales tax, seeing that they have no-sales. They have no sales because of the primage unities and other burdens under which they are labouring to-day. Therefore, as tar as possible, the farmers should be given every assistance by means of the tariff. qpposite who, when the Wheat Marketing Bill was before the House, were prepared to support the proposal to guarantee 4s. a bushel for wheat at railway sidings, are nqw contending that the scheme was fantastic; but it is easy to be wise after the event. The honourable member for Darling Downs referred to the fiduciary issue as rotten paper money, but let me remind him that Australia was able to play its part in the Great War only by raising a loan of £380,000,000-most of it fiduciary mpney. That loan did not ruin Australia, so there is no reason to suppose that the raising of a mere £6,000,000 to relieve the desperate plight of the wheat-farmers of Australia is likely to have any harmful effect upon this country, honourable member for Wimmera( Mr for Echuca( MrH ill ) has indicated in Stewart) and the honourable member for his amendment the only means by which Echuca( Mr Hill) have ably and fully adequate assistance can be given to the stated the case for Government assistance farmers. It is futile for us to persist to the wheat industry. The pictures that with this bill, for it is well known that they drew of the deplorable conditions there is not the slightest prospect of it of the wheat-farmers were in no way being passed in another place. If the exaggerated. Their references to the Victorian farmers apply equally to the wheat farmers of New South Wales, and particularly those of the dryer districts. The western part of the Riverina has suffered three successive years of drought. Many farmers have grown no wheat at all. Others have obtained only small crops, some quarter crops, and a few half crops. The average throughout those three years of drought would not be anything like a quarter crop. Last year throughout the greater part of the season the rains came and the crops in a great part of the Riverina were good; but iu the western part, because of the lack of spring rains, the crops, to a great extent, failed, and the farmers there suffered their fourth year of drought, many of them not getting even half crops. Following the disaster of the droughts came the disaster of the fall in price. When the farmers had no wheat or very little wheat to sell, the price was high, but when they had plenty of wheat to sell the price fell to a figure which made wheat-growing unprofitable. Two such calamities have never previously followed each other in the history of Australia. To-day, the farmers, through no fault of their own, are in a desperate position. Certain honourable members Because they responded to the appeal of the Prime Minister to grow more wheat, they are heavily in debt. They hoped that the promised price of 4s. per bushel would enable them to recover from past troubles, and many of them incurred debt in order to sow the largest possible area. If they had not sown such a large area, their debts would not have been so heavy. But, to-day, those who sowed the largest area are the most deeply in debt. The urgent need of the moment for these men is fertilizers for use in sowing their crop for the coming season. Unless immediate assistance can be given them they will have to sow without fertilizers, which will mean a very poor crop, or else they will not sow any crop at all. To my mind, the honourable member",48,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

238,Mr Killen (Riverina) [9.13],"Th eGovernment desires to do something usef u l for the farmers, it should make provision for the imposition of a sales tax on flour. So far as we know the only reason why it will not do so is that it fears an increase in the price of bread. But the honourable member for Echuca has shown clearly that the price of bread is higher now than it should be, and that the imposition of the proposed tax should not cause an advance in price. Eveni f the tax is imposed the price of flour will be considerably lower than it is to-day in Queensland and New Zealand where the price of bread is no higher than it is in the southern States of Australia. If this extra taxation caused an increase of i d . or $d. per loaf, it would be well worthwhile if it were the means of granting assistance to the wheat-farmers. The alternative to the granting of such assistance is that the farmers should cease growing wheat. This would mean the abandonment of holdings, and many other deplorable troubles. If the farmers ceased wheat-growing, we should have to import wheat to make flour, and the price of bread would then be double what it is now. That would be inevitable. The honourable member for Indi( Mr how they can deceive the farmers as they Jones) said truly that if the Government allows the farmers to leave their holdings, the result will be calamitous. In my opinion, the farmers will be forced off their holdings, and the disaster predicted by the honourable member for Indi will occur, unless the proposed sales tax on flour is imposed. The Government has it within its power by this means to give immediate aid to our wheat-farmers, who are to-day the most sorely tried section of the community. If the wheat-farmers are relieved, all classes of the community will also be assisted, for it will be possible to continue producing wheat at a reasonable price and this will mean that bread will be sold at a reasonable price. The people in the cities are realizing to-day as they have never before done the extent to which they are dependent for their prosperity upon our primary producers. Sydney is feeling the pinch of an unprecedented depression. Empty houses are to be seen everywhere, and many houses are occupied by tenants who cannot pay their rent or can pay only a fraction of the rent they previously paid. I , therefore, urge the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , for it will not only make possible the granting of relief to the wheat-growers, who, next to the wool'growers, are the most important section of primary pro^ducers in Australia, but it will also assist every other resident of Australia. -The subject-matter of this bill does not interest me quite as. much as it should interest the honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Killen), for there are not many wheat-farmers in my constituency; but I realize the importance of the wheat growing industry to Australia, and believe that the Government should do its best to help our farmers to overcome their difficulties. It gives me, as a commonplace philosopher, a good deal of concern to notice that the honourable members who represent agricultural communities in this House can look at this subject in such a two-faced manner. They pretend to be anxious to help the farmers, but refuse to adopt the only means by which they can be helped. I am at a loss to understand are doing. The farming community, however, is intelligent, and it will not be misled by the sophistry or hypocrisy of honourable members opposite. The speech just delivered by the honourable member for Riverina reminded me of a story I heard years ago of the daughter of a certain farmer who would not marry the son of a neighbouring farmer, because he lived near a river, and she was afraid that their children might be drowned. The wedding was postponed so long that in the end there were no children to drown. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) pretends to be anxious to help the farmers, but he has talked a lot of cant and humbug about the money which the Government is endeavouring to find for this purpose being nothing but "" rotten paper."" The honourable member for Riverina is one of the fortunate people in this country who, by fortuitous circumstances, have been able to make money on the land. He is now misrepresenting the primaiy producers in this chamber,. I am ashamed",49,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic
239,Mr Cusack (Eden,"Monaro) [9.24].that he and others who hold similar views to his own should insult Australia by saying that the money which the Commonwealth Government desires to put in circulation would be valueless and useless for the purpose of helping the farmers. It is a disgrace and a scandal that such things should be said. For my own part, I should be quite willing to accept the I.O.TJ. of the honourable member and t r y to negotiate it . If I found that it was valueless, I should then tell the honourable member what I thought of him. The Government endeavoured to pay the farmers 4s. per bushel for their wheat, but its efforts in that direction were nullified by the Opposition in this Parliament. The Opposition claims that the Government could not find the money. Then why did it seek to save the Government from such a humiliating position. men are now trying to tell us that the money which the Government would have paid for the wheat would have been useless. W h y they should seek to humiliate this Parliament, and carry their hostility to a Labour government to such lengths, I cannot understand. We have been told that the Government should be put out of office, because it has failed to assist the farmers, and now we are being told that it should be put out of office because the money it wishes to provide for the assistance of the primary producers is not acceptable to certain sections of the community. It has been said that if a government composed of certain honourable members opposite could be placed on the Treasury bench it would be possible to get sufficient money to assist the farmers. But there are nearly as many parties opposite as there are members. We are being told to-day that a government formed by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) would command the confidence of the people. We are discussing the WheatB ill and I submit that the honourable member's remarks have nothing to do with this subject. ( Mr Yates) I presume that the honoryou are wrong. A t present the farmers able member intends to connect his are in a desperate position. Attempts remarks with the bill. do so. I propose to show how futil e it sition have stood relentlessly in their is to expect a government supported by honourable members opposite to grant any real relief to the farmers. To this end I wish to read a quotation from a speech by Mr Lyons on party loyalty. The extract is as follows:Mr J. A. LYONS, M.H.R. His VIEWS ON PAKTX LOTALTX. Those who are now acclaiming the ex-Labour member, Mr Lyons, as Australia's new leader may be interested to read his opinion on party loyalty and the fate of Labour breakaways. -Does the honourable member intend to connect these remarks w it h the bill? be able to convince you, sir, that I am using a most potent argument in support of the b ill In the Hobart (Tasmania) Daily Post, 16th These gentleNovember, 1916, Mr Lyons was reported as having said: "" Experience has shown that those who had at any time departed from the Labour movement, after having formed part of it, had invariably failed to block the growth and progress of the movement.

Mr Lyons, speaking at the Hobart Domain, also said, referring to the breakaway of Senator Ogden from the Labour party -Order!

248,Mr Cusack,"I have concluded the way. What would be the position if this measure became law? The issue of fiduciary notes would be of great benefit to the wheat-farmers. I heard of a farmer who has £800 worth of wheat and who possesses a property valued at £3,000, who is unable to buy a loaf of bread. Tbat farmer was anxious to purchase £200 worth of sheep to place them on the stubble to fatten them for market, but was unable to do so because financial accommodation was not available. If it had been he would have been able to make a profit of about 50 per cent, on his purin supreme control. Would the aborichase. But he could not buy the sheep because credit could not be obtained. On the other hand, there are farmers in Cooma and Adaminaby who have more sheep then they can feed, and who are anxious to make a deal with the man who has the pasture available. The sale could not be effected because the financial sysstarve when snakes and opossums were tem of the country would not enable the farmer who had the feed to get sufficient credit from the banks to make the purchase. Therefore, the man who has the sheep and who cannot provide the feed has to allow them to starve, while the man who has the feed cannot purchase the sheep because he cannot obtain credit. If the Commonwealth Bank was to make credit available the farmer would be able to go to the bank and obtain, say, £300, which would not be paid to him in cash. Probably it would be in notes-no t necespushed out. sarily fiduciary-o r he might simply be given credit. In effect, all that would happen would be that the credit would be made available to the man who wished to purchase the sheep. Probably no money would change hands at all. The person who desired to purchase the sheep would be given credit, and payment in the form of a cheque would be handed to the seller, who would probably bank it in the same bank the following day. The cheque would simply be a via media to enable the sheep to be shifted from paddocks where there was no feed to a spot where ample pasture was available. The transaction is a simple one. It would not involve the production of gold or notes, but would simply mean a book entry. Honourable members should not imagine that actual cash would be handed over in such cases; it would simply be a matter of providing credit. This country is suffering to-day because there is no possibility of releasing credits, irrespective of the value of the securities available. We are suffering the result.' 1 of a financial famine, in consequence of which the wheat-growers particularly are experiencing great hardships. We have heard at times of action being taken under very old statutes, passed even as far back as the time of CharlesI . Let us consider the conditions which existed in this country hundreds of years ago when "" K in g B ill y "" was gines in those day have allowed themselves to starve when opossums and snakes on which they fed were plentiful, simply because money-was not available as a medium of exchange? There were no fiduciary notes in those days, but the aborigines would not allow themselves to available. The other night I dreamt that I was on the summit of Mount Ainslie, where I discovered a library which contained valuable data, and records of events which occurred 4,000 years ago. To me the library appeared second only to that at Alexandria which was destroyed by the Calif Omar. I also dreamt that somewhere in the vicinity of the Molonglo there was a sanctuary for snakes. The tribal laws at that time provided that any one who killed a snake within the sanctuary would have his eyesl r able member have for supper? ber also came into my dream. He was welcoming such persons as Niemeyer and Professor "" Duckenheim "" I should like to know, Mr Speaker, whether opossums, snakes, sheep, Calif Omar, children drowning in creeks, Niemeyer, and Professor "" Duckenheim "" are associated with the subject matter of the bill. -The honourable member for Eden Monaro must confine his remarks to the bill, and express himself so as to comply with the Standing Orders. been contended by honourable members opposite that the fiduciary notes, which it is proposed to make available to",51,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

253,Mr Cusack,"I submit that as it hasassist the -wheat-farmers, will not provide of that value to prevent them from a means of financing transactions between the producer and the consumer, I am justified in showing by way of illustration that the laws under which we live permit people to starve in a land of plenty. I am showing that under conditions which existed hundreds of years ago the aborigines would not think of starving when ample food was available. The laws which existed then were more humanitarian than those in operation to-day, under which people are permitted to starve in the midst of plenty. It occurred to me that the illustration would be most edifying even to men like the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), who I believe has recently been prepared to place upon the grey hairs of his brow a crown of political stinkworts. able member must not indulge in personalities. self, but when at war one is justified in using the weapons of one's opponents. Under the laws which obtained in Australia more than a hundred years ago no aborigine would go hungry while food was available, and some such law should be in operation to-day. In those days the way in which a young queen displayed her scansorial ability in obtaining food jfor the aged and infirm who could not secure their own was the admiration of the tribe and in that way she endeared herself to her people. The present system of government is crude. When there is an abundance of clothing, food and shelter the people should not be deprived of such necessities simply because credits are not available. Why do we not establish credits? It is recognized by every political economistI do not profess to be one of great significance, but I am a financial authority in some respects, and also a financial diagnostician-that credits should be made available to enable the producer to make his products available to the consumer. Credit, which is money, can be created by a bank or a government by a stroke of the pen. If the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) went to the Commonwealth Bank to-morrow, and asked for credit of £1,000 in order to purchase sheep starving, credit could be made available by a book entry. The purchase of sheep to that value would increase the food supply, provide work for drovers, and enable the Government to collect a sales t & provides for the payment of a bounty on the production of wheat, for the making of loans to necessitous wheat-growers, and for other purposes. The honourable member must keep within the confines of the measure. producing more food than we can consume. In Great Britain there is open to us a very large market, and a bounty that would enable us to transport our surplus production to that country would be exceedingly valuable. The best means of discrediting the Government would be to prove the proposed bounty a failure. Let it be given a trial. If it should fail, honourable members opposite would have the satisfaction of knowing that their criticism was justified. According to a report that has appeared in the public press, an ex-Minister of the Commonwealth, Mr Jensen, who is now a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, has recounted the fact that on one occasion during the Prime Ministership of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), while that gentleman was in America, a cable was sent to Australia by Great Britain asking to be supplied immediately with £10,000,000 worth of gold, and stating that a letter would follow the cable explaining why it was required. The Cabinet met and deliberated upon the matter. Although, in its opinion, the amount of gold in Australia did not represent 25 per cent, of the then currency, they took whatever risk was involved in further depleting the gold reserve and complied with the request of the Government of Great Britain. The letter with which that Government followed up its cable disclosed the fact that the gold was needed to purchase wheat from the Argentine, because that country would not supply it unless payment was made in that form. This incident shows the fallacy of the propaganda that is being indulged in against the issue of fiduciary notes;",52,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

257,Mr Cusack,"As a nation we arebecause a certain proportion of the currency in circulation at that time must have been fiduciary in its nature on accoimt of the fact that the gold reserve was depleted below the statutory requirement. But, notwithstanding that fact, they were successful in meeting the needs of the nation. Similarly, the fiduciary notes that the Government now desires to issue will prove successful in alleviating the burden of the existing depression. I understand that at a later date, when Great Britain required a further supply of wheat, Australia tendered for the contract, but lost it to the Argentine, whose price was lower to the extent of %d a bushel. If we were tendering to-day, and our farmers were given a bounty of 6d. a bushel, other nations would have to produce their wheat at more than 6d. a bushel below our price in order to outbid us. The granting of a bounty would possibly result in the circulation of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. All that the Government proposes is that the farmers shall have credit made available to them. Why is it being withheld from them? Because in another part of this building tbere are men who are prepared to support the financiers. They urge that if the Government's proposal is agreed to the value of money may be reduced. The financiers to-day want to lend money to the farmers at an interest rate of 6 per cent. Where do they propose to get it? Will they borrow it? It will be merely paper money. They are afraid of their profits being reduced. The amount on deposit in the private banks is approximately £400,000,000, and it is loaned out mostly to farmers. A reduction of 2 per cent, would mean a loss to them of £8,000,000 a year. There is plenty of money available, but honourable members opposite will see that the farmers do not get it at a cheap rate. Australia must see to it that the stranglehold which these financiers have upon the community is loosened. It is the policy of the Government to make money cheap for the farmers. If its proposal should prove ineffective or financially unsound, the Government must fall. I urge honourable members opposite to "" give it a spin."" The farmers are waiting for it. Let them not try to pull the wool over their eyes any longer. I do not think they will be able to do so, because the farmers are becoming more enlightened. The Farmers and Settlers Journal is subsidized by those who .are afraid of money becoming cheap, and prints articles which deceive the farmers. They have been deceived for years, and have been regarded as the only section of the community upon whose eredulity Nationalists can impose. But the straits in which they now find themselves will compel them to accept the proposals of the Government for their relief. If honourable members opposite were in power they would possibly be able to raise money at 6 per cent., but that is not what is wanted. It is the £1,000,000 a week interest bill that now crushes Australia. It is the interest charge that is ruining Australia to-day. Yet honourable members opposite would add to it, so as to make the financiers more prosperous at the expense of the sweat and blood of the farmer. They are now being offered an opportunity to provide the farmer with cheap money. Why should they stand up in this House and hypocritically pretend that they are studying the interests of the farmer? political sense only. missible even in a political sense. been fortunate enough to be elected some time ago with a majority in both Houses, the payment of 4s. a bushel would be the law of this country to-day. The farmers must realize that the reason why they have not been given that measure of relief is that, under the Constitution, obsolete members of another place have been enabled to prevent the passage of the Government's legislation. With the assistance of a cock-eyed press, those members have been able to make the farmers believe that they have been studying their interests. Very soon the farmers will be disillusioned. Many of the older men will die of starvation because of the action of honourable members opposite, and of their friends in another place. Their successors will be more enlightened, better educated, and will not be deceived by the sophistry that has succeeded so well in the past.

If it were possible for such an incongruous body to do so, the Opposition should rise as one man, and with one voice declare to the Opposition in another place that unless it ceases its obstructive tactics it will incur the full extent of the wrath of the suffering farming community. The conditions in Australia are desperate, because the Government has the misfortune to be unable to enact its legislation.

Prior to the There is a good reason why we cannot Easter adjournment, the honourable memdo that. ber for Calare( Mr Gibbons) said, in effect, that any honourable member who objected to this bill must be unfamiliar with the needs of the farmers or must oppose the measure for political reasons.

Therefore it is not necessary for me to be told how great is the need of the farmers in my own district, or in that represented by the Stewart). If I intended to oppose this bill member yet made up his mind on the matter ? a caucus to make it up for me. One well acquainted with the farmers' needs might conceivably oppose the measure, not on account of what the bill itself contains, but because of the statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) that the Fiduciary Notes Bill is the pivotal measure round which all the other Government proposals revolve.

I stand here to-night, as an independent member, using what power I have in the interests of the people generally. Since the late war the debt of this country has increased to the extent of nearly another £400,000,000. The loans raised during tbe war period are not comparable with the proposed fiduciary currency. The present proposal for providing £6,000,000 for £12,000,000 for the unemployed, is merely a preliminary stage. I shall not quote instructions I received from the South Australian Labour party as to the action to be taken whenever a loan was due for renewal. The currency of this country was to be used, and these loans wiped out progressively as they fell due. Owing to what has not been revealed there is danger in the proposal of the Government for a fiduciary currency. a bushel, as agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition, would have cost a great deal more than £6,000,000. things at the time of the original proposals of the Government. I do not accuse Ministers of insincerity in the matter of assisting the farmers. I know that a number of members opposite really desire to help them; but the majority of the supporters of the Government are not so much concerned about assisting the farmers as with the initiation of a scheme for the provision of easy money. The farmer and his need is only one of the levers to be used in making that easy money available. farmer to put in his crop ? the confidence of the people, it would have no difficulty in raising a loan sufficient to provide for the planting of crops throughout the length and breadth of the country. If confidence were restored by a change of government it, would still be possible to do something for the wheat-farmers, but, unfortunately, it is too late to help some of them, because their planting time has arrived. It has been stated that some of them have put in their seed wheat without superphosphate. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) has announced that he intends to support the bill because, so he says, it is the only chance of giving relief to our farmers. Does any honourable member supporting the Government believe that the Fiduciary Notes Bill will be accepted in another place? They are, of course, well aware that it will not pass the Senate, and that, therefore, the farmers will not be able to obtain any relief under this tbe farming community, and bill.

Earlier in the debate the Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Parker Moloney) declared that all State Ministers of Agriculture were opposed to the imposition of a sales tax on flour. Does he include the Minister for Agriculture in South Australia? The Minister is silent. We may therefore assume that his statement, as regards South Australia at all events, is incorrect. As a matter of fact the Minister for Agriculture in that State was prepared to support a much higher tax than is suggested by members of the Country party in this House. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), referring to those of us who have severed our connection with the Labour party in this chamber, implied that we had supported the Government for eighteen months without saving the country. The fact is that during the whole of that time notice was not taken of many proposals which we urged should be incorporated in Government policy for the benefit of the people. The honourable member for Kennedy knows very well what I mean. He and other Government supporters must admit that if the Labour party had followed the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fenton), and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons), in their budget proposals, Australia would not be at present in -such an unsatisfactory The honourable member for Kennedy also sneeringly declared that we were posing as the saviours of our country, and went on to remind us that we would do well if we could save ourselves in the next three months. I hope that the Government will give us an immediate opportunity the people concerning recent events. But, as we know, Ministers are determined to cling to office; they will have to be scraped off the treasury bench. I am prepared at any time to face a general election. I shall then be free of all party ilr. Galb. pledges. I remind Government supporters, who declare that in supporting this bill their one desire is to assist the farmers, that, just prior to the adjournment in December the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde), under direcSuch a tion from caucus brought down an export duty on sheepskins. NeedI tell the House what happened inside the party room in regard to that matter? reference whatever to an export duty on sheepskins. I , therefore, cannot allow the honourable member to discuss that subject. I shall not pursue it further. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) has lately been quoting, with a good deal of approval, the views of Professor Copland in support of his fiduciary notes scheme. I may, therefore, be excused if I read the following extract from a statement by Professor Copland which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on the 5th March last:An amount of £6,000,000 is to be used for farm relief, and there is admittedly a strong case for some relief to the farmers. It will be well, however, to realize that the relief offered in this way may increase the farmer's difficulties and force him to be a suppliant for further relief. There is nothing in the proposal to suggest that costs of production will fall. On the contrary it has been shown that taxation will have to be increased on account of the higher Government payments. The farmer will, therefore, be left in his present position with high internal costs and low export prices. It cannot be too often reiterated that the export prices of farm products have fallen by about 50 per cent., while there has been no substantial reduction in industrial products, produced behind the natural financial position. shelter of the tariff wall in Australia. I commend that statement of Professor Copland, particularly to the honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones). Every form of inflation, whether disguised as an issue of fiduciary currency or otherwise, has, in the past, been associated with a to test the feeling of rise in price levels. France's experience showed that with an increase of five times in the amount of currency there followed a rise in price levels to the extent of five and a half times. If our currency is inflated, the farmers will have to continue selling their products in the markets of the world on the basis of deflated world",56,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

280,Mr Gabb,"Very well, Mr Speaker,currency. Whatever is done with the currency in Australia cannot alter that position. If we increase production costs, there is a danger that the last state of the farmers w ill be worse than the first, and that before long they w ill be coming to the Government again as suppliants for further relief. I intend to support the bill because there is in it no reference to a fiduciary currency. In doing so I wonder, however, whether I am not in some way helping further to fool the farmers. I do not wish to do that. I say to the farmers fTom my place in this House that they have no chance of receiving assistance from the present Commonwealth Government, and they might as well recognize that fact. However, we now have this proposal before us, and the Country party is hopeful of amending it by associating with it the imposition of a sales tax on flour to provide funds for the relief of wheat-farmers. I hope that the Government may yet be persuaded to do something along those lines. In that hope I propose to support the bill, at the same time making it plain that if it contained any reference to a fiduciary currency I should certainly oppose it . ter) [10.23] I move That the House do now adjourn. After consultation with the industrial organizations concerned, the Commonwealth Government has appointed Mr T. M . W. Eady and Mr Robert Taylor, to act as delegates representing the employers and workers respectively, at the forthcoming International Labour Conference at Geneva. This year it is not proposed to appoint a Government delegate to attend the conference. the intention of the Prime Minister to afford honourable members an opportunity of discussing both the minority and majority reports of the Sugar Investigation Committee, and of voting on the recommendations ? Honourable members must have heard w i th interest the announcement of the Prime Minister with respect to the representation of the Commonwealth at the International Labour Conference. I am aware that every effort must be made to reduce expenditure at the present time, and I should like to know whether the gentlemen who are to represent Australia are being sent f r om this country or whether, on the other hand, they are at present on the other side of the world. In the past it has often been found possible to appoint as a representative some one who has bben travelling abroad, and who was qualified to attend the conference. I regret that it is not proposed to have a Government delegate this year. It costs only a small sum to send a representative from London to the conference. While the International Labour Organization has not functioned in such a way as to please everybody up to the present, I am convinced that it is highly desirable, particularly for a country like Australia which regards itself as advanced in industrial affairs, to do everything possible to improve indust r i a l conditions all over the world. This should be done, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for economic reasons, having in mind' the welfare of most of the decisions arrived at by the conference can be put into operation in Australia only as a result of State legislation ? the distribution of industrial powers between the Commonwealth and the States. That, however, does not dispose of the obligation of the' Commonwealth to keep abreast of industrial developments, and to make a contribution towards raising industrial standards in other countries. That has been the tendency of the International Labour Conference since its inception. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister whetheT it would not be possible to have Mr Fuhrman, whe is now in London, to represent the Oommonwealth at the conference, as ht, has",57,Moloney Th E Reason Stances I Am Still Hopeful That The Vic

Australia will cut a rather poor figure as compared with other countries if we are represented at the conference only by nominees of employers and employees. I suggest that, unless there is a satisfactory America. I do not think that anything reason for acting otherwise, the Government should take steps to have a direct Government representative at the conference. -This afternoon I asked a question regarding the payment of interest by the New South Wales Government. I understand that that Government intends to pay 3 per cent, interest on various Australian loans negotiated for it during previous years, and also upon loans raised in America. So far our only information in this regard has been received from the newspapers, and I should like to have an authoritative statement from the Prime Minister. Government is to pay the full amount of interest due on American loans. was due on the 1st April, and as April is now considerably advanced I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Government has received any definite information regarding what is taking place ? This matter is of importance, not only to the people of New South Wales, but to those of the Commonwealth as a whole. ter) [10.29] I hope that some day next week an opportunity will be given to honourable memhers to discuss the sugar agreement. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) regarding the importance of the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and it is only because it is necessary to exercise economy even in small matters that the Government has decided not to send a direct representative, even though one might be sent from London. After all, if the employers and employees are represented at the conference, Australia's representation will be fairly complete. We are fortunate that the gentleman chosen to represent the employers is already abroad on a trip, but the representative of the employees is in Brisbane, and will be sent from here. In regard to the payment of interest by New South Wales, I understand, but cannot say definitely at the moment, that the interest for April has been paid on loans raised in the TJnited States of has been done to reduce the rate of Australian interest, but I shall know more definitely when I inquire at the Treasury.
