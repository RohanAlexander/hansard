Aft e r the resolution is agreed to it will be reported to the House, and we shall proceed with the business in the ordinary way. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and agreed to. That the standing orders be suspended so as to allow the report to he adopted and the Bill to be passed through all its stages this day. The reason for urgency is that the despatch which I have laid on the table asks us to deal with this matter at the earliest possible moment. I have not allowed it, so far, to unduly interfere with the course of public business, but if Parliament in its wisdom thinks f it to sanction the despatch of troops to England, it will be necessary for the detachment to leave some time before the end of this month. the despatch ? was received by me on the 19th. As I have said, I have not been able to deal with this matter before, owing to the pressure of other important matters of public business. I think, however, that honourable members will scarcely say that in the case of a measure embodying the few items which this contains-the schedule being really the Bill-and which has already been circulated, there need be any delay of the usual character so long as they have the full opportunity, which we hope they will take, of diseussing the items themselves. simply a matter of the items and the policy of the items. Committee: orders be suspended for this purpose ? the Senate have the B i ll if possible to-morrow, in order that the matters which are included in the schedule may be put in hand at tlie earliest possible moment. I "" think I can say, as regards the troops which it is A r e we going into Comproposed to despatch, that it will be necessary to allow a sufficient interval to elapse for them to be prepared, and that by the time i,hat is done it will be necessary for them to start from here for the representation of the Commonwealth at the Coronation. That event takes place on the 26th June, and it is advisable that the troops should arrive in London by the 19th June. Honourable members will probably recollect that transports conveying troops do not travel at the same rate as mail steamers, and apart from that consideration, the troops must arrive in England in sufficient time to enable them to receive their horses and become accustomed to them. I m o v e strongly deprecate this fashion of rushing through this House, contrary to the usual parliamentary forms, appropriations of public money. I make this remark absolutely without reference to the particular object of this particular motion. I am speaking of the general principles which have been embodied in our parliamentary laws for very wise reasons, and which have been so beneficial in their operation that during the long period that has elapsed since their establishment no one has ever dreamt of altering them. The Prime Minister said that he had a despatch dated 18th Marchprobably received on the 19th March-fro m date of the Home Government, with reference to these troops. Surely the Cabinet could have made up their minds within a fortnight after the receipt of that despatch, whether they would send troops or not. That would have allowed ample time for the passage of the Bill, with due observance of the proper parliamentary forms. The question is : Are these parliamentary forms to exist against private members, and to exist only at the caprice of the Government, so far as Ministers are concerned? We are absolutely bound by the parliamentary rules, and no member or combination of members can break them, except under the very It is special motion which is provided for in,the standing orders ; but in this case the Ministry, without the slightest adequate",16,Temporary Federalappea L Courts

34,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I cannot tooexcuse, ask us to set aside all these rules. If the Ministry think these rules are unwise they should take action to have them altered and abandon the safeguards now provided for deliberation and for intervals elapsing before appropriations of public moneys are made. There is no excuse for dealing with the parliamentary rules in this way. I do not like, especially in connection with a subject^ like that dealt with in the motion, to offer political criticisms of any kind, but it is from these precedents that we shall fall into what seems to me an objectionable practice. We should either alter our laws and allow this procedure to be adopted as a matter of course, or,the parliamentary laws should be observed except in cases of emergency. The Ministry have had f u ll time to treat these laws and this House with respect-ther e is no pretence to the contrary-and I deprecate the idea that this sort of thing is to become a matter of form. enter my protest against the method adopted by the Government in dealing with this question. The standing orders are devised for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of honourable members and the public, and of preventing legislation being passed without due consideration. The course now proposed by the Government should not be adopted without the strongest reasons. The Premier received a despatch bearing upon this matter some considerable time ago, and yet it has only been laid upon the table within the last few minutes, and honourable members have not had an opportunity of considering it. I have always set my face against suspensions of the standing orders, because I recognise that therein are contained safeguards that we cannot afford to lightly set aside. Unless the Government can show very good reasons why the course they propose should be adopted, I am prepared to vote against them. all that the honourable member for Canobolas has said. No reason has been put forward by the Prime Minister for the suspension of the standing orders. The policy of the Government is in thorough accord with their present proposal. All their measures have been brought down at the last moment. The Judiciary Bill was introduced at the last moment, and the introduction of the Tariff was delayed as long as possible. They introduce all their measures at the last instead of at the first stage, and then throw upon the House the odium or responsibility of any delay. There is no reason why this matter should not be discussed in the ordinary way. According to the statement of the Prime Minister, the troops need not leave here unti l the end of the month, and unless some better reason is advanced for the suspension of the standing orders I shall vote against the proposal. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I must also enter my protest against the suspension of the standing orders. A t the outset of our career as a Federal Parliament we should avoid adopting loose practices, and endeavour to set the best of examples. In the State Parliaments the suspension of the standing orders is always looked upon as a very dangerous .practice, and one which should be resorted to only in very extreme circumstances. The Government now ask us to proceed with a proposal, regarding which they have kept us practically in the dark. We have heard for the first time to-day of a despatch received on the 19th March, and the Ministry have not treated us with that respect for which we have a right to look. Under the circumstances, the Government might have decided upon their policy before this, and we should have had the despatch laid before us some time ago. Like other members who have preceded me, I intend to vote against the suspension of the standing orders. Sir EDWARDBRADD ON (Tasmania). In my judgment the Government are greatly to be blamed for their action in connection with this matter. There was no earthly reason why the despatch which was tabled to-day should not have been tabled weeks ago; and when the leader of the Opposition objects to this infraction of our standing orders and parliamentary procedure he does what is perfectly right. His view of the practice which should be adopted in the future will, I hope, be endorsed by honourable members generally, even if on the present occasion we allow the standing orders to be suspended in order.that the particular business which has been introduced may be transacted. We cannot too carefully safeguard our forms of procedure from sudden onslaughts by Ministers or anybody else. I trust that whilst honourable members upon this side of the Chamber will not take any special action to defeat Ministers, in the present instance, by pressing the matter to a division, it will",17,Suspension Of Standing Orders

General) I quite agree with my right honourable friend, and those who have preceded me, that it is possible to abuse this form of procedure, although the standing orders, by requiring the submission of a special motion, sufficiently safeguard the business of the House, should the House find f it occasion to intervene. members appear to have fixed their attention solely upon the despatch which reached us on tbe 19th' of last month. But I would point out that it was.the first intimation we had of any desire on the part of the Imperial Government that some such a'epresentation as is now proposed was desired on the part of the Commonwealth. ment are concernpd. no official information had reached them, and no private information had reached me individually. Upon the reeeipt of that information it became necessary to institute inquiries, which have been more searching than may at first sight appear. Por example, there was the question of cost to be considered. There are various modes in which the Commonwealth could be represented, and a choice had to be made, but I do not wish to deal with that aspect at the present stage. I merely say that the receipt of the communication in question marked the beginning of a series of inquiries which have been concluded only within the last day or two. The simple reason why this proposal has not previously appeared upon the business-paper is that the Government have daily cherished the expectation that the debate upon the Tariff would be -concluded, so far as the schedule was concerned, before we required to submit this Bill. It is only within the past few days that we have received an intimation-as a result of the inquiries made in regard to -shipping accommodation-whic h has shown -us the urgency of this particular measure. Until then we were under the impression that we had the whole of next week within which this Bill could be passed in ample time. We were loth to intervene during the -discussion of the Tariff with a foreign proposal of this sort, except under the spur of absolute necessity. This has been forced upon us by the shipping arrangements. We were not informed of the nature of these arrangements t ill three days ago. When the despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies reached the Government it seemed to them proper that not only the proposal with regard to the despatch of troops, but the question of the desirability of making any other kind of demonstration which might be regarded as necessary, should be considered. We had to obtain information, which is in the possession of So far the Prime Minister, concerning other matters. If honourable members have regard to the necessity for making inquiries respecting the cost of the despatch of troops, to the shipping arrangements, to the urgency which exists for concluding the Tariff debate, and to the apparent prospect of disposing of that schedule before the introduction of this It was known last year. measure, they will easily understand why As far as the Governthe Government have been unable to submit it earlier, and now find it of much greater urgency than any member of the Ministry had supposed. the arrangements of which the Attorney General has spoken could have been effected in a quiet, peaceful, regular way if this matter had Veen put in hand earlier. The action of the Government looks like an attempt to rush their proposal through the committee. They have been in possession of the despatch, which to-day has been laid upon the table, for three weeks. They have treated it as of no consequence, and they only now wake up to find that this B ill is a matter of urgent and pressing necessity which must be put through at once. In addition to that, the despatch is only placed upon the table, mysteriously enough, upon the very day upon which they wish to rush this Bill through the House without the usual consideration being given to it . I ask the Government whether they desire honourable members to believe that the stage which they have now reached could not have been reached in a better or more orderly way if this matter had been put in hand only a week ago ? Time will be lost by attempting to force the measure through in this manner. I am glad that honourable members are waking up to the fact that we have such things as standing orders.

Whatever else the first Federal Parliament may establish a record for, it has certainly -established one for suspending the standing orders. All this is quite unnecessary. It is all very well for the right honourable member for Tasmania to express the hope that this suspension will not be interpreted as a precedent, but I would point out that precedents have already been made, and are being religiously followed by the Government. Having regard to the object of the Government, I do not feel justified in voting against the motion, but I am none the less bound to protest against the flippant use which is made of our standing orders which ought to be regarded in a more serious light. several occasions I have taken objection to Ministers proceeding with the second reading of Bills before they had been circulated for some days. We are now asked to go further, and to suspend the standing orders to enable a Bill to pass through all its stages to day. member had the schedule last night. the Bill. I am merely objecting to the constant practice of the Government in neglecting to circulate Bills until their second reading is about to be moved. In one instance they allowed .about five months to elapse between the first reading of a Bill and the date upon which copies of it were circulated amongst honourable members. appeared as if they were ashamed to put before the country their own legislative offspring. In asking the House to agree to this motion, not a single word has been urged in its favour. That is a bad practice. All that the Constitution requires is that a message from the Governor General should at some stage of our proceedings be brought down. But the practice adopted by the Government-under several occasions-has been to go into committee immediately the message is received, and without a single word in favour of the resolution to adopt it and report it to the House. That is a bad practice. We have thus already affirmed the desirability of being represented at home, and yet we are now asked to consider the expediency of 33 D allowing the Prime Minister and the troops to attend the Coronation ceremonies. That is a stupid practice, and the sooner it is altered the better. vious occasions I have raised very strong objection to the suspension of the standing orders. Whilei n the present instance I cannot help blaming the Government for laxity in regard to the procedure which has been adopted, I must confess that I am in f u l l sympathy with the schedule which has been presented to honourable members. Therefore, I do not like to give a vote which will have the effect of preventing its consideration this afternoon^ much as I object to the practice of suspending the standing orders.

Having regard, however, to the importance of the subject, it seemed to me, on further consideration, that whatever might be decided by the House, the head of the Government should take charge of this measure. When the item to which I have referred is reached I shall not embarrass the committee by taking part in the discussion, nor by in any way taking a course which might render hon6rable members, in their own judgment, less free to express themselves with all frankness.

46,Mr Bart On (Hunter,"Minister for the 26th June. It is the opinion of Ministers that, not only with respect to the invitation I have received, but in other matters, the Commonwealth should-no t in an extravagant way, nor, on the other hand, in a niggardly way, but in a way consistent with the importance of the Empire-tak e its place in the family of nations which go to make up the greatest empire in the world. The Government ask the House for what, in our judgment, is no more and no less than is right and proper. We do not ask the House to provide for the 580 troops mentioned in the despatch ;. that number was named as a maximum. We ask for less than half the number, but we do think, there being horses stabled in England, that the best way to typify the military position of Australia, such as it is, is to send troops of the character of those who have so signally helped in South Africa to vindicate the Empire and to uphold tlie honour of our country. We must all feel legitimate pride in the service rendered by our men, and there are among our own forces now, or available for selection in South Africa, a very large number of men who have assisted in that service. We propose that the men selected shall be diosen only from those who have served, or are now serving, in South Africa, and that they shall be exclusively mounted troops. apply to the officers ? well as to men. The Government take all possible precautions to see that the officers as well as tlie men selected have served, or are serving, in South since this visit to England must be looked upon by the whole Empire as well as by Australia as something in the nature of a meet recognition of their services. We are informed by the military authorities that the expense will be about the same whether the troops are sent from South Africa to England and returned to Australia, or whether they are sent direct from Australia to England and back again. In carrying out this visit, we wish to recognise the services, not only of those who are now in South Africa, but also of those who have done their duty there and returned. House approves of the sending of a body of 250 men, I hope to be able to arrange that at least 50 of them shall be chosen from amongst those who are now serving in South Africa, and that, as a large number of 33 D z soldiers have returned from South Africa, their services shall also be recognised. In arriving at 250 as the number to be sent, we have behind us what is to some extent a precedent, the number of soldiers sent to represent the individual colonies at the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoriai n 1897 having been 253. sent by the colony of New South Wales. present on that occasion were Lancers, who had proceeded to England for training, and the cost of the visit was materially reduced by the munificence of a gentleman residing in New South Wales, Colonel Burns. As to the other expenditure provided for in the Bill, the amount set down for the illumination of the Commonwealth buildings in the State capitals has been arrived at after careful inquiry. There is no doubt that every ' important city in the British Empire will be illuminated upon the evening of the Coronation Day, and the amount provided for in the Bill is to meet the Commonwealth's share of the expense. the Customs-houses and the Post-offices that is provided for 1 Commonwealth buildings generally, which, of course, include those offices. The Victorian illuminations upon the occasion of the Commonwealth celebrations applies to officers as cost £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 ,' but that expenditure was will spread over several -nights. No doubt some of the material used then can be used again; but upon inquiry, the Africa, Government find that, in order that the illuminations, however modestly designed, may be effective, it will be hard to reduce the cost of them below the sum of £5,500. The illuminations will have to be carried out in the six capitals of the States, and will average a little over £ 9 0 0 for each city. Where the buildings are large and imposing, the cost will be more than that, so that what is done may be effective, and where the buildings are small and less imposing the cost will be less than the average; but no injury will be done to any State, because, as this expendiTherefore, if the ture will be classed with what is known under the terms of the Constitution as "" new or other expenditure,"" it will be contributed by the States in proportion to their population.

In addition, there is the expenditure of £5,500 upon illuminations; but as an event of this character has not occurred for 64 years, the Government do not think that the citizens of the Commonwealth are being asked to pay too much for its fitting celebration. ""We ask, also, for the approval of the House to an expenditure of £2,000 upon the despatch of a Commonwealth rifle team to compete at Bisley. It is thought that that is a very modest sum to expend in connection with such an occasion, and that its expenditure will probably result in the cultivation of an honourable and healthy emulation between our riflemen and those of other parts of the Empire. be an annual one 1 occasion. be sent 1 the team will be eight or ten. must be a member of the Defence forces, and the team will be selected according to merit.

To go a little more into detail, I find that the Military department estimated, on the assumption that 300 troops were to be sent, that the passage money to and from England, pay, clothing, accoutrements, and contingencies, would come to £30,871. the passage money per head ? I find now that passages can be obtained for officers for £ 75 return, and for men for £33 return. If we had followed the practice which obtained when contingents were sent home by the various colonies -on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee, we might have saved the amount set down for pay, and afterwards, if it was thought fit, have allowed those who went a bonus. On that occasion the only colony which paid its soldiers was South Australia. It seems right to us, however, that the men who are sent should be paid. If they are not paid, it will mean the almost entire exclusion of those whose means are humble, and those who have the leisure and are able to go without pay will monopolize the honour of representing the Commonwealth. Therefore, I submit that the men who go should be paid at the rates given to the contingents which have been sent to SouthA f r i c a ; that is to say, 5s. a day for the privates, and so much for the officers, according to the prevailing rates. It is not desirable to practise upon the generosity of those who have leisure by sending them without pay, or to practically exclude those who have neither leisure nor money by refusing them pay. the expenditure to absent ? No ; it is only for this months. They will get away from London sooner than the political representatives of many men are to the Commonwealth, the Dominion, and New Zealand, because those representatives will have to remain for perhaps a fortnight to attend certain conferences which are to be held. It will be necessary, however, for them to start earlier than I shall have to start, because it is not my intention to proceed by way.of the Cape, and to land with our own contingent, as I hear is contemplated in another case. I understand that if the troops leave Sydney on the 19th April, Melbourne on the 25th, and Adelaide on the 30th, they should arrive in London about the 19th Junea week before I shall do my best to the Coronation-whic h will give them a day or two to recover from their journey, and a sufficient interval to see to their accoutrements, and become accustomed to the horses which will be provided for them. We find that it is possible to send them by a fine steamer, of a type which has been used already for transport purposes by the Imperial Government. The passage money for 300 men would come to £13,050, the pay to £11,820, the clothing and accoutrements to £3,001, and the contingencies to £3,000, making a total of £30,871. As the Cabinet have decided, however, that 250 men will be a sufficient number to send, the actual cost will be arrived at by deducting onesixth that amount, the balance being within a few pounds of the sum which Parliament is asked to vote.

Whilst 580 men were mentioned as the maximum number in the despatch which I have read, I understand that a similar despatch sent to New Zealand named a maximum of 150, and that New Zealand is sending the maximum. I am not going to base upon that any special appeal to this House to send an unnecessary number of troops. I only mention it for the purpose of showing that the Government are acting in a spirit of moderation, because, when a neighbouring self-governing colony with one-fifth of the population of this Commonwealth sends its maximum number, it is surely moderation for the Commonwealth to offer to send less than half the maximum. I understand-and this is a consideration which I shall put earnestly to honourable members-that all the other parts of the Empire will be represented by troops on the occasion of the coronation. There will, thereto defray a share of the expense, we fore, be a representation which will be typical of the strength and cohesion of the Empire. That we should not join in such a representation would, I think, be a course deeply to be regretted, because our refusal to do so would not only concern ourselves, but would absolutely deprive the military representation at the coronation celebrations of that feature of cohesion and completeness which ought to be its essential. So that a refusal coming from this Commonwealth would to a certain extent operate to mar the success and completeness of the representation of the whole Empire.

I have given British representative contingent which was a reason which, I think, should first appeal sent here by Great Britain. Wheni t was to us why, as long as we remain part of the necessary to celebrate the inauguration of Empire, we should be represented in the way that is asked. I would urge 'this further reason : that so long as the expense is not excessive-and I venture to think that the expense proposed is not excessive it is desirable that we should be ready to undergo some expense in military representation, and for this reason : Every soldier that this Commonwealth has sent to the war in South Africa, and not only that, every soldier sent by the various States since, I think, the third and fourth contingents, has been despatched by the Imperial Government. We have not found the money, but it has been provided by the taxpayers of Great Britain. Therefore, I should be. very sorry indeed if it were open to any one to draw the inference from any refusal of ours to take part in the Coronation celebrations that when John Bull paid the piper we were ready to dance to the piping, but that when we were asked flouted him and would not join him. That is not a position, I think, that we can worthily assume, nor is it one consistent either with our pride of race or with our pride in our position in these southern seas. An Honorable MEMBER -The Prime Minister does not say that Australia has not sent out any troops at her own expense? first few contingents were financed by the States, but after those had been despatched, and even before the Commonwealth was many men is formed, all the soldiers were sent at the expense of Great Britain.

She sent a contingent here representing in the most striking and picturesque form-as I say again, without regard to expense-no t only the great regiments of England, Ireland, and Scotland, but also her forces in the rest of the Empire, and no one, I think, who saw them will forget the dash and the gallant bearing of those Indian soldiers who came here with their British comrades. wards we legislated to keep them out. keep men of that kind out of Australia? Those Indian officers were gentlemen, and all of them could pass our education test, and perhaps a few of the men could have done so, too. The officers, however, have not offered themselves for the passing of our test, and I do not think we need inquire at the pvesent moment into the way in which we should receive them. They were sent here as a part of a corps representing the Empire, to which I haye referred only with a view to show honourable members that Great Britain did not exhibit herself a niggard, but horsemen, and that every unit in the forces gave us of her best to grace our ceremonial at the inauguration of the federation.

They are infantry mounted-that is, men who fight on foot, but proceed from place to place on horseback.' If the number mentioned in the military estimate, 300, had been sent, tlie men would have been selected from the various States in the following proportions :-Ninety-nin e from New South Wales, 85 from Victoria, 40 from Queensland, 26 from South Australia, 16 from Western Australia, and 11 from Tasmania. As the cost would have been according to population-and this draft will be on Did we legislate to the same basis-that would have been an equitable adjustment. I have just been handed an estimate, which I had not seen before I entered the House, showing how the reduced number will be furnished. Eighty-four will come from New South Wales, 73 from Victoria, 35 from Queensland, 22 from South Australia, 17 from Western Australia, and 11 from Tasmania. This makes a total of 242 men, which, with the ordinary staff officers as mentioned i u the despatch, will bring the total up to 250. It is proposed that the men selected shall be good shall be, as far as possible, represented, in order that there may be no sense of injustice felt by any of the troops left behind.

Minister suggest 1 be advisable to represent the products of Australia in a public way by the erection of an arch ; but I think that an expenditure -of £6,000 would be excessive, and that £3,000 would probably be sufficient to -enable us to make an effective representation of that kind. the least that could be appropriated for the -erection of an effective arch. It might be advisable for us to erect such an arch, but I -do not regard myself as justified in pressing too much expense on the House in view of our relations with the States. A t the same time, I think we should have every one of the States with us in providing for the -effective representation of the Commonwealth. I have great pleasure in moving the second reading of the Bill. sideration of this Bill, I wish to put aside the feeling of irritation which I experienced regarding the manner in which the Government have brought this matter before the House. The event to which the measure refers is one calculated to evoke the most loyal expressions of congratulation with reference to the King whose accession to the throne is about to be marked in the usual manner. The late Prince of AVales, during the long period in which he discharged a multitude of duties and -obligations on behalf of the Sovereign, proved himself a worthy constitutional .successor to Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. As a representative of the embodied power of the British Empire we shall hail his coronation throughout the length and breadth of Australasia with feelings of the keenest satisfaction. That fact in itself will probably be a greater source of satisfaction to His Majesty than will any mere contribution which we may make to the pageantry of the ceremonial itself. A t the same time. I do not wish to oppose the Government proposition to despatch a representative body of our military forces to take part in that great event. So far as the Prime Minister himself is concerned, I think that it was his duty to take charge of this Bill, and I cannot conceive of any sense of delicacy which should prompt him to refrain from so doing. His shareinthe transaction is purely an official one. It comes to course does the Prime him simply as one of the high obligations attached to the office which he fills, and I suggest that it would we all regard the proposition which has been submitted as one which is made, so far as he is concerned, by virtue of the necessities of the case. Therefore, I feel no desire to carp at the amount which has been placed opposite the highly-distinguished mission which the Prime Minister will undertake on behalf of the people of Australia. So far as my experience goes, that I think £3,000 is about sum is not to be cavilled at upon any ground of economy. But, in the present state of the Australian finances, I . cannot feel quite so sure that, even upon occasions of rejoicing, we should not begin to study economy and prudence. AVe have spent enormous sums of money in connection with the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. I do not begrudge that expenditure, although I believe that upon both occasions large amounts were wasted. There, is however, a feeling growing up throughout the CommonwealthI think in the most wise and healthy manner-that even in connection with our pageantry and ceremonials, we shall have to study very keenly questions connected with the financial condition of the States. AVhen the Prime Minister tells us that G reat Britain with her army of at least a quarter of a million soldiers, sent 1,000 men to Australia to participate in the inauguration of our Commonwealth, the analogy is not a happy one.

When the Prime Minister speaks of this or that, as representing only so much per head of the population, we must not forget that if we pile up the farthings they will soon become a serious item in the daily life of our people. So far as the proposed military delegation is concerned, I think that we can be fitly represented by a smaller number of men. I believe that the proposal to spend £26,000 upon this particular featureof our representation is one which we, as prudent guardians of the finances of the Commonwealth, ought not to sanction. Over and over again we have heard appeals by the Treasurer to increase the taxation of the people upon articles which chiefly are consumed by tlie poorest and most necessitous classes of the community. deavour in our expenditure the same prudent spirit as the Treasurer breathes when he calls upon us to impose taxation upon the people of the country. when our people must take the question of economy into serious consideration. One great duty which the Commonwealth Parliament owes to the people of Australia is to set au example of rigid economy in our administration of public affairs. If we do that in dealing wibh this or that servant of the Commonwealth, and if we are forced to deal rigidly with our own officers in matters of every-day service and obligation, it surely behoves us to be frugal and prudent, even at a time when we propose to pay a graceful and fitting compliment to the Sovereign of tlie Empire! feel bhab a smaller number of broops will supply all bhe needs of the coming great occasion.

I strongly hope that the men who are now serving in South Africa will enjoy their full share of bhis representation. every ground of justice I feel that those who have served should be fully recognised, but in equal ratio should our representation be composed of men taken from the fields of battle in South Africa.

A t the same time, I cannot see my way to support two of the items which are contained in the schedule under consideration, namely, the expenditure proposed to be incurred in connection with sending a contingent to England, and in the despatch of a rifle team to Bisley. There are many ways in which we can celebrate the occasion at a very much less expense, and in a much more fitting manner. Por instance, the Prime Minister made reference to the erection of an arch. Now an arch, emblematic of the industries of the Commonwealth would, in my opinion, be a very suitable way of celebrating the occasion. It would exhibit us to another part of the world in the light in which we desire to be exhibited, as a peaceful and industrial people, and not as a people who are anxious for any display of militarism. We do not pretend to be a military power. I have endeavoured as much as any person in the Commonwealth to aid the Imperial Government when we were able to be of real service to them. During.my short term of oflice as Premier of Victoria, I despatched no less than four contingents to South Africa without waiting to be asked for their services, and I will go as far in that direction in the future as will any man. If it beto think it is possible that they have paid! came necessary-as I sincerely hope it never w ill I would go to the length of spending our last shilling and of shedding our last drop of blood in the defence of the Empire. But at the same time. I am not and have never been an advocate of extravagance, and I consider that the two items which I have mentioned are unnecessary to Australia's proper representation at the Coronation. I will not object to the despatch of a small contingent if such an action is considered necessary, but certainly I shall never consent to the expenditure of £26,000 in this connection. Concerning the proposal to despatch a rifle team to Bisley, I cannot forget that when I have sent letters to the Commonwealth Defence department, asking for assistance to enable members of rifle clubs to qualify themselves as marksmen, those appeals have been very curtly refused. How can I go to my constituents and tell them that I voted for an expenditure of money to exhibit the skill of those who were taught rifle shooting by our predecessors in the States, and refused to assist our people to qualify themselves for thefuture defence of their hearths and homes, should the emergency ever arise?.' So far as the representation of the Commonwealth by the Prime Minister is concerned, the whole Commonwealth is unanimous, as we shall also be unanimous in our desire to make some suitable display here by illumination or otherwise. But I feel perfectly sure that some display in the form of an arch, indicative of the industries of the Commonwealth, would be much more in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Australia than any attempt at a military display. Wheni t becomes necessary for usto send assistance to the Empire the unanimity of tlie Commonwealth may be relied! on. Buti n the matter of unnecessary expenditure we should be a little more careful than we have been hitherto. I certainly do not look with any great degree of satisfaction on what we have done in this respect in thepast. We commenced badly when we added £400 each to the remuneration of the Ministers of the Commonwealth. I think that we have created an unnecessary number of highly-paid officers. We have increased theprinting bill unreasonably, and also in creased the cost of every department which the Commonwealth has taken over.

M c LEAN you, Mr Speaker, but surely it is in order to deal with the raising of revenue for the expenditure we are asked to incur ? It is our duty to consider the means of the people for whom we are merely custodians and trustees, and to do what is best for their welfare and prosperity. The welfare of the people can never be secured by displays of the kind we are asked to sanction. In such displays there is no -harmony with the objects or aspirations of the people of Australia, who do not desire to be regarded as a military power. We may on occasions be called on to take the field, and I feel sure that our young men would respond cheerfully and willingly to any such call, but I sincerely hope we shall never pose before the world as a military or an aggressive nation. It is not in that direction we should endeavour to make a display, but in the direction of showing to the people of the old world in a suitable manner the feelings and aspirathat is another question. The fact that we tions of the people of this Commonwealth. who underrates in the slightest degree the importance of the occasion at which we are asked to assist in London. The coronation of the King of the British Empire possesses a significance nowadays entirely different from that which attached to the coronation of the monarch of England a few centuries ago. Theni t was merely an act of honour, as one might say, towards the monarch, whereas now it is an event in which everyone in the Empire has a direct personal interest. The leader of the Opposition struck the keynote, -sofaras Australia is concerned, whenhestated that the Prime Minister, in this relation, irepresented the Commonwealth of Australia. And that is the contention I rely on in opposing a number of the items in this ^schedule. A t this stage in the Empire's history it is not necessary to do anything to demonstrate the loyalty of this section -of the Empire. That loyalty has been --demonstrated to an extent that may be '-'out of proportion to our real potentialities, member for Corio, there are none of us who and it is recognised in every other portion of the Empire, and especially by those in the older land.

I cannot, however, see any necessity for spending the amount of money which it is proposed to expend in sending troops to England. I do not quite agree with the honourable member for Gippsland in his criticism of the financial procedure of the Commonwealth up to the present period of its existence. I shall have pleasure in debating the question when it comes in proper shape, but at present I shall merely say that I do not think there has been any extravagance so far. . I do not think the printing bill is unreasonable under all the circumstances, and I for one should resist any attempt on the part of a few journalists to obtain a monopoly of parliamentary reporting to the detriment of the people of Australia. However, that is a matter I intend to debate on a more fitting occasion. so large as has been represented. have not so far indulged in extravagance is rather an additional reason for resisting the temptation held out to us by the head of the Defence department, who has told us that in Western Australia he has spent £600,000 without consulting Parliament. No doubt anything that the right honourable gentleman did would be wise, but that kind of expenditure is not advisable under all circumstances, especially when the right honourable gentleman is at the head of a department, the leading spirits of which are only too glad to avail themselves of every opportunity for garish display. There is no body of men in Australia more likely to take advantage of expenditure than the heads of the military department, which is the department on which the people have to keep their fingers all the time in order to hold it in check. There is no department in the service so likely to indulge in expenditure out of all reason, but with the exception of, perhaps, the Minister for Defence and the honourable and gallant can pretend to criticise with exactitude the proposal before us.

95,Mr Watson,"I know that is so, butregarded in an unfair light by the people of England. The fact that Mr Seddon has taken advantage to the full of the possibilities of the situation in sending troops home -constitutes no precedent for us. Mr Seddon .seems to have gone right out of himself during the last year or so, and if he is not put under restraint he may find his tight little -colony in a condition which will cause its people to lament for a considerable time the acts of his Government. There is another item in this schedule which is even less -defensible than the proposal to send troops. 'The sending of troops might be defended, as the Prime Minister has very properly said, -on the ground that the Empire was represented here at the Commonwealth celebrations, and that we ought to reciprocate. But the proposal to send a rifle team to Bisley, -cannot be justified. It cannot be argued that because of this expenditure of £2,000 .any one man in the team will become a better shot. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The House has already expressed an opinion against the sending of this team. had an opportunity of expressing an opinion -as to the sending of a team, but I believe there is a concensusof opinion against the proposal. As pointed out by the honourable member for Gippsland, applications for the -encouragement of rifle shooting have been -consistently refused by the head of the department who now asks us to vote £2,000 in order to enable a number of gentlemen to take an excursion into England. There is not the least possibility of any improvement in the shooting of those who will represent the Commonwealth in this team. Imperial significance 1 recommend it that may be urged in favour of sending troops to take part in the Coronation procession. has promised it . mised it or not, this House is the guardian of the public purse, and I take it that if there is a majority against the expenditure, the Government will see the advisability of allowing that majority to have its own way. I am not sure that the illumination of the Commonwealth buildings is a necessary part of the celebration. In any case, I think that the sum set down is rather a large one. I take it that there are only three Commonwealth buildings in each city which should be illuminated-the Post-office, the Custom-house, and the barracks ; but in many cases the head-quarters of the military are too far from the centre of the city to make their illumination desirable. in which other Ministerial departments are located. would matter much if they were left out of the scheme of illumination. I do not think that we are justified in spending a large sum upon powder or gas. The various States are crying out about the condition of their finances, and some of them have suffered severely from droughts and other visitations. That being so, we are bound to exercise eveiy economy consistent with the efficient working of the federal machine. if the States were to illuminate their public buildings, and the Commonwealth public buildings were left unlighted ? the financial condition of some of the States, I should think that they will not illuminate their buildings. Whatever is done should not be upon an extravagant scale. I trust that the effect of the discussion of the Government proposals will be to bring about the reduction of the expenditure by somethinglike £30,000. If the other items are reduced, I see no great objection to the erection of a Commonwealth arch in London, but I will not be a party to it if it will mean expenditure in addition to that already proposed by the Government. with the honourable member for Bland that in view of the financial, condition of the States at the present time the House should make a stand against the proposals of the Government. Remembering the pathetic appeals of the Treasurer for additional revenue amounting to £25,000, by an increase in the duties upon cotton-piece goods and other lines, and the dire results which the right honourable gentleman pictured as likely to follow, if we did not accede to his request, we may very well pause before sanctioning the expenditure now asked for. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland, that tli is display is not necessary to prove our loyalty to the Empire-that has already been more than amply proved. The",29,Second Reading

Whether the people of Great Britain realize it or not, he will more fittingly represent us than will any military display that we can make. If the people of Great Britain are not already convinced of our loyalty, the sending of 250 mounted troops to take part in a pageant will not convince them of it. With regard to the proposal for illuminating the Commonwealth buildings, it seems to me that since now, in all the States, and particularly in Victoria, the mania for retrenchment fills the columns of the press and the minds of the citizens, we should be more economical. Victoria appears to be very much in the position of a drunkard who, awakening from a heavy debauch, puts his hand into his pocket, and, finding his money unaccountably gone, determines to cut down the supplies of his wife and children, and thus begin to save up for another orgie. We have already the indications of a desire for another ""go-in."" the State will wish to put on the screw again, and ultimately I hope it will realize the ridiculousness of its position, and become absolutely sane. I do not know why we should spend money upon illuminations, and probably no one else knows. It seems to me that a number of people are afraid that unless they are continually waving flags, shouting "" God Save the King,"" and setting fire to Roman candles, they will be thought disloyal to the British Empire. people in the part from which I coine never dream of doing these things. are supposed, by virtue of their citizenship, to be loyal, and are not required to prove their loyalty in that manner. some persons do not think that we should have done what we have done in South Africa, I am not one of them. Like the honourable member for Gippsland, if it were necessary, I should be prepared to go still further in assisting the Empire, either in South Africa or elsewhere. In this matter, however, I feel that our loyalty to the Empire is not concerned. As to the sending of a team of riflemen to Bisley, while I would vote for the expenditure of £10,000 in encouraging rifle shooting in this country, I do not see the use of sending eight men who can already shoot well to compete in Great Britain. If we are going to rely upon the valour and good shooting of our citizens, what we want is, not eight men Mr Hughes. who can shoot extraordinarily well, b u t 80,000 men who can hit what they shootat. The love for the Empire which somehonorable gentlemen profess ill accords with the fact that whenever they have anything topurchase they invariably give their ordersto Germany. One of the strangest comments upon the loyalty of this State is to befound in the news which was published in parallel columns of the Age a month ago. We then read what the Prime Minister said Australia desired to do in regard to the war in South Africa, and from tlie same page we learned that this State had just given an order to Germany for £16,000 worth of steel rails. honourable member belongs would allow German rails to be imported here free of duty. although we have so much to say about helping our big brother, we do not No doubt, afterwards bother about giving him an order for steel rails, although we know that he gets his living largely by selling them. However, these little inconsistencies help to make life worth living. The Government, whose watchword is economy, and whose desire is to do something for the States, now propose that we should fire off our. Chinese crackers, wave our little banners, and utter our war-whoops on the 26th June.

107,Mr Hughes,"My point is that,^worthy to live. But only the other day the great Emperor of Germany published a pro-clamation to his people, in which he asked them not to spend money in celebrating his birthday when there were hundreds of per-sons starving throughout the German Empire; and, accordingly, the money which would have been spent was put into a great fund to feed those people. Every day we see -crowds of working men standing under Gor-don's monument, appealing to the Premier -of Victoria for work. They come here in great deputations, to ask the Prime Minister to do something for them. But while we have not a dollar for our hungry people at home, we have £35,000 to spend in powder explosions and champagne razzle-dazzles in London. If the Commonwealth of Australia is to lose its standing or prestige unless it has 200 or 300 men to carry rifles and ride down Piccadilly, I shall be sorry for it . My fear is that the London creditors of Australia may keep the men there as a security for what we owe them. It is a fine thing for people who are borrowing money and paying enormous rates of interest upon a national debt of £200,000,000 to indulge in such extravagance. We have every newspaper crying out for economy, and we have the States denouncing this Parliament because we are taking the burdens from the backs of the people by abolishing the dutieson kerosene and tea. All this shows that money is needed for the legitimate purposes of government, and cannot be spared for any idle display. The Commonwealth will be sufficiently represented by the Prime Minister and others who may go to England to be present at the Coronation. We do not want to be represented by a lot of men carrying guns on horseback. Every nation that has set up a military oligarchy has finally sunk beneath the power of the military. I am perfectly agreeable that £35,000 should be spent in providing food for the poor people of Australia. If His Majesty the King intends to feed 500,000 of the poor people of England on Coronation Day, I think it would be a good thing for us to spend £35,000 in following his example. The democratic people of the Commonwealth should not be taxed in order to add to the success of ceremonies which in their very essence are opposed to the principles of democracy. The system which lends it self to these displays is founded upon caste. Aristocracy is the parent of caste, and caste is the curse of the country. In South Africa caste has been at the bottom of many of the disasters which have befallen our troops. Plannel-headed fools were placed at the head of affairs because of their caste, and the whole operations of the army were muddled. While we have hungry people and deficient sewerage arrangements in our suburban post-offices we should not spend money in the way now proposed. Why should the Commonwealth borrow £30,000 or £40,000 in order to have a grand ""blowout?"" AVe should stop all expenditure that is not in harmony with the ideas of the people or for the benefit of the people. No one respects His Majesty theKing more than I do; he is really the only democratic king in the world and I am satisfied, from that fact that he is himself providing food for a large number of poor people, that he will be best pleased by our adopting a similar course. Probably our men when they get to London, will be like a certain regiment that went from Arizona to Washington-three-fourth s of them were drunk when they got there. AVhat did General Hutton remark the other day about the men of the last contingent that left Sydney? He said that all the sober men had gone, and the drunken men were left. I was there and heard every word. MrO ' MALLEY I can refer the honourable member to the Bulletin, which is the only independent paper in the Commonwealth. ing to do with the question before us. MrO ' MALLEY I quite agree with Mr Speaker. I shall oppose this vote in every possible way. agree that the Commonwealth should be represented at the Coronation, but celebrations, such as that intended to be made in connection with the Coronation, have been too long entirely associated with military displays.

Indeed, I believe that the whole 250 could be provided there. the subject. tralian soldiers in England who have fought the battles of tlie Empire, and have been wounded whilst upon active service.

Some of those * who have been receiving pay during the period of their sojourn in South Africa have accumulated sufficient funds to visit England. saw tbe wounded sailors belonging to HMS.

After every federation.there is sure to be some friction. State Parliaments will be found to some extent jealous of, if not antagonistic, to the Pederal Parliament. Most of us have been Members of Parliament before, and no Parliament of which I have had any experience has been so parsimonious as the Federal Parliament. Tlie charge of extravagance is absolutely a fiction, originating in the antagonism of a considerable number of people outside Parliament, most of whom have never given a moment's time to the service of the country, or under any circumstances sacrificed anything for the weal of tbe people. No doubt there is a sacrifice in connection with Parliament, but it is not a sacrifice by the people ; it is a sacrifice by honourable members, who come from all parts of Australia, and break up their homes, in order to represent their constituents, at great loss to themselves. ber is travelling far from the subject under discussion. that this Parliament is not extravagant.

M c LEAN (Lang) I can scarcely hope, after the eloquent speech of the honourable member for Richmond, to add much to a subject so important.

Such an arch might be made thoroughly representative of our productions, and would do great credit to our enterprise. Honourable members will remember that at the Commonwealth celebrations the foreign residents in Melbourne and in Sydney, and particularly in Sydney, were able to excellently represent the nations to which they belonged by an expenditure much less lavish. £2,000 would be an adequate amount for the erection of a suitable arch, I do not agree w i th the especially in Loudon, where the streets are so much narrower than those of our principal cities, and particularly of Adelaide and Melbourne.

137,Mr Henry Willis,"The fact thatmen selected should be those who have served the Empire in South Africa. support the Government proposals. I feel that it is due to the great Commonwealth of Australia that upon this, the first occasion upon which the States have had an opportunity of being represented as members of a federation, we should do our part in a becoming way to exemplify the power, the might, and the unity of the Empire to which we belong. I think that the proposals of the Government are moderate and reasonable, and 1 find myself unable to sympathize with those who appear to consider that a fewer number than 250 men should be sent. We must remember that at this great pageant every part of the Empire will be represented, and I feel sure that the States would be disappointed if the Commonwealth contingent were so small and insignificant as to cause remark on the score of its insufficiency. My opinion is that this is an occasion upon which the people would be willing that we should; if anything, be a little extravagant. Australians appear to me unduly sensitive as to the estimation in which their country is held by other people ; and I believe that if Parliament failed to encoronation will be the first occasion on which able the Government to secure our proper representation in England, it would disappoint the desires of the great majority of our peopleConsidering that there are six States to be represented, it would appear that 250 men are as few as we can very well send. Our people are proud of their soldiers, and they will rejoice that some of those who have borne the burden aud heat of the day in South Africa are to receive this recognition of their services. I therefore trust that the Government proposals will be carried. The amount set < down to cover the expenses of the Prime Minister is extremely moderate. Any one who has been to London even in a semi public capacity must know how enormously expenses are run up, and the fact that the Prime Minister will be a Royal guest will add to, instead of reducing, his expenses. gentleman will be invited, as the representative of the Commonwealth, to all manner of public ceremonies'and functions,his appearance at which will involve him in very large expense. I need not enter into details, because it will bs readily understood that, as the representative of Australia, the 33 E J Prime Minister could not act in any mean or unbecoming way. I shall be extremely surprised if the expenses of the Prime Minister are covered by the amount set down in the schedule, and I should have preferred to see it fixed at a larger figure. the expense which it is proposed to incur seems to be very heavy, but I ' agree with honourable members who have expressed the view that if the States had acted separately, the outlay would have been considerably greater. The occasion will be unique in the history of tbe Empire and in our history as a Commonwealth. In the first place, we have attracted the attention, not only of the British Empire, but of the .whole world by the position we have taken up in connection with the South African war, and the people of Great Britain and others who come from all parts of the world will desire to show their approval of the step we took in the defence of the Empire. Surelyi t is of the utmost importance that we should make a creditable exhibition, when, without doubt, our representatives will meet with a reception of which every citizen of the Commonwealth may feel proud. Moreover, the the Commonwealth has been able to arrange for its representation in London. Surelyi t is desirable that for that reason alone we should make a creditable appearance. If we cannot do so we had better not be represented at all. I believe that the people of the Commonwealth generally desire thatweshallmakeafitting response to the invitation extended to us. Some reference has been made to the waste of money that will be involved, but although the £35,000 will be taken out of our Commonwealth exchequer, it must be remembered that we shall probably derive great benefit in a commercial sense from the interest aroused by the presence of our troops in London. It»is not, however, upon this ground that I think we should support the vote, because it is quite unimportant compared with the desire of the people that we should share in a display signifying the cohesion of the Empire. The proposal that the Commonwealth buildings in each of the State capitals shall be illuminated on the occasion of the coronation is one which I regard with the least favour. The Prime Minister has pointed out, however, that we have all the neeessary material on hand, and as there will doubtless be some similar displays by the State Governments, I take no",37,Second Reading

W it h rethe duty of seeing that the Commonwealth gard to the sending of a Commonwealth rifle team to the Bisley meeting, I am afraid that there is rather a strong feeling in the House against the appropriation of the necessary money. I hope, however, that the item will be agreed to. I admit that it cannot be claimed that the sending of this team to England is in any way associated with the coronation celebrations, because steps were taken to form the. team long before any invitation was received by the Government. A t the same time, in view of the preparations which have been made by the Rifle Associations, it would be something in the nature of a breach of faith if the money were not now voted. The team has been selected after innummerable test matches. has been deferred pending the decision of Parliament. members of the team have been arranging with their employers for the necessary leave of absence. The Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company have agreed to allow one of their employees to go away, and have arranged to pay his salary to his wife and family during the time he is absent. Looking at this matter in another aspect, I think that every encouragement should be given to the members of rifle clubs who devote a great deal of their time to making themselves effective rifle shots. The selection of a team to compete at Bisley every year would give our riflemen something to aspire to. Reference has been made to the desirability of erecting an arch emblematic of the natural resources of the Commonwealth, and I hope that something in that direction will be undertaken. A t the same time, I think that if Parliament is not prepared to be represented by 250 Australian troops, it will be better for us to have no military representation at all, for in addition to the number which it is proposed to despatch from Australia, I hope that suitable men who may chance to be in London at the time, will be allowed an opportunity of joining in the procession. Undoubtedly they deserve recognition, on account of the fighting which tliey have done in South Africa. sentation of Australia was thus swollen to 500 men, the position would be improved from our point of view. ThoughI have been returned to Parliament charged with is not committed to extravagant expenditure, I think I am faithfully interpreting the wishes of my constituents in supporting the Government upon the present occasion. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON (South AustraUa) -It is not my intention to occupy the time of the House at any great length. I think it was Conan Doyle who some time ago suggested that a statue should be erected in London to Kruger, as the man who federated the British Empire. Without going into the question of the wisdom of giving effect to that suggestion, I think there can be no doubt as to the fact. Within the past three or four years the British Empire has been federated, and federated in such a way as could never have been accomplished by Act of Parliament. Australia has proved in a very conspicuous manner its loyalty to the Throne and to the Empire, an i it seems to me that this fact releases us from I know that already several any trammels as we approach the consideration of the proposed expenditure. I am very sorry to say that I cannot agree with the Government. I think that in this case they propose to spend more money than is necessary under the circumstances, and those who know me will, I think, bear me out when I say that my past record is one which shows that I am not likely to be guilty of disloyalty. Regarding the amount which it is proposed to vote the Prime Minister, I have not one word to say. If that sum is needed I shall most heartily support the vote. But concerning the proposal to send a rifle team to compete at Bisley, I think we can very much better utilize the money allotted for that purpose in Australia. Regarding the illumination of the Commonwealth buildings I am not sure that the f u l l amount specified need be spent in that particular way. I come now to the proposed expenditure of £26,000 in connection with the visit of the troops to London. I think that amount is needlessly high. ' I believe that any troops sent should be paid. There should be no idea of sending unpaid men. But if Australia is represented in London by 100 or 150 men, she will, in my judgment, be adequately represented. I was surprised to hear my right honourable friend the Minister for DefenceI f the military represay that the people of London would view with contempt a contingent of 100 troopers.

Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON -The reason why no feeling of the kind would he entertained is that the people of England would realize that these men represent the thousands who at the present moment are in South Africa defending the British Empire. desire to occupy very much time in discussing this matter. One or two remarks, however, have been made with which I do not agree. The Coronation of the King will be a very great event in the history of the British Empire. Moreover, it is the first occasion upon which the States of Australia have had an opportunity of being represented as a united nation. I feel sure that the niggardly spirit displayed by some honourable members in connection with our proposed representation at this great ceremony will not meet with the approval and support of the large body of the people. The honourable member for Kooyong talked about our representation in London as a kind of advertisement from which Australia would derive some reward in the shape of a material, advancement of her interests. I do not view the matter from any such stand-point. It is our duty, as part and parcel of the British Empire, to see that the Commonwealth is adequately represented upon the occasion of the Coronation. If we occupied the position of a handful of divided States instead of being federated, each State would be represented by its own Premier and its own contingent. But owing to federation, we now have an opportunity of being adequately represented by one contingent. As a result money is actually being saved to the people of Australia as a whole. From the opinions expressed by some honourable members this afternoon, it appears to me that they are possessed of very little national spirit. As an Australian, I am proud of ray native country, and proud of the Empire to which I belong, and I shall not be satisfied unless Australia is properly represented. I do not cavil at the amount which it is proposed to spend in this connection, with one exception. I am Indeed, as far as the Prime Minister's expenses are concerned, I think that he has asked for a very modest sum. He will attend the Coronation ceremonies as therepresentative of Australia, and ought to have sufficient means at his command to enable him to property represent us. It appears to me that the patriotism and national spirit of some honourable members is to be gauged by the expenditure of a paltry £2,000 or £3,000 upon a great occasion like this I do not agree with that spirit at all. I sincerely trust that the proposals of the Government will be carried, and then amended in committee, and that Australia will have that proper representation at the Coronation ceremonies to which she is entitled. that a parliamentarian will admit that a debate has influenced his opinion. In nearly all deliberative assemblies the representatives attend with their minds made up. I confess, however, that the progress of the discussion upon this question has influenced me a great deal. During the course of the debate the speeches delivered have ranged from commercialism to idealism. Some honourable members apparently wish Australia to be represented with all the splendour and gorgeousness of the ""Arabian Nights,"" while others seek only the Spartan simplicity of an advertisement. My first impression was that the adequate military representation of Australia could be accomplished only by sending the number of troops which the Government proposed. During the debate, however, I have considered the matter very cax-efully, and I can now see clearly enough that it is not numbers which are required in the pageant. could be represented by one. tative of the civil power of Australia will be present, namely, the Prime Minister. I would further point out that the great United States of America, which has been dragged into this debate by one honourable member in a fashion that I deprecate, is to be represented by one man only. WhilstI do not wish to be hysterical over this matter, I realize that the loyalty .which will be displayed at the Coronation ceremoniesisloyalty to the British Empire.

I thoroughly agree that the military forces of the Commonwealth should be represented by a contingent. tingent will march with the colonial forces of the Empire, we must agree that the fact that it comprises 250 or 100 men will not be studied. That is the opinion at which I have arrived during the course of the debate. In the first place I thought it was only right that we should be represented by the number of men suggested, but upon reflection I do not see why we should adopt the spectacular ideas of the New Zealand Premier. I was very glad to hear the Prime Minister say that he would arrive in England as the political representative of Australia, and not in the buccaneering manner of the Premier of an adjoining State. Sir WILLIAM honourable member refer 1 the position I take up is that whether the expenditure be £35,000 or £.65,000, it should not be incurred unless it is actuallylike some member of the Ministry to explain required. The question of extravagance or parsimony should be judged, not by the sum, but by the necessity of the expenditure. I see no danger of a military spii'it being unduly created. If the British people have a characteristic, it is that of being deliberative and phlegmatic, and not allowing themselves to be carried to extremes. 1 do not look on this celebration as a mere compliment to the King, but as another proof to the powers of the world that we can, after the time of trouble is over, provide port the second reading of the Bill, reserva representation, symbolical of the solidity of ing to myself the right to deal as I think the British Empire. The authorities of Great Britain do not require troops to represent that solidity; that has been demonstrated in South Africa; and the demonstration has not been lost on watchful foreign powers. I agree with honourable members who oppose the sending of a rifle team to Bisley, because I can see no results, ideal or otherwise, to warrant the expenditure. So far as the Prime Minister is concerned, the amount suggested for his expenses seems large, but those who support the right honourable gentleman in this matter are responsible to the Commonwealth. The citizens of Australia will not grudge any expenditure in this direction that may be necessary, and while I do not cavil at the amount, I think the citizens of the Commonwealth ought to know why a sum of ' £1,850 is provided for a three weeks' residence in England. member know that the trip will be three When we recollect that this conweeks ?

Taking a position between gorgeous orientalism and Spartan simplicity, I shall vote for every item on the schedule with the exception of that connected with the Bisley team. I shall support a reduction of the number of 250 troops, and I hope that those sent may be those who have served with honour in South Africa, and will be thoroughly representative of Australia. fit with the measure in committee. I consider that 100 or 150 troopswill be sufficiently representative, although the Minister for Defence and others think that less than 200 or 300 will cause the Commonwealth to look mean. In my opinion 100 troops in the coronation procession will be quite as effective as 1,000, and I would point out that if Australia were represented in this connection in proportion to her population, having regard to the number of troops sent from England to the Commonwealth inauguration, we should send only. 70 or 80 men. The Prime Minister has already told us that he intends the troops to be fully representative, and that of itself is quite sufficient to cause me to give my vote to the Government' to the extent I have indicated.

Yesterday, when I read the proposals of the Governmentas theyappeared upon thenoticepaper, I was very much surprised at them, and I freely expressed my determination to, in the main, oppose them. I was not then aware, however, that an official invitation had been received from the English Government to send a military representation to take part in the Coronation procession in London. Now that I have heard the message from the Imperial Government read, I feel constrained to reconsider the position, and I shall therefore vote for a reasonable expenditure for this purpose. If . the financial condition of the every member of the House would cheer-, fully vote for an expenditure -.of £26,000 in sending home an Australian Contingent. My original objection to the proposal of the Government was due, not to the lack of desire to see the Commonwealth fittingly represented at this great event, but to my knowledge of our financial situation.

Never before in the history of Australia has attention been so keenly directed' to the public expenditure and the need for reducing expenses. TheState Governments are everywhere being urged to economize; but how can we expect them to do so if we do not set them an example ?

163,,"I am sure that Sir EDWARD BRADDON I sent as I t was intended to display to the people of England the representatives of all the self governing communities under the British Sag, and of every country and every possession of the Empire. That was the significance of the procession which was the be all and end all of thegreatday when the Diamond Jubilee was celebrated. A t the coronation, the procession at the very best will be only a secondary consideration. The great function that is to take place in Westminster Abbey will absorb the principal interest of the people attending the celebration. I cannot see why Australia should not be adequately and effectively represented as regards her troops by the men who have seen service iu South Africa. Many of them are still serving, and others are in England, and could be got together at two or three days' notice to take their place in the procession. I am convinced that we could gather together, not from the hospitals or convalescent homes, but in England generally, a sufficient number of men who have served in South Africa to adequately represent the Commonwealth. One hundred men would be quite sufficient, but, if necessary, 150 could be got together with the greatest possible ease, and at the least possible expense. I hope, therefore, that we shall see the vote of £26,000 cut. down to something like £11,000. The question of the illumination of public buildings is very much one of estimate. I suppose that if the State Governments illuminate their buildings, it will be the duty of the Commonwealth to do something in the same direction. Whether £5,500 will be too large or too small a sum I cannot say, but we must hold Ministers responsible and take them to task if they exceed the necessary expenditure. W it h reference to the rifle team which it is proposed to send to the Bisley meeting I would ask honourable members to bear with me for a few minutes whilst I describe the way in which this vote originated. Some three or four years ago, the Premiers of all the States agreed that a representative team should be sent to England under the auspices of the Australian .National Rifle Association. The Minister for Defence was then one of the State Premiers, and the right honourable the Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the leader of the Opposision, were also among them. They were all in agreement as to the desirability of a rifle team being sent to Bisley, for the first part as a demonstration ' of the federal feeling of Australia, a feeling which happily or unhappilyI do not quite know which-has since been further developed by the union that has been brought about; and in the second place to encourage and foster the use of the rifle amongst our people. It was thought that this would tend to encourage Australians in shooting, by giving them something which would stimulate them to become better defenders in time of need. Having in view the immense importance of teaching our people the use of the rifle-as to which we have had an object lesson from our enemies in South Africa-w e cannot give them too much encouragement, whether by sending teams to international rifle meetings or otherwise. As to the Prime Minister's allowance for expenses, I shall say nothing now. That is a matter of detail that may very well be left until we go into committee. On the whole question, however, I would urge that ifc becomes us as the people of the great Australian nation to exhibit our thorough loyalty to the Empire, our loyalty to the flag, and our recognition of the fact that we owe, an infinite debt of gratitude to the mother country, and that we ma)' well seek opportunities to discharge that debt in every possible way this being one of them. for Defence) I should be very sorry to prolong this discussion, but as the largest item in the schedule is one connected with the despatch of troops, I may be expected to say a word or two.

Those who have that notion, when they know me better, will, find that it is not well-founded. Moreover, if any one supposes that I desire to spend money without the authority of Parliament, he is very much mistaken. gentleman told us that he once spent £600,000 in that way. would do it again, under the same conditions.

I very much doubt whether upon a close analysis being made of the expenditure of the Commonwealth from the date of its inauguration to the present, it would be found that as much has been spent in the Defence department as was spent by the States before federation was established. Honourable members seem to think that it is possible to take over a department, to re-organize it, to make it efficient, and to establish a system of economy before we have any legislation, and while a large portion of one's time is spent in Parliament. How was it possible for any department to be organized and placed upon an efficient basis during the present prolonged session of Parliament, especially in the absence of legislation for the purpose? I am led to make these remarks by the observations of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who declared it was necessary to stop the gradually increasing of the Commonwealth, that this Bill presented another instance of the extravagance of the Government. absolutely deny that there has been any extravagance, contrary that more has been expended upon any of the transferred departments than was spent upon them when they were under the control of the various State Governments. All that the Ministry desire is that the Commonwealth shall be adequately represented at the Coronation .ceremonies. Sir John, Forrest.

195,Mr Hartnoll (Tasmania),"It isany parsimonious spirit displayed on an occasion of this kind. If , however, we can fittingly reduce our expenditure it ought to be the earnest desire of this Parliament to do so. I do not entirely agree with the proposal of the leader of the Opposition that the number of troops should be reduced to 100,' because that number would be altogether inadequate for an effective display. If it could be done without embarrassing the Ministry and without prejudicing what it is earnestly desired to accomplish on this great occasion, I should like to see the number of troops reduced by 50. That would afford a very fitting display, and at the same time effect a saving of something over £5,000. It is incumbent on us, if we possibly can, to save not only in tens of thousands, but in thousands of pounds whenever opportunity offers. The question of a rifle team for Bisley can be more fittingly considered in the committee stage, when I presume the Ministeri n charge of the Bill will give us the fullest possible Information. The amount set down for the expenses of the Prime Minister may be regarded as fairly reasonable. Some honourable members seem to regard the amount as somewhat extravagant, but, so far as I am enabled to judge, occasions of this kind always mean considerable expense. I am pleased, at my first entrance into this assembly of all the talents of Australia, to have an opportunity of offering a few remarks on this measure. I only hope that whatever the decision may be in regard to the number of troops, or other expenditure under the Bill, we shall be animated by a desire to do honour to the great Empire to which we belong. Following the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, I may be permitted to congratulate that gentleman on the clearness and lucidity with which he has put forward his views in his first speech to this House. I need not tell the honourable member how cordially we welcome him amongst us. If the object of the Minister for Defence was to give reasons why the Bill should be passed in the form in which it was introduced, I do not think that he has succeeded in doing what he intended to do. To drag in the question of loyalty was a very great mistake. Our loyalty has nothing to do with this matter, and is altogether beyond dispute. We have proved it by actions which speak much louder than will the sending of 250 men to take part in the Coronation processiou. We all desire that the Commonwealth shall be fittingly represented in the Coronation ceremonies. The only question is what would be a fitting representation. The Government propose that we shall send a contingent of troops, despatch a rifle team to Bisley, illuminate our public buildings, and send the Prime Minister to England as a special representative. I am sure that the representation of the Commonwealth will be very fittingly placed in his hands. Every one will agree that his services to Australia justify the belief that he will fill the position with credit to himself and to the country. The main point of difference is as to the despatch of troops. If troops are sent, they will have nothing to do except to take part in the procession on Coronation Day; and the question we have to decide is whether it is worthwhile to spend £26,000 on sending 250 troops some thousands of miles in order to take part in one day's proceedings. Of course, their presence in London will add to the display, and give eclat to the proceedings; but I do not think the expenditure involved is justifiable. The Prime Minister said that we must not flout John Bull by declining to send troops to take part in this procession. That is a, stronger expression than he need have used. We shall not flout John Bull if we decline the invitation, and ib certainly cannot be considered as flouting him if we send 100 mounted men. Australia may have done only her duty to the Empire, but in bhe despatch of troops to South Africa she has acted in generous, fashion, and to accuse us of meanness because we do not think it worthwhile tospend a large sum of money on pageantry is to entirely misundersband our position. The Prime Minisber said that because England sent 1,000 men to Australia to take part in bhe Commonwealbh inaugural proceedings, we .should reburn bhe compliment ; but that does not seem bo me bo be a sbrong argument When bhe Imperial aubhoribies sent oub bhose troops, they did not do it with the object of getting a return of this kind, and the expense that they incurred was relatively less than the expense which we are now asked bo incur.'

The Commonwealth are not called upon to finance any such enterprise. Those who want to go home for a holiday should pay their own expenses. In New South Wales we have been endeavouring to encourage rifle practice amongst the people, and we have appealed in vain to the Government for assistance. AVe are told that the finances will not permit of any assistance being given to rifle clubs. In my electorate there are several important centres where rifle companies are ready to be formed, and they have so far failed to secure the necessary permission and assistance, because of that parsimony of which the Minister for Defence has complained. On behalf of One of these rifle clubs, which has been in existence for two or three years, and ' has not yet been provided with rifles, I suggested to tbe Minister for Defence that some of the rifles captured in South Africa might be brought here and utilized until arms of the regulation pattern could be supplied. But the Minister apparently thinks that it would cost too much even to act upon that idea. time, he is prepared for the purposes of show to spend £26,000. I wish to see the Conv monwealth properly represented at the Coronation celebrations, and I hope that the Prime Minister will proceed to Loudon for that purpose, and that a liberal allowance will be made for his expenses. I shall therefore support the second reading of the Bill, reserving to myself the right to review the items in the schedule in committee. So fatas the military representation of the Commonwealth is concerned, I do not think we could do better than despatch the Minister for Defence to London. He would make a worthy representative, and would uphold our honour and dignity, and be noticed where even a great multitude of our soldiers would be lost sight of. There is no question of loyalty, or of our being under a command from the old country to send troop3 to the celebrations involved in this matter. In view of these circumstances, I shall vote against any expenditure that would have the result of imposing unnecessary burdens upon the taxpayers. bane) -The burden of the song of many upon cheers that were heard during honourable members has been that we should the whole progress of that great pageant. be adequately represented at the great historical event that is about to take place in London, but at the same time they have cavilled at the proposals of the Government. After having nobly expressed a grand sentiment, they have immediately proceeded to whittle down the Government proposal. Every tongue has been a knife to whittle away the provisions of the Bill. If Queensland were in the same position now that she was in two years ago the Government of the State would regard the present proposal as wholly inadequate for the representation of Queensland alone.

Wasi t not Great Britain? All this magnificent continent was given to us free, gratis, and yet forsooth we are to begrudge an expenditure of £26,000 to insure the proper representa tion of the Commonwealth upon a grea' historic occasion. I believe that if this Parliament declares that the Commonwealth taxpayers cannot afford to pay 2d. per head, there are men in Australia who will gladly incur the proposed expenditure, if they ditions of modern rifle shooting must be are only given-reasonable notice.

Eveni f the Commonwealth were in such financial straits that we had to borrow this moneyand we ought to borrow it , if we have not got it-the annual amount payable by the taxpayer in this connection would represent only about one thirty-second of a penny. How many members of this House have married upon borrowed money ? How many have attended birthday and wedding celebrations upon borrowed money ?

I fully recognise that the occasion is one whicii demands from us some expenditure. The question at issue is what expenditure are we justified in incurring? I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that no representation of Australia is necessary in the procession which will take place in London. A t the same time. I am not prepared to accept the proposal of the Government as it stands. I believe that without any disadvantage to ourselves, we can reduce the expenditure which is proposed in connection with the despatch of troops by £10,000. The streets of LonWho don are narrow, and will be crowded upon Coronation day with an excited multitude, so that as long as there is a group of Australian horsemen in the procession, it will matter little whether that group contains 100 or 500 men. Therefore I regard the proposal of the leader of the Opposition as a reasonable one, and shall accordingly support it . I am entirely opposed, however, to the expenditure of £2,000 to send a rifle team to compete at Bisley. An y person who knows anything of the conwell aware that matches as carried on by first-class shots constitute an absolute parody upon the conditions of fighting in the field. These first-class shots appear on the rifle ranges with most elaborate paraphernalia, consisting of paints, paint brushes, wind gauges, &c, and to encourage that sort of thing is to my mind absurd. Ifi t is sought to establish shooting competitions which will enable our men to become proficient in the conditions of active warfare I shall be willing to give the Government every possible assistance. But so long as the present conditions prevail, the proposal of the Government to spend money in sending a rifle team to Bisley is unjustifiable: I would much prefer to see money expended-as has been suggestedin the erection of a Commonwealth arch in London. Such an arch can be made in many respects an advertisement for Australia, and 1 believe that if we can associate an advertisement of our resources with this demonstration of loyalty, we shall be justified in so. doing. The other items contained in the schedule seem to be fairly reasonable, and will accordingly command my vote. seems to me that the proposals of the Government are upon the whole exceedingly moderate. Most of the speakers to-day seem to have lost sight of the fact that we have been invited by the home authorities to send troops to the Coronation. Early in the discussion the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne made what I venture to consider one of the best speeches of the debate. He pointed out that",50,Second Reading

Surely upon such a great historic occasion, and in view of the fact that other portions of the Empire are likely to be represented by as large a body of troops as that proposed for the Commonwealth, honourable members should readily assent to the Ministerial proposition. any other item save that of the £2,000 which it is proposed to spend in sending a rifle team to Bisley. It is true that the proposal has no connection whatever with the Coronation ceremonies. The Prime Minister has explained how the item has found its way into the schedule. It appears that a promise was made that this money should be placed upon the Estimates. The Estimates, however, have not yet been submitted,and theindividuals who wish to go to Bisley desire to know whether or not this . House is prepared tovote the necessary money. Personally I am very loth to vote this .sum of £2,000, which could be very much better spent in the direction forshadowed by the honourable member for Parramatta. Prizes in the shape of shields or trophies could be offered by the Commonwealth throughout Australia for shooting under conditions as nearly as possible those of actual warfare. The present Commandant of the forces, and also Lord Roberts, have pointed out that shooting at fixed targets is by no means all that is wanted, and the suggestion which I have made would prove of great advantage. able targets at Bisley. trophy known as the Coronation Cup or King's Cup might be shot for throughout generations, and such competitions would be really useful to Australia. There may be movable targets at Bisley, but at the same 33 p time the competitions there, so far as Australians are concerned, are only for one year. How far the Government are bound by any alleged promise I of course do not know. the country 1 but it seems that people expect this money to be voted. When we get into committee I shall be prepared to vote for the Government proposals, excepting that for sending a team to Bisley. In many respects this is a very special occasion, and, speaking as one born in Australia, I feel it would be a disgrace if Australians were unworthily represented. This is a matter on which one cannot give a silent vote, because to do so may lead to an honourable member being misunderstood by the House and the country. Personally I do not wish to dwell upon I am opposed to military displays of any kind, but seeing that the Coronation is altogether a military display, I must give way to some extent, and endeavour to reach a compromise. No doubt we ought to do a great deal in order to demonstrate our loyalty and the integrity of the Empire, but we cannot forget that we have large obligations nearer home. It has been prophesied that this will be a very trying winter in Australia, and consequently we should not be rash i u our-expenditure. A fair compromise has been offered, and allegiance to the Government is the only motive which induces me to support a considerable expenditure in the direction proposed. We certainly should not like to place the Government in the invidious position of shabbily or unworthily representing the country on this occasion. We should remember that had Australia been still divided into six States, each State, one vieing with the other, would have spent a great deal more than is proposed under this Bill. still great obligations resting on us here in connection with the Commonwealth. Above all, this House has to justify federation by economy, and it would be undesirable, from that point of view, to carry out the proposals of the Government as submitted. A saving of £10,000 by a reduction of the number of troops to 100 is a considerable item. I have not much objection to the proposal to illuminate the Commonwealth buildings in the State capitals,",51,Second Reading

The proposal to send a team to Bisley has few friends, and we may regard that matter as decided. But honourable members who are prepared to give £26,000 in order to send a contingent to England, and yet cavil at the proposal for a Bisley team, seem to me to be "" straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel."" If we make any display it should be in connection with the industrial arts. As the honourable inemberfor Gippsland has well said, we are an industrial, and not a warlike, people, and we send to Englandi n order to demonstrate the fact that we intend to help the Empire in the way of supplying foodstuffs. There are other reasons why we in Australia should not send a large representation of our military to London. I am perfectly satisfied that when the people in England consider that these men have to travel 12,000 or 13,000 mile's they will regard 150 men from Australia as representative as 1,000 men from Canada. 250 men as 150. more money. s'end 250 men if that number costs more. The whole question is one of economy, and untrue. I am in favour of the compromise under which 150 men will be sent. I further ber see that in a newspaper ?

I undertake to say that the to more than sticking a tallow candle on the top of the Sydney Post-office. In all the States at the present time the Governments and the press are advocating economy. The Premiers are continually making speeches, and communicating with honourable members in this Chamber, directly or indirectly, asking that expenses may be curtailed in orderthat additional revenue may be returned to the States. It can be seen that the finances of the various States are likely to be in a bad condition in the future, and that every penny will be required to keep them straight. In the face of all this the Federal Govermnent ask us to pass this Bill, though we have no guarantee that the amount provided will cover the expenditure.

MrM c DONALD I know t h a t; but Ministers often make promises for which, in their cooler moments, they are very sorry. However, I leave the Minister to fight this matter out with the parties themselves. I am opposed to the sending of troops to London. If it is necessary to be represented, then I agree with the leader of the Opposition that it would be a good thing if the people recognised that they were adequately represented by the' presence there of the Prime .Minister. I think, however, that we should do something to let the people of England understand the commerical value of this country. If we are going to become a nation, it will, not be by taking all occasions for displaying our military powers, but by cultivating peaceful, industrial methods, and developing our magnificent resources. We want every penny we can get for that work, and there are many other ways in which we could more profitably spend our money than in sending a body of troops to London. It would be much better to establish ten or eleven scholarships of £ 1 0 0 each, available for students in various parts of the Commonwealth, and call them, if you like, the ""Coronation "" scholarships. That would provide a lasting memorial of the occasion, whereas tlie despatch of the troops will be forgotten a month after the procession has taken place. £5,000 seems to me a wholly insufficient sum for the. illumination of the Commonwealth buildings in the various State capitals, and the expenditure of such an amount will only make a farce of the whole business. ' I am therefore opposed to that proposal. In my opinion we could have done without this Bill altogether. The Government might very well have taken the responsibility, by Executive minute, of furnishing the Prime Minister with the money required to take him to England and bring him back again. Sir JOH N FORREST -That would been an illegal appropriation. have been ratified afterwards by Parliament. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) I should not rise to further protract the disdivision is to be called for on the motion for the second reading. While I feel bound to vote for tlie Bill, I entertain strong objections to some of its provisions. I think that, as a loyal part of the Empire, we must in some way take part in the celebrations connected with the Coronation of the King, and that the proposal to send home the Prime Minister to represent tlie Commonwealth is one which should be i ndorsed by everybody. The right honourable gentleman should be supplied with sufficient funds to enable him to adequately perform his mission. But with regard to the proposal to send troops to London to take part in a pageant, I think that, considering how far we are from England, we are not justified in incurring the extravagant expenditure which it will involve. I do nob know how the Treasurer can find it in his conscience to square it with utterances which he has made in regard to other matters. Such an expenditure is in no way necessary to declare the loyalty of our people to the Empire. Our loyalty has already been sufficiently demonstrated, and when occasion arises I am sure that we shall be prepared to demonstrate it again. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, has said that the pomp and circumstance of glorious war always plays a part in pageantries of the kind which we are considering; but "" different times, different manners;"" aud although some of the ancestors of His Gracious Majesty may have beeu called to the kingship by the simple act of their soldiers in raising them upon their shields, the time will come, if it has not come already, when we shall celebrate functions like these by the display, not of military troops, but of the arts of peace. Considering, moreover, that the people are everywhere agitating for retrenchment and the reduction of the hitherto excessive expenditure of the municipal, States, and Commonwealth Governments, we are not justified in spending money in the way proposed. The proposal for a compromise, however, by reducing the continhave gent from 250 to 150 or 100 men is altogether contemptible. If it is right to send any men at all, we should send enough to make a good display, but I do not think it is necessary. The proposal to spend money for illuminating",53,Second Reading

232,Mr Mcdonald,"Yes; but it couldthe Commonwealth buildings is, I think, defensible. We should have some form of public rejoicing on the occasion. I should also like to see erected in the streets of the great metropolis of the Empire a trophy or triumphal arch, which will be emblematic of Australia's progress, and will display the source of our real strength. The proposal to send a rifle team to Bisley was dead at its inception. Ifc has nothing to do with the coronation celebrations, and I do not think the House intends to give it any consideration. As I have already stated, I am not prepared to increase our military expenditure, and thus add to what I consider the great menace to Australia-wan t of economy in all directions, and the growing desire to set ourselves before the world as a military nation. Thank Cod, we have been able to hold our own in military matters, and when the time ""comes I hope we shall do so again ; but our real strength is not in our military prowess, but in our cultivation of the arts of peace.

We need not be parsimonious, that these invitations really originate -with because there can be no more parsimony in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the sending 125 men than in despatching 250. It is all a question of degree, and the Government might as well have brought down a proposal to send 500 or 1,000 men. If the Commonwealth had been established for some years, and the finances were in a flourishing condition, and it were not known that some of the State Treasurers find it difficult to make ends meet, it might have been desirable to spend even £100,000 in making an adequate display. We have, however, to face conditions as they are, and if we send home 125 men our troops will serve with those representing otber portions of the Empire to make a sufficient display. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, but I trust that there will be no necessity to go to a division, and that we shall not present even the appearance of want of unanimity upon a point upon which we are all agreed, namely, our desire to show the greatest possible respect for the Empire, and to do everything bhab is in our power bo assisb ab the great function that is about to take place, consistently, however, We ing down our expenditure.

The honourable and learned member for Brisbane told us that if we had not the money necessary to meet the expenses involved by the Government proposal we could borrow it, but I trust the Commonwealth will not start to borrow money for such purposes as this. learned member said that if we had not tlie money we might borrow it .

We could advertise the Commonwealth, if that is all that is desired to think that we should gain something in that direction.

It is proposed to despatch the troops as a compliment to the great Empire of which we form a part, aud in return for the magnificent I compliment that the Empire paid us by sending 1,000 troops to take part in the Commonwealth celebrations.

I regret that we have to incur this expenditure, but this is a case of noblesse oblige. We are not only proud of the Empire, but we desire the Empire to be proud of us; and what would be thought of us if we were to refrain from sending forth the men who are asked for ? A great deal has been said about arches, but unfortunately the terms of the invitation bind us to a particular kind of representation.

I think also that the response to the invitation sent to us should be prompt and cordial.

By adopting that course we can reduce the expenditure involved to a very considerable extent. Personally I cannot see any objection to such a proposal. Apart from that fact altogether, I think the 'present is a time above all others when we ought to insure that the Commonwealth shall be fittingly represented. It has been said that the Coronation of the King is not an every day occurrence, and as all the rest of the Empire will be represented, I therefore ask them not to reduce the it would seem an ungracious and ill conditioned state of things if Australia did not desire to be similarly represented.

Concerning the despatch of a rifle team to Bisley, I may say at once that I fully appreciate that it would be a waste of time to attempt to proceed with that vote. I shall' therefore allow the item to be negatived. Regarding the proposal of the Government to send troops to the Coronation, I think that a majority of honourable members will be with me in saying that we may fairly ask for a vote of at least £16,000 iu this connection. I .shall ask for that vote, and shall amend our original proposal accordingly. I shall also take into consideration the suggestion which has been made to strengthen the contingent by available soldiers of the Commonwealth in London. I should like, however, to say i u regard to that matter, that there is some danger of an invidious distinction being made, because if there are any who deserve to be rewarded for their services to the Empire, it is those who have been maimed and injured, and are therefore least fit for service.

Prime Minister submits that amendment, I desire to move That the words "" Contingent of Commonwealth mounted troops "" be omitted. My object is to provide that no military contingent be sent to the Coronation. To send troops will encourage a spirit of militarism, not only here, but in the old country. A t the first Jubilee of Her late Majesty, and also at the Diamond Jubilee, we sent military forces and representatives of no other class to England. Before we take such a step we should see that our present military forces are fairly paid. There is no doubt that in addition to the effort to increase the spirit of militarism; there is, as a natural consequence, a desire to increase the spirit of Imperialism ; and I object that the only class, which goes from Australia to the Coronation should be the military. Those who were present at the Jubilee celebrations will remember that the colonial troops did not occupy a prominent, or even respectable, place in the procession. paper reports, and from others who were present, we learn that the procession of the Australian troops was divided from the principal procession, and occupied altogether a subordinate place. Sir troops occupied a leading place. occupied, they were not in the same part of the procession as the Queen was.

Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) I support the amendment of the honourable member for Corio, though I do not endorse or sympathize with all his reasons. In my opinion there is no necessity for this military display, and the Government proposal is much more objectionable on the smaller than on the larger scale. If we have to send troops let us do the thing well; but as I believe there is no reason for any display of the kind, I shall vote for the amendment. In this and in other matters we are apt to be carried away by what is being done by New Zealand, but if New Zealand chooses to take what I consider to be a foolish line of action, there is no need for the' Commonwealth to follow suit. We do not want to vie with New Zealand extravagance; and the proposed military display is not necessary to adequately express the loyalty of the people of the Commonwealth. The Government proposal involves an unwarrantable expense which we are not justified in incurring at this early stage of the history of the.Commonwealth. ment have shown themselves so thoroughly impressed with the views which I and others have put forward that we ought not to haggle over the question of whether the expenditure shall be £16,000 or £13,000. I am quite prepared to accept the figure mentioned by the Prime Minister, with a view to prevent unnecessary discussion. .Personally, I should have preferred a smaller number of men, but when the the least I can do is to accept their offer.

If we are to be represented at all, I do not think we could be more suitably represented than by men who have fought in South Africa, and who, in consequence of their wounds have been sent convalescent to England. I thoroughly agree with tlie honourable member for North Sydney that the effect of the display will not be detracted from because of an empty sleeve or two in the procession. However, as the Prime Minister has come so far to meet our views, it would be ungenerous to cavil about £2,000 or £3,000. I desire, however, to take strong exception to an expression that I was surprised to hear fall from the Minister for Defence, who is the last man in the HouseI should have thought would accuse members of a cowardly act. Sir thing of the sort. Mr A. M.CLEAN -The Minister for Defence said that he did not believe that those who took exception to the Government proposals on the ground of economy were sincere, but expressed the opinion that they ivere actuated by some political motive. As I was one of the first members to take exception to the amount of this vote, I can tell the Minister for Defence that I am just as independent in expressing my views as any other honourable member of the House. I came into this House absolutely unpledged to any Government. Sir JOH N PORREST -The honourable member is too thin-skinned. MrA . McLEAN -When I have occasion to take exception to any act of the honourable gentleman he will find that I shall tell him so as straightly as I can find language to convey my meaning. I shall not dissemble my real intentions under any subterfuge of the kind that the honourable gentleman hinted at. I have nothing to add in regard to the Bill. I congratulate the Prime Minister on the graceful manner in which he has met the views of honourable members ; and seeing that the proposal for a Bisley team will be abandoned, I think that the other items might now be passed in a few minutes. When the Bill was discussed in the House it was suggested that the troops might be augmented in London, and expense thus saved. When that suggestion was made. I dissented from it. If men who are in London are asked to join the procession, they should be paid, just as those who are sent from Australia will be paid. I should like to know from the Prime Minister if he proposes that they shall receive remuneration for their services. ber must confine his remarks to the amendment before the chair. for the second reading of the Bill, although I consider that, on the whole, Australia will be adequately represented in Londou by the presence there of the Prime Minister, and I was at first inclined to vote against the sending of troops; not that I am afraid that these manifestations of our military power are likely to create a spirit of militarism among our population, but JOHN EORRKST I never did anybecause I object to excessive display. In my opinion, the simpler the ceremonial the better, and I always associate splendacious ostentation with vulgarity. I understand, however, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has requested that troops be sent, and to refuse such a request would be to administer to that gentleman something in the nature of a snub. I shall, therefore, vote for the proposal of the leader of the Opposition, although a display of official rubrics is opposed to my own tastes. There was a time when the exhibition of the trappings of office was thought necessary, and it was sought to impress the public by -an appeal to the eye rather than to the reason; but in the beginning of the 20th",58,Edward Braddon Th E Colonial Government Come So Near To My Suggestion

I did so because, if the Bil l were not passed, there would be no proper authority for the vote proposed to be granted to cover the Prime Minister's expenses, and I consider that it is necessary that he should go to London to represent us. But I do not approve of other provisions in the Bill, and while the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition may have come to a compromise in regard to the proposed despatch of a contingent, I and a number of others are prepared, when the opportunity presents itself, to vote against that proposal in its entirety. I do not wish to again go into the reasons which actuate me, further than to say that I believe that the Commonwealth will be adequately represented by the Prime Minister, and that I do not think the military displaj is necessary. the sum proposed for the contingent will be member for Bland, I admit freely that it is . sufficient.

If it troops at the celebrations. had been a foreign nation which had sent value of our troops in the procession, I 33 o the House would have refused to allow our majority would have agreed to the proposal. I only trust that the amount provided in the Bill will be sufficient. W it h regard to the sum proposed to meet the expenses of the Prime Minister, I think it is altogether too small, and that he will not be able to point out that as we do not aim at building up a nation of swashbucklers, and are a producing, not a military people, our part of the celebrations should be a demonstration to the people of the old world of thenatural riches we possess in our mineral, agricultural, and pastoral resources. Thesuggestion has been made that we should, construct an arch, or something of that kind in London, and I should like to see-that done in substitution for the proposed military representation. I am glad that. the Government have agreed to reduce the numbers of the proposed contingent, and I hope that they will now see their way, instead of sending men to-Australia, to take advantage of those who are serving in South Africa, and thus obtain a worthy representation at a minimum of cost.

Every citizen of the Commonwealth has to contribute his share, and it . is not fair that the city people only shall be able to enjoy the illuminations. The country people certainly ought to get their share. The money should be distributed, so as to illuminate every public building in the Commonwealth every post-office, every telegraph-office, and every Customs-house. ber move to increase the amount of the vote to £50,000? take to distribute the money as fairly as possible. Why should not the pioneers of the back-blocks have a share of the expenditure? For these reasons, I move That the words "" in the State capitals"" be omitted. I support the item as it stands. It is due to us to make some recognition of this important event, and one of the best means of doing so is by illuminations. That will give the greatest amount of enjoyment to the greatest number of people. honourable member for Wide Bay deprecates the expenditure of the money in i l luminating the capital cities. agree with him that if it were possible to expend the money throughout the Commonwealth . in illuminating the post-offices and other public buildings it would be a splendid thing to do, but even then there would be people living in the far-away localities who would not see the illuminations. To make them thorough it would be necessary to illuminate every gum tree in every province ! It is a per 1 fecfcly fair thing to illuminate only the places where the greatest number of people can enjoy the sight. I do not think that the Government are putting down too much money for this purpose, and I rather agree with the Prime Minister that it will be found somewhat difficult to do the work for the amount providedlieve that this item is the most moderate one in the schedule, and I am satisfied that ifc will give a great amount of enjoyment to thousands of people. The honourable member for Wide Bay takes the view that every was surprised to hear the Prime Custom-house and post-office in the Commonwealth should have spent upon it a share of the money voted for illumination. His principle seems to be "" every Custom-house officer his own lighthouse!"" Upon the same principle we may regret; that the Coronation itself takes place only at AVestminster. Some one might suggest that His Majesty should be crowned at every port of England, and that the ceremony should take place throughout AVales, Scotland, and Ireland, being afterwards extended to Australia and other parts of the Empire. A t the time of the Jubilee the illuminations were enjoyed by tens of thousands of people. They were not only much appreciated, but made a deep impression on the minds of the children who witnessed them. I suggest that we might save some amount of money by adjourning now, and the electricity used in illuminating this House which would be saved might be devoted to further illuminating the capital cities at the Coronation. I take the opportunity of saying that I thoroughly agree with the Prime Minister that money spent in these illuminations is not wasted. Large busiThe ness firms in the principal cities already have appliances for illuminating their warehouses and shops. In all probaI quite bility there will be general illuminations, and the people of the Commonwealth will expect the Government to illuminate its buildings. Tn all probability the States will follow suifc. It must be remembered that a large amount of the money thus expended will be recouped by the extra amount of travelling done-a t all events in those States where the trams are owned by the Government.

The festivities are arranged to last for a week after the Coronation, and it is further expected that there will be a stay of another two weeks in London, having regard to the number of important subjects to be dealt with in conference. Since the despatches arrived, other subjects have been suggested by the Premier of Canada and the Premier of New Zealand, and 1 also am offering suggestions of subjects for discussion. That does not mean that I can bind Parliament to any important stop of policy, because, so far as responsibility is concerned, no conclusions can be arrived at without being subject to the approval of Parliament before they acquire validity. I rather imagine it would be difficult to include all these subjects in the conference in London within the time mentioned, but as I am thinking of returning by way of Canada, it might be possible to remain there a few days longer, with a view to consulting, if necessary, with the Premier of the Dominion, and possibly the Premier of New Zealand. I mention these facts in order to show how the time may be occupied, and in order that it may not be said that any information has been withheld. Schedule agreed to.

I am forwarding a letter to the Postmaster-General so that we may get an answer. learned member for Werriwa asked me a question as to suing the Commonwealth, and I have to say that there is a doubt as to whether the Commonwealth can be sued under existing legislation. One of the reasons why the Attorney General is so very anxious that the Judiciary Bil l and the High Court Procedure Bill should be gone on with, is in order that the Commonwealth may not be supposed to be placing any obstacles in the way of those who are seeking the establishment of any right or supposed right.
