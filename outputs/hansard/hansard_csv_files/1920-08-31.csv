1,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson),"whether the attention of the Government has been drawn to n statement made by Mr J. Entwistle at a recent meeting of the South AustralianGas Company. He is reported to have said thatThey had heard a lot about supporting Australian industries, but he had been informed the other dav that a certain well-known South Australian business institution, which controlled one of the big collieries in New South Wales, had practically sold the whole oi their output to Japan, ana that the shipment was so immense that the smoke of one steamer was not lost sight of by the second, and so nn. Is the Government aware of the circumstances referred to, and, if so, what action, if any, does it intend to take to conserve coal for the industries of Australia, which during recent months have been lacking supplies? of the facts stated; one usually has to go outside for statements of this kind. I do not pay much credence to the report. We are doing the best we can in the circumstances, and 30,000 tons of coal is on its way to Victoria. I hope that what is now happening will not be interrupted, because if the present supply continues the coal situation will soon be eased very materially. preference'is given to Inter-State loading? of his appointment is to see that overseas trade does liot unduly interfere with trade between the States. ment take the earliest opportunity to give us definite information as to when we may hopo for the settlement of the earlier Wheat Pools, and as to the arrangements that are being made in regard to this sea sou's wheat?

The Treasurer and I have seen the bodies of members carried from this building, and I believe that the long sittings of the past are thereason why so many men in parliamentary life have broken down. A member who takes his work seriously, as every member should, and attends conscientiously to his parliamentary duties, has to remain here for many hours at a stretch, and if we are required to come early on Thursdays, breakdowns will be more frequent in the. future than they have been in the past.

The control of the Commonwealth is now limited to firms and private and proprietary companies the membership of which does not consist wholly of natural-born British subjects; to foreign companies and firms; and to companies and firms partly or wholly formed with foreign capital or whose operations are to be carried on outside Australia. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE 19th August the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) asked me1. Whether the lad, Clement George Huckell, who was sentenced to fourteen days' imprisonment on one charge, and seven days on another charge, for breaches of the compulsory military service sections of the Defence Act, on 20th March, 1!)20, and who was released from military custody upon serving fourteen days, was released upon instructions from the Minister or some subordinate official? 2. Is it a fact that this lad was re-arrested "" orders "" in the section I now move the on the 13th instant, and conveyed to Fort Largs, South Australia? 3. Had the lad been called upon to return to his'former custody in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation :Cadet Clement George Huckell was sentenced to two terms of detention, viz., fourteen days and seven days respectively, for breaches of discipline, the sentences to be cumulative. Tlie ter has given us no reason why this new first term was served forthwith, and expired on 8th April, 1920. Instead of serving the adclause is proposed, and I am afraid it ditional term immediately, Huckell was not called upon until 13th August -throug h misinterpretation by the Area Officer of departmental instructions governing such cases-to undergo the further detention of seven days. This detention expired on 18th August, 1920. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 27th August, vide page 3957): Clause 10, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 11 to 13 agreed to. move That the following new clause be added:3A. SectionS of the principal Act is amended(o) by inserting after the word ""orders"" the words "" encourages, advises or incites""; and (6) by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (2.) For the purposes of this section an organization shall be deemed to have ordered, encouraged, advised or incited its members to refuse to offer or accept employment, if (a) the Committee of Management of the organization has ordered, encouraged, advised or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment; or (6) an officer or officers of the Committee of Management has or have ordered, encouraged, advised or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment, unless the Court before which the proceedings On the are brought is satisfied that the Committee of Management was not cognisant of the matter"" Section8 of the Act is as follows: Any organization of employers or employees which, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the demands of any employers or employees, orders its members to refuse, to offer or accept employment, shall be deemed to lie guilty of a lockout or strike, as the case may be. . It will be seen that to the word addition of the words "" encourages, advises, or incites."" This seems to be rather a far-reaching amendment as to the effect of which I am not quite sure. The section in the Act makes ample provision for dealing with organizations which are deemed to have committed an offence of the k in d ; and, altogether, the amendment appears to me rather an objectionable one. The Minismight lead to a good deal of trouble. It is quite possible, in connection with an industrial upheaval, or some anticipated trouble,' that an officer may make certain remarks which do not represent the views of the organization with which he is connected, and, under the clause, the organization will be held responsible. It often happens in industrial troubles that a representative of the men takes a certain view, and places it before the members, but it does not follow that the members agree with it or accept his advice.",22,Statement S By Company Promoters

27,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.21],"The members of the association may hold quite a different view, and, under the circumstances, they ought not to be regarded as having committed a contravention of the Act. The section in the Act at present is sufficiently effective, and has hitherto worked satisfactorily; but now, for some reasons of which we have not been told, we are asked to make it more drastic. The Minister ought at least to show the grounds on which he proposes^ to make the change. This is a clause which may not prove acceptable to the bodies outside concerned in industrial arbitration , and no' one can say what it may lead to. We are not told whether the suggestion for such a clause emanates from the Department or from some indust r i a l bodies, and evidently it was an afterjust as much responsible for creating in thought, for it was drawn up after the B ill had been drafted. poses to make the law unmistakable. now. law. and in extending it makes it more drason the organization. t i c ; indeed, it is a. sort of drag-net, which made for the appointment of officers.

It goes a long way further than was in tended when we adopted the principle of arbitration. The Act at present only refers to the offence which an organization commits if it orders its members to do a certain thing. very little stress on the additional words he is proposing to insert, viz., ""encourages, advises, or incites."" There is a vast difference between ordering a man to refrain from work and encouraging, advising, or inciting him to do so. officer of an organization may give utterance to certain views which are not in dorsed by the committee of the organization, but the organization is to be held liable. Mr G-EOOM -Unless the Committee of might be another Mount Kembla disaster. Management was not cognisant of what I am reminded by the honourable member the officer was doing. that occurs to me. Honourable members of the mine to the face at which men are will remember that during the trouble in working, and in the event of an explosion 1917, when the mines were held up heof gas there is little hope that the men cause there were no engines running to convey the coal to port, it was claimed that the miners had taken sides in connection with the dispute. I take the case of what occurred at the Richmond Main colliery, in which 200 or 300 men from the State of Victoria were employed. If when the difficulty was overcome, and the men who were out were asked to.go back to their places in the mine, although the Richmond Main mine was only one colliery connected w""th the industry, an officer of an association of miners had said to the men that he did not think it would be advisable for them to go back to the mine to work with the men who had been introduced from Victoria, the organization would be held responsible under the proposed amendment. I say as a practical man that it would not ibe advisable for the men to go back to the mine to work with other men who had not been accustomed to work in gaseous mines, and thus take the risk of losing their lives because of the employment in the mine of inexperienced labour. When there is a strike on we are often carried away by our feelings, and these things are not reasoned out as they should be. If any prominent officer of a miners' organization took up the attitude which I have suggested as justifiable, and said that in the circumstances he thought members of the organization, if they desired to protect tiheir lives, I should not go back to the mine to work with inexperienced men, the organization, under the new clause proposed by the Minister, might be charged with encouraging or inciting the men to do certain things. The Minister laid Management would not be liable on those facts, because the officer to whom thei honourable member refers would be acting on his own. mittee of Management of the organization An took up the same attitude.

(2.) No legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk, shall be allowed to appear before the Court, be heard, or attend the Court, in any hearing or determination of an industrial dispute.'"" I hope that my amendment will meet with a better reception than that accorded the amendment with which we have just dealt. In order that my position may not be misunderstood by my legal friends, let me say that, .as a 'member of the State Parliament of South Australia, I availed myself of every opportunity to move to exclude members of the legal profession from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I recognise that in my proposed new clause I am making a most serious attack upon the strongest and most powerful trade union in the world. If it were carried, and resulted in a number of legal gentlemen being thrown out of work, I should be glad to assist the Government in establishing a bureau to find work for unemployed solicitors. I do not anticipate, however, that the exclusion of the legal profession from the Court would have that effect. We may trust the lawyers to look after themselves, and always to be able to earn a crust. I submit this amendment, in the first place, because I believe it essential to divest the Arbitration Court of any suggestion of the legal element. If I had my own way, even the President of the Court would not be a legal gentleman. convinces me that the heavy expenses involved in approaching the Court constitute one of the gravest causes of dissatisfaction with the Court on the part of a great many of our trade unionists. Trade unions have made repeated efforts to reap the benefit of our industrial legislation. I remember one case in South Australia where the employees of the Tramway Trust attempted to register under the Act. peared in the case: the application for registration was refused, and the association had to pay over £400 in respect of legal and other expenses. That is the sort of thing that creates among trade organizations a distrust of industrial legislation. Trade unionists are advised that the cheapest and most common-sense way of settling a dispute is to appeal to the Court. If they take that advice, with the result, which so often happens, that not only the accumulated funds of their organization are eaten up, but a special levy is made to provide for legal and other expenses, a sense of injustice is created, and an absolute distrust of industrial arbitration follows. In this way, their minds are prepared for the suggestion, which might 'be put to them very logically, that a lightning strike would at least cost no more than would an appeal to the Court, and that it might give them a better chance of securing a speedy verdict. Trade unions in South Australia are making levies every week to meet the legal expenses associated with an application to the Court, which involved the settlement of a question of interest to quite a number of unions. With all due respect to my legal friends, I find that lawyers appearing in the Court cannot refrain from putting before it the purely legal aspect of a dispute. tion means anything, it means the coming together of the parties directly concerned, -and the stating of their case by themselves, so that a settlement may be secured without reference to the dry and musty records of decisions given perhaps before we were born. In my experience I have known an Arbitration Court case argued for four or five daysj and for this, I contend, there is no need; the simpler, My experience easier and cheaper we make the admin.istration of our arbitration laws the better for all concerned. I know that the Minister will say that section 27 of the Act really meets the position, because it leaves the appearance of legal gentlemen to the 'decision of the parties concerned. That section provides that on the hearing and determination of any industrial dispute an organization may be represented by a member or officer, and any party A number of legal gentlemen apnot being an organization may be represented by an employer, but no party shall except by the consent of all parties",30,Pairs

85,Mr Blundell,"No. If arbitrabe represented by counsel, solicitor or paid agent. There was a slight amendment made in that section in 1910, but it does not materially affect the principle laid down. Doubtless the Minister will contend that my proposal is unnecessary, because the matter is in the hands of the parties, but, despite that section, legal gentlemen do appear. Western Australia is tlie only place I know of where, under the conciliation and arbitration laws, legal representatives are absolutely excluded. the Commonwealth Court except with the consent of all concerned. still, the legal men get there; members of the legal profession have a happy knack of getting to any place where there are fees to be earned. I am not so much concerned about the employers, who are very well able to look after themselves, but the employment of legal practitioners involves the workers iu considerable expense. Men whose wages are not too high are called upon to find the means of protecting their interests, and to pay special levies for the purpose of meeting legal expenses. It is true that no legal men can appear if any of the parties object, but the circumstances are such that tbe men are given the idea that they get a better "" d e a l "" if they are employed. Even under the section of the Act the employers cannot be prevented from having the advice and assistance of legal gentlemen. In cases in which it is decided there shall be no legal men, it is true that no lawyer stands up and pleads openly, but a lawyer may sit immediately behind the representative of the employers, and every action and question in a particular case I remember was but an echo of the legal mind. That was in a case in which I was directly interested, and in which, in my simplicity, I thought the parties alone would fight the matter out. That sort of thing creates amongst the unionists a feeling of unrest, and they determine, in many cases, to have a lawyer, involving, as I say, considerable expense. In my opinion the wisest thing to do would be to insert a clause which would not allow the Judge to sit in any place that even looked like a Court. The moment the parties get into a place with -a legal atmosphere a feeling of antagonism is raised between the parties, whereas a gathering, consisting entirely of laymen directly interested, would prove a cheaper and better method of settlement. I have made it very clear in the clause I propose that no legal representative shall be allowed to sit behind the chair of the representative of either employer or employee. I tell honourable members quite frankly that the clause aims at the exclusion from the Court of all legal practitioners while, a case is on, for, otherwise, the lawyers cannot be prevented from giving their advice and assistance, with the effects I have indicated. That particular portion of my amendment is copied from Western Australian legislation, and represents a step towards the T h a t is true, but, ideal of a gathering of laymen directly the interested. I look to the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to vote with me on this occasion, because, on looking up the records, I find that when, that gentleman was a member of the"" New South ""Wales Parliament, and an Arbitration B ill was before the House, he moved to the effect that no person connected with the legal profession should be allowed to be even tlie Judgei n an Arbitration Court. That, of course, goes a good deal further than I propose; but I think I can look for the honourable gentleman's support. There is another phase which I might incidentally mention, and of which I ask the Minister to take note. A few days ago representatives of a particular calling were summoned by the Courtf r o m all over Australia to appear at the hearing of a case. In South Australia the union concerned was put to an expense of over £20 in order to send the secretary and representatives, and the employers also had to find a good deal of money to cover their expenses. The Committee w ill agree that it is a scandal that all these representatives and witnesses should be called together from all parts of the country, and, in ten minutes, told that they could go home again. I do not blame the legal profession for what took place on that occasion, and merely mention it incidentally, with a hope that the Minister will see that such a thing does not occur again. The clause I propose w ill result in great saving to the employees, and eventually be the means of making both parties recognise that it is better for them to settle their own disputes without the intervention of the legal profession.",31,Pairs

If all parties desire to be represented by the legal profession, why should they not have the right to be so represented ? The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell) proposes that the parties shall be deprived of legal assistance, even if they wish to have it . that industrialists are not compos mentis -that they "" do not know their job."" their j o b "" pretty well. point is that, while it is proposed to exclude lawyers, a number of men are permitted to appear who are just as keen as any lawyer in raising objections and prolonging cases by calling witnesses. not say that these men cause delays wilfully, but they have not the same knowledge or appreciation of the relevancy of evidence that legal practitioners have. Giving my own individual opinion, I think it was a mistake to prevent the Court from having the advantage of the assistance of counsel if desired. Lawyers, by their training and experience, have a knowledge of what is relevant and what is not relevant, and their employment would shorten tbe proceedings, more clearly define the questions to be decided, and, on the whole, make the administration much better. Parliament has taken a contrary view, and it is not now proposed to reverse it . In the interests of the parties concerned, however, I ask the Committee to retain the provision that by the consent of all parties counsel may appear. In cases where employers or employees are not trained advocates, and are devoid of experience, why should they not have assistance? always the requisite ability to put cases clearly and concisely, and it would be monstrous to prevent an employer or any organization which felt itself deficient in this regard from obtaining the best assistance possible. To prevent them from employing legal representatives places such organizations at a disadvantage, and, even now, they cannot have them unless all parties consent. The honourable member for Adelaide The first part of the proposed employment of lawyers, but if he analyzes the balance-sheets he w ill find that all the money is not spent in that direction, but is mostly required for the payment of witnesses, and of persons moving about to obtain evidence. The honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned a few days ago a heavy legal b ill, the bulk of which, I understand, was represented by witnesses' fees. Even the costs of an ordinary common law action often consist mostly of Court fees, and witHe takes the view nesses' fees; the remuneration for the profession often is relatively small. It would be very unjust to pass the amendment, I think they ""know and to prevent either party from getting, The peculiar with mutual consent, the legal assistance it desires. I support the amendment, and am prepared to go very much farther in advocatI do ing simplicity oflanguage in Acts of Parliament, particularly in industrial legislation. The language of industrial legislation should be such as to be readily understood by any layman, and, if possible, I would have a lay Court from which the legal fraternit y were excluded entirely.

We have arrived at a stage when we can say good-bye to a lawyer at his office, and enter the Court without him. The Committee should grasp the opportunity of introducing the reform which the amendment suggests. The majority of honourable members do not belong to the legal profession, and for that reason they bring to bear on the business -of the House a greater amount of common sense. first sight, I was inclined to support the amendment, so that lawyers should be excluded from the Courts entirely, but I find that' the section provides that neither party shall be represented by counsel, except with the consent of the other party. To such a provision, what exception can be taken ? Surely the parties know their own business better than we do. We provide a Court, and say that the lawyer shall not enter it unless both parties are agreeable. Surely that is all we need do. If the employees desire the assistance of a lawyer, and the employers are agreeable to the appearance of counsel, the matter is one entirely for them to decide. It would be unjust for us to interfere. Therefore I must vote against the amendment. have much pleasure in supporting the amendment, for it is in conformity with my policy for the last twenty years. In my action against Sir Malcolm McEaeharn, I had one experience of receiving legal advice that should not have been followed. Owing to legal technicalities, the Court officials would not accept my money, and I arranged with my solicitor that I would tender the money personally, if need be, planking it down on the counter and telling the official to go to Hades. Just as Gronluiid, in his Co-operative Commonwealth, referred to Switzerland as an example ' of the efficacy of the referendum, initiative and recall, so he referred to Denmark for an illustration of simplicity in law. Unionists will lose nothing Many years ago, when Mr Justice Higgins, as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, secured the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the simplification of the law, I . introduced toi him a Danish gentleman, who gave valuable evidence as to the procedure in Denmark. Briefly, it is this: If citizen A wishes to sue citizen B, he cannot do it directly, as is allowed under the laws of most other countries. He must first appear before a magistrate, a pacificator, who is sworn to make peace between citizen and citizen. The parties may meet before him at a table, and smoke and chat. CitizenA may claim £20 from citizen B ; the latter says he owes only £15. The pacificator says he thinks B is in the right, and advises A to accept the offer of £15. If A refuses, he pays about Is. 3d. for a process of law, and he and B appear before the pacificator in his magisterial capacity. The parties may call witnesses, but no lawyers ""may appear in the court. The magistrate writes down his decision, and the reason upon which it is based; obviously, it generally follows the suggestion he made at the informal conference. If the unsuccessful litigant is still dissatisfied, he carries the case to a higher court, in which both parties can be represented by counsel. But no fresh evidence can be adduced, and the lawyer can only argue on the written decision of the magistrate. In my opinion, and that of Gronlund, Che legal system of Denmark is the simplest in the world. I have in my possession a documentwhich to me is worth more than its weight in diamonds. A Mr Christisen, who had been a police official in Australia for some years, and whose father had been the greatest medal maker in the world, succeeded to his father's estate, and went to Denmark to wind it up. Against his own inclination, he was persuaded by his solicitor to go to law.

Mr Christisen explained to me that as the High Court had held the advice of the solicitors to be wrong, they, as honourable men, had decided to pay the costs. When I tell honourable members that the writer of that letter three years later became Attorney-General of Denmark, they will recognise that he was a light in his profession. WhilstI loathe and detest the legal profession, there are many men amongst it whom I love and esteem, and I often find that my friendly feelings towards them are in conflict with my conscience. with one of the few religious men whom I call friends, and, using a concordance to the Bible, he convinced me that all I might say of lawyers would be mild in comparison with what the good Old Book says of them. If any honourable member who desires material with which to slate the legal profession, I refer him to the Bible'. The legal profession has too much power. If I were only one of two of the same mind, I should vote for the amendment. Two Judges of the Supreme Court and another Judge have said that the lawshould be altered to enable that unfortunate man, the Reverend Mr Ronald, to secure justice; and we cannot get it done, in spite of the fact that, in Mr industrialists in this country to seek legal Ronald's case, every witness .for the plaintiff, with the exception of Sir George Fuller, who is now a member of the New South Wales Parliament, was sentenced for perjury and conspiracy. How can any one respect the law when such things as that can occur? One cannot blame the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) for standing up for his crowd; but I may mention that the great Sumner, one of the greatest jurists that America ever produced, said that for the betrayal of a cause or a country you have not far to go; you can find one ready-made in any lawyer you meet. If the Committee will not agree to the amendment, I hope still to live to have an opportunity of voting for a similar amendment on a later occasion. the proposal of the honourable member for Adelaide were directed to reducing in some way the emoluments or earnings of the members of the legal profession who are interested in industrial work, and if it were likely to have that effect, I should have contented myself by taking no part in tbe discussion, and enjoying a pleasant half-hour in the club-room while it was in progress. But there is an aspect of the amendment which moves me to say something, and to make quite clear why I am opposed to it. It has already been pointed out that, as the result of some amendments of the Arbitration Act, it is no longer possible for a party to arbitration proceedings to be represented by a legal practitioner unless all parties to those proceedings consent. It is not enough that an organization may desire I was speaking recently to be represented in the Court by a legal representative, because the opposing parties may veto that desire by declaring that they do not consent. An organization of employers or an organization of employees might desire to exercise what, in other Courts, would be the right to be represented by counsel, but they may be prevented by this very drastic provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act from being so represented in the Arbitration Court, which' requires the consent of all parties to proceedings before counsel may appear in the Court. The honourable member for Adelaide finds that, spite of this very strict legal enactment, there is an extraordinary and incorrigible tendency on the part of some advice and assistance. member asks me why. Surely it must be for the pleasure of paying the lawyers, or the joy they derive from association with them. It cannot be, one may suppose, that as sane men exercising their free will, they desire to avail themselves of the expert knowledge of experienced men in presenting their evidence or their case. the unionists know that sitting behind the employer is a trained lawyer, advising him, even though he does not appear in Court, and, as a consequence, both side3 are represented by lawyers? reason, to some extent.

He proposes thatNo legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk Honourable members will mark thatshall he allowed to appear before the Court or to attend the Court in any hearing or determination' of an industrial dispute. 1 venture to say, with great respect, that a more ridiculous proposition was never submitted to a sane Parliament, if the proposed amendment be clearly understood in all its bearings. If it is to be logical, and certainly if it is to have any effect in the direction the honourable member expects, his amendment should go much further, and I would suggest to some extent how much further it should go. It should readNo legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk shall be allowed to appear before the Court, to be heard, to attend the Court, or to be seen anywhere within the hearing of the Court, or in the right-of-way leading to ov in proximity to the Court, or in the neighbouring hostelry within the hours that the same is open for the sale of liquor; and no industrialist shall be found in suspicious conversation with a legally qualified legal pracmember for his wise legislation preventtitioner or his clerk or his typist, male or feing them from exercising their own dismale, either in his office or elsewhere wheresoever.

Bamford) -I s the honourable member proposing a new clause? merely suggesting that in' order that the amendment should be effective for the purpose desired by the honourable member who has moved it, it should be drafted upon lines similar to those I have indicated. If the honourable member reflects for a moment ou the effect of his amendment, I cannot understand him seriously pressing it in its present form. If the industrialists, the workers, are so intent upon seeking legal advice in connection with the presentation and"" argument of their cases that the honourable member thinks, it necessary to exercise coercion upon them to the exent of preventing any one suspected' of legal knowledge going into a Court where an ordinary member of the public may go, I do not agree with him. I am specially addressing myself to the coercion of industrialists involved in the amendment. It would appear that the honourable member regards the workers of this country as so many fools, who canvice of a legal practitioner if they have any case to present to a Court. If that be so, the honourable member must go further and prevent, under penalties, those men going to the offices or places at which they would be likely to get advice from legal practitioners. If the prohibition is to operate, it must be carried out in its entirety; otherwise it will be utterly ineffectual. ' Considering the amendment professionally or personally, I have not the very faintest interest in it or anxiety that it will affect lawyers in the slightest degree. I am not worrying about that. If I seriously thought that it could have an effect of that kind, I would not have addressed myself to it at all, lest it might be suggested that I am in some way personally interested in the matter, which I am not in the veryleast. ""What makes me speak about it-and I think I ought to speak-is that it is an absolute affront to the intelligence of the men who come to the Arbitration Court to suggest that they are dependent on the honourable member for Adelaide or any other honourable cretion as to whom they will consult and when they will consult him in matters of this kind. member need not interject.

It is for that very obvious and natural reason that the law excluding the legal profession from the Arbitration Court has been largely ineffectual. For that reason, as the honourable member himself indicates, it happens that it will very often be found that a solicitor or solicitor's clerk is, at the earnest request and solicitation of the secretary of a union or the man acting for a union, seated behind him in Court helping him with his case. Nothing that the honourable member can do short of the absolute penalties such as those I have mentioned will prevent men from availing themselves of the advice and assistance of legal practitioners. I ' do not desire to go into the value of industrial work to the ordinary practitioner, or to the extent to which it is onerous, exacting, and sometimes unpleasant, because I do not want to be placed in the position'of appearing to defend my own profession in this matter. I am opposed to the amendment because of its inherent absurdity and injustice, not to tbe legal profession, .but to the unionists, and because it seeks to correct the judgment of men who are just as well able to think for themselves as is the'honourable member for Adelaide. dices that exist against the profession, and which arise very often from the fact that long, intricate and expensive arguments sometimes take place in Court as to the meaning of terms incautiously drawn by laymen who say what they mean and afterwards employ lawyers to find out what they mean, and as to the interpretation of Acts of Parliament, which we in our wisdom, and sometimes in our comparative lack of wisdom, may pass. That position is not affected by the particular proposal of the honourable member for Adelaide. I am opposed to it because it prevents men from exercising discretion and free and independent judgment without coercion. It seeks to* deprive them in a purely futile way of their right to decide for themselves as to what advice or assistance they shall have, expert or inexpert, or whether they will have any at all. The law went far enoughI am not prepared to express an opinion as to whether it is wise or not' -whe n it provided that industrialists shall not be at a disadvantage when appearing before a Judge by reason of the fact that the employers with their greater reserves have the assistance of counsel. But the honourable member for Adelaide goes further when he says that a legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or a solicitor's clerk, shall not be allowed to appear before the Court, or be seen in the Court. The honourable member for Adelaide is reducing the proposal to an absurdity, and suggesting that intelligent men who take their case to the Court are so many dupes and fools because they sometimes seek the advice and assistance of expert men in connection with tbe presentation of their case and the effect and method of collation of evidence. I oppose the proposed new clause, even at the risk of appearing selfinterested, which I am not. quite realize that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is not opposing the proposed new clause merely because he is a member of the legal profession. The honourable member is in error in. saying that the amendment has been brought forward without an expression of opinion from trade unionists, because I have moved the amendment at I know the prejuthe request of the trade unionists. If the amendment is absurd and foolish, as the honourable member suggests, then those who have requested me to have it inserted must be foolish and absurd. This"" absurd"" clause is a copy of the legislation which was passed in ""Western Australia by the Labour party when in office, and my amendment has not been moved merely because a request has been made 'by trade unionists, because if the honourable member peruses the policy of the South Australian Labour party he will find that that party favours the absolute exclusion of legal practitioners from the",36,Pairs

Under the electoral code it is clearly and' distinctly provided that no legal practitioner shall appear in an appeal case without the consent of both parties. In the case to which I have referred, I was an interested party and objected to the appearance of legal practitioners, particularly in the preliminary hearing. In the appeal, which was heard before Mr Justice Barton, four persons were involved, and when we met iu the Judge's chambers I was surprised to find that the three gentlemen I was petitioning against walked in with solicitors to assist them. I raised the point have involved. In the Bootmakers' and as to whether counsel could appear, at least at the preliminary proceedings, and I was informed that they could not. Although counsel did not actually conduct the case of these men, it was noticed throughout the proceedings that not one of them attempted to speak without consulting counsel.

I know why organizations ' engage legal assistance, and if honourable members had sat in the Court as I have in connection with industrial cases, they would understand the position. The employers' representative sits at the table with a leading solicitor behind him, and it is felt that the employees' representative might just as well also have the assistance of counsel. 'The average trade union secretary, or member of the trade Legal gentlemen thus union, could appear in these cases and do just as well as a legal practitioner, but foolishly they have the assistance of counsel, with the result that they spend their accumulated funds, and very often have to make a levy. union secretary will become as bad as a lawyer. that any trade union secretary is likely to become as bad as a lawyer. I ask the House to realize that if we desire to make industrial legislation effective and prevent trade unionists from preaching the doctrine of direct action, we shall have to show them that arbitration is cheap, and that it will not cost them as much to go to the Court as it will to strike. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that in many cases it has cost industrial unions as much to appear before the Arbitration Court as a strike would Builders' Labourers cases five or six strikes could have been successfully carried out for the money that was spent in going to the Court, and the industrial unionists of to-day that adopt constitutional methods have to pay as much as if they went on strike. In disputes between employees and employers, unionists do not desire to go to the Court, knowing that legal technicalities in every shape or form will be raised, and one of the best means of making arbitration effective is by inserting a provision to debar legal men from appearing. It is also very desirable that provision should be made to prevent industrial cases being heard in a building that resembles a Court, or before a person who is associated with the legal profession. The amendment I have moved has the support of trade unionists, and as it will be the means of facilitating the hearing of cases I ask honourable members to accept it. support the proposed new clause moved by the honourable member for Adelaide.

115,Mr Gabb (Angas) [5.39],"I rise tois not often that we agree, but on this occasion I must confess that he is right, in spite of the ridicule of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan).

I can quite understand a wealthy employer being -quite willing that his legal representative have not engaged legal advice. The bulk should protract a hearing. There are many employers who can afford to pay £1,000 -where a struggling trade organization may find it hard to raise £10. The object of adding expenses, in such circumtitances, is obvious. The point has been advanced that a lawyer is not permitted to be present in the Arbitration Court unless by consent of both parties. The honourable member .for Batman( Mr from. They consult lawyersI take it Brennan) says, "" Surely the unions know their own business best."" It is not so much a matter of the unions knowing their own business as of their feeling the necessity for engaging a lawyer in order that he, with his expert knowledge and training, may be able to counter the quibbles and technicalities raised by the lawyer for the other side. I once had to engage a lawyer. I did so, not so much that I felt that I could not conduct my own case, as that I was afraid of the legal technicalities which might be raised by the lawyer opposed to me. I have been sorry ever since, for my lawyer charged me two guineas for his advice that I should plead guilty. got off lightly. not guilty. The engaging of lawyers byunions is not due to the fact that the secretaries have been unable to adequately conduct their case, but it has been done because the unions are afraid might find themselves without the service of a lawyer when it came to the matter of arguing legal technicalities. I can quite understand the fears of the organizations in this respect. BeforeI went to college, I was always afraid to enter into an argument with a collegebred man, because I had the feeling that his special education gave him advantages which I would not be able to withstand. I had that same feeling of diffidence before I entered Parliament. I used to feel, when I was attending Labour conferences, and the like, that I was not equipped to enter into argument with members of Parliament, because they appeared to be especially wise and . sane persons. SinceI have entered this political arena, however, those ideas have departed. I sympathize with the attitude of trade unions generally towards members of the legal profession. They rightly fear that advantage may be taken by the other side if they themselves of public opinion is that the Arbitration Court would be infinitely more acceptable and successful if lawyers were barred. [5.47] -The proposal under discussion is really amazing. I do not know why the unions consult lawyers at all; but I suspect that it is because of the benefits which the unions expect to accrue there-in order to get the best possible advice in relation to the presentation of their , case before the Court. The suggestion that the introduction of lawyers necessarily involves the protraction of a hearing must emanate from a miserable and unfortunate experience. The unions know what is best in their own interests. There is already provision j that lawyers cannot be employed within the Court, except by the consent of both parties; and, if both parties agree that lawyers shall be employed, it is because each side is of opinion that it will be advantageous, both in its own interests, and for the assistance of the Courti t self, thus actually securing-in the",38,Pairs

Wouldi t not be passing a reflection upon the sanity and discretion of the unionists who desired the assistance of lawyers? unionists will thank the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Blundell) or the honourable member for Angas( Mr that lawyers have brought dilatoriness to Gabb), seeing that there is already ample protection in this matter afforded under the Act., If I were to consult a doctor, it would be for the reason that I considered that his advice would assist me towards the recovery of my health. A medical man would be able to help me, because of his expert knowledge. From a professional standpoint,""^ it is absurd to suggest that I , or any other legal member of this Legislature, should be moved, in arguing upon this matter, in any personal sense. I emphasize that the sole reason why parties consult members of the legal profession is, in their own interests, to secure expert advice and assistance. there were required additional reasons to convince me to support the proposed new clause, they have been furnished by those honourable members who have spoken in opposition to it . I refer partifees. The amendment should appeal to cularly to the' remarks of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and of the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best). It must be within the knowledge of practically all honourable members that unionists generally desire the legal fraternity to be excluded from Arbitration proceedings. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), with all his eloquence, failed to convince was fastened on me, when in a communime that it was due to the consideration of any expert training or knowledge that unionists engaged lawyers to attend the Arbitration Court. In matters coming before that Court, the expert knowledge and training are exclusively the attributes of the particular parties thereto;. the lawyers engaged generally know nothing whatever of the matters under consideration. legal interpretations are raised, the unionist is compelled to have his lawyer in Court to argue the legal side of any question. The industrialists do not want to have the legal so much as the practical side of their cases presented; they want to put before the Court the prevailing conditions of employment, and the amendment of those conditions for which I do not think they are asking. The Minister said that the employment of lawyers expedited the hearing of cases, but my experience is a fine art. We hear of the workers going slow, but the delays in the Arbitration Court due to the lawyers were a revelation to me. member put a layman in place of the Judge of that Court? would be an excellent thing to do. To determine working conditions, you require, not a Judge, but a practical man. I fail to see why either Judges or lawyers should be employed in the industrial Court. Arbitration does not appeal to unionists, and a large number of them have no faith in it, because of the delays which occur before cases can get to the Court, the delays that arise after they get there, due to the appearance of lawyers, and the fact that the greater part of their funds go in paying lawyers' all who desire the success of arbitration and object to direct action.

When speaking on the Industrial PeaceB ill , the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) was in favour of keeping away from the Court. He said, "" L e t matters be settled in some quiet private place, not in a Court."" Therefore, I expected him to be a whole-souled supporter of the amendment, because its -aim is to do away with the employment of lawyers, and to take from this tribunal the air of a Court. I should like to have everything done by laymen, though I do not know that that w ill be possible u n t i l before us, and I hope that members geneall Acts of Parliament are drafted in language which the ordinary layman can understand. Calare( Mr Lavelle) has shown that, although the Act says that lawyers are not to be employed unless there be an agreement between the parties for their employment, a legal gentleman almost invariably sits behind, the representative of the employer, f r a m in g arguments and questions for him, and that, therefore, the lawyer is not really excluded. I believe that the unionists of Australia would like to exclude lawyers from the Arbitration Court altogether. A t the present time, a very intricate case is being heard before Mr Justice Higgins, which raises the question of hours of labour; but on the employees' side the assistant secretary to the TradesH a i l Council is appearing, not for one union only, but practically for all the unions. the Australian Labour .party held in 1915, the late Laurie Cohen said thatParliament should make the laws so definite Foster, Richard that there would not he room for the High Francis, F.

The Minister has amended section 41 of the principal Act to provide that the person authorized by the Registrar shall have the right to inspect documents and so forth . The proposed new clause will make it necessary for employers to keep records of the names of their employees, the time worked, and the wages received by them. Most of them do so at the present time, but, in some of the States, in stances have occurred where employers have been found to keep no records, and not to ask their employees to sign for their wages. If an inspector were sent to the factory of such an employer to inspect documents, he would be unable to find any receipts for wages paid. In many of these cases, there is very grave suspicion in the minds of union secretaries that the men are not receiving the f u l l wages to which they are entitled. ment is designed to carry out what the Minister has already agreed shall be done..

The other part is more in the nature of the provisions of a Factories Act.

Employers are also called upon to keep a time book showing the number of hours worked by their employees and the wages received by them, and the employees are required to sign that book. Surely there can be no objection, to a similar' requirement in respect of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. It is necessary to see to the interests of the honest employer, who desires to obey an award, as well as keep control over the dishonest employer who seeks to evade it ; and to this end copies that he made application on behalf of the of awards should be conspicuously displayed. We have not yet reached the "" pitch "" when it is necessary to have a witness to the signature of a workman in payment of wages; but, in New South Wales, in the building trade, printed forms are provided,' showing the number of hours worked each day and the amount due. When a case goes to Court, these signed forms have to be produced""; and some employers have been known to get men to sign, for greater amounts than were paid to them. In two such cases employers have been fined, and one of the workmen concerned said he did not know what the award rate was. The Minister and the Court ought to be anxious to accept the proposed new clauses with a view to preventing such offences in tbe future, and protecting the honest employer.

I am at a disadvantage in not knowing the actual difficulties which the organizations have experienced in the past in connection with breaches of awards. I am informed that the amendment would be a benefit to the unions, and the workers generally, because it would facilitate the laying of information against defaulting employers. I do not think the amendment would cause any danger, because the secretary or officer could not take action on his own volition; he would have to apply to the.Court, and the Judge would decide whether proceedings should be taken against the party complained of.",42,Paibs

Of course, the organization must apply through some officer, and the applicant would explain to the Court his authority for applying oh behalf of the organization. What the amendment means is that the secretary, or some other officer, should have power to apply to the CouTt of his own volition, and apart from the organization.

Proposed new clause negatived. the second reading, I called attention to the advisability of allowing the persons who were most seriously affected by the strike an opportunity to express their views before the strike was entered upon. .During an industrial trouble, contribu. tions are sent for thebenefit of the strikers from industrial organizations all over-the Commonwealth; and the men get their ' food, housing, clothing, tobacco, and even some luxuries, much as usual; but the women and children are deprived of many of the comforts to which they are entitled, and suffer a great deal. I desire that the voice of the women may be heard before a strike is declared, and I propose the repeal of section 21, with a view to inserting another provision in lieu thereof.. Section 21 providesA certificate by the Registrar that a specified industrial dispute exists, or is threatened, or impending, or probable, as an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, shall be prvmA faoie evidence that the fact is as stated. Thus before a dispute, can come under the cognisance of the Arbitration Court, it must extend beyond the boundaries of any one StateT move That the following new clause be added:Section 21 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following is inserted in lieu thereof:."" 21. (1) In any case where an industrial dispute exists because of which a strike is suggested, contemplated, or threatened, it shall be competent for the President of the Arbitration Court to order that a secret ballot be taken at or in which every member of the organization affected shall be entitled to record a vote for or against a strike. (2) Whenever any such ballot is ordered, toral Departments shall conduct and supervise the taking of the ballot. (3) Furtheri t is hereby provided that the record a vote.

The new clause involves a new principle, but this is something which we should have done years ago. We should have given those -most deeply concerned some voice in these matters. Many of us have noted that recently the women of BrokenH ill themselves took action in connection with a strike. It resulted in nothing, but the very fact that they took action on their own account shows how deeply they were interested, and how very seriously they were affected by what has been going on at BrokenH ill during the past fifteen or sixteen months. Whilst they have been suffering very much, we have seen from correspondence in the press that the men at BrokenH i ll have been well fed and clothed, and, apparently, well housed.

That, however, is the thing farthest from their minds. think of it . What does a strike mean to them ? It means nothing but trouble for them. It means the most anxious time which men leading the trade union movement can have. I have had to go through it myself, and I know that the officials of trade unions detest strikes, but they have to protect the interests of the members of their organizations. The rules of these organizations can be seen; they are registered in the different States, and are recognised under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Herbert comes along with a proposal to take away from the members of trade union organizations their rights in regard to certain matters, because, forsooth, s-ome members of the Committee do not approve of what they occasionally find it necessary to do. Whilst they are prepared to deal with employees in this way, they have not one word to say about treating employers in the same way.

It has been a revelation, and I believe he has clearly expressed the opinion of most of the wives of the men who strike.

What is the use of legislationwhen our experience shows that we will have strikes whatever we do? Why not admit that strikes cannot be prevented, and legislate for them ? Is it right to shackle one section and allow the other to do just as it likes? The wording of the amendable member apply the amendment in the case of .a lockout ? ago, in connection with a strike, that the wives of the workmen decided to cease work, and left the strikers to look after the kitchen and the kiddies while they had a good time.

I am delighted to know that the statement is true._ As to. the workshops in which my honourable friend ( Mr Makin) says he has been employed, the experience of the last twenty years is that the industrial disturbances created in it have not infrequently been due to young irresponsibles. I am not including my honourable friend in that category. «ertainly youthful in appearance, but he is the father of a family, and an excellent fellow. My only complaint against him is that he is wrongly informed. I could traverse all the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), and several other members of his party, but I do not wish to detain the Committee. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) has given utterance tonight to some splendid sentiments, the truth of which cannot be. gainsaid, but in order to avoid any waste of time let me say that the words of wisdom that have fallen from his lips have come at the wrong moment, since the purport of the Minister's proposals, if I understand them rightly, is that strikes shall be declared illegal. In these circumstances, I ask you, Mr Chairman, whether the debate is in order ? the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford). I have not much fault to find with that part of it which provides that there shall be a secret ballot of the members of an organization involved in a dispute to determine whether or not a strike shall take place, because I , too, have had inside experience, and might bear out some of the statements which the honourable member has made. But I resent very strongly his proposal that the wives of the men should take part in the ballot. No doubt the honourable member thinks that if the women-folk had a right to vote, there would be no strike. In other words, he is casting a reflection on the wives of the unionists by suggesting that they would be such crawlers as to allow their husbands to put up with any industrial conditions rattier than risk the privations that attend a strike. The unionist, after all, is but the son of his mother; he is of the stock from which he has sprung, and . when it comes to making a sacrifice, or to standing up for a principle, no one is more ready to do so than a woman. have an opportunity of expressing their opinion. this amendment because of any fear of the result of such a ballot as is suggested.

Proposed new clause negatived. move That the following new clause he added:"" 19. After section 58A of the principal Act the following section is inserted:58B. The rules of an organization under this Act and the officials of such .organization shall not, during the currency of an award in the industry concerned, prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements in accordance with such award at any time prior to the commencement of service.'"" The amendment would prove useful in connection with not only the pastoral industry, but sugar-cane cutting, since it would enable members of an organization to make their arrangements or to enter into contracts with employers some time before the actual date of starting work. The special reasons supplied to me for this proposal are as follow:1. Tlie signing of an agreement is the only way of binding an employer on the one hand to keep a pen for the man engaged, and, on the other hand, of binding an employee to commence his work on or about a given date. 2. In order to organize the supply of shearing labour for pastoral requirements., definite engagements must be made in advance and prior to roll-call; until the shearers, shedhands, and wool-spressers are engaged, it is impracticable to safely engage woolclasser, expert, overseer, and other men, required. 3. If agreements are not signed before rollby flouting an award. I am sure there * call the experience in the past has been that at some sheds there is an over-supply, and in others an under-supply, of the labour necessary for the shearing, and that, men make unnecessary trips to stations at a great distance without being sure of obtaining work when they get there. That should be obvious to honourable members generally. If it were possible for memibers of organizations to enter into an arrangement some time before the date fixed for commencing operations, there would be less likelihood of men travelling long. distances to reach a shearing shed, only to be disappointed on arriving at their destination. In these days of labour shortage particularly, this is a.very important consideration. The. Australian Workers Union until 1918had no objection to shearers signing on in advance of shearing operations. The men were in the habit of sending in their names or of entering into arrangements either with tihe contractor or the pastoralist to shear his sheep; but since 1918 the union has objected. It has a rule that members may forward their deposits, but must not sign agreements before roll-call. Since 1918, however, the rule has been suspended during each shearing season. That is not a good thing for the industry. So long as men work in. accordance with the award relating to the industry, I cannot understand why any objection should be made to these arrangements. The present system is very unfair. Where the members of the organization have not made any contract prior to the date fixed for starting operations, the pastoralists and .cane-growers are left absolutely in the hands of a few.men. That, I am sure, is quite contrary to the wishes of the Australian Workers Union. That union has always been anxious that its members shall carry out their obligations under the award of the Court. That is all we are asking for-that the rules of the organization shall not enable it to prevent men engaging in this class of work on contracts made some time before they actually commence operations. I hope the Minister( Mr Groom) will not' object to the amendment, for he knows the difficulties of the industry, and how irresponsible men are at times able to cause a great deal of trouble, especially in the back country, is no desire to support men who do that kind of thing; and, under the circumstances, my proposal is to enable the shearer and the cane-cutter to be quite sure of employment, and employers to make arrangements for the entire season. In Western Australia, under the conditions I am advocating, continuous work is provided from about March to the end of November. I can assure the Minister and honourable members that those interested in this amendment have the highest authority for saying that it is quite constitutional.",53,Paibs
249,Mr Gregory (Dampier) [9.25],"II regard this amendment as quite unnecessary, and I hope it will not be accepted by the Committee. The amendment asks that during the currency of an award nothing shall be done to prevent members of an organization from entering into written agreements, in accordance with the award, at any time prior to the commencement of service. I cannot understand why, if an award has been obtained by an association, there should be any necessity for members of that association to enter into private agreements. This agreement, it seems to me, is "" loaded."" the honourable member that it is not.' we have heard that it is "" loaded,"" and I shall be very careful regarding it . The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) alluded to the Australian Workers Union. sides of the question. me say at once that I do not think there is any union that has the same numerical strength as the Australian Workers Union, and, further, that since the A r b i tration A ct came into force, no union has, so far as I know, observed awards more closely^ as proved by the fact that there has been no upheaval in the pastoral industry. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) says that nothing has been gained by arbitration, but I submit that no one can tell what has been gained in consequence of the -operation of the Act. Workers Union has lqyally abided by the awards of the Court, and, after all, they represent one of the staple industries of the Commonwealth on which we depend. have not always done so. record of the Australian Workers Union, tbe honourable member says that the men of the organizations have not always abided loyally by the awards. I take it that the honourable member is alluding to the present position, ' view qf the remarks of the honourable member. There is an award at present .current, but in Queensland a State award jgave better conditions than those pro-vided by the Commonwealth award. This led to a conference between the representatives of the pastoralists and the Australian Workers Union, and, at that conference, I should say three-fourths of the pastoralists agreed to observe the better terms of the State award. There were, however, somepastoralists who declined to enter into that arrangement; and, I take it , because of their declining we are asked to accept this amendment. The cost of living has gone up considerably during the last few years, while the price of wool has practically doubled, and there ought to be no objection to the employees getting I can assure a better price for shearing. Surely it is not claimed that the shearers in AusI think from what tralia generally shall work for less than has been awarded by the Queensland Judge? The question was thoroughly threshed out at the conference to which I have referred, but whether the settlement arrived at did or did not represent a compromise, I cannot say. Now, however, because a few pastoralists, probably the most wealthy of those engaged in the industry, have decided they w ill not abide by the Queensland terms, this amendment is proposed. As I have said, there is at the present time a Commonwealth award which covers the Australian Workers Union, and if this amendment is accepted the small section of pastoralists who decline to pay the terms arranged at the conference w ill be able to enter into private agreements, on the basis of an award that gives something less to shearers than they are entitled to. To pass The Australian such legislation is to "" look for trouble "" ; if we insert a provision for the purpose of assisting certain individuals to force Australian Workers Union members in certain parts of New South Wales to themselves shear for something less than the price paid in Queensland and other parts of In spite of the Australia, we shall not be going in the right direction. I sincerely hope the amendment will not be accepted, because I feel convinced that it would mean a good deal of mischief to the Commonwealth. ' I warn the Minister( Mr. Groom) that it will be to the advanI am putting my accepted, for it w ill enable certain pastoralists to protect themselves by the. present award, and certain unionists w ill regard themselves as justified in working under it .",54,Paibs

As I was saying, for many years past, station-owners in the north of South Australia, right up to the Queensland border, have been in the habit of engaging their shearers in Adelaide, under agreements, to shear first one station and then another, right through the season.' Until very recently that has been done at award rates. Recently, however, for some reason or other, the union has forbidden men to enter into such agreements, and insists that they shall sign their agreements on the stations. Let me say here, that under the arrangements which have prevailed until quite recently, station-owners were able to employ the same men year after year; and this proved of great mutual advantage. ; should it be done without signing? The employer is responsible for the fares of the men, and if the agreements were not signed in the city there would be no obligation on the part of the -men to sign on when they arrived at the station. I may say ""that a good many of the stationowners in South Australia get on very well with the union's principal representative, and for years there has been no trouble, the shearing going on like music until completion. Why should' the men not be allowed to do as in the past, for, as the honourable member for H.unter 'must admit, it is a sound business proposition?

They would sign on in the terms of the award or any constitutional variation of ' it.

It will not be eight hours; the Queensland award prescribes forty-four hours.

It and been .prepared to commence shearing, except that the conditions in the huts, and the kitchen, and the cooking conveniences, were so deplorable that no men would commence work until they were rectified. they have no option but. to commence work, and sue for a breach of the award. The shearing is finished, before the Court can be moved in regard to any breaches. The only way that men can enforce their legitimate claims is by insisting upon the conditions being satisfactory before they sign an agreement. The Arbitration -Court has fixed the rates for shearing and shed labour, and the working hours, but has not fixed the price at which meat is to be supplied to shearers. Honourable members know perfectly well that if some employers can only bulldoze their employees into signing the agreement before the roll-call, they will have no chance of getting their meat at a reasonable rate. If some employers have men bound hand and foot under an agreement, they will not give them anything that they have been depriving their employees of for so long. I say, as one who has been through the mill, that the employers will do nothing for their employees but what they are forced to do. If a man has not signed the agreement, and demands meat at a reasonable rate, in 99 cases out of 100 he will get what he demands. I claim to know as much about shearing conditions as does any other member of the ComMr Lavelle. mittee, and more than dd honourable members who sit in the Ministerial corner. That is proved by the statements which some of them have made to-night in this chamber. As one who understands everything connected with the pastoral industry, I say that the amendment, and the later amendment suggested Under by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) aim deliberate blows at the Ausin tbe best interests of that organization ment is carried.

In 1917 the Australian Workers Union were claimants in the Court, They asked the Judge to decideThat all shed hands shall be signed on at the advertised time of roll-call, and all vacant positions shall be ballotted for. They asked that that condition should be inserted in the award by the Court. The Court turned down the application, and would not allow that condition to be put into the award. Then the organization made a rule of their own, which, as I am informed, is contained in the 1918 issue, to this effectMembers may forward deposits for pens, but shall not sign agreement prior to rollcall. Members employed in the pastoral industry must sign the award agreement before commencing work at any shed, a duplicate of which they must retain in their possession. Members failing to comply with this rule shall be fined £2. That is a rule which they agreed to amongst themselves, -binding the members of their organization. Organizations have perfect liberty under the law to make rules and regulations to control their affairs. An application was made on behalf of the pastoralists for the cancellation of the registration of the Aus-",57,Paibs
295,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Ministe rtralian Workers Union as an industrial organization. The pastoralists did not really desire the deregistration of the union, but they were anxious that the Judge of the Arbitration Court should order this rule, which they regarded as objectionable, to be struck out of the rules of the organization, or that otherwise the organization should be deregistered. The application was to deregister, so as to compel the organization that made the Tule to repeal it. The Judge refused that application on the ground that the rule was not contrary to law or to the requirements of the Act. That was an industrial dispute between two organizations to decide whether or not a particular thing should be done.. organization, "" I will not give you what you ask."" And the organization then said, "" We will take it . "" in accordance with the powers they possessed under the law. They did nothing illegal in passing the rule objected to. This appears to have been an industrial dispute between two organizations, and now it seems to me that this Parliament is being appealed to to give a decision in this case. I have tried to look at the matter fairly, and from a non-party point of view. An appeal is made to this Parliament to do something which a Judge of the Arbitration Court refused to entertain. I say that this Parliament should not be made a Court of Appeal from an industrial tribunal. amend the law? doing it all the time. do something which, notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, it is doubtful whether Court to decide. we possess the power to do.

The honourable member must realize that the matter with which he desires to deal has been the subject of an industrial dispute in the Arbitration Court.

I suggest to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) that in this chamber we shall, get on very much better if we do. not impute motives to each other. This appears to have been an industrial dispute in the Court, and the Court is the proper authority to decide it . We cannot do by legislation indirectly what we have not the power to do by a direct Act of this Parliament.

Minister will look into the matter careParliament ought to have the power. f u l l y , because a very important question is involved. carefully. member for Dampier said appealed to me. I wai impressed by his suggestion that there should be as much freedom as possible given to men to take up employment so long as they do not violate an award. The shearing industry is a very important one, and as shearing is carried on in different places, it is very desirable that it should be possible to organize the labour available so as to secure the best results. But a consideration of the merits of any industrial matter in dispute between organizations is not a duty for this Parliament to undertake. In the circumstances, I ask' the honourable member not to press his amendment, as it seems to me that it is doubtful whether we have the power to 1 give it effect. The question has been looked into carefully by the law officers of the Commonwealth, but I give honourable members the assurance that I shall have it further considered. [10.15] I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Gro'om). I do not want to place my opinion against that of the Minister on constitutional questions, but it is absolutely inconceivable that a practical piece of common sense business which has been proceeding for the past twenty or thirty years or more should be outside the province of this direct legislation on labour matters assumed that the President looked upon 1 it. I hope that the point is that if the Court has power this a party question, and I am contending for a principle that is as much in the interests of the shearers as it is in the interests of the employers. It is based on ordinary business methods, arid if we are going to submit to another principle that is likelv to be a further impediment to industrial operations in this country it is time, in the public interest, that it was rectified. member explain how this amendment affects t h "" ivrint he is dealing with?",59,Paibs

I am merely repeating what the shearers have told me. They do not want to bo handed over to the tender mercies of some individuals at the sheds. The practice has been in vogue for twenty or thirty years, during which time the Australian Workers Union has grown' to the biggest thing of its kind in any part of the world. I am desirous of dispensing with that which is responsible for most of the industrial unrest in Australia, and I ask the Minister to allow this clause to be .postponed to enable honourable members to ascertain whether his statement as to the power of this Parliament' is correct or not. ..

That the House do now adjourn. desire to utter a word of protest concerning the. treatment meted out to some of the cx-membcrs of the Royal Australian JfavHl Brigade, "" M "" class, who were disbanded on the eve of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Adelaide. I have endeavoured to find an opportune time to bring this matter before the House, and I thought I would have an opportunity on grievance-day, but there was insufficient time. The, men.who were recently disbanded rendered valuable service to Australia as members of the Royal Australian Naval 'Brigade. Some had served from ten to thirty-three years, and notwithstanding this, were notified-by circular from the Navy Office that the force was being disbanded, and that they were to report themselves on-29th July to receive one year's retaining fee and their discharge. ri6712 I understand that no word of appreciaNavy Office, aud that the district naval officer was not in attendance when themen were disbanded. Whilst an apology was tendered on behalf of the district naval officer for his absence, there has been a lack of recognition of the valuable services rendered. They were ealled up in 1914 by proclamation, and performed very valuable work iu guarding wireless stations, on various merchantmen, and on enemy vessels lying in our ports. They were subjected to many disabilities, and had to work excessively long hours, for which they received very little or nd recognition in the way of extra pay. I have in my possession a'statement which shows that on many occasions' they were required to work many more than eight hours/and that some of them were not in receipt' of more th.an an able seamen's pay of 5s. per day. The claim these men make that they should come under the provisions of the war-time measures that have been passed by this -House in recognition of services rendered is worthy of consideration. A .number of the men were .drafted overseas, and, of course, there were others in the same brigade who were compelled to remain in-Australia, although'they desired to ""go abroad. Naturally, they feel that tion by the Government as some of those who rendered service abroad by taking work on transports, and who are allowed to participate in the benefits provided under the Repatriation Act, War Service Homes Act, War Gratuity. Act, and other measures. Some of the men wereemployed in isolated places such as Neptune Island and Oape St. Albans for months st a.time, and mauy of them were compelled Io give up permanent employment, which they could not regain on being disbanded. Honourable members will recognise that in consequence of the service they were compelled to render they had to make sacrifices in regard to seniority and in .oihpx ways. I trust the Government will give favorable consideration-to my request, and see that the men will be able to receive benefits under the measures ' that have been passed to assist soldiers.
