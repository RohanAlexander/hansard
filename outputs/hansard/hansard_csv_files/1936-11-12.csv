9,Mr Garden (Cook) [3.47],"Iwhich the Minister himself would be uuabie to pass. The Minister has strained, to a ridiculous yet dangerous degree, tlie very wide discretionary powers vested in him by the Immigration Act. Yesterday he stated in this House -that information received from India was of such a nature a3 to indicate that Mrs. Freer was a person of undesirable character. He has not the courage to make such a statement outside the House, but takes refuge in a coward's castle, and blasts a woman's character. He has attacked a woman who has been refused the right to land in Australia, and denied the right to defend hertelf. Mrs. Freer has challenged the Minister to produce ».ay information'which he may have relating to her character. He is, therefore, under no restraint to reveal the full facts of the case. Briefly, the Minister has damaged the moral reputation of a woman who has repeatedly demanded that he give the full facts. From answers to questions asked in this House, and from newspaper reports, it would appear that the Minister acted solely on representations made by General Carl Jess. entitled to know what were .those representations. appear that the first steps in this matter were taken hy the family of a Mrs. Dewar. Without, apparently, taking any precautions to verify fully anything that was told to him, the Minister set himself up as a sort of divorce court to intervene in a private domestic trouble which, seemingly, was really a. matter for a judge in divorce. This House should be informed under which section of the * Immigration Act the Minister derives power to side with one party in a domestic dispute. that act gives the Minister power, because a person wishing to enter Australia is, or is likely to he, involved in a divorce aotion, to take steps to prevent that person from entering this country? Surely he does not take it on him-, self to institute 'a. censorship over the affairs of private individuals! a principle is admitted, then we shall have a Minister excluding reputable British citizens because he does not like the colour of their politics, using as an excuse for their exclusion some phase of their domestic affairs. if r . Garden. should inform this House of the source of his information, and the steps he took to verify tnat information. .His replies to questions on't'liis matter have been most unsatisfactory-nothin g but innuendo, and, in effect, vilification. Having placed himself in a ridiculous position, he is now endeavouring to cover up his mistake by blackening the character of this woman, who . has not the privilege of defending herself. Even if Mrs. Freer's character is as bad as the Minister alleges, by what right can he exclude her from landing in Australia? If he replies that he has that right, anybody with a knowledge of modern life will readily agree that almost all persons arriving in Australia would have difficulty in entering the cenntry once the Minister had run his moral rule over them. Having done this in the case of Mrs. Freer, the Minister, to be consistent, must instruct his officers that, in future, every person arriving in Australia must satisfy the department as to the probity of his, or her, moral life. This case affects every British citizen who may hold a British passport, and This House is may be desirous of entering Australia. Never before in the history of this, or Furthermore, it would any other country, in which a democratic system of government exists has a responsible Minister taken such a stupid action. Members of the Cabinet should have the courage as men to tell the Minister that he has blundered over this affair. It is more than common gossip that, had the full Cabinet considered this matter before any action had been taken, the official, decision would have been vastly different. The Minister should be man enough to admit his blunder and take advantage of the earliest opportunity to rectify his What section of error and state that it is not his policy, or the policy of the Government, to enforce arbitrarily tbe provisions of the Immigration Act. If he fails to do this, it will be apparent to every one that this Government ' is ready at all times to invoke that legislation for party political purposes and to the detriment of liberty If such and freedom. The Government should, in every wav possible, try to erase this blot on the pages of Australia's history. Whatever it does, it cannot completely remove the The Minister stigma that has been placed on this woman's character. It can, however, by revoking ""the decision of the Minister for the Interior, show that it is not a party to the dictatorial enforcement of the provisions of the Immigration Act by arbitrarily excluding British subjects. Before the Minister took action in this matter did he consider what he would, or would not, have done had Mrs. Freer been some one near and dear to him? I remind him that One much greater than himself, with a deeper realization of human frailties and a greater understanding of the need for tolerance and compassion once saidHo that is without sin among you, let him cast a. stone at her. I hope that members of the Government will stand up to their responsibilities in this case. Here is a woman who has been brought into the focus of public light over a domestic issue. The person who brought her here and invited her on board the ship by which he travelled, and who is instructing the young of this country, is said to be a proper citizen, but the character of the woman has been reviled by the Minister for the Interior from one end of Australia to the other. Surely members of the Government have, the courage of their opinions, and will demand a retraction by the Minister, so far as his action in this case is concerned. Et is the easiest thing in the world to put a stigma on the character of any person, but no one who is guilty of such action can remedy the harm thereby done. Eveni f everything the Minister suggests concerning the character of this woman is true, surely it is not his prerogative, or that of any member of this Government, to say that he shall interfere with the private life of any citizen of a British dominion who desires to enter this country. I hope that honourable members opposite will protest against this action in respect of a woman who has neither the opportunity nor the privilege to defend herself. I am informed that Mrs. Freer intends to leave New Zealand next week for Australia. ""Will the Minister allow her to land in this country and will he then make statements outside of this House similar to those which he has made inside of it, so that she, as a citizen of the job is, I realize, in some situations not British Empire, may have the opportunity to defend her character before the people of Australia, India and Great Britain? for the Interior) [3.0J -The honourable member for Cook .( Mr Garden) has charged me with having used the privileges and immunities of this House to defame the character of a woman. On the contrary, had I taken full advantage of the privileges' and immunities of Parliament, I could have said very much more than I have said to defend the action which I have taken, and that would have been much the easier course for me to pursue. I have endeavoured, however, by every means in my power to protect this woman and other people involved by exercising every restraint, and this restraint has been exercised possibly to my own detriment. This unfortunate woman has brought more opprobrium upon herself by her own statements than I have been unwillingly compelled to bring upon her. The honourable member for Cook referred to a communication from General Jess. I have received no communication from that gentleman. The information upon which I acted came from India. Let us consider for a moment the attitude which the honourable member for Cook usually adopts respecting immigrants. As a rule he may be depended upon to protest against the admission to Australia of even a few wholesome migrants who may be an asset to the country in every respect. Generally, he may be trusted to use every endeavour to prevent even desirable persons of that character from coming here, despite the fact that he, like myself, migrated to Australia. But when a Minister charged with the sometimes unpleasant duty to administer the provisions of the immigration law, acting with a full sense of responsibility, refuses permission to land here to a person concerning whom his department has received reliable reports which disclose that the individual .concerned is of undesirable character, the honourable gentleman is filled with indignation. The bare possibility that a newcomer to Australia might take some other person's without its tragedy, and the honourable gentleman's sympathies are invariably",13,Formal Motion For Aojournment

Suffice it to say that I . have satisfied myself entirely as to the absolute trustworthiness of the. source and substance of this information..

The honourable member observed a few moments ago, that the woman had stated that she was willing for a f u l l disclosure to be made by me, and that there was therefore no longer any need for restraint in the matter. But I still have a duty to other persons-for example, the persons from whom I obtained this confidential information and also the persons who are the innocent victims of this unfortunate domestic tragedy.

'Shortly, my conclusions are-n o <one, British ago, that the most jealously guarded prior foreign, white or coloured, not being 'a member of the Australian community, has a legal right to claim admission to the Commonwealth. The right to refuse admission is rightly vested in the Minister, subject to control by Cabinet and Parliament. The matter of disclosure of rcaaons is properly in the -discretion of the -Minister in each case, subject to tlie like control. Some reference haa been made to that part of the Immigration Act which embraces the dictation test. I believe that no honourable member of this House is so simple as to believe that that part of our immigration legislation was enacted for the purpose of preventing illiterate persons from entering this country. That is nothing more than polite fiction. It may be quite frankly stated that the purpose of the section is undoubtedly of a dragnet character, but it at least has the great merit of serving to provide a technical reason for exclusion, which is accepted with good grace and without resentment by the countries from which the rejected persons come. On previous occasions it has been applied to British subjects as well as to aliens; it is brought into play a score of times a year; it has to be in his Opinion, from information been on the statute-book since shortly received from the Government of the United after federation; and from the beginning Kingdom or of aiiy other part of the British it has been made use of by every governDominions ment regardless of its political comsirable as an inhabitant of, Or visitor to, tiie plexion.

Honourable members were informed by him, -in answer to a question some days vilege of the Commonwealth of Australia is the .right to exclude undesirables from entering this country. We are all jealous of that privilege, but we are equally jealous of the right to be given reasons for ministerial action. While standing in the defence of one of these privileges, the Minister arbitrarily denies the other. Since Magna Char'ta it has been laid down as a fundamental principle of British law that justice shall be denied to no one and that every person has the -right to be heard in his or her own defence. The Minister stated in the early part of. this discussion that he has excluded Mrs. Freer under the power which is given to him to apply a dictation test. I desire to know why he found it necessary to invoke paragraph a of section 3 of the Immigration Act when if he had. received any justifiable information against this woman from authoritative sources he could quite easily have cleaned up the whole matter by invoking paragraph gh of the same section.

In my opinion the Minister, iu order to save himself, because his case, if he has a case at all, is so weak, dare not now give those reasons to the House. He admits that he has certain information, but he declines to state it. He has set himself up as a judge and jury, and from his decision there is no appeal. Apparently honourable members must not question his decisions. numbers of people have been excluded from this country, but the records disclose that the Ministers of the day, in order to justify those exclusions, were able to point to various circumstances as set out in the Immigration Act, as being good ground for preventing the persons concerned from landing on these shores. In the past, I emphasize, Ministers have been able to say: "" You cannot enter this country because you have an infectious disease; you are an advocate of the overthrowing by force of the Government of the Commonwealth; you have a criminal history-her e is your record, you have been tried and proved guilty."" In this case, however, the only charge which has been made by the Minister against Mrs. Freer is that she is a woman of an undesirable character. I should like to know what the Minister means by ""undesirable character."" The person whom he so charges has stated that she is not an undesirable character, and she has challenged the Minister to set out his reasons for so impugning her honour. The honourable gentleman is well aware that under the privileges of this House he can inform honourable members of those reasons, and I consider that if they have been obtained from an authoritative ^ource, and not from a personal and interested source, he would have had no hesitation in giving them. Mrs. Freer is a British subject carrying a British passport. The Minister on his own admission has received no information from the British Government in regard to this woman. Indeed, the Secretary of State for the Dominions, when replying in the House of Commons the other day to a question based on her. exclusion from Australia, admitted that he knew nothing of the case. The Minister has further stated that he has not received any information in reference to Mrs. Freer from the Government of India, but he has received information from interested persons in India and Australia. I therefore charge him with taking action in connection with this case at the time without first of all verifying the charges which have been laid against Mrs. Freer. He has left himself open to grave charges of careless administration, bocause, when taking action he failed to verify the information given to him, and In the past, I challenge him to disprove my statements. unverified evidence, the Ministei excludes a British subject and because, in my opinion, he has made a bad blunder, he thinks that by going into hit -shell, and maintaining a stony, non-committal silence, many credulous people will think that he has something dread f ul to conceal. In refusing to give thk information to the House, he is allowing thousands of people to think that the information which he is supposed to possess covers a multitude of sins, which may or may, not be the sins of Mrs. Freer. Is the Minister aware that many honourable members of this House have heard in a hundred places that he has excluded this woman from entering the Commonwealth because she ""may be a spy,"" she "" may have a criminal record,"" she ""may be professionally immoral,'* she "" may be a drug pedler,"" or she "" may be a white slaver""?

Mr Fagan stated that he saw no reason why she should bo refused permission to land in New Zealand, and everybody knows that New Zealand is a country with a high moral standard. What would the people of the dominion say to Mr Fagani f the Minister for the Interior were to lay on the table papers which disclosed something that we might regard as nefarious and dangerous in character? Even if all other members are prepared to judge this case on unconfirmed information, I am not.

But after all, it generally happens done to Australia, the Minister has the' right of discretion but the responsibility of deciding in favour of Australia. This matter has been raised by private The Acting Minister for members. It is complained, first thai the woman in . the case has been maligned and injured by publicity, and secondly, that not sufficient reason for her exclusion from Australia has been given to this House. Surely it must be obvious that both of those grounds cannot be sustained. I submit that there has been more broadcasting through suggestion and surmise by individual members than there has been publication by the Minister of reasons; and if injury has been caused to this woman it has been done by them. We must have some confidence in the Minister, or he would not occupy the position that he now holds. His inquiries brought confirmation of his original information. He has submitted this matter to Cabinet, and has informed us that Cabinet has approved of his action. That there may be others in this country whose character is similar to that of this woman, is not a ' reason that can be advanced in favour of entertaining her request to be allowed to land, for murderers, felons, and revolutionaries might also find comrades in Australia.

25,Mr Brennan (Batman) [3.24],"1that principles of first-rate importance are associated in some way with particular and personal instances. The liberty of the subject involves, as a principle, the liberty of some particular subject whose case arises for consideration. So it is in this case. The person affected is a British subject. That, however, is by no means conclusive of the question in any aspect. She came to Australia accredited by passport, from what may be regarded as the centre of our Commonwealth of Nations. As a general rule, intercourse between the dominions, and between Great Britain and the dominions, is free and open to all, and is not subject to change. I think it has to be laid down and accepted as a principle that, notwithstanding the terms of goodwill upon which we live with other dominions and with Great Britain, and notwithstanding the freedom of intercourse between citizens in different part.' of our Commonwealth of Nations, Australia admits whom it likes within its shores. It claims, and has asserted that right on a number of occasions, and in the courts of the land has successfully insisted upon its recognition. That insistence has extended, not only to individuals, but also to nations. But in the narrower aspects of the matter certain classes of persons are declared under the immigration law to be prohibited persons, and one of the classes consists of those who cannot pass what is known as the dictation test. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) himself admits that, that dictation test is a polite fiction. it has been the policy of the law not to I consider that the sooner we put our immigration law upon a more honest and solid basis the better. That is not a charge against the Minister, or even against the Government, because this act has been in existence for many years. But to act upon what is, after all, merely a fiction is to use what may h"". termed a fraudu ent device to administer 1 the law. I think that there is much to be said against exercising the powers that are conferred under section 3 and through the medium of that test, against any person, on moral grounds -wit h my own. But that is not a The Minister is quite wrong when he suggests that either the mover of the motion ( Mr Garden), the honourable Mr Brennan. or any other honourable member, is less sensitive than he himself is in regard to the importance of keeping the family life sacrosanct and incorrupt. We are all agreed upon that, and are well aware that, unhappily, the principle is often violated in this country. As one speaker has said, the divorce courts bear only too eloquent testimony to that fact. I think that, as far as possible, our attitude towards incomers should be, though it need not necessarily be, similar to our attitude towards those who are already within our shores. I speak in general terms. I believe that it is entirely undesirable that we should make a discrimination upon moral grounds. In my opinion, the framers of the statute took that view, because, apart from the dictation test, they have set out a long list of specific classes of persons who, in the view of the legislature, should be excluded. I need not read them. They are to be found in section 3, and they include imbeciles and feeble-minded persons, persons suffering from serious transniissable diseases, and so on. It is significant that that long list includes the class of unfortunate women who live in circumstances which I need not more exactly describe. the details? slightest intention of gratifying the honourable gentleman. In my view, the provision goes to show that, generally, constitute the Commonwealth a moral censor. The law has taken upon itself the exclusion of definite classes of persons whose incoming would be a menace in one way or another to Ihe safety or the social health of the community as a whole, and has been careful not to go beyond that when dealing with the moral issue. On the subject of family life and morality, the Minister would be the first to realize that his view may differ from that of others. It may accord very nearlyI hope and believe that it does complete answer to the question.

She has not the right to enter the countryand take action in the courts to clear her name should the allegations be untrue. Perhaps they are not untrue. She states that she desires the opportunity to prove that they are, but that opportunity is denied her. It seems to me that such action cuts across a principle of Brit'sh justice, the principle that he who is accused should have an opportunity to prove his innocence in the courts of the land, and for that reason I regret the action of the Minister for the Interior, and welcome the opportunity, provided by the moving of this motion, for honourable members to express their opinions on the broad principles insituation in which this woman finds hervolved. listened very attentively to the reply of entry into Australia of undesirable perthe Minister for the Interior( Mr sons, but the Minister has not convinced Paterson) honourable member for Cook( Mr character, or that she has broken the Garden), and I am not yet satisfied.

Both he and she were married, but her to each other, and he brought her to Australia for the avowed purpose of marrying her when he was able to obtain a divorce. There are always two sides to these matters. No one can persuade me that, in affairs .of this kind, the overtures are always made by the woman. Even the Minister would not claim that. It is even possible that if he were given the ""glad eye"" he might be tempted to make overtures himself. However that may be, the fact remains that this officer of the Australian Defence Department is to be allowed to go scot free, while the woman in the case is being made to bear all the blame. It is grossly unjust that she should be denied her right under British justice to defend herself. We-do not know what happened in India. If she is to blame, then Lieutenant Dewar is also to blame. Yet he has been allowed to return to Australia, and is to continue training the youth of this country. Even if he had been only partly responsible for the self. I do not admire him for his silence.

Honourable gentlemen have charged the Minister with insincerity and have criticized him for his failure to disclose the full facts. I do not know what those facts arc, but a very significant state of affairs has existed in this House this afternoon. This is the second occasion on which a matter of this nature has been debated here. On the other occasion, when the case of the exclusion of Egon Kisch was being considered, honourable members ^opposite rose in batches from their seats to have something to say, and the greatest antagonist to the Government on that occasion was the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). To-day that honourable gentleman contributed to this debate a very moderate and very valuable statement, but he spoke not one word of censure on the Government for the action it has taken in this case. He certainly made amending our immigration legislation, but I suggest that the honourable gentleman's most unusual moderation on a matter of this nature, when one would have expected him to approach the table >i wrath and indignation in defence of the rights of an injured lady, is extremely significant. Furthermore, the attitude of the Opposition is significant. What has palsied their tongues? What has palsied their legs this afternoon that they cannot rise to take part in this debate? Is any one of them in possession of any information bearing on this case which honourable members on this side of the House do not possess? Honourable gentlemen opposite have adopted a most inexplicable attitude, and their failure in this instance to follow their policy of taking care of the waifs and strays of the world, a responsibility which they essume with vehemence and vigour, allows the is most unusual.

But I do so because I believe that it has acted rightly, and for no other reason. If I thought that the Government -had acted wrongly, I should say so. ""We should judge this issue on the basis of whether the Minister has broken the immigration law of this country. Has he acted in a way in which the law does not give him the right to act in using his discretion in this manner? No man can level such a charge justly against him.

If it comes to a point of whether this Parliament has to choose between the rights of one outsider-wh o has no rights, legal, moral, or otherwise-to enter this country and the rights of the 6,000,000 people who constitute the population of Australia, raise its revenue, and have to pay for its administration, then I stand on the side of the Commonwealth Government in protecting the 6,000.000 against the Outsider.

The Government has exercised its right and its discretion. The Minister has done his job, and, instead of being criticized for having done it, this Parliament as a whole, and the taxpayers of this country, should commend him for his action. The honourable member for Barker( Mr carefully exercised. I agree that, in <MB Archie Cameron) was vexed because honourable members on this side of the House would not make this matter a party matter. We decline to make it a party matter, because we realize that what has been done by the Government has not been done on the basis of any party considerations, and also because of the disapproval expressed by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. Honourable members on this side commend the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Martin( Mr What has been done in this case appears McCall), in raising this matter on many occasions. The honourable member for Barker said that it should be considered as one of law only, that the only thing we had to ascertain was whether the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) bad legal power for the action he took, and if he had such power, it was the end of the matter. I submit that that is not the end of the matter. Undoubtedly the Minister has such power, but he is not commanded in every case to exercise that power. He is given a discretion. If he were to exercise this power in every case, no one would come into this country at all. We have to consider why the particular section was enacted and examine the reasons why this power to exclude persons on a dictation test was invoked. In the beginning of federation, the Commonwealth decided to carry on the old colonial policy of excludof persons who wish to enter Australia. ing coloured immigrants, whether they were British subjects or not. Sir Joseph Chamberlain, who was then in charge of the Colonial Office, said that the Royal [831 power of disallowance would be used in relation to any aotion which definitely excluded British subjects from a dominion. It was for that reason that the dictation test was devised. It had been used before in Natal and Western Australia. That test was introduced with the object of enabling the Commonwealth to exclude coloured people without having to give reasons for such exclusions. In the same way, the original provision that the dictation test must he put in a European language was excised from the act, and a new provision for a dictation test in any language was enacted. We have to consider the circumstances in which this power was enacted, and the reasons for it. This power is one which must ""be instance, the Minister has not exercised it in any party spirit, but that he hiB been influenced by a natural feeling which would affeclj any man in like circumstances. The first thing to realize is that the Minister, or rather, the department, should not be a censor of morals. I mention the department, because Htm Minister, in csxplaining his action, said that he had acted upon the advice of the officers of his department. Thus, the Minister has broken no new ground. to he the kind of thing that has been done for a long time by the department; that is, the department considers that, under the provisions of this act, it can, at its will and pleasure, exclude anybody, because it is perfectly lawful and easy to administer to a migrant a dictation test which he cannot passI suppose that the Minister for the Interior himself might have been subjected about 25 years ago, when he first sought entry into Australia, to a dictation test of 25 words in German, Swedish or some other European language. If he had failed to pass it he might have been excluded from the country to which he is now an ornament. This power was not intended to enable the Minister to be the judge of the morals Most honourable members know that an agitation has been on foot in Australia for some years for the exclusion from the country of wealthy, men who leave their wives here and go to Nevada to obtain",24,Formal Motion For Aojournment

49,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [4.0],"an irregular divorce in a court where their wives have no opportunity to defend themselves. men on obtaining their divorce often remarry in America and re-enter Australia, where they cannot be prosecuted for bigamy. It has been suggested over and over again that the law should be amended to deny them re-admission to Australia. But I do not say that such men, who, in many cases, are prominent citizens of Australia, should be excluded. I am sure that the names of some such certain persons will rise in the minds of honourable members, particularly those who represent Victorian constituencies, but I consider that it would be wrong to give power to exclude them from the country simply because we do not like their moral behaviour. Tho act provides that a person living on sexual immorality or suffering from an incurable disease may be excluded; but obviously the legislature did not intend to give the Minister power to exclude from the country persons merely because they may be immoral. Adultery has not been a criminal offence in Britain Interior cannot, however, be converted since the days of the Protectorate, and we have no right to exclude a person from Australia simply because of his sexual immorality. If we are to exclude all persons who fall within that category, we ought to deny many of our prominent citizens the right to live here. One Premier of Victoria, for example, was notoriously living in adultery, and the Premier of another State, whose name I shall not disclose because of the great respect I have had for his memory, was also in that position. The same thing could be said of many other citizens. ""WhatI have so far said sums up my first objection to the action which the Government has taken in this case. My second objection is that what has been done has been done in the dark. I remember reading that in the old republic of Venice there was what was called the Lion's Mouth. Into this lion's mouth at night could be placed an anonymous indictment of any citizen. This would come before the Council of Ten and the citizen charged might disappear for ever. That is the kind of thing against which English courts and English common law Mr Blackburn. have been working for centuries. On this point, Voltaire, as honourable members will Such recollect, praised the English courts and the English common law, and condemned the courts and law of his own country. If citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations are to be excluded from Australia at all, it should be only after a charge made against them has been investigated and found to be proved. A charge has been made in this case by no one knows whom, but there has been no investigation or verification of it. The Minister for the Interior has said that he has spared this woman, but actually he has not spared her. At first we all understood that the charge against her was that she was an infamous person. It wa3 only after the Minister had been questioned again and again in this House that it leaked out that her offence was that she was a stirrer up of domestic discord, and was endeavouring to alienate husband from wife, and that a friend of the wife was indignant at this action. The Department of the into a bureau of matrimonial conciliation. I do not think that the Minister himself believes that Mr and Mrs. Dewar will be brought together by the device of excluding Mrs. Freer from Australia. The Minister should state exactly the charge against Mrs. Freer, even though he may not say who made it. He has been invited by several honourable members to state the charge so that they may have the opportunity to judge whether he has properly exercised his discretion. A good deal has been said in the course of this discussion about the law and the policy of the law; but that has nothing to do with the Minister. If Parliament does not like the policy of the law it can amend the law. The House has reasons to dislike the policy of the department, and the manner in which it has been exercised in this particular case. I say, with great respect to the Minister, that I believe that he has really tried to do this act without hurting the sensibilities of the people concerned, and has allowed himself to be influenced by a natural human sentiment.

I wish to amend the motion for leave so that the competence of the House to deliberate upon the general principles of the Constitution Aet may be preserved. I have in mind particularly thoie portions of the act which modern experience has shown need to be altered. Unless the motion is amended at this stage it will be impracticable for honourable members to deal with the subjects which I have enumerated when the bill is actually introduced. ""We should find ourselves hampered in every direction. The motion would confine our consideration solely to matters relating to air navigation and aircraft. I said in a recent debate that it is unsatisfactory to deal in piecemeal fashion with the Constitution. To pursue that course must render it almost impossible for us to make the Constitution, as a Constitution, a workable instrument to enab'e this Parliament to exercise effective legislative power on many matters of major national importance. The bill that was recently before us, which dealt with the limitations imposed on us by section 92 of the Constitution by reason of a decision of the Privy Couneil, was unsatisfactory in that, even if the people agreed to that proposed alteration of the Constitution, it would still be questionable whether this Parliament would have adequate power to deal effectively with marketing as a subject of Commonwealth policy. The bill which the Attorney General( Mr Menzies) is now seeking leave to bring in is consequent upon a decision of the High Court of Australia, delivered only the day before yesterday. It will be observed, therefore, that the bill now before another place became necessary because of a judgment of the Privy Council, and rthe bill which the Attorney-General is now seeking authority to introduce'has become necessary because of a judgment of the High Court. Within the last two months, therefore, judgments have been delivered by one tribunal or another which have upset legislation which was presumed ta be well within the legislative competence of this Parliament. The uncertainty and confusion which has arisen in regard to the validity of the powers of this Parliament is creating a state of affairs that may lead to the assumption that any law passed by the Parliament may be successfully attacked and overthrown. The danger of that to a democracy at present is, I submit, extremely grave, because, in a democracy, respect for the law must rest finally upon the certainty of the authority of the law. In the very doubtful circumstances in which we find ourselves, by reason of these recent judicial decisions, I suggest to the Attorney-General 'that he can no longer be satisfied to seek the approval of the electors to a single alteration of the Constitution. It is therefore greatly to be desired that Parliament should be given the opportunity to deal with other aspects of the Constitution which admittedly need attention. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said in his policy speech that certain aspects of the Constitution required attention, and the Attorney General admitted in the recent debate in this House that there was a call for the strengthening of Commonwealth power in some form or other in order to deal with various subjects. I direct attention to the fact that it is the Constitution Act itself which needs review. While I have, to some extent, succumbed to the necessity for dealing with the Constitution piecemeal, as indicated in my amendment, I do it only because a general declaratory motion hy the Opposition in respect to how the Constitution might be reviewed would probably not be acceptable to the Government. member asking for specific powers? : amendment in sufficiently wide terms to avoid hampering honourable members in giving consideration to wider aspects of the Constitution than those specifically 1 mentioned by the Attorney-General.",25,Formal Motion For Aojournment

These subjects are, I submit, just as urgent as marketing or air navigation and aircraft. Speaking generally, I would say that foreign treaty, and that we should proit is unwise for the Parliament to attempt ceed to legislate in regard to industrial to deal with proposals for the alteration matters, trade and commerce, or aviation, of the Constitution in any strictly not under the power given to us by the limited way.

In regard to air navigation and aircraft, the High Court has decided, in effect, that the Commonwealth power is not satisfactory, and Their Honours the justices have pointed to a method whereby the power might be exercised.

I put it to the Country party that, if orderly marketing is advantageous and desirable, and calls for Commonwealth legislation, the Commonwealth Parliament authority to deal with the situation, and that it should not have to wait until an agreement is reached by a number of the States. Similarly, in Tegard to aviation, we perhaps could get an agreement with the States by which they would surrender their power over this sphere to the Commonwealth, and such an occurrence would avert the necessity for the holding of a referendum based upon the terms, of the bill whioh the Attorney-General seeks to introduce; but would that be a satisfactory solution of the difficulty in regard to aviation? obviously says "" No "", because he is asking for leave to bring in this bill, but I put it to him that industrial matters are really more perplexing and more important to the. economic life of Australia than is the subject of aircraft and air navigation. In scale and in importance it cannot be denied that industry presents the outstanding and supreme problem of our generation, but this Parliament is handcuffed in dealing with it. In view of the fact that we are now to discuss another proposal for an alteration of the Constitution, we at least should see that at this juncture we free ourselves in order to be able to discuss the matter generally and adequately. My amendment of the motion which has been moved by the Attorney-General has been devised, not because at this stage I contend that this House could give an affirmative vote for powers over trad* and commerce, but because Parliament should take a vote as to whether or not it will submit the question of granting powers over trade and commerce to the people. Recently the Attorney-General, in a reply which he gave to a question, said that he was in favour of a referendum in connection with the granting of industrial powers to the Commonwealth being submitted to the people at a more appropriate time. I now invite honourable members of the House of Representatives to declare whether or not hit opinion is their opinion. Let Parliament decide whether now or some other occasion is the appropriate time to deal with the subject of industrial matters. The same applies to trade and commerce.

It would be a great mistake to bring forward at this time contentious subjects which would be opposed, not only by the general public, but also by the State Parliaments themselves. If the honourable member's amendment were carried and the Government determined to submit to tlie people the issues which it contains, I feel that the success of the referendum iu connection with marketing would be gravely jeopardized. Leader of the Opposition when dealing with this matter, mentioned the opinion of Sir ""William Irvine in connection with the powers given to the federal authority. I was never aware that Sir ""William Irvine, although an able lawyer, ever considered himself to be an authority on constitutional matters. I quote the opinion of Professor Dicey in his Law of the ConstitutionThe Parliament of the Coinm'onwealth is endowed with very wide legislative authority; thus it can legislate on many topics which lie beyond the competence of the Congress of the United States, and in some topics which He beyond the competence of the Parliament of tlie Canadian Dominion. Court upset that belief. When the Constitution was framed the matter of aviation was never contemplated, and I have never been able to understand why the federal authorities have not appealed to the State governments to confer upon the Commonwealth power to control aviation. understand why no publicity was ever given to the request or to the refusal of the State Parliaments to grant such a necessary power to the Commonwealth. I quote from another authority, the Honourable James Bryce, in Studies of History and JurisprudenceThe range of powers granted to tlie National or Commonwealth Parliament is very wide, wider than that of Congress or of the Swids National Assembly, or even of the Dominion Parliament in Canada. It is strange that honourable members appear to forget entirely that the circumstances under which the Commonwealth Constitution was framed, and that under section 51, a series of powers was given to the federal authority to make it supreme only in certain spheres. It has been entirely a case of the Federal Parliament itself having gone beyond the powers granted to it to legislate on questions in regard to which it had no constitutional powers. I contend that in matters of this kind the Parliament Bhould be content to accept for the time being the decision of the people. I am not suggesting that, because the people in 1910 and on subsequent occaThe sions refused to grant to the Commonwealth the trade and commerce power which it sought, they should not be asked again at a later date. The view that I am putting forward is that it is not right to legislate on the assumption that powers are held which the Constitution iias never conferred. I do not think that many honourable members realize what would happen if the full trade and commerce power were possessed by the Commonwealth. Under it, the Commonwealth would have the power to legislate in regard to every matter that affects the business affairs of the Australian community. Even the granting of a peddler's licence could be brought within its purview. Every vestige of home rule would be destroyed. I quoted the other day a lengthy statement which President Coolidge made in 1926, when he refused to ask for powers similar to that for which the Leader of the Opposition now asks. The area of the United States of America is practically the same as that of Australia, and different propositions arise for determination in the various States. Unlessi f is desired to set up control by a bureaucracy, f u l l power should be withheld from the Commonwealth. A t the present time it is hardly possible for one to trade without first obtaining permission from a government department, and this control is becoming a very serious menace.

65,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [4.38.],"( Mr Menzies) is to set in motion the machinery of constitutional alteration for of the greatest authorities upon the Austho purpose of dealing with the flaw which the decision just given by the High ever produced, and one of the leading Court of Australia has disclosed in the legislative power of this Commonwealth. I suggest that it is undesirable that we should resort to the policy of making piecemeal alterations of a constitution which was adopted at the end of last cento, the powers of the Constitution. tury, and in many respects has grown out of the needs of the people. President Pranklin Roosevelt has referred to the Constitution of the United States of America as a ""horse and buggy constitution which is being applied to an automobile age "". The Australian Constitution is not so greatly out of touch with the present age of the people as is that of the United States of America, but it is undoubtedly out of touch. All honourable members, quite irrespective of party considerations, will admit that the national Parliament should have much wider power than it now possesses, and many of them will concede that it should have complete legislative power. The honourable member for Swan( Mr in the beginning of federation-a n elected Gregory), who has just resumed his seat, has referred to what President Coolidge said about the constitution of the United States of America. That constitution has been a buttress of privilege, and there is might have to gofurther than that, and no doubt that the great vote recorded in favour of President Franklin Roosevelt was largely a protest against the manner in which the remedial measures passed by the Roosevelt Administration were set at naught by the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I believe that, instead of dealing with the matter in the manner suggested by the Attorney General, we should attempt so to revise our Constitution as to make it conform to the needs of the people. It is quite obvious that, whatever may be the merits of major alterations of the Constitution, those merits do not receive consideration by the electors .of Australia, because the the power to amend its own constitution; proposed alterations, when placed before them, are associated with the party that proposes them, and the use which that party proposes to make of them. Swan has denied tlie competence of Sir William Irvine to rank as a high constitutional authority. I claim that Sir William Irvine is undoubtedly one tralian Constitution that this country has advocates of it in the High Court of Australia. It is interesting to note that in the High Court Sir William Irvine was the advocate of those who sought to limit, to give a restricted construction But, in this House, he did contend that there should be an extension of those powers, and in 1910 made an attempt to consider, quite irrespective of partisan considerations, the merits of the proposals then placed before the people. He also advocated the adoption by the people of the very wide alterations proposed in 1911. It is unfortunate that the people have always associated proposed alterations of the Constitution with the policy of the party that has proposed them. I believe that the Constitution will never be satisfactorily altered until it is considered by the some kind of authority as that which presented it to the people for consideration convention representative of the people and invested with power to submit proposed alterations to the people apart altogether from the Parliament. We provide that this elected body should itself have the power to alter the Constitution. I , however, do not agree with that. I believe that it would be very undesirable to diminish whatever power is given to the people by the Constitution. The people should have the power to either reject or accept proposed alterations of the Constitution. Consideration has recently been given to an alteration of the Canadian constitution. For that purpose a special parliamentary committee was set up last year. Professor F. R. S. Scott, giving evidence before it recommended that Canada should have that the amendment should be made by a majority vote of the dominion parliament sitting as one House, and that those amendments which affected minority The honourable member for rights should require the consent of the provincial parliaments, such consent to be taken for granted unless withheld, within one year. I believe that the Constitution of Australia should be developed with the object of ultimately giving to the Commonwealth Parliament full power to deal with the problems of this country. There should be such guarantees of economic liberty and equality as exist in the present Constitution. In other words, whole the States remain there should be the guarantee of freedom of trade between them; against discrimination or preference; there should be no established religion or religious preference; there should be the provision that should not last longer than three years; and there should he provision for adult suffrage and other matters of a similar character. But this Parliament should have full legislative powers. It has, I believe, much greater powers than we are accustomed to credit it with possessing. The difficulty is to ascertain exactly where we are. Our path of legislation is as difficult to find as the tracks through countries of which we sometimes read. There are certain safe tracks, but only very old and experienced marshmen know where they are; and if one should step for a moment off the path of safety one would be engulfed forever. We do not want a Constitution with those, characteristics; we want a form of government that can be made to work the people's will, so that the people may feel that there is not only power but also responsibility. One of the greatest defects of the system under which we work in Australia is that the people are not able to hold anybody responsible for failure to remedy their ills. We have a system of government which can he understood only by lawyers-and not always by them. Under the constitutionsof Australia and the United States of America, the real government rests with the courts-an aristocracy of the long road. They, and they alone, can say definitely what are the powers of the legislature. In such circumstances, the Parliaments of both the States and the Commonwealth can evade responsibility. State parliament may say, "" We should like to be able to solve this problem or to remedy this social evil, but we cannot do so because, in our opinion, we have not the necessary power. 'We will not incur the obloquy of attempting a solution and Mr Blackburn. then having it rejected by the courts."" Over and over again the Commonwealth Parliament has refused to attempt to deal with certain matters because it has not been certain of its power. I consider that the prime need of a country which claims to be a democracy, is to bare an instrument of government so simple that the people who live under it can underthere should be protection stand it, and so clear that failure to remedy social ills can be sheeted home to those who are responsible. I believe that we should aim at a Constitution which Parliament will invest in this Parliament complete power to deal with the economic and social evils of this country, but will protect the individual rights of citizens, and the rights of States so long as they continue to exist. I am of the opinion that the time has arrived when this country should be further subdivided. Order1 I wish to give a ruling that will guide honourable members during the course of this debate. It will not be in order for them to advocate wider powers, or powers other than are proposed in either the motion or the amendment. General amendments limiting or increasing the powers of the Commonwealth or the States, which are outside the motion or the amendment will not be in order. to your raling, sir. I thought that I was in order in contending that the policy advocated by the Attorney-General, of making piecemeal alterations of the Constitution, should not be adopted. However, I have already said as much as I desired to say upon that matter. I consider that the policy of tinkering with the Constitution, of mending a hole here and a crack there, of putting a patch here and a patch there, is outworn. Such a policy does not improve the instrument of government. If we have to patch up defects such as those that the High Court has discovered, it would be better if we were to ask the States to refer the necessary power under section 51, paragraph 37. I believe that there would be no disA inclination on the part of the States to refer that power. I am not in favour of setting the whole process of constitution alteration in motion merely in order to remedy defects that could easily be remedied by agreement. To do that is to use a steam hammer to crack a hazel nut.",30,Constitutio N Alteration

67,Mr Blackburn,"I cheerfully bowmatta) [4.50J -The constitutional conflict, which culminated in the High Court decision of a few days ago in regard to aviation, demonstrates clearly the need for taking some action to settle the line of demarcation between the powers exercised by the existing sovereign governments of Australia, and that action should be of a more comprehensive character than that proposed in the resolution now before us. I have in mind, not only decisions reached after litigation, but also the disputations taking place at the present time between two of the highest financial authorities in Australia in connection with important matters of national monetary policy. I hope, therefore, that the Government will not entirely disregard the suggestion that a more far-reaching review of the Constitution should be made than it has yet proposed, so that the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States may be more definitely determined. I do not think that I am giving away any secrets when I say that I believe the time has arrived to ask the people to say whether or not they are in favour of concentrating all the legislative functions within Australia in one soverign government. I mention that by way of preface to the statement that, although such would be my ultimate objective, I am prepared to advance step by step, and am, therefore, willing to' support the proposal of the Government. I am wholly in favour of the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) by way of amendment, but I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will, at a more appropriate time, submit that proposal flor the approval of the people. In the circumstances, therefore, while I am not prepared to vote against the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, I must content myself with the promise of the Prime Minister that, at a later date, this House will be given an opportunity to discuss wider proposals which would include, among other things, the granting to the Commonwealth of industrial powers which it does not now possess. [4.53] I support the amendment of done now by adding a third, and asking the [04] ( Mr Curtin). I suggest to the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) that he should accept the proposal previously made for the holding of a small, inexpensive, round-table conference, of a non-party character, between representatives of the Government and of the Opposition, for the purpose of drawing up proposals for submission to the people by way of referendum. My experience has convinced me that, unless we can agree in this way upon the proposals to be submitted, there is no hope whatever of their being endorsed by the people. If all the parties in this House could agree among themselves what questions to submit, and when they should be submitted, I believe that we might secure the approval of the people to proposals for much-needed reforms of the Constitution. I can remember when the first Commonwealth Arbitration Court case was heard in Australia before Mr Justice Higgins. The case for the employees had been prepared at a cost of £6,000, and we were told that, under the Constitution, it was necessary to cite only a few of the large employers, and that the common rule would apply in the case of all the other employers. The ruling of the court in that case was challenged by the employers, acting upon legal advice, and was upset. It was shown that there was no power under the Constitution to grant a common rule in industrial matters. That was 30 years ago, and ever since we have been trying to remedy the position. It is no exaggeration to say that hundreds of thousands uf pounds have been added to the cost of production because frequent litigation is necessary in order to determine whether awards apply to persons who are not members of organizations, or only to the parties cited in the proceedings. On many occasions we have consulted the present Attorney-General in regard to the matter, but the anomaly still remains. I have thought that, after the discussion of last week, the Government would have been a little more flexible, and -""ould be prepared to consider suggestions frorr. the Opposition. A situation has now arisen in which it is necessary to submit at the forthcoming referendum, not one quesLeader of the Opposition the people for coniplete Commonwealth",32,Constitutio N Alteration

The granting of such power would be of benefit to the whole community, and particularly to those engaged in industry. I again appeal to the Attorney-General to consider favourably the suggestion for the holding of an all-party conference to draft proposals for submission to the people. One of the valuable contributions to this discussion has just been made by the honourable member for Melbourne Port3 ( Mr Holloway). I strongly support his suggestion that representatives of the Gothat it would satisfy every present need. vernment and the Opposition should confer with a view to framing a common policy in regard to the issue to be submitted to the people. The Labour party, I understand, is in favour of the granting of powers to the Commonwealth in regard to marketing, and to that extent is in accord with the Government. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have advocated the inclusion of a request for complete Commonwealth industrial powers in proposals to bo submitted to the people, and on the platform in 1931, and since I have publicly proclaimed my opinion, which is in accord with the policy of the United Australia party enunciated in 1931. Tbe situation has been greatly altered by the recent High Court decision in regard to aviation. There is no reason why representatives of the Government and tbe Opposition should not now get together to frame a set of questions for submission to the people. I find myself in the same ment to the proposal of the Attorneyposition as the honourable member for General, and we should consider first, Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). I whether it is desirable in itself, and, am in favour of the proposal of the secondly whether it is politically practicLeader of the Opposition, but I have been able to give effect to it.

Nevertheless, I believe that, but one is driven to a realization of the even at this late hour, the Government fact that it would be impossible, at the should accept the offer of the Opposition present time, to secure for it an affirmafor a conference so that unanimity betive vote. I believe that honourable memtween all parties may be reached. I appeal bers opposite realize the truth of this to the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) just as well as I do myself.

It is recognized by all thinking people that it is intolerable that what should be the supreme parliament of the nation is circumscribed in its legislative action by a Constitution drawn up before many present-day electors were born. Even if it were possible so to revise the Constitution I have no doubt that it would again require revision before the lapse of 50 years. It would be impossible for even the wisest and most far-seeing persons so successfully to foresee the needs and developments of the nation as to frame a constitution that would never require revision. We are now concerned with the control of aviation, an activity which did not exist when the present Constitution was drawn up. The only satisfactory solution of the general problems will come when the constitutional relations between the Commonwealth and the States are reversed, and when the powers of the State governments are limited by a written constitution, and those of the national Parliament, outside the limits of those Constitutions are unlimited. That is the direction in which we should be working. We have before us a positive amendzens the reasons which should impel them",33,Constitutio N Alteration

I need say no more in regard to_ that than to draw attention to the division in regard to this matter in the ranks of the very party from which this amendment has emanated. The amendment has emanated from the Labour party. Speaking without acrimony, I point out that in this House the Labour party which, throughout its existence, has advocated greater powers for the Commonwealth, is confronted with, the situation that perhaps the most powerful forces that would be opposed to a substantial increase of the powers of the Commonwealth exist in States in which Labour governments are in office. I do not say this in order to chide the Labour party in any way; I merely state it as a fact, and as an example of the need for leadership in the carrying out of propaganda in respect of the principles involved. I shall not repeat views which I have reiterated previously, and conclude by requesting the Government that it should accede to the suggestion that has come from honourable members in all quarters of this chamber that the time is ripe for us to get together in a non-party spirit and endeavour to display to the people that degree of federal leadership that has been lacking for so long. [5.7] I cannot subscribe to the views mitted to the people at the approaching expressed by the honourable member for referendum. I am not one of those who be done to give the Commonwealth wider ment should give to any convention the powers because of disagreement which, responsibility of deciding what additional he says, exists between the various State governments in Australia. That contention is unfounded; we have not made any attempt to test public opinion in that direction for some time. For want of of any particular development of public opinion on these matters in recent years. We appear to be too much influenced by the knowledge of the existence of sections of people known as State-righters and .the belief that State governments generally are not inelined to surrender any of the powers which they now possess. This position could be tested if honourable members as a whole supported the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). Honourable members opposite say that they are in favour of granting wider powers generally to the Commonwealth, but there is always a string to their statements. Whenever they are given an opportunity to substantiate those views in this. House by their votes they take up the attitude that they cannot depart from the policy of their party which must, at all times, remain the paramount consideration. At the same time, however, they chide honourable members on this side with being tied by party decisions.

Eight or nine years have elapsed since the last referendum, giving ample time for a change in public opinion, which I believe has taken place. If the people were again given an opportunity to give a decision on these matters, I have no doubt that they would rise to the support of the Commonwealth Government, and give this Parliament powers to enable it to function properly as a national Parliament. I repeat that, if honourable members opposite, despite their previous expressions of opinion on this matter, cannot see their way clear to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition they should bring pressure to bear on their leaders to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that should meet at a conference to see how f a r we can get towards reaching agreement as to what issues should be submitted to the people. In any case, I have no doubt that an appeal to the people for trade and commerce and industrial powers for the Commonwealth Government would be successful, because the people now realize the difficulties under which the Commonwealth suffers owing to this lack of power. A t any rate, honourable members opposite now have an opportunity to test the people on this matter, and, as they declare inside the House that they are in favour of these powers being given to the Commonwealth, let thrm go outside and say it, and, above all, let them bring pressure to bear on their leaders to bring this matter to fruition.

In the United States of America a situation similar to that existing to-day in Australia has developed. In an ""article in the Reviexo of Reviews, Arthu r Pound advocates that the internal map of the United States of America should be redrawn, and offers many observations which apply to conditions in Australia, and of which we should take notice if we are to overcome our difficulties. He postulates that the Statesi n the United States of America are so weak that they cannot carry on as they exist to-day, and he urges that the country should be regionalized or sectionalized. Many of his views are applicable to Australia's position in this respect. He saysWliere can a balance be struck between centralization and decentralization, between the unmanageable vastness of America and the feebleness of statehood? Government already has given the lead all parties toward the correct answer; re-alignment of the nation along sectional lines. The Federal Reserve Act divides the nation into twelve districts, each under its own board, which adapts policy to sectional needs, in acknowledgment of the cold truth that finance cannot be fairly administered from a central .point. The army maintains nine corps areas. Some of the strongest labour unions operate on a district plan, notably the United Mine Workers.

Those problems arc too much for Washington; what suits one part of the country dues not suit another, and the resulting commotion is perilous. The fact that the several districts might try different solutions would be a prime advantage because one could learn from the experience of the other. Variety of social experience means progress. Uniformity over so vast a geographic -xpanse means stagnation. These are wise words by Arthur Pound. They apply to Australia and I ask all honourable members to heed them in a non-party spirit, and to delete the word * uniformity"" from parliamentary language in dealing with this matter. We have had an experience of centralization in regard to banking and monetary matters generally which has not been satisfactory. If we were to Bectionalize our continent as I have suggested, power would need to be given back to the regional authorities to .borrow money in accordance with their ability to pay, with the Commonwealth Government acting purely as consultant. This would do away with State spending sprees by another central authority not in step with regional requirements. ber may not discuss banking. that by way of illustration. Although the centralization of monetary procedure has proved unsatisfactory, the Labour party now seeks to centralize industrial authority. Both need sectionalizing because of the danger of the massive borrower, when pinched, tinkering with the currency and cheating the people. It seems to me, therefore, that there would be grave danger in centralizing industrial powers, just as there is grave danger in centralizing the borrowing power of the nation, which, in actual fact, enabled one Commonwealth Treasurer to attempt to tamper with our currency. able member must not pursue that line of argument. ization of industrial power would lead to serious troubles and retard secondary and primary development in our remote areas which cannot compete. Because of the section alize our industries, I cannot support the amendment. I do, however, regard favourably the action of the Attorney-General (Air. Menkes) in seeking leave to bring in a bill to control civil aviation. should have thought that the opportunity now presented to the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) to seek an adequate amplification of constitutional power for the Commonwealth, particularly in regard to industrial matters, would have been immediately grasped, for the honourable gentleman has led us to believe that he sympathizes with many honourable members on both sides of the chamber who desire an increase of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament over industry. The Attorney-General could now take effective action to give practical expression to his sympathy. At any rate, he should not contradict the words which he uttered on this subject very recently by an action which he is about to take. Aviation is an important subject, thou'"" 1 not necessarily or actually so important as some other subjects which this Parliament should consider in relation to the Constitution. I should have thought that the sudden action forced upon the Attorney-General by what may be called a I simply referred to bolt from the blue-if that is not an improper way to refer to a decision of the High Court-woul d have been gladly availed of to suggest other desirable alterations of the Constitution.

The object of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr they found themselves as the result of Curtin) in moving his amendment is really to enable that to be done. Of course, I desire to amplify the power of the national Parliament to a much greater extent than is foreshadowed in the amendment, hut, nevertheless, it covers a fairly wide field. A careful reading of the literature on the subject of trade and commerce, including the decisions of the High Court, would indicate that it, to a very large extent, embraces industrial matters and probably even aviation. The declaration by some honourable gentlemen opposite that they are ready to invest the Commonwealth Parliament with added power over industry is encouraging and inspiriting, and leaves room for the hope that eventually they will go the whole distance. Experience adds to knowledge, if not to ments working within the same geowisdom, and there is considerable siggraphical boundaries must inevitably nificance in our experience of the Concause disorders of one kind and another stitution, which now extends over more than 35 years.

But he had not proceeded very far before he found himself restrained by the cast-iron fetters of the constitution in respect of the very subjects which we are considering-industria l matters, trade and commerce, and aviation. The constitution of the United States of America is, of course, much older than our own and it is becoming increasingly difficult to alter it. This does not seem to offer much consolation to the people of Australia. Sooner or later, however, the force of circumstances will inevitably compel an alteration of the American constitution, and that is inevitable, also, in this country.

We can never know where we are so long as the representatives of the nation are held by purely arbitrary and technical bonds, which prevent them from doing the things that they wish to do for the welfare of the people. The dissatisfaction that exists is bound to express itself some day in an eruption. The name of Sir William Irvine has been mentioned in this debate. That learned gentleman expressed himself many years ago as being in favour of an extension of the industrial power of the Commonwealth. unification. able member for . Swan( Mr Gregory) doubts whether Sir William Irvine ought to be regarded as a constitutional authority; but T am sure that that lea ned gentleman would be very hurt to think that any one-harboured such a doubt in these days. It is not for me to say whether or not Sir William Irvine is a constitutional authority, but speaking on the subject in the long ago in connection with an assertion which had been made that the Australian Constitution was the weakest in the world, he saidI think that accounts very largely for the cuss that aspect any further at the fact that when the Convention was in doubt, the form of the American Constitution was in most cases followed. But the result, rightly or wrongly, was that in Australia we live tmder one of the weakest federal unions in the world. The honourable member for Swan sugsubstantial instalments.

There came a stage in his history, ing to this table with a proposal to alter however, when the subject of industrial powers was being discussed, and he declared, in effect, "" I am entirely in favour of this grant of power to the Commonwealth Parliament, but not to be exercised by the Government now in office"". That attitude is one of the serious obstacles in the way of constitutional reform, and is one of the weakest arguments against constitutional reform, because if one large section of the Australian public takes the There is not even any stand: "" No, we are not going to give this Government power to legislate ad lib in respect of trade and commerce; we believe in the exercise by the Commonwealth of powers in respect of trade, commerce and industry, but we do not desire that they shall be placed in the hands of this Government or that government "", such a state of mind is fatal to any proposal for the enlargement of Commonwealth powers. It reduces the matter of constitutional alteration to mere party bickering. The correct attitude, as I understand it, either in regard to these powers for which we are asking, or in regard to any other powers, is that such powers should be exercised by the government which is chosen by the people for the purpose of exercising them. Whatever goin favour of vernment may be in office, the people have chosen it, and the people must accept the responsibility for it. If they choose the wrong government, as I feel so certain they did quite recently, that is their misfortune, and they must bear it. v I have spoken so often both in this chamber and outside it upon the subject of the enlargement of the powers of the Commonwealth that I think that my views jejune and immature as they may be, should be understood by honourable members by this time. I should dearly love to see supremo powers vested in the National Parliament, but I shall not dismoment, although I think that it must be the final solution of this continuallygrowing evil which must sooner or later be cured.

That is no way in which to tinker with the Constitution. While I do not believe that the Constitution should be regarded as something sacrosanct, rigid as a statue, and unresponsive to the will of the people, at the same time, it should not be altered for slight cause, but list. only where urgently necessary, and on a large scale, and for great motives. I therefore submit that the Attorney General, who has uncovered his mind to honourable members on these matters from time to time and to myself on other occasions of a more private character, should get busy now with the great influence which he possesses in this Parliament with the United Australia party and with the easy run such as he will have with the Opposition, and do something really worthwhile with the Constitution. Surely there is no need for him to have fears in this regard. Does he not expect a further grant of power for himself, and those honourable and distinguished gentlemen who are associated with him? He surely does not believe that the Labour party is coming into office within a year or two! Such an event may be anticipated by some of us, but not by the Attorney-General. These proposed extended powers of the Commonwealth are safe in the able hands of these "" wise"" people who will be called upon to exercise them. Eveni f it should be otherwise, and the people in an unexpected exhibition of lack of wisdom should return the Labour party to office to exercise the new-found powers under the Constitution, there can only he one consequence if the people suffer thereby, and that will be that the Labour partu which will be responsible for the misuse of that new grant of power, will be speedily judged, convicted and sentenced by the electors, its masters. various reasons, some of which I have submitted, and others which I might easily submit in other circumstances, I ask the House to accept, in a burst of real patriotism, the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition and get on with these much-needed alterations of the Constitution for which the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Prederick Stewart), the honourable member for Watson( Mr Jennings), the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) and other ministerial supporters are pining and which the Attorney-General thinks that this Parliament should have. member should not include me in that the honourable member. I ask honourable members to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, support the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and I consider that the Government would be well advised in this connection to heed the voice of the Opposition members, who are apparently prepared to join with it in a round table conference in order to agree upon a proposal to widen Commonwealth powers, which would make the federation worthy of this great country. I regret an inclination on the part of a number of ministerial supporters to contend that only a minor amendment of the Constitution limited to the marketing issue should be submitted to the people at this juncture. That does not meet my idea of what should be the powers of a national Parliament. Por many years the Australian public have been promised that the powers of the Commonwealth would be widely extended, and in those circumstances I regret that it is proposed to submit only a request for a minor increase of power, which is not a credit to us, or to the electors. Before the bill passes the second reading the Government should give serious consideration to and accept not only the amendment, which' would be moved by the Leader of the Opposition, but also a further amendPor ment with a view to securing the approval of the Australian people for the abolition of -State Parliaments. The public of Australia are deeply disappointed that only a minor alteration of the Constitution is to be submitted to them at the referendum.

Meanwhile, although there have been several changes of government, no government has taken up the matter. One of the subjects upon which the commission submitted a recommendation was the very subject of aviation, with which we are now dealing. I candidly admit that I apprehend considerable difficulty in adopting the suggestion that there should be a "" get together"" movement of the parties in this House. That that is desirpolicy that I have laid down-the States able, I do not think that any honourable member will deny; but I find it very difficult to believe that unanimity would be reached on many points. I , nevertheless, add my voice to the voices of those who advocate the proposal. greater measure of success would be achieved if all parties could speak to instead of each party making different representations. commission was able to. reach certain unanimous conclusions, we also might achieve a sufficient degree of unanimity to age of rapid development in all branches enable us to submit to the people a proposal for Constitution alteration that would have fair prospects of success. A further suggestion made this afternoon, I think by the honourable member for Bourke, was for a constitution convention. At different times, some honourable members have given consideration to such a proposal. I was connected with the movement in New South Wales that aimed at the establishment of additional telf-governing units within the Commonwealth, under a definitely limited constitution, the residual power being reserved to the federal body. The different conventions that were held considered the advisability of a constitution convention. How such a convention would be set up, and what would be the nature and the method of choosing its personnel, were not elaborated by the honourable member for Bourke. These factors would demand the most serious consideration, because the action taken in regard to them would largely determine the nature of the results likely t« hf achieved. It has benn argued that this Parliament is the best constitution convention that could be convened. Its members are the elected representatives of the people, and they represent all shades of political opinion in the community as well as all ckates and every part of each State. The argument advanced against that is, that it would be circumscribed. The honourable member for Bourke expressed the view, but gave no reason for it, that no member of Parliament should take part in a constitution convention. The suggestion is worthy of consideration, because such a body might produce something approaching to the lines of having the defined powers, and the Commonwealth the residual powers. I have not that great respect for the Constitution or its framers that is usually expressed, more in the nature of A much lip service. My view is aptly summed up in the statement made by Mussolini a week or two weeks ago-""D o not let us the people with one voice, embalm the past, but anticipate the future "". That sentiment is well worthy As the royal of consideration in dealing with constitutional questions. Australia is a young and growing country. We live in an of science and industry. We must not hold fast to anything merely because it has served a purpose for a given number of years. What is moth-eaten or destroyed by rust must be discarded.

Consequently, we cannot afford to adopt some dilatory proceeding, which may produce an admirable document in the long run, but will not chime in, in point of time, with the referendum to which this House at least is already committed. need not be a substitute for the bill. gestion for a conference will, of course, be considered by the Government. May I remind the House that the immediate point with which we arc concerned is whether the order of leave that I have sought should be varied by extending it to cover a number of other matters, including, in particular, industrial matters and trade and commerce. I shall not occupy the time of the House in reiterating arguments that I have already used within the last fortnight. The whole of this matter, in one fashion or another, has been debated in this House within the last week or two. For the reasons then advanced on behalf of the Government, it is unable to accept the proposal that there should be put to the people at this time proposals There is however one other observation I should like to make because it is of some point in connection with the amendment. The motion I submitted wasThatI have leave to bring in a bill for an aet to alter the Constitution with respect to atr navigation and aircraft. The amendment moved by the Leader of tbe Opposition is as follows:That after the word ""aircraft"" the words **, trade and commerce, industrial matters, broadcasting and television "" be added. Therefore, if the amendment is carried, leave will be given to bring in a bill to deal with all those matters, and if the bill he passed, those matters would be submitted as one question to the people of Australia. The wise practice of all governments in this Parliament has been, when seeking the agreement of the people to proposed Constitution alterations, to place different matters in different bills, so that the people may have a fair chance to consider them as individual proposals. It would be an affront to the people tc put before them one question, to which they were invited to say "" Yes"" or "" No "", dealing with aviation, broadcasting, trade and commerce, and industrial powers. objection which the Attorney-General ha* to the amendment? member had listened to me with his usual the conference courtesy, he would have heard me sav that my other objections to the proposal are still the same as those which I stated a fortnight ago. The objection I now 6tate is an additional one. tunity the Opposition has to obtain an expression of opinion, and if the amendment were agreed to it would be competent for the Government to withdraw the bill, and bring down three other bills. motion hostile to the Government be carried, it is always competent for the Government to""withdraw its proposal and submit something else. If this amendment were agreed to it would be competent for Parliament, within the order of reference so approved, to put into the bill a reference to every subject mentioned in the amendment, and then all those matters would be submitted to the of the nature suggested. people in the one question. That is an intolerable suggestion, and could not possibly be agreed to. Thereforej for all the reasons which I gave a fortnight ago, and for the additional reason now stated, I cannot accept the amendment. AttorneyjGeneral( Mr Menzies) has said that hi3 objections to the present amendment are the same as those which he stated a fortnight ago when speaking on the Constitution Alteration (Marketing) Bill. I remind him, however, that, on that occasion, he objected to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) because it would confuse the issue to submit to the peopie more than one question at a time. Now, he himself proposes to submit two questions. The honourable gentleman is very far from consistent in his argument. Every member supporting the Govern-",43,Constitutio N Alteration

115,Mr Garden (Cook) [6.10],"Th omont, when speaking on the other bill, echoed the words of tiie Attorney-General to the extent of saying that it would be bad policy to confuse the issue by introducing extraneous matters, but now they have all to swallow their words, because of the recent judgment of the High Court in regard to aviation. The Leader of the Opposition was criticized a fortnight ago because his amendment was not definite. Now he has made it definite enough for every one, and it is for the House to say whether or not it approves of it. The Attorney-General knows that an amendment of this kind cannot be submitted once the second-reading stage of the bill is passed. The honourable member for Swan( Mr States. Gregory) opposed the amendment on the ground that he does not believe in any change whatsoever, yet only two days ago I heard bim singing lustily "" Change and decay in all around I see"". He also asked for light then, but now that it has been vouchsafed to him he declares that he does not believe that there should be any change. He is still living in the past, and is prepared to stay there; He believes that what was good enough for his father is good enough for him. Then we have the honourable member for Echuca( Mr complicate the questions to be submitted McEwen), who says that he believes in giving absolute power to tbe Commonwealth, but-and every time he speaks on this subject he introduces that word ""but"". We have now learned to wait for it. He wants to show how progressive he is in his ideas "", but, he says, "" the time is not opportune "", "" there are difficulties in the way"", and so on. Actually, of course, he does not desire a change any more than does the honourable member for Swan.

If he votes in accordance with his word's, I shall be hap; to admit that I have been mistaken in him. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) said that Australia should be divided into a greater number of administrative units, but how is that to be done without the authority of a central government which would delegate to those units the powers which they are to exercise? I believe in the division of the existing States into provinces, but it is first necessary to have one central, supreme government. As things are now, the Commonwealth Government has to bow the knee every time there is a clash of Commonwealth, and State powers, because the residual powers belong to the to trust the honourable member's paTty. never been given the opportunity to state in explicit terms their opinion on the issue. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to8 p.m. vernment's proposal to ask the people for marketing powers for the Commonwealth the Attorney-General emphasized that the introduction of any other issue would to the people. He saidThe Government agrees that this question of industrial powers must be dealt with, but at the rieht time, when it will not prejudice, or be prejudiced by, the marketing proposal, and when there will be no mutual prejudice exerted by one proposal against another. ber is not in order in quoting from an earlier debate in the current session. statement made by the Attorney-General this afternoon, when he was reminded that previously he had said that one issue, and one issue only, should be placed before the people. His statements this afternoon are not in haimony with his previous remarks on this matter. Honourable members on this side of the House urge the Government to include the issue of industrial powers in the proposal to be submitted to the people.

The proposal which the Attorney-General puts before the House now is a step in that direction, but the argument which he used to-day contradicts his previous argument. man said previously that one issue, and one issue only, must he placed before the people. He proposes now to submit two issues. orable member should read my speech. gentleman's speech. He said that these issues must be taken one at a time; marketing first of all should be dealt with and then, as opportunity offered^ other issues could be placed before the people. The honourable gentleman says that he believes that wider industrial powers should be given to the Commonwealth, but when the opportunity now presents itself to introduce a bill to enable this issue proposals submitted would be carried. to be, placed before the people he dares not trust the people to say whether the Commonwealth should be given those powers. I have no-doubt that the people believe that sueh powers should be given to the Commonwealth; in fact, I am certain that, if given the opportunity, they would vote out of existence the six State Parliaments and bo content to have the destinies of this country controlled solely by the national Parliament. Why will not the Government give the people an opportunity to give their verdict on these issues? They have been appealing for that opportunity for many years and now, once again, it is to be denied to them. The voting on the proposal for wider industrial powers for the Commonwealth submitted in the referendum held in 1913 was 961,000 for and 987,000 against, the proposal being defeated by a small ma jority of 90,000. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has suggested that the Government should t-all a round-table conference of all parties to decide what issues should be submitted iu the referendum so that this Parliament could approach the people with a united voice. That suggestion has been supported by the honourable members for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), Watson (. Mr Jennings), and Barton( Mr Lane), and if it were given effect to surely members of all parties in this chamber, by presenting a united front to the people, could wipe out the small majority by which a similar proposal was defeated in the referendum of 1913. In that event the farmers would have all their desires fulfilled and the industrial movement would be enabled to bring to a conclusion the fight which it has waged for years to obtain for the workers their rights as citizens of this country. I cannot see, therefore, why the Attorney-General refuses this request for a round table conference. On the other hand he expects honourable members of all parties to support the proposals he has placed before this House. I suggest that he should call together the leaders of all parties to thrash out their differences with a view to presenting a united front to the people so that no substantial section of the community would oppose the issues to be put before them in the referendum. In those circumstances I have no doubt that the I believe that residual powers in all matters should rest with the Commonwealth. This Parliament would then be enabled to delegate to local governing bodies powers necessary for the better control of individual districts. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) has advocated such a proposal in respect of the district which he represents in this House. I support his suggestion and I believe that it should be applied right throughout Australia. desires to see full industrial powers concentrated in the Commonwealth Government and is, himself, inconsistent in his argument. rest with some central authority.

Possibly the honourable gentleman in the course of his travels overseas visited Selkirk and Brig of Ayr, near the home of the Scottish poet who said: "" Pacts are chiels that winna ding.""

They believe that sovereign power should be vested in the State parliaments to legislate on certain subjects, and it is most unlikely that they will be easily moved from their convictions. Only by a thorough campaign of education are the people likely to agree to vest additional power in the Commonwealth Parliament. Violent changes are not likely to be made. Our best policy, therefore, is to seek, by a persistent educational process, to persuade the people that they must, in their own interests, give additional authority to the national Parliament. All honourable members of this Parliament knew before they took their seats here, that the power of the in many directions. Our constitutional history during the last 35 years reveals Certain honourable gentlemen opposite I The honourable member for Swan( Mr has already decided that the CommonGregory) suggested in his speech that the Constitution should not be altered in any respect, but the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) said that we should not be bound by the dead hand of the past. I agree with that view. framers of the Commonwealth Constitution laid the foundation of our legislative authority, but they must have realized that time would make changes both necessary and inevitable. not, for example, have foreseen the invention of broadcasting and television, or the development of aviation; nor could they have guessed at the complications that would arise in the marketing of our produce owing to economic developments overseas. They sought to lay down the broad basis of government, and we must resign ourselves to the view that any alteration of this basis can be made only by careful and well considered action. But while we cannot expect the people to agree to a proposal to scrap the Constitution, we may reasonably anticipate that they will agree to such alterations of it as become necessary from time to time. As the Attorney-General has suggested, we now hold. Therefore, that second it is a case of what we can get and point is another reason why I cannot not what we want. .Strong interests in support the amendment which has been this country will seek to preserve existing moved by the Leader of the Opposition. State rights. AlthoughI have advocated in this House on different occasions the granting of greater industrial powers to the Commonwealth, I have no hesitation in saying that the time is not ripe for the seeking of such powers. When the time becomes opportune, I shall be prepared to advocate with honourable gentlemen oppopresent time. site the vesting of complete industrial power in the Commonwealth. I am by nature and conviction a uniassurance which was given a few weeks ficationist, but for three reasons I canago by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), not support the amendment. The first of when speaking upon the Constitution Althese is that if it were agreed to, it would teration (Marketing) Bill, that when the be ineffective. It is so comprehensive time is opportune, he will introduce a that if constitution alterations based proposal to obtain increased industrial upon it were submitted to the people for powers for the Commonwealth. For an their endorsement, an immense conflict alteration of the, Constitution to be of interests would arise, and one proposal successful, harmonious conditions must would, in my opinion, kill the other, and prevail in the States themselves. It is the whole procedure would be abortive. The second reason why I cannot supfrom the States through a referendum port the amendment is that, although it if we know perfectly well that conditions refers to broadcasting) the High Court in the States do hot point to success. wealth Parliament has power over broadcastiug. In those circumstances it would be absurd for us to ask the people to give us such power. In this connection I direct the attention of honourable memThe bers to the judgment of the High Court in the case, The King v. Brislan, delivered in December last, in which it is held that section 51 of the Constitution confers upon the Commonwealth Parliament They could power to legislate on radio and broadcasting. subject of an appeal. Mr E. J. HARRISON I am not aware of that; but even if it were so we must assume that the judgment is sound until it is upset. If we acknowledged weakness in that . regard by including the term "" broadcasting "" in the referendum, we should be simply courting a succession of legal actions. Until it is proved conclusively, and a judgment has been entered against the Commonwealth Government that it has no power in that connection, we should seek to maintain that which we believe The third point that brings me to a rejection of the honourable gentleman's amendment is that the increase of industrial powers, with which I am in complete accord Mr E.

136,Mr Drakeford,"But not at theAlthoughI have personal feelings in regard to the marketing proposal, I was prepared to make them subservient to the needs of the Commonwealth, and I , therefore, supported the Prime Minister in that regard, but I would appeal to the House upon another point. Would honourable members representing Queensland be prepared to advocate against the whole battery of the government of that State to-day, the granting of increased industrial powers of the Commonwealth, when the award rates of that State are 10s. a week higher than those provided for in federal awards? In view of those circumstances, could those honourable members confidently assure the Leader of the Opposition that a majority of citizens of Queensland would vote for a proposal for increased industrial powers for the Commonwealth. When the position is studied from, that view-point, the When the time is propitious and absolute absurdity of it is revealed. I notice that honourable members of the Opposition are now silent, because they know that it would be impossible to obtain an affirmative vote in this connection from the people of Queensland. On a number of occasions the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) has pointed out that, in view of the circumstances to which I have referred it would be impossible to persuade Queensland to consent to grant increased industrial powers to the Commonwealth. A similar position prevails in Western Australia, where the State awards are 4s. higher than the federal awards. With all the political capital that could be made by the State Government against a proposal to increase the powers of the Commonwealth, and with the feeling which recently led to an attempt to gain secesof the chamber occupy in regard to this sion, would it be possible to obtain a majority in Western Australia in favour of such a proposal? In South Australia the margin between State and Federal awards is so close that they are practically equal; but there again, the feelings in that State against the Commonwealth are so great as to preclude any possibility every conceivable occasion on which they of a favorable decision to grant this Parhave addressed electors that they support liament an increase of industrial powers. The small island State of Tasmania is jealous of its rights and fearfvil that the gency for submitting to the people a Commonwealth might seek to increase its industrial powers. Mr ,T.

HARRISON -The honourable member for Denison would probably resist any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to assume increased industrial powers. the Commonwealth to take those powers. Mr E. J. HARRISON I am afraid that the honourable member is all sound and fury. It is all very well for him to sit in Opposition and interject and make grimaces across the chamber, but when the testing time came, I know on which side he would range himself. Because of the three factors which I have set out I shall not, and cannot, support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. conditions in the States are favorable, I shall support a proposal which has for its objective an increase of industrial powers for the Commonwealth, but I look to the good sense of the Prime Minister to choose the right moment to make a successful appeal to the people in this connection. I emphasize the three reasons why I am unable to support the amendment. AlthoughI have certain personal feelings in this connection, I am prepared to make them subservient to the necessities of the moment and await a propitious time for submitting to the peoplo a proposal to give to the Commonwealth added powers. feel a profound sense of disappointment at the most untenable position that honourable gentlemen on the ministerial side matter. If ever there was a demonstration of the game of hide-and-seek with political principles, surely we have the evidence of it to-day. Honourable gentlemen opposite like the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) have declared from public platforms on the principle of increased powers for the Commonwealth, and recognize the urreferendum to bring about that desirable objective. Yet when opportunity makes",49,Constitutio N Alteration

I am losing faith in some of the honourable gentlemen who I believed had a spark ot principle in them. Unfortunaie^y, they fail to realize their obligalater stage I shall remind the honourable tions to those electors to whom they made such definite declarations of principle, i'heir behaviour earns my utmost contempt as 1 am sure it will rightly earn the contempt of the electorates they represent. Honourable members of the Labour party desire in all earnestness and sincerity to give ministerial supporters the opportunity to present to the country proposals which have a reasonable chance of being carried by the people, and in this connection we have desired to co-operate with the Government and have afforded a genuine gesture of helpfulness with a view to assisting it to secure essential powers which are urgently required to enable this Parliament to function effectively as a national deliberative assembly. .But while honourable gentlemen opposite have indicated their belief tliat the need exists for obtaining additional, powers for the Commonwealth in respect of trade and commerce, and industry, instead of agreeing to submit a proposal to the people to grant such necessary power to the Commonwealth, they constantly excuse themselves by stating that the time is not opportune to do so. When in the name of all that is right will the time arrive to correct weaknesses of the Constitution? Mr E. J. the Scullin Government when it was in olfico introduce a bill for a referendum to give the Commonwealth such powers? ment did formulate proposals for submission to tbe people. If the honourable gentleman knew the history of this Parliament he would realize that every effort which we are making at the present time to obtain increased powers for the Comwealth is consistent with past attempts -of Labour governments to secure those powers. The record of the Labour party will stand any investigation that the honourable gentleman may desire to make in regard to the securing of increased powers to the Commonwealth. I challenge him to study that record and, during the course of this debate, to be prepared to reveal one instance of where this party has proved inconsistent in regard to its attitude on such matters. At a c gentleman of my challenge. I am ui'raid that he will find himself hard pressed because he has taken a certain course of action which he knows is not in accordance with the professions of faith which he made to hi3 constituents. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has been put forward with the desire to learn how far members of the Opposition can walk along the road with ministerial supporters in advocating the granting of wider powers to the Commonwealth. I emphasize that the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition cannot on this amendment have legislative effect in regard to these added powers, but is intended to give honourable members an opportunity within the scope of this discussion to make a full survey of the position in order to ascertain how far it is possible for the opinions of ministerial supporters to be reconciled with those of the Opposition upon such an important matter. Honourable members opposite seem to be courting defeat and to be bargaining for it. From their demeanour, one gathers that it is their desire to sec proposals, with which they are in accord, rejected by the people. I was gratified to hear the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) this afternoon express an opinion which matter. ' I give him full credit for having declared so definitely the belief that he holds in this particular matter. If many of his colleagues had. been equally consistent, they, too, could have rejoiced at having given evidence of good faith. The argument advanced by the honourable member for Wentworth is untenable. He sought to hide behind the rather clever but nevertheless unconvincing argument advanced by the distinguished gentleman ( Mr Menzio3) who occupies the office of Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, who this afternoon submitted that one of his objections to the amendment was that its acceptance",50,Constitutio N Alteration
140,Mr Makin,"The Scullin Governwould mean, the incorporation in the one bill of the additional subjects proposed for submission to the people, and that this would cause confusion in the public mind. The honourable gentleman knows full well that he is, only begging the question, and that once this House had determined the nature and extent of the proposals to be submitted, he could deal with the situation legislatively in a way that would present no difficulty. His process of reasoning seems to be characteristic of those who hold a distinguished position in the legal world. He would do well to afford an opportunity to review the matters contained, in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Wentworth has claimed that it would be the height of absurdity to submit to the peopTe a proposal in relation to broadcasting, because of some decision that has been given by the High Court. I point out to him that that particular judgment is to be the subject of further litigation. I understand that it is to be taken to the Privy Council by way of appeal. But even excluding that consideration, it is quite conceivable and probable that when in the course of time the composition of the High Court Bench is altered, the judgment may be reversed, as other judgments have been. reason why we should not. make it positive that these powers reside in the Commonwealth? the Government I cannot describe better than by using the words of the Leader of the Opposition, that the Government is losing a golden opportunity so to reconcile and harmonize the opinions of honourable members of this House that we may present a united case to the country, and, discarding sectionalism, seek to obtain the many powers that are essential to the proper discharge of public functions in the true national sense. The country would do well to take notice of the pathetic and lamentable exhibition that has been given by ministerial members in an attempt to evade their obligations. Their attitude on this measure will not enhance the reputation of the Government. The Opposition has made a genuine gesture, and it is a thousand pities that tbe Government fails to realize how favorable is the opportunity to Mr Jlfafctn. obtain the fulfilment of the promise made to the people that there would be every endeavour to obtain the powers that are essential if the Commonwealth, is to legislate effectively in the interests of the whole of the community.

A public meeting was held which the council, representative of the people of Norfolk Island, advised him by resolution that he was mistaken, and tliat, in fact, there had been no such attempt. Petitions to the Government from the islanders have been of no avail; every appeal has been ignored. Even the petition addressed to tbe Governor General, asking him to interest himself in the grievances of the people of Norfolk Island, has either disappeared or been pigeon-holed since it left Norfolk Island. petition presented? partment of External Affairs. The Administrator, however, not content to let matters rest as they were, went a little further, and exceeded the bounds of the law. In May, 1934, he anticipated the gazettal of an ordinance framed for the purpose of dealing with the gentleman who was at that time president of the Advisory Council, Mr Nobbs. Apparently ne knew what was in the ordinance before it was gazetted and, in fact, acted on the power to b* given to him under it. Mussolinilike, he went along to the Advisory Council and was successful in getting sufficient support among its members to depose the president. He himself took the position and held it for some months. Legal action was taken by the deposed president, and Mr Justice Ooyle was sent to Norfolk Island to adjudicate in the matter. He found in favour of the deposed chairman. In delivering judgment, His Honour saidTn giving my docision T regret that the peace Council to himself. of the island is in such a troubled state. 1 find that the Administrator was not in order in calling the special meeting of May 19, which mooting the president had the right to call. Therefore, the meeting was irregular. I find that that meeting was called and a resolution passed whereby plaintiff was removed from office. It purports to be pawed by an ordinance setting out thai the president shall he doorivpd of office by a vote of at least twowas a constant critic of the administrathirds. The vote at that irregular meeting was invalid accord inc to law which could have no force on this island. I have no hesitation in saying that at tbe time that it was done it had cert:rinly not been published, and. the inference thereof was that any action purporting to be done under that ordinance was of no effect, and removal was not in form. So that the removal of Mr Nobbs from the. presidency was not correct. Apparently when he fouud that the council would not dance to the tune he called, the Administrator took action against its members. Yet, despite the repeated protests that have been made against the administration of this gentleman, the Government has extended his term of office for a further twelve months. In March, 1935, as a result of the turmoil that existed, Senator Sir George Pearce was sent to Norfolk Island to see what was wrong. The Norfolk Island Act was amended in April, 1935, and an elective council was set up. In June, 1935, a further ordinance was promulgated, giving the Minister power to set up ward boundaries. It is quite probable that the boundaries of the wards were decided on the advice of the Administrator, but whoever was responsible for the sub-division, was also responsible for the fact that of the eight councillors, four represent 70 per cent., and the other four 30 per cent, of the population. Honourable members will recall that when the bill amending the Norfolk' Island Act was piloted through this chamber by the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes), the right honourable gentleman said that it would usher in a new era in the history of Norfolk Island. I should like to know who is responsible for gerrymandering the wards established under the new ordinance. One of the first actions of tbe Administrator, following the election of the new council, was to demand implicit obedience from its members. When he could not control the council, he induced the Commonwealth Government to frame an ordinance transferring the control of the works department from the Advisory But there was one other thing he was unable to . control, namely, the press. There was in existence on the island a roneoed newspaper with a circulation of about 350 copies. This organ tion, with the result that the Administrator came to the conclusion that it would have to be controlled.

This is, indeed, a very broad definition of defamatory matter. The Administrator had already attempted to nobble the Advisory Council, and when unable to do that, had had the control of public works vested in himself so that he would have all the political patronage to hand out to his supporters. Then, finding the press critical of his activities, he induced the Government to draft an ordinance making it a crime to criticize the administration, or to hold any one, including the Administrator, up to ridicule, or to cause people to despise .him, whether the imputations were expressed directly, by insinuation, or by irony. No doubt, if the newspaper had suddenly reversed its critical policy, and had said that the Administrator was the best that had ever been on the island, it would still be liable to prosecution on the ground that it was criticizing the administration by irony. As the result of this ordinance, the only newspaper on the island went out of existence, and since that time there has been no manifest criticism of the Administrator, except at public meetings. On several occasions I raised the subject of the newspaper ordinance in this House. A public meeting on the island passed a resolution requesting the Government to withdraw the ordinance, as also did the Advisory Council. Finally, the Government took action, but it did so by promulgating another ordinance in which power was given to the Administrator himself or any person acting on his authority to publish a pamphlet which from any of obligations imposed on any one else who controlled a newspaper. Thus, while the Administrator was, by ordinance, freed from newspaper criticism, he was himself empowered to publish a newspaper, or to authorize the publication of one, in which he might criticize any one or every one and eulogize his own administration to his heart's content. Some time ago, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr. R. Green) referred in this House to the tyrannical manner in which the Administrator for Norfolk Island had deported New South Wales. At the time the House was given, hy the Prime Minister, certain information in reply to the statement of the honourable member for Richmond. I do not suggest that the statement was prepared by the Prime Minister himself, but I have conclusive proof that the things alleged in extenuation of the action of the Administrator were in some instances, only half true, and in others less than half true. ister read on that occasion was drafted by the Administrator himself. believe the honourable member. Although at the time. I was not inclined to support him in the stand he had taken, what I have heard since fro m responsible residents of the island has convinced me that more than 50 per cent, of what the Prime Minister said on that occasion was false. Resolutions hostile to the Administrator have been carried at public meetings, and by the Advisory Council which represents the residents of the island. Here is a resolution carried by the council on the Sth January, 1936, at a meeting at which four councillors voted, for the motion, three voted against it , and one abstained from voting 1 That the present administration of Norfolk Island has been chiefly marked by an alarming amount of unrest, discontent, and lack of confidence in the Administration's integrity and efficiency.

147,Mr Rosevear,"I am prepared tomuni cation of the 25th October, 1935, to the President of the Council. The Council respectfully asks the Minister's attention to the pledges given in Parliament by the Government to provide a larger measure of self-government for the people of the island, and to give them a much greater share in the management of their own all'airs (Debate on Norfolk Island Bill 1935-4t h April, 1935). The measures foreshadowed in the Minister's letter would appear to be reactionary and repressive, and, with the enactment of the S roposed Public Works Ordinance 1935, would eprive the people of important rights and privileges inherent in the Constitution since 165G. It would appear to be the Minister's intention to entirely disregard the wishes and requirements of the residents, transmitted through this Council, and to enact measures that would absolutely deprive them of such control in the management of their own affairs as they have held hitherto. The proposed Public Works Ordinance 1935 provides no machinery for investigation of alleged injustices that may occur, and removes any constitutional check on arbitrary, inefficient, or discriminatory management. The Council earnestly and respectfully submits that for the welfare of the residents, its representations should receive a further sympathetic consideration from the Minister, since they were submitted only after a careful study of the requirements and wishes of the residents, and the promises of tlie Government. The following resolution was carried unfriends. [Leave to continue given.""] I animously at a meeting of the Norfolk am concerned that, after having disposed Island Residents Association on the 24th of that company, and being instrumental July, 1936 :That the people of Norfolk Island hear with should have been allowed to escape disgust and abhorrence of the extension of the criticism by the promulgation of an appointment of the present Administrator for ordinance, obviously inspired by him, to still another twelve months. Tliat as an Administrator they consider him control newspapers published on the a complete failure, and that the extension of island. I condemn the Government for his apix)intinent is a direct insult to the people having accepted a further recommendaof this island, and a disgrace to tlie people of tion of the Administrator to promulgate Australia. I am also directed to hand you herewith copy another ordinance exempting from the of the Advisory Council's majority resolution previous ordinance any pamphlet or newson the proposed amendments to the Printers paper issued by the Administrator or any and Newspapers Ordinance, which have been cne under his charge. If it is good already sent to yoiu With many thanks for your friendship and enough for the Administrator, or any one interest in the people of the island. Here is a further resolution carried by the pamphlets or newspapers praising his Advisory CouncilThat this meeting repeats previous protests that a newspaper established on the island against the continuation in office of the premany years ago, and conducted to the sent Administrator and Secretary-Collector of satisfaction of the residents, should he Customs, especially as recent court proceedings and continued complaints from the public reentitled to criticize the administration. flect the injustice and incompetency of the In view of the known hostility of the present administration, and the lack of conmajority of the residents of the island to fidence it inspires in the community. Other resolutions in the same terms have that that gentleman has sought to browbeen carried from time to time by the beat the council which the Government Advisory Council, which was set up by set up, there must have been sufficient Mr Rosevear. this Government to assist in the administration of Norfolk Island. When that council, which is elected by the people, arrives at a decision, it should be beyond the power of the Administrator to resist it. There is not the slightest doubt that, ever since the present Administrator has been in control of Norfolk Island he has been sheltered by officialdom in Canberra. I am concerned with the fact that the Government set up a council to control the affairsof the island, and that an administrator, not elected by the people, should be allowed at its first meeting to warn the council that he expected from it implicit obedience, and that, when he was not able to obtain this obedience, he should be permitted to have an ordinance promulgated transferring to his own hands control of the public works policy of the island. I am concerned that an organization known as the Norfolk Island Boating Company, which has been in the hands of original residents of the island and their descendants for over 80 years, should be despoiled by a vindictive administrator in order to assist his in organizing another, the Administrator acting for him, to have the right to issue own administration, it is good enough the Administrator, and also of the fact evidence in the hands of the Government to cause it to doubt the wisdom of extending his term of office. I ask that the long-standing grievances of the residents of Norfolk Island, who are separated by many hundreds of miles of sea from the seat of government in Australia, be dealt with by the Government. It would appear that every action of the Advisory Council can be frustrated by action taken in Canberra. I ask that the Government cause an inquiry to be made into Norfolk Island affairs. I do not ask that action be taken merely on what I have said to-night-although , apparently, the Government is prepared to act on the statement of the Administrator, in spite of advice to the contrary by the Advisory Council and well-known residents-bu t I do ask for an independent inquiry into the whole administration of the island. There can be no doubt that grave discontent exists there. Apparently the Minister for External Affairs (Senator Pearce), who visited Norfolk Island in 1935, reported on his return that the residents were discontented. That discontent was reflected in the speech of the Minister who introduced into this chamber the Norfolk IslandB ill . That the Government was prepared to alter the constitution of the council was evidence that it believed that things were not proceeding smoothly on the island. It set up a new authority when it appointed tbe Advisory Council. Having set it up, the Government should give consideration to its views. When the Administrator smashed the boating company, the views of the Advisory Council should have been given consideration. Again, when the people of the island publicly protested against the newspaper ordinance, and the Advisory Council unanimously recommended its withdrawal, the Government should have heeded these representations. Obviously, the Administrator is not suitable for his position, but is a constant source of annoyance to the residents of the island. I hope that the Government will not treat this matter lightly, but w ill do something to curb the dictatorial administration of the person in charge of Norfolk Island. Minister receives a copy of the honourable member's speech. [9.3'7] I commend the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) for his interest in one of the outlying territories under the control of the Commonwealth. He has shown in no uncertain way that bureaucratic rule exists in Norfolk Island. It exists also in the Northern Territory; but although I have advocated self-government for the Northern Terri tory, I do not propose to address the committee on that subject now. I am pleased that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) intends that next year a committee of three persons shall visit the Northern Territory, and that one of its number-should remain there to work out a plan in the f r a m in g of which he has taken an active part. In the circumstances, I am content to refrai n from again advocating immediate self-government for the Northern Territory along the lines of a legislative council, such as exists in New Guinea. I hope, however, that the Minister w ill keep before h i m the ideal of self-government for the Northern Territory which, if granted, would relieve him of the responsibility for the administration of the domestic policy of that portion of the Commonwealth. We already have competent officials^ capable of relieving the Minister of this responsibility if they were only given greater authority in conjunction with residents of the Territory elected as a legislative council. The Estimates provide a sum of £1,160 in respect of educational services and scholarships for the Northern Territory. There is a dearth of facilities at Darwin for the secondary education of the children and the Government should subsidize the school that is struggling to establish itself there. Those who pass through the primary school and desire to continue their studies must pursue them elsewhere. Usually, such children attend secondary schools at Charters Towers or Southport in Queensland. Two scholarships are provided for Northern Terri tory children, but the parents of children who f a i l to secure scholarships are involved in heavy expense if they wish them to receive a higher education. Many of in charge of Territories them cannot afford to do so, and consequently their children have to seek employment locally. The position is set out",55,Common Wealth

In a letter to me the father saidWe are sending our boy on the boat tomorrow to attend All Souls school at Charters Towers. To do this it is to cost me £15 for his fare -to Townsville. Fancy payiug £15 for a five days' trip-£ 3 per day. And at the annual holidays, if we wish to have him home for a few weeks, it will cost me an extra £27 for the return fare. It is true that the passengers got something for their £3 per day, but it is daylight robbery to charge £3 per day for school children. You must realize that there is no high school in Darwin, and after a boy has done his term in the seventh grade, he has either to go south for further education, or look for a job at the age of about thirteen, or continue in tlfe same class for another term in tlie hope of winning a scholarship. The letter proceedsIt is not fair to ask the boy to do anothei twelve months in the same class in the hope of winning a scholarship, for which Tie would be a certainty, neither would it be.fair to the other children . . . I consider that if a boy cannot win a scholarship in his first year ho should, if circumstances permit, be sent south for further education, and give the rising boys a chance. I am not a millionaire. In Queensland, if a boy gets a pass in a scholarship, he is allowed £.10 a year to further his education, but in Darwin under the Commonwealth, if he gets a pass, and is unsuccessful in winning a scholarship, he gets nothing. If the Queensland Government can hand out £.10 to each one that passes, why not the Commonwealth? I ask the Minister to look into this matter with a view to giving to the children of the Northern Territory chances similar to those available to children in Queensland. I believe that he w ill be sympathetic with my request. I am amazed to find that the police in the Northern both the Northern Territory Public Service Ordinance and the Police and Police Offences Ordinance. Territory, that mentioned by the honourable member for Island, exists. charged under section 10 of the Police and Police officer is not entitled to a right of appeal. The Administrator judge; and as he is also the board of appeal, he is, as it were, the Lord High Executioner Commonwealth Jfr. Blain. are on an entirely different footing. They have a right of appeal, their cases are heard in public, and they are entitled to legal representation. Those provisions might well be extended to the police of the Northern Territory. A separate police ordinance is needed. I suggest that the Minister could simp l if y this matter and take these police officers into his confidence, and put them under a scheme similar to that which applies to the police force of the Federal Capital Territory. The police of the Northern Territory should be organized on a proper basis. To-day, they are governed by two laws. Provision should be made to give to them rights of appeal. If they are charged under section 10 of the Police and Police Offences Ordinances, they have no right of appeal. I urge the Minister to give them a f a i r deal. Under another regulation under the Public Service Ordinance 1928-1934, which bears the signature of the then Acting Minister, the Assistant Minister( MrH u n t e r ) , the status of "" mounted constable "" has been abolished. The force as a whole in the Northern Territory is highly regarded by residents in that area. It includes many remarkable men. I am amazed that any action would be taken to reduce the status of members of this force. Men who were previously designated as "" mounted constables"" have been reduced to the status of "" constable "". At the same time, under regulation 56 of the Public Service Regulations, the status of "" inspector"" has been raised to that of ""superintendent"". I hardly think that, in view of his own promotion, a superinTerritory are subject to tendent would, of his own volition, reduce the status of officers under him. I am amazed that such action has been taken. In the Northern Thus, the conflict of authority, resulting bureaucratic rule similar to from the application of the Public Service Regulations in some instances, and Dalley, in respect of Norfolk the Police and Police Offences OrdiIf a police officer is nances in others, is apparent. A f a i r deal should be given to this police force in Offences Ordinance, that order that it may be freed of dissension. Furthermore, I find that recently the seris both accuser and vices of two members of the force have been dispensed with. In one case, that of Mounted Constable McCann, very unfair of Mikado fame! The treatment was meted out by the departpolice in Canberra ment. I ask the Minister to review that case. If that man cannot be reinstated, he should be reimbursed for all moneys which he has paid into the superannuation fund, and also paid salary in lieu of holidays which had accrued to h i m at the. time of his dismissal. He and Constable Cameron, who was the second officer dismissed, have been denied these rights. I also point out that members of the Public Servicei n the Northern Territory have no right of appeal in cases of promotion similar to that enjoyed by officers of the Public Service elsewhere, who, if they consider that they possess greater qualifications, can appeal against the promotion of other officers. that distinction so f a r as Northern Terriask him to take advantage of such an tory officers are concerned? Administrator who makes the appointments is also the judge of his own actions in appeal cases. another instance in which he is, in effect, the grand Mikado. Officers at the head-quarters of the department apparently seek the advice of officers in the Northern Territory when it suits them to be evasive in regard to suggestions for reform, but in matters of high policy, they act on their own decisions. I ask the Minister to give all members of the Public Servicei n the Northern Territory this right of appeal which is enjoyed by officers through the Service elsewhere. I now propose to deal with the proposed vote of £1,000 to the Darwin Town Council. cently promulgated in Darwin, under which buildings can be demolished on the ground that they are not fit for habitation from a health point of view, has caused grave dissention, and I have been asked by those interested in the matter to place their case before the Minister. This ordinance is most unjust. The department has condemned and demolished, certain buildings, and, at the same time, has given no compensation whatever to the owners of those buildings. Contrast this policy with that pursued by the London County Council, which, in its efforts to abolish slum areas, finances the building of the new structures and allows have drawn the attention of the Minister to the matter of town-planning Darwin, according to a scheme which will make Darwin a town worthy of the admiration of visitors from overseas. Today, the town contains slums; but I point out that those particular buildings were erected in the early days, principally by Chinese, and, in spite of the materials used, principally sheet iron and round timber, their construction was costly. I again ask the Minister to accept my advice to send a town planner to Darwin to devise a scheme whereby condemned buildings can be demolished and the owners thereof compensated for their loss as is done in other parts of the world and given rights to rebuild. Furthermore, I opportunity to inaugurate a housing sysI t is because the tem with the object, of providing better homes for pensioners and working people generally in Darwin. In this respect he This is could follow the policy adopted by the department in its housing operations in the Federal Capital Territory. There is an urgent need in Darwin to-day for better housing accommodation. Many pensioners resident there are obliged to live in humpies. Recently, I drew the attention of the Minister to what has been accomplished in the town-planning of Mackay, in Queensland, and pointed out that the Brisbane town planner had been asked to town-plan Suva. The Minister's advisers tell him, however, that to plan Darwin would present extraordinary difficulties. To negative people everything is extraordinary. Positive action is reThe Building Ordinance required. [Quorum formed.] Another matted to which I direct the attention of the Minister is that of land surveys. The proposed vote for this purpose is not sufficient. Lessees of pastoral areas in the Northern Territory are urging that the boundaries of their holdings should be delineated. I have raised this matter on several occasions previously, particularly in respect of the position of lessees in the Alice Springs district, where many disputes have arisen from this cause. .Honourable members who are familiar with conditions in areas such as Alice Springs, are aware that very often disputes between settlers arise as compensation. Previously, T to the ownership of waterholes, choice",57,Common Wealth
150,Mr Mocall.i,What is the reason for,59,Common Wealth
151,Mr Blain,"feeding grounds, bores and other improvements. To-day, the policy of the department appears to be that no pastoral lease surveys can be made except at the expense of the lessees. 1 am not suggesting that every lease should be precisely surveyed, but I ask that surveyors be sent to Alice Springs to survey the key boundaries so as to enable lessees to determine the ownership of the choieer areas. If the lessees are charged for these surveys they will not be able to afford the cost of fencing their areas. I contend that the starting points, at at Alice Springs to deal with least, should be established on areas which the lessees wish to fence and parts of the actual boundaries surveyed. The lessees pay rent and the Government should delineate the boundaries of the land for which rent is demanded. Another point is that some lessees who have been impatient for this work to be undertaken, have already come to certain agreements with their neighbours. They have built fences, and are now seeking to have the common boundaries recognized as is done in most of the States in similar circumstances. I am not clear as to whether under the territory laws this is legal and I ask the Minister to obtain a legal ruling as to whether these common boundaries would be correct in a court of law or regarded as so by his department. The landholders are impatient to have these improvements put up but they wish to have them recognized. If that cannot.be done under the existing conditions, new regulations should be made. It is simple enough in the States, especially in Queensland, but nothing seems to be simple under the regulations which govern the Northern Territory. The area is a bundle of red tape that leaves the inhabitants bewildered. The smaller land-holders around Alice Springs complain that there is no lands officer to whom they can apply for permission to erect windmills and other improvements under this grant of £20,000 for freight, concessions and assistance to lessees. This is a point which the Minister should examine. In the States-I refer particularly to Queensland-lands offices are situated in the various key towns and are accessible to land-holders, who are able to communicate with them with facility. The land officers visit the Mr main. holdings, inspect the proposed improvements and give or withhold permission for them to be proceeded with. The landholders at Alice Springs have either to apply to Canberra or to the Land Board in Darwin, but, owing to the infrequency of the mail service between Alice Springs and Darwin, it takes two months for a considered reply to be received, and the officers in Canberra cannot be expected to be familiar . with local conditions peculiar to Alice Springs. I urge the Minister to appoint an officer land matters to whom the lessees could apply and who would be conveniently close to the holdings to inspect improvements immediately. It is only ' fair that the Minister should do that. The land-holders at Alice Springs take the view that it is useless to send applicatioiu to Canberra, because of the evasive replies received. An injustice is being done to the unemployed at Darwin and Alice Springs. About 20 or 30 white men are situated in a camp about two miles outside Darwin but they are not eligible for any relief until they have been resident there for an unreasonable period. These men are destitute. Leniency should be shown to them because no one would undertake the trek to the Northern Territory to take advantage of relief work or unemployment relief. They are. entitled to the treatment which men in similar circumstances receive in the States. In Alice Springs there is no relief scheme in operation at all and, of course, there is no residential qualification. Throughout the rest of the Commonwealth the unemployed receive the dole, and it is unfair that these men in the Northern Territory should be more or less disinherited. They have made frequent representation for relief. They can get no money with which to pay grocery bills. They applied, as a matter of fact, for permission to run small raffles to enable them to fulfil their obligations, but the superintendent of police denied their plea. The Minister should send a communication to the superintendent of police directing him to allow them, by means of raffles, to raise some money not only to meet their obligations to the business people but also to provide themselves with a Christmas dinner, if the Minister cannot provide them with Christmas relief work. They are committing no crime and they should receive better treatment. that to the honourable member to-day. for that. I was not aware of it. I do not propose to deal at length with loans to miners, but, up to the present, it is only the mining promoters who have been able to take advantage of the loans. In this respect the miners at Tennant Creek have been disinherited. The small business men in that area are carrying men on their shoulders. work on a 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, margin to cover risk of bad debts, but at Tennant Creek so adverse are the conditions that they are forced to work on a much greater margin, judging by the price lists. If the Commonwealth Statisexact investigation by recognized authoritician were to work out a basic wage on the basis of the prices at Tennant Creek it would be amazing. By virtue of the Minister not malting the loans apply to the small miners, the storekeepers, as I have already said, are compelled to allow a greater margin for safety to the price of goods to cover the risk of their not being reimbursed. It is, therefore, the duty of the Department of the Interior to see that this loan money goes, not only berra, and I suggest that if the Minister to the mining promoters, but also to the small miners, so that small storekeepers will have something real on which to give credit. There are many other matters on which I wished to speak, but I realize that my time has expired. [Leave to continue given.] I shall not delay the committee, but with regard to primary production in the Northern Territory, I have had sent to me the prospectus of a man who wishes to develop the territory on the Morris plan. I assume that the Minister has seen it, since a copy was also submitted to the Department of the Interior for review, and it has been deeemed by that department to be acceptable for publication. Recognizing the policy of "" first come first"", I have not been pressing for the development of tropical agriculture so far, but this is a direction in which something could be done to assist the people who wish to develop the territory along those lines. The areas which I suggest could be investigated are situated in the hinterland of Bynoe Harbour, the Pinnoss and Edith rivers districts and east of Pine Creek. I commend the Minister for the appointing of Mr W. L . Payne, chairman of the LandI thank the Minister Administration Board, Queensland, and a committee, to make an inspection of the territory. I also urge that the Minister despatch Dr. Prescott, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, to the territory to make, on the lines of the Russian Glinka soil survey, a thorough soil survey, which, in turn, will eventually become a thorough economic survey, in order that we can Business people generally show just what we have in our vast territory. Dr. Prescott has just returned from Russia, where, I understand, he furthered his investigations in regard to the Glinka soil survey, which is outstanding in the world. It behoves us after ties to dress the window and show the people who are willing to spend money on the development of the territory just what they are spending it on. 1 understand that the Government is about to embark on the construction of a big building to house departments of the Commonwealth Public Service in Canhas at heart the interests of the Australian industry he will take into consideration the possibility of erecting this building with a better kind of material than has been used hitherto. honourable member think that enough money is being spent there? being well done.

In common with other members of the Labour party, and possibly members of other parties, I have received various statements from persons on the island, but I do not, on that account, consider it my duty to launch attacks on publie servants. Two sections of the community which many people consider fair game are members of Parliament and public servants. Members of Parliaout good reason, members of the Public Service. Some years ago, as a member of a parliamentary party, I visited Norfolk Island, and the Administrator result of our investigations, I formed the opinion that he has most difficult duties to discharge. The population of the island is over 1,000, and there is only one member of the Commonwealth Police Force to preserve order. Obviously, would not be sufficient. It would be highly dangerous for this committee to treat the 'affairs of the island so lightly as to cause the inhabitants to think that it is prepared to side against the Administrator; but, as certain complaints have been mentioned in this chamber, it might be desirable to appoint a parliamentary committee to investigate and report upon them. It is most unfair for any member of this chamber to attack the Administrator merely because individuals have chosen to make statements which may or may not be true.

An y honourable member who adopts a similar attitude to the Administrator of Norfolk Island, or any other territory of the Commonwealth, lays himself open to the same criticism as that directed against . the Minister. Unless a member is sure of the facts, it is most unfair to attack a member of the Public Service. There should be no cheap criticism by parliamentarians from a coward's castle. No criticism at all should be directed against the Administrator of Norfolk Island until a careful investigation has definitely disclosed that there are good grounds for it . The Government should pay more attention than it has in the past to the interests of the people of the Pederal Capital Territory. Recently many public servants have been transferred to Canberra, but the mistake has been made of not providing sufficient housing accommodation for them prior to their arrival. The Government should give careful consideration also to the granting of the parliamentary franchise to the people of this territory. Before their appointment, members of the Public Service had to pass examinations which require more than average educational attainments. Some members of the Service have particularly high educational qualifications, but they are not entitled to vote in electm certain Sydney suburbs, and, therefore., ing the members from whom the Government, which they have to serve, is chosen. In these circumstances, arrangements should be made as early as possibleeventually they will have to be madefor the people of the Pederal Capital Territory to have the right to vote at federal elections. I have always been under the impression that the Government is endeavouring to make Canberra a capital worthy of the Australian nation in accordance with the ideal of its founders. numerous occasions, discussions have arisen in this chamber and in the Senate concerning the unsightly and unsatisfactory buildings in Canberra, in which a certain section of the community is compelled to live. The number of unsightly dwellings in Canberra is not large, but in proportion to the total number of houses they are too many. in this city. Minister is one of the few who do not admit the fact that slums exist in Canberra. The unsatisfactory condition and general appearance of the tenements at Molonglo has already been brought under the notice of the Government. if compared with those to be seen in East Sydney and Pive Dock. of the Government is very well expressed by the honourable member for Martin( Mr. McCall) who, in effect, suggests that Canberra is very much behind the times because it does not possess slums such as are to be seen in East Sydney. order. The honourable member for Olriffith ( Mr Baker) is incorrect in inferring that 1 said that Canberra is behind the times because it has not slums comparable with those to be found in East Sydney. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN That is not a point of order. understood the honourable member, but I understood hi m to say that the slums in Canberra are not comparable with those are not a disgrace to Canberra. has misrepresented what I said, and his remarks are offensive to me. scheme the Government lends to intending purchasers up to 90 per cent, of the cost of a home, with a limitation of the advance to a maximum of £1,800. That means that in veSpect of a house costing £2,000, only £200 has to be found by the purchasers. As dwellings costing £2,000 Yet, on are well beyond the means of a majority of the residents of Canberra, the Government should pay greater attention to the construction of homes costing from £300 to £600 for people who need them.

Will Paterson) explain how the increased vote is to be expended? Last year, £1,000 was voted for the encouragement of primary production in the Northern Territory of which only £55 was expended, and this year £2,000 has been provided. I understand that all this expenditure so far has been to assist peanut farmers to obtain implements. An amount of £4,100 has been provided for the running expenses of the patrol vessel which has proved very unsatisfactory. Por the eradication of noxious weeds in the Federal Capital Territory, £2,300 was voted last year, and only £927 expended. As £2,000 is provided for this year and we have been informed that Paterson's curse is not to be found in the Territory, will the Minismittee by explaining that, of the 32.000 ter explain how the money is to be expended ? Last year, £200 was provided for the Tourist Bureau, and only £59 was' expended, but I am glad to see that £850 is provided for publicity work this year. I trust that the money will be wisely employed in directing the attention of the Australian people generally to the attracFor that reason, I am advocating the contions of Canberra. A motion appears on the notice-paper relating to the necessity for the constructhe WaveH ill and Victoria River Downs tion of a railway from Wyndham for a distance of 200 miles into the Northern Territory. This project has been mentioned by several honourable members. I direct attention to the fact that the Western Australian Government erected meat works at a cost of £1,000,000, which Mr Conacher and other recognized authorities on the Australian meat industry have said are among the most up to date in 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, that now come Australia. It might well be asked why the Government of Western Australia should have gone out of its way to establish meat-works 1,600 or 1,700 miles north it is expected that, under the new meat of the capital of the State, in a sparsely agreement which is to be made by the populated area. The reason is, that no private company could be expected to undertake the expenditure, because it was clear that the works could not be made to pay. The government was faced with the position that if the works were not established the value of the large number of cattle that are raised in that locality would be lost. Originally, live cattle were carried by boat from the south, but that market was lost when local supplies were available from the areas in the southern part of the State. -The honourable member is not dealing with the Northern Territory. unduly prolonged my explanation of the circumstances which led to the establishment of meat-works in the north-western portion of Western Australia. It is proposed that a railway shall be constructed for the nurpose of opening up the western part of the Northern Territory, for which Wyndham it the natural port. I am endeavouring to deal with the vote before the comcattle annually treated at Wyndhamthat is the average for the last four years -full y one-half come from the Northern Territory. If the meat-works in the Kimberley district were closed down the western portion of the Northern Territory would be without an outlet for its beef. struction of a railway of which a length of 100 miles would be in the Northern Territory. The cattle are driven from districts, which are fertile portions of tbe Northern Territory that depend entirely on an outlet being provided for them. Mr Morey, the pastoral superintendent of one of the largest cattle firms in the north, stated in Sydney a little over a fortnight ago that, with a railway to Wyndham it would be possible to deliver at the works 90 per cent, of the cattle as fats, compared with the from the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Fisken) explained recently in this chamber that British Government with Argentina, 15 per cent, of the British market will provide an outlet for Australian chilled beef. That is all that the Northern Territory and other pastoral areas of Australia will be able to supply, and the",63,Temporary Chairman Treated Us With Every Courtesy As The

174,Mr A. Green,"I fear that I havebenefit, to the Northern Territory will bo considerable. While in England recently, I had an opportunity to examine the chilled beef sent from Argentina, as well as the frozen beef sent from Australia, and can frankly say that the Argentine product begins . to deteriorate after it has been displayed in shop windows for a period. The proposal that I now bring forward is of immense importance to tbe western part of the Northern Territory, and, incidentally, would make the meat works at Wyndham a more payable proposition, and ensure the continuance of the existing port facilduty to do all that lies within our power ities. The honourable member for Ballarat has dealt with this matter very fully. He has had such wide and varied experience that I should hesitate tooppose my view, against an opinion that he has expressed. He has given valuable service to the meat trade and is undoubtedly a most useful man as chairman of the Australian Meat Board. Within comparatively recent times the Government of Western Australia has expended £3S,000 on experimental chilling operations at the meat works at Wyndham. If we were able to export chilled beef the return from the 30,000 head of cattle that are treated there would be increased by £60,000. It is impossible to drove cattle from the western portion of the Northern Territory to this port, and make a success of pastoral operations. All the cattle are driven ago Mr Hobler, a Commonwealth railalong the one stock route out of the Northern Territory until they enter Western Australia. The course of the Ord River is followed. I have visited this country on a few occasions, and the country is familiar to me. The course of the Ord River is wide but has a stony bottom, and very little feed for cattle; the small quantity of feed it produces, is quickly eaten out. The Commonwealth should co-operate with the Government of Western Australia in making the necessary arrangements for the construction of the railway that I have mentioned. I feel sure that a good deal of solid development is possible in the western portion of the Northern Territory, and that the cattle industry may be made much more lucrative than it is at the present time. The amount received for beef for freezing purposes is very [05] small. I believe that I am safe in saying that in present circumstances it hardly pays co continue the growing of cattle. But those who arc engaged in the pastoral industry, in this area are in the same position as is occupied by many other primary producers throughout Australiathey have to remain in the business because they cannot get out, eveu though they are losing money every year. The prosperity of secondary industries is largely dependent upon the prosperity of primary industries. It is, therefore, our to help those who are endeavouring to make a success of cattle raising in the Northern Territory. To-day, owing to the absence of railway facilities, cattle lose something like SO lb. to 100 lb. on the track. They spend several weeks on the journey, on a track that has already been eaten bare. The consequence is that only 40 per cent, of the cattle are suitable for export when they reach the chilling works. No blame can be attached to the chilling works, which have the latest equipment. It is the duty of the Federal Government to consider this proposition. The Australian Meat Board, which met in September last in Sydney, passed a resolution asking the Government to take the preliminary step of surveying a route for the proposed railway. I hope that the Government will do so. A few years ways engineer, made flying surveys of routes of new lines to be constructed ultimately for the opening up of the Northern Territory. The proposal which I have mentioned was one of those. I have no desire to delay the committee any longer to-night, but I hope to have an opportunity later to deal with this matter more effectively on a substantive motion. Proposed votes agreed to.

In t e r i o r , u p o n notice1. Isi t a fact that, although the country has been put to an enormous expenditure to equip the Public Works Department in the Northern Territory, with all the necessary plant and machinery to carry out constructional works, nearly all this work is handed out to contractors, who are generally friends o' officials of the Public Works Department in the Territory? 2.

Patrick J. Kelly, of Manildra. 4. Isi t a fact that, apart from this contract £03 per annum from the 1st Januarv, system lending itself to "" g r a f t "" , there is also the danger of the contractor evading payment to the workmen by leaving the territory? 5. Isi t a fact that, owing to the keen pricecutting competition among these contractors, much discontent exists among the workmen, who are being unduly exploited, and have tn many instances to wait not only weeks, but sometimes for months,, before they are paid? 0. Isi t a fact that persons injured in the Northern Territory have to bear the cost of transport to hospital and are then charged £3 10s. a week, apart from costs of operations, and that, owing to these abnormal charges, an injured person from WaveH ill Station, who is left a permanent cripple, is also in debt, to the extent of £200 after receiving compensation? If these charges are in accordance with the Workers Compensation Ordinance, will he take immediate steps to amend the ordinance, so that all medical costs and hospital treatment w i ll not be a charge against the injured person? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. It is the policy of the department to carry out works in the Northern Territory by contract, as far as practicable, and tenders or quotations are publicly invited. I am not aware of any work having been handed out to contractors excepting under competitive conditions. The fact that a successful contractor is a friend of an official is immaterial provided tenders are dealt with on their merits. 2. I am not aware of the award having been broken by contractors. If any employee has not received payment for public holidays to which he is entitled under award conditions, his remedy is to make a complaint to the The in for m a t i o n is bedepartment, which, upon satisfactory proof of non-payment, has power under the conditions of contract to pay his claim from any moneys due to the contractor. The fifteen days* annual holiday is a concession granted to employees under the award. Therefore, the department has no power to enforce contractors to grant the privilege, 3. The elimination of holidays is certainly not a saving to the department, and if the money is retained by tbe contractor, the emplovee has his remedies, as indicated in No. 2. 4 and 5. It is the duty of any employee or the union to acquaint, the department of any evasion of awards by contractors, following which prompt action is taken to ensure t h a i award conditions are observed. 0.

Isi t a fact that the insurance companies last week announced an increase in the average market rate to 5 por cent.? 4. To what extent have the rates for advances to insurance companies increased during the last three years? honourable member's questions are follows:1. (<t) In 1933 provision was made to allow in the assessments of life assurance companies which made a profit, a deduction of an amount equal to 4 per cent, of that part of the valuation of liabilities at the end of the year in which the assessable income was derived which bears to that valuation the sa..me proportioa as the va""uc at that date of tlie assets from which the company derives assessable income bears to the aggregate of tbe value at that date of all the assets of the company. In the case of a life assurance company which was not making a profit, full exemption from Income tax was given. Life assurance companies have enjoyed, along with all other companies, the following reductions in taxation:-Financia l year 1933-34-reduutio n of the normal rate of tax from Is. 4.8d. to Is., reduction of the special property tax from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent.; financial year 193R-30-reductio n of the special property tax from 0 per cent, to 5 per cent. 2. These companies shared with all other taxpayers in the abolition oi the special property tax. 3. I have no oliicial knowledge of the increase in the rates referred to, but have seen a press statement in regard thereto. 4. I have no specific knowledge of the actual variations of the rates of interest on loans charged by individual insurance companies, but I am aware of the fact that, whilst the practice adopted by various companies is not uniform, the rates, generally speaking, have fluctuated in accordance with the rise and fall of other interest rates. honourable member for .Bass( Mr. The answers to Barnard) asked me the following question, without notice:Ha3 the Prime Minister received any information regarding the shortage of passengeT accommodation of the ferry service between Melbourne and Tasmania during the Christmas season? Can he say whether all second, and nearly all first, class accommodation from the 20th December until after the New Year has already been booked? If so. and in view of the importance of the tourist traffic to ot' INSURANCE COMPANIES. Tasmania, will he take action to see that sufficient accommodation is made available for persons desiring to travel to Tasmania?
