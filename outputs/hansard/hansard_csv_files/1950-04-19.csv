In reply to the second part of the right honourable gentleman's question, I shall make arrangements for the issue of a statement in relation to the effects of immunization against diphtheria. Unfortunately, such a statement cannot be very authoritative as a good deal of doubt exists in relation to the matter. ""What the Director-General of Health said was that insofar as immunization with anti-diphtheric serum was concerned there was no question of deletenous effects but that insofar as the mixture of anti-diphtheric and whooping-cought serum was concerned some question had been raised. That suggestion has been made on certain observations. I shall prepare a complete statement on the subject. NEW GUINEA. this question, which I address to the Minister for External Territories, I wish to state that I am aware that many ex-servicemen, because of the knowledge they gained whilst with the forces in New Guinea, are anxious to return to that territory in order to assist in its development. They have been prevented from doing so by lack of finance and by governmental restrictions. In view of those facts, will the Minister consider, in the light of his recent visit to New Guinea, what encouragement and assistance may be extended to ex-servicemen and others who wish to go to New Guinea, particularly to engage in primary production ? discussions and personal observations in New GuineaI came to the conclusion that there is ample scope for encouraging people, particularly returned soldiers, to go to New Guinea and engage in primary production. While I was in New GuineaI received a number of suggestions on how this should be done. I propose to take up this question with the Minister for Repatriation. I believe that certain action can be taken to develop the idea. I am satisfied that it will be a very good scheme from every point of view to encourage as many Australians as possible to go there. It will assist us to discharge our responsibilities to the natives and to maintain this area as a strategic zone. COAL. Minister state whether it is correct, as reported, that the Government intends to import coal from South Africa and India? If that report is correct, has the Government considered obtaining additional coal supplies from Queensland? The Minister for Mines has stated that Queensland can supply all the coal required or that would be imported from overseas and that the Queensland coal would not be inferior in quality to that which it is proposed to import and would be landed in southern States at no greater cost than that which would be imported from India and South Africa. Does the Prime Minister not consider that, in the interests of the Queensland coal-mining industry, it would be better to obtain coal from that State than from overseas? coal from overseas is being arranged by joint action by the Commonwealth and the States, particularly South Australia and Victoria. That importation is designed to secure prompt additional supplies of coal. It is in no way intended to limit the development of coal production in Australia. The Government believes that the best coal, from Australia's point of view, is the coal that can be obtained in our own country. It is desired to obtain coal not only from New South Wales but also from every other State in the Commonwealth including Queensland. The possibility of obtaining further supplies from Queensland has not been overlooked.

Two and a half million cases of fruit have been ordered from Tasmania by the United Kingdom but shipment must be effected before the 31st May. Waterside workers are making every effort that is humanly possible to handle the cargoes, but it seems that a very considerable portion of the order may be left behind. The problem is a very complex one and involves wharfs, storage shed3 and other factors. Little can be done this season.

ME. E. THOBNTON. Minister for External Affairs whether it Government, of which the honourable is a fact that Mr E. Thornton has member for Grayndler was a supporter. left Australia to attend a conference of the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions in Pakistan? In view of the continued added pressure of Communist organizations against British Empire interests, including the interests of the State of Pakistan, I ask whether any permit was issued by the Australian Government to allow of Thornton's our national interests were protected by preventing, as far as possible, Australian traitors from attending enemy conferences overseas to our detriment? tion that I have on this subject is what I have read since I have returned to Australia. The issuing of passports is not a matter for the Department of External Affairs, but I have already had discussions with the Minister for Immigration and we are now considering the whole question of the limitations that can be imposed upon overseas visits by Communists whom we know to be going overseas in order to advance conspiracy against this country. I am satisfied that the full extent of our powers will be used to prevent people from going overseas to engage in Communist Minister for Immigration a question supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Wide Bay. Will the department issued a passport to Mr Thornton? If so, in view of the many protests by members of the present Government parties when they sat in opposition against the issue of a passport to Mr Thornton to enable him to travel overseas, did the Minister take those protests into consideration when deciding the matter?

I have not made any statement about Australian investments in Malaya either recently or at any time. If , therefore, the honourable member did read some report in some journal, I should be glad if he would tell me the name of the journal later. I suspect its identity. Any such report is completely untrue.

That is a most laudable desire and is something that this Government stands for, and will surely endeavour to carry out. As for communism in the Royal Australian Air Force, I do not think it exists. The morale of that organization is high, and iu the only case of sabotage which has been discovered in recent months a man was tried, sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and dismissed from the Service. We have the matter always under scrutiny both in the service and on the civil side. Health read the leading article in the Melbourne Herald of the 17th April entitled "" Who is Delaying Medical Plan "", in which it is stated that all that ihe public actually knows at present is that it has been promised a medical scheme and that something or someone appears to be delaying it? In view of the fact that an impression is prevalent that the delay in the introduction of the new health legislation is due to the obstructionist tactics of the British Medical Association, will the Minister, in order to see that the matter is immediately clarified, accept the statement in the Herald's leading article, that the merits of the latest plans cannot be discussed intelligently until the Government tells the people just what they are, and will he accept that journal's advice that the Government should make an early sible excuse for secrecy. member would know, if he were dealing with a human complication, that it should be dealt with in confidential consultation and not openly.

Fortunately the position vis-a-vis the Pharmaceutical Guild ie more advanced than most as I hope within a couple of weeks to have the full list of drugs determined by the specialists.

If so, what was, or what will be the nature of his reply? federal executive of the Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australian in Melbourne last January, I gave it that assurance, which has never been altered in the slightest degree, and still stands. tion to the Minister for HealthI desire to make a brief statement so that my question will be understood. I know of a person in Melbourne who has secured treatment for his wife, who is suffering from arthritis, at the Eockefeller Presbyterian Hospital in New York. She was given five injections of the new drug, cortisone, and has apparently been cured after having been bedridden for more than two years. A statement has been made that this drug would be released in Australia after March this year through a manufacturing chemist in Sydney. Does the right honorahle gentleman know anything of such a proposal? In view of the fact that many sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis are interested in the claims about the effectiveness of this drug, will the Minister make full inquiries and issue a considered statement on the subject as early as possible? what life-saving and disease-preventing drugs should be included in the formulary under the Government's health and medical benefits scheme is being examined by an expert committee, consisting of professors of pharmacology in Melbourne and Sydney and of four expert specialists. I have no doubt that these eminent gentlemen will fully examine the effectiveness of the drug, cortisone, and decide whether or not it should be included in the formulary. Health exercise patience in dealing with members of the Central Southern Branch of the British Medical Association who are defying the Government's arbitration policy? In explanation of my question, I inform the right honourable gentleman that these members of the doctors' trade union have joined together by direct action substantially to increase their fees to as much as a guinea a visit, and are refusing to work except at the new rates. WhilstI recognize that the Minister cannot tolerate this will he take into account the fact that the doctors have doubtlessly been misled by a small minority of trouble-makers at their head? Before invoking the Crimes Act against them, will he point out that this Government will not allow any sections of the workers to take the law into their own hands and only as a last resort will it gaol or deport their leaders and so allow the rank and file to regain control of their organization? that the difference between doctors and the wharf labourers in Brisbane is that the doctors have kept on working night and day, while the wharf labourers in Brisbane have left the ships and have not unloaded them. What the doctors may do in relation to their fees has nothing to do with the Australian Government.

Also, in view of the anticipated good crop, especially in Queensland, and the comparative price of wheat and grain sorghum on the local market, does the Minister consider that there will be any relaxation of the conditions whereby export licences can be granted for 60 per cent of stock while the balance of 40 per cent, must be retained for the home market? ber reminds me that I made a statement some weeks ago on the policy to be applied in the issue of licences for the export of grain sorghum. That policy still stands. Authority has been granted for the issue of a number of licences. I cannot say the exact number, nor can I say without inquiry whether licences have been issued in every State, but I shall obtain the information and supply it to the honourable member. The percentages of 60 per cent, for export and 40 per cent, for home consumption were considered to be appropriate before complete knowledge of the volume of the crop was available. When complete figures are available, I shall review those percentages front in Melbourne known as the Perand, as the honourable member suggests, it may be possible to vary them. Prime Minister a question about a proclamation issued by the Governor General recently, which related directly to industrial trouble on the Brisbane waterfront. Will that proclamation remain in force, or will it be revoked, in view of the fact that the industrial troubles in Brisbane have since ceased and the Communists have been dealt with in that city? say something about that matter after question time, but I may conveniently deal with it in answer to the question by the honourable member for St. George. Some time before Easter, I announced to the House that a proclamation had been issued under the Crimes Act having regard to events on the waterfront in Queensland. Since the issue of that proclamation, the process of work on the waterfront has been restored. There has been continuity of operations, and, in point of fact on the matters which immediately gave rise to the dispute, the Waterside Workers Federation has gone back, to the judge, and certain proceedings before him are now pending. In other words, the industrial disturbance which provoked the proclamation has terminated, and, in those circumstances, the Government has decided to revoke it. As I indicated to honourable members when I made my announcement to the House some time before Easter, the position is that, under the Crimes Act, a proclamation', once issued, continues until it is revoked. It will be revoked this afternoon. It is not desirable that emergency measures of that kind should continue after the expiration of the emergency, and, therefore, we propose to revoke the proclamation. Should any disturbance in future require corresponding action, the Government of course will know what to do. Labour and National Service aware that there is an organization on the watermanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union? Is he also aware that the organization had its origin as a strikebreaking, or "" scab"", weapon, and that it has now merged into a Communist controlled union?

Is it a fact that many miners and retired miners have had their homes wrecked, in many instances beyond repair, and have lost their whole life savings? Is it also a fact that a committee appointed by the Government is at present going around assessing the damage done to the property of farmers as a result of the recent floods, with a view to granting farmers financial assistance to repair the damage? Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of extending the scope of the committee's functions to take in the industrial area of Scarborough and to provide for an assessment to be made of the damage there, with a view to financial aid being granted to the miners and retired miners on the same basis as the assistance to be granted to farmers? with the nnfortunate incident to which the honourable member has referred. In the case of flood damage in both New South Wales and Victoria, I received applications from the Premiers of those States, who drew attention to the nature of the losses that had occurred. The Government agreed to co-operate with those States in taking some action in the matter-no t to repair all the damage done to individual citizens, but to deal with cases of genuine personal hardship that might have arisen.

If the honourable member will give me further information on the subject. I shall be glad to look into bis proposal. address a question to you, Mr Speaker. When flying from Adelaide to Canberra this morning by Trans-Australia Airlines Skymaster, on which were politicians of various political creeds, I carefully read a copy of to-day's Adelaide Advertiser, a journal which I know is deemed in some quarters to be thoroughly reliable, but which I admit is not responsible for framing the advertisements which appear in its columns. Page 22 of that journal contains an advertisement inviting applications for the tenancy of a dry canteen at the works hostel at Turner, Canberra. The advertisement appears over the authority of "" Nelson Lemmon, Minister for AVorks and Housing"".

I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman has had a chance to read this morning's press, so I ask him whether he has been advised that the Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court yesterday announced that the basic wage would rise by 3s. in Melbourne and 2s. in Sydney because of increases of the cost of living during the last quarter? If so, does he agree that this is the second cost-of-living increase since this Government took office and that, in the case of workers in some capital cities, it brings the increases to 8s.? If this is so, is it evidence of the Government's efforts to put more value into the Â£1, or, as it would appear logical to suggest, is it evidence of the vanishing value of the Â£1? If the latter is the case, what does the Prime Minister propose to do in order to give effect to his election promise to make the Â£1 worth of goods to the value of Â£1? honourable member's interest in this matter.

81,Mr Menzies,"I appreciate the more. In his question, the honorahle member has omitted reference to one significant fact. The price-level began to rise at the rate of about 10 per cent, per annum in 1947, when the honourable gentleman had a seat on the treasury bench. It continued to rise at the same rate during 1948. referendum. i l r . MENZIES -Unfortunatel y for the honourable gentleman, it was before the referendum. The rise in price levels began a clear eighteen months before the .prices referendum was held. Prices rose at the rate of from 10 to 12 per cent, per annum in 1947, 1948, in the middle of which year the referendum occurred, and in 1949. Such an alarming rise in the cost of living cannot be arrested overnight. I am, therefore, not surprised to know that the continuation of that momentum has produced the result referred to by the honourable gentleman, but with his co-operation, and the co-operation of the trade union movement and of all those concerned with production in this country, we shall hope to slow down that process, then to arrest it, and then to start a movement in the opposite direction? to ask the Prime Minister a question supplementary to the one just asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. Is it true that the Prime Minister told a meeting at Launceston recently that more value could not be put into the Â£1 by an act of the Government ? Does the present attitude of the right honourable gentleman constitute repudiation of the solemn promise he made to the Australian people that, if elected, he would put value back into the Â£1 ? the purpose of the honourable member's question, I did not make the statement he hae attributed to me. ter misreported?

I should like to inform the honourable member for Hindmarsh that on the occasion to which he referred to in his question I indicated that Governments could and should do certain things which concerned economic policy and concerns everybody-the problem of arresting inflation. But the Government cannot do all about it because no government can do everything on that matter unless it is backed by the resolute efforts of all individual members of the community. When honourable members of the Opposition realize that they, as well as other people, have a task of leadership on this matter, we shall progress more rapidly. BEAN AND POLLARD. March the honourable member for Mitchell asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question regarding stimulating the export of flour from Australia, and, by this means, improving the supplies of mill offals, bran and pollard, the shortage of which is causing grave concern amongst dairy farmers, pig-raisers and other farmers who require these commodities for stock feed. Could the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether there have been any developments which would indicate that increased supplies will become available? aware of the shortage of wheaten mill offals and its effect on the various industries mentioned by the honourable member. As I told the House on another occasion, I have consulted the Australian Wheat Board, and' also specialist members of the Flour Millers Association, and officials of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and we have examined every possible way of stimulating the export of flour for the purpose, amongst other things, of securing more wheaten mill offals.

Air and Minister for Civil Aviation). -by leave-Earlie r in the session I undertook to obtain for the honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) certain information concerning the alleged inadequacy of the air service to Elinders Island. I have now obtained the required information and present it to the House. The matter of air services to Flinders Island has been discussed with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, the regular operator of the service to that island, and also with Mr W. T. Dwyer, who operates an occasional service. Prior to September, 1948, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited operated between Launceston and Flinders Island thrice weekly, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but, owing to the poor loadings on the whole service, the Wednesday service was discontinued in that month. The prospects of re-introducing the Wednesday service have been discussed with the company, which has advised that during the six months ended the 31st December, 1949, the loadings on the twice-weekly service wereLaum-eston to Flinders Island -1,17! ) scats available; 4.83 passengers carried.

All of us are equally agreed that I have just quoted certainly indicate, that it is most important that the people's that a service three times a week could not bank should be encouraged in every way be justified at present, and, with the to expand in such a manner as will enable winter season so near, there appears to be it to meet the growing demands upon it. even less justification than previously for Earlier in this debate, certain members increasing the frequency of operation of of the Opposition were pleased to say the service. enterprise has failed Bank, but they must have known that the honourable member is air-minded, he should encourage more people to travel by air. The question whether the Commonwealth should subsidize the service has been examined, but, as a twice-weekly service is now being operated, there is no justification for a Commonwealth subsidy.

I do not want to deal in detail with any of the component parts of the bill, and I propose to refer principally to its main objectives which are, first, the expansion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank; ancl, secondly, the establishment of a board to control the conduct of the bank in the soundest and best disagreement anywhere in this House concerning the desirability of the first that members of this Government had",23,Production

106,Mr Gullett,"And that is abouttheir statements were very far from the truth. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) lent some force to the totally specious argument that the Government intended to hamper the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. Such talk, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) observed in his speech, adds nothing to the debate; it merely unjustly caricatures the arguments of Opposition members. I dismiss it as so much political propaganda in the narrowest sense for we are in complete agreement that the expansion of the bank is a good thing. It is on the proposition to set up a board of governors to control the policy of this bank that the House is divided. The Government believes that this great bank, upon which the efficient functioning of the whole financial policy of this country depends, can be efficiently, continuously and properly run, only by a properly constituted board. It does not believe that one person can do the job. The Government has embodied that belief in this bill. pretends that it is opposed to the setting up of a board, but I have yet to hear one honourable member opposite advance one good reason against such a proposal. The Opposition pretends that it is opposed to boards in general, but boards were made use of in nearly every government instrumentality that the previous Government set up. There has always been a military board to conduct the affairs of the Army, and a Naval Board to conduct the affairs of the Royal Australian Navy. an Apple and Pear Marketing Board, an Australian Wool Board, and many other boards. Many boards were set up by the previous Government because it knew that great Commonwealth best and most easily administered over a period of years by a board. In the course of ite own legislative programme last year the Chifley Government brought in a bill to set up and regulate the shipping industry. The instrumentality chosen to implement that legislation was, in fact, the Australian Shipping Board. says that as it is with shipping, marketing, and the armed services, so also it should be with the very important operation of banking. I can understand, but I can see no justification for, the resolute opposition to the setting up of a Commonwealth Bank Board. I ask myself, as other honourable members and citizens have asked themselves, what prompts the Opposition so bitterly to oppose the setting up of the board. The Leader of the Opposition said that he feared the setting up of boards because persons appointed to them could not be independent. To use his own words, he saidI have never yet known any one appointed to a bank board to be an independent person. Why should any one so appointed be an independent person? Appointees to other boards are not independent persons. On the Australian Wool Board there are representatives of growers, of the Government, of taxpayers and of the consumers. The same principle applies to the Australian Shipping Boar.d. The marketing boards of this country also The Opposition embrace a diversity of representation. The Commonwealth Bank Board will be possibly the most important body in Australia excepting this Parliament and the High Court. In its hands will lie the financial well-being and stability of this country. It will also administer the broad policy covering the activities of the trading banks. That being so, surely it is reasonable that the governing body of the bank should be composed of representatives who will be able to put the views of all those sections We also have of the people vitally interested in the functions of the bank. Therefore, it is only natural that we should find on this board representatives, for example, of the banks, of the citizens, and of labour. They should all be represented on undertakings could he the bank because they are vitally interested. The proposition advanced by the Opposition is that the only people on this board should be Commonwealth civil servants. If that is so then no one will have any share in the financial administration of this country other than permanent civil servants and the Government itself. Such a point of view is Tbis Government fantastic. For this great bank to be run efficiently there should be the widest possible representation on the board. The Leader of the Opposition made great play of his fear that those appointed to the board would not necessarily be independent. It does not matter twopence if they are not independent as long as the representation is wide enough to cover all sections of the community. If the Leader of the Opposition is so keen on independent representation why did he not carry out that policy when he was in office? A look at some of the appointments made by the previous Government will show whether independence of politics or interests guided the Government in making such appointments. We need look no further than the appointment of the head of the instrumentality in question, the Commonwealth Bank. Dr. Coombs was appointed to that position. I have not made it a practice to attack public servants in this House and I do not wish to do so in this instance because I know Dr. Coombs, and what I know of him I like. I greatly respect him as does everybody who knows anything about him. He is a man of the highest integrity and of great capacity. ridiculous to pretend, and never have I heard it pretended, that Dr. Coombs is any other than a doctrinaire socialist, and that he was put in control of the Commonwealth Bank because he was one of the few men in the country capable of doing the job that the Government required to be done. That was the nationalizing and socializing of the trading banks. faintest pretence of disinterestedness or independence in the last Government's appointment of Dr. Coombs. appointed a straight out fellow-traveller of its own political philosophy, and for any member of the Opposition to talk about the necessity for obtaining board is the veriest piece of humbug, because when the Opposition was in power its only desire was to appoint a man who would do exactly what he was told, not because he did not have the courage to stand up to the Government, but because his own political socialist philosophy was identical with that of those who appointed him. to leave him in control? Mr Gullett. ber has raised the very point I wish to discuss. As he knows, this Government intends to retain Dr. Coombs as Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board. I have already said what I think of Dr. Coombs. I have said that he is a most capable and most upright officer. However, since honourable members opposite have made such scathing attacks upon those whom they guess will be appointed to the board, it is only fair to say that, while I do not disagree with the proposal to appoint Dr. Coombs as Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I believe that he will find it very difficult, as a doctrinaire socialist, to reconcile his duties with his beliefs. I shall be interested to see how the matter turns out. The attitude of Dr. Coombs to the trading banks is the attitude of the lion to the lamb. The banks are there to be gobbled up and to be made part of the socialist system. I shall be very interested to see how a man who holds that belief can effectively operate the Commonwealth Bank in the way this However, it is absolutely Government intends it to be operated, and so that the trading banks may stay in existence. I cannot help commenting on the manner in which honourable members opposite have conducted themselves in this debate. To hear them talk, one would thing that the subject of banking and the relation between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading There was not the banks, were matters completely new to this Parliament. One would certainly not believe that only a little more than It a year ago we were debating these very matters in the House, or that, on the 10th December, the people of Australia delivered a verdict on the issue so emphatic that even honourable members independent people for this opposite can hardly have forgotten it. In their hearts, they know that what the Government is doing now is what the people of Australia wish them to do, and that the proposals which the Labour party are advancing are the very proposals which brought destruction upon it.

108,Mr Gullett,"The honourable memand the proposal that the Labour Government put to the House, and ultimately to the people, was that the trading banks should be nationalized, and that one supreme national banking authority should be set up. Upon those proposals the people delivered their verdict, as a result of which the Opposition is where we see it to-day. The Labour party is out of office, and is represented in this House by a truncated remnant. The Labour party's banking legislation was the rock upon which the last Government foundered, and the foundation stone upon which the fortunes of the present Government are being built. It is evident, therefore, that honourable members opposite, in opposing the present bill, are engaging in bogus political manoeuvring. will of the people. They also know that the Labour party has a majority in the Senate. If they truly believe that the Government's banking proposals, including the appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board, are not in the best interests of the people they have their remedy. By using their majority in the Senate they can at any time force the Government to go to the country. I hope they will do so, because I am sure that what happened to the Labour party on the 10th December last was a small thing compared with what will happen to it if it invites the decision of the people a second time on this issue. Therefore, I say, let us have less posturing and time-wasting, less talk about the last depression, and less putting up of straw men to be knocked down again. If honourable members opposite are sincere, let them arrange with their coUeagues in the Senate to throw the bill out. Let them go to the country, and see what will happen. The Government's banking proposals are based upon first principles, and upon issues that we took to the country. This Government was elected upon an issue that rang a bell in the hearts of the people. Therefore, I support this bill, confident that it has the support of the people. I trust that honourable members opposite will not waste further time in this debate, and I am confident that they will not give the people another opportunity to vote on the issue. Hr. FITZGEEALD (Phillip) [3.52] This bill relates to the control of the Commonwealth Bank, which may properly be regarded as the Labour party's heritage. [Quorum formed.] 1 should have thought that at this critical period, when the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has called for the co-operation of members of all parties, the Government would have refrained from introducing a measure of this kind. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) challenged the Labour party to throw the bill out when it came before the Senate. I assure the honourable member that the Labour party will adopt that course. The Government has introduced this measure with indecent haste. As a matter of fact, the banking screw They know the is already being tightened. Credit is being restricted, and higher interest rates are in the offing. In this movement, the Commonwealth Bank is playing its part with the trading banks. Advances for home-building are being curtailed. Cooperative societies that have been in existence for years are being refused accommodation by the Commonwealth Bank, as well as by the trading banks and insurance companies. It is not suggested that there is not plenty of money available for investment. The recent Commonwealth loan shows exactly the amount that the insurance companies had available for subscription, but there is no money for building or developmental works, because it is the intention of the Government to take action to increase interest rates in the near future, and the wealthy financial institutions want to be in for the kill. The Government should have considered other matters before it introduced this bill. The basic wage has increased by 8s. a week in some of the major States since this Government assumed office, and the high cost of living is inflicting severe hardship upon those unfortunate people who are trying to exist upon their meagre pensions. Their dire plight should have been given priority by the Government in its legislative programme, but it has made the big financial interests its main concern. A fortnight after the Government was elected to office, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is one of the great allies of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party increased the price of steel hy Â£2 a ton, and I am led to believe that that increase will yield to that wealthy organization a profit of Â£2,000,000 a year. The Government was not satisfied with rendering that service to one of its supporters before it gave some consideration to the dire plight of pensioners, and it proceeded hastily to introduce legislation to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. The Government desires to repay its debts to the private banks which provided the anti-Labour parties with funds for the recent election campaign. Bank managers wrote articles in local newspapers, and special scare letters were sent to depositors about the intentions of the Labour party. I had believed prior to that time that one of the fundamental points of policy of a bank was to preserve secrecy about its deposits. ever, the banks employed canvassers who disseminated the lies about which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken so indignantly. They had polling booth workers in considerable numbers, outside and inside, approaching people to vote against the Labour party candidates. Such circumstances had neveT before been heard of. The Lahour party believes that the assistance which the Liberal party and the Australian Country party received during the election campaign has prompted and even forced the Government to introduce this bill as a means of paying off those people who were responsible for its return to oflice. The Labour party is opposed to the re-appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board. ( Mr Eadden) and the Government possess all the authority that they require to control the Commonwealth Bank, and the Labour party will not allow this or any other government to shackle the people, or impede the progress of this nation for an indefinite period. The national development will be retarded if the control of the Commonwealth Bank is vested in the board which will act in the interests of the private banks. no mandate to attempt to govern in perpetuity, or to set in motion any financial machinery that would place the people in thrall for an indefinite period. itr. Fitzgerald. If the control of the Commonwealth Bank were vested in a board, the Labour party would need to win a majority of Senate seats in every State in successive elections in order to change that form of control of banking. I realize that the Government desires to bring about circumstances under which the Labour party would be forced into that position before it could undo the damage that the bank board could do. Indeed, I venture to say that it would be impossible for a Labour government to remain in office for more than one term. Honourable members opposite have referred to the Australian Shipping Board, the Military Board, and similar authorities in somewhat derogatory terms, yet they are most anxious to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board. Mr Beginald McKenna, a former Chancellor of the British Exchequer and Howchairman of the Midland Bank emphasized the importance of the control of credit when he saidThey who control the credit of a nation direct the policy of governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people. Mr David Lloyd George, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World WarI . , referred to bankers as absolute monarchs. He saidTlie bankers swept statesmen, parliamentarians, jurists and journalists all on one side and issued their orders with the imperiousness of absolute monarchs who knew that there was no appeal from their ruthless decrees. Similar conditions could exist in Australia if this Government's banking proposals were given effect to because a Labour government could not easily undo The Treasurer the damage. The Labour party is opposed to this bill, because it believes that the Government has no mandate to constitute an authority which would govern Australia in perpetuity. Some honourable members opposite have issued a challenge to the Labour party on this bill. They have said, in effect, ""Interfere with this bill, and there will be a double dissolution "". We on this side of the House believe that the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board This Government has might result in placing the people of Australia in pawn for years to come, and, in those circumstances, we are prepared to accept that challenge. Government supporters have referred, somewhat belatedly, to the excellent achievements of the Commonwealth Bank, but I think that it w ill be advisable if I refresh their memories. I cannot do better than read a passage from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) in which he described the great work of the Commonwealth Bank and showed how it had saved the people of Australia vast sums of money. He said that the institution had stopped the rake-off and huge profits which anti-Labour governments had been so anxious to pass on to their numerous wealthy friends, the financial institutions. The right honourable gentleman continued as follows:I enumerate some of the things that the Commonwealth Bank has clone, many of them under the provisions of the 1945 Act. The Commonwealth Bank has controlled interest rates and has prevented primary producers and other persons from being robbed. It has provided short-dated treasury bills at verylow rates of interest ranging from 1 per cent, down to, I think, a half of 1 per cent, at present. Whenever the Government required temporary advances to carry on the administration of the country it did not have to go to the private banks and pay, as it did when Sir Earle Page was Treasurer, interest of cent, on three-month treasury bills. At the peak period of borrowing, the Australian Government owed the Commonwealth Bank Â£343,000,000 on treasury bills. That sum had been advanced by the Commonwealth Bank at low rates of interest to carry on thc war and the business of this country. The private banks would have made millions of pounds profit if they had supplied that money. During the period when I was Treasurer the debt of Â£343.000,000 was reduced to Â£105,000.000. During and since the war, the Commonwealth Bank assisted the Treasury to float loans. Not one penny was subscribed by a private bank, because the Labour Government would not allow private hanks to contribute to a national loan. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) referred to the achievements of the Commonwealth Banki n the following terms:Let me mention a word about what the Commonwealth Bank did in connection with advances in respect of primary products between September, 1939, and September, 1945, that is, the six years of the Second World War. The Commonwealth Bank then made advances totalling no less than Â£812,000,000 under the various financial arrangements covering such primary products as wheat, meat, butter and cheese, eggs, apples and pears, barley, rabbit skins, peas, and products like tea and coffee and wool sheepskins. That shows the magnitude of the achievements of the Commonwealth Bank during the war years. What a great rake-off for the private banks if they had lent that money. We shall advise the people of Australia of the system honourable members on the Government benches desire to see operating. On behalf of their numerous friends in the financial world and a3 a repayment for the great work that those friends did to secure the return of the present Government parties during the last general election campaign, honourable gentlemen opposite intend to re-establish a system under which private financial institutions woulcl have made huge profits. The Banking Act 1945 give the Commonwealth Bank general jurisdiction over the advances policy of the private banks and also the power to decide whether their lending should be restricted or increased in the public interest. It also gave the Commonwealth Bank thc power to determine what rates of interest the private banks are to pay .and receive. Under that act the Commonwealth Bank also regulates the surplus investable funds of the private banks and authorizes the per payment of a very low rate of interest on the large sum that it at present holds for the private banks. I know that the 1945 act will not be altered so f a r as its actual wording is concerned, but if the means of effective control of the bank are removed the private banks can regain their former position. The people of this country are not likely to be deluded by the Government's statements to the effect that the 1945 act w ill not be altered, because they are aware of what lies behind the Government's present moves. They know that the Government intends to place the people of this country once more in pawn to the private banks and to the people who have so shackled this country with huge interest burdens over a period of years. It was stated in the last election campaign that the women of Australia were tlie camels of this country because of the huge burdens that they had to carry. Such burdens will be nothing to the financial burdens that the people will have to carry if the Government has its way. I shall show how much this country is in pawn through high interest rates. In 1888 the New South Wales Government raised a loan of Â£16,000,000 for railway construction. In 1944, when repayment of the loan fell due, the State had paid Â£26,000,000 in interest charges alone. to be paid in interest every day on the capital cost of building the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The same position occurs in relation to concerns like the Sydney County Council, which bas to pay 15s. from every Â£1 that it earns from the supply of electricity as interest on the capital cost of the council's allow any form of organization to operate generating plant. The people of Australia would have been saved those tremendous burdens if there had been a properly controlled financial system i 1 Australia in days gone by. It is th? desire of the Lahour party to ensure that never again shall such methods of financing public utilities operate in this country. On that basis Labour is prepared to carry on this fight on behalf of the people of Australia and to expose the Government's proposals for what they are worth. We shall do that also because we do not consider that the people gave the Government a mandate, at the last general election, on this particular issue. A combination of factors was responsible for a change of government at that election, but on this particular issue alone, we hold that the Government has no mandate and consider that at this particular stage of Australia's development, when co-operation between all sections of the community is so urgently required, it is doing the country a disservice by introducing a measure that will set class against class. I believe that that is an action which the people of Australia will not countenance. At present the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) is attempting to persuade American"" big business "" to invest in Australian Government loans for national development. same newspapers that contain news of that fact we find also items coTprnirg the huge unemployed army of America, which bas grown to such a degree that President Truman has sent an urgent message to Congress asking it to enact legislation to give relief benefits to about 6,000,000 people. We believe that these conditions could come here, because unemployment can grow with great momentum and we are not unmind.]/>. Fitzgerald. ful of the circumstances that operated from 1929 almost up to the beginning of World War II . We believe that it is our responsibility to the people of Australia An amount of Â£800 has to see that the economic conditions of those years never recur. We know that they will not recur while a Labour government is in office, provided that such a government is not shackled by outside interests as Labour governments have been in days gone by. A Labour government, remembering the past, would never in this country so as to hamper national activities. That is why we shall fight to the death any proposal by the Government that would, in our opinion, lead to a recurrence of the conditions that existed in the pre-waT years. Some people might be led to believe that the Oommonwealth Bank, as it is functioning at present, is almost a failure, but the facts show otherwise. Reference to the balance-sheet issued on the 30th June, 1949, shows that although the bank was originally established with an advance from the Treasury of only Â£10,000, it was able to produce a balance sheet last year that showed assets of more than Â£468,000,000. Last year the bank's aggregate net profit derived from its activities, including the Note Issue Department and the Commonwealth Savings Bank Department after making provision for contingencies was, in round figures, Â£7,683,000, which represented an increase of Â£508,000 over the previous year's profit of Â£7,175,000. In such circumstances one might well consider that there would be hardly any need to interfere with an organization doing such a magnificent job for this country. The figure represented in that increased profit would be a magnificent amount to place In th;> in the hands of the people who finance and support the parties opposite, and whose mouthpiece the present Government is. I repeat that, despite all threats offered by the Government, the Labour party accepts the challenge .contained in the present measure and will fight against the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board in the form in which the Government proposes to constitute it. The people of Australia recognize that the Labour party is fighting for their protection in thia matter, and, in the event of an election on thia issue, will realize that the labour party, in fighting for their protection, has done a magnificent job for Australia as a whole. support the bill. A great deal of criticism has been levelled against the proposal of the Government to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board. The history of the activities of the earlier board has been presented by Opposition members in a distorted fashion. We have been told that the board which controlled the Commonwealth Bank during the early 'thirties was responsible for the financial and economic depression, In a very moderate and convincing speech, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) told us what the board should have done in 1929 and in 1930 to meet the financial difficulties that then confronted this country. It has been suggested by honourable members opposite that had the board agreed to the proposal of the .Scullin Government to issue approximately Â£18,000,000 worth of fiduciary notes the troubles and horrors of the depression would have been avoided. eased. a fiduciary note which was issued by the German Government in 1923. It has a face value of 100,000 marks, which at one time would have purchased 5,000 British sovereigns. To-day, it is valueless. It is not even worth a cigarette unless one wants it as a souvenir. As a means of relieving the effects of the depression, the printing of notes in Australia, once started, might have reached the proportions experienced in Germany. It is all very well for Opposition members to be wise after the event. Many people went to race meetings during the Easter holidays. To-day all of them could tell us what horses they should have backed. They know now, but they did not know them. It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth Bank Board should have done this or that in the past. Let us consider the achievements of the earlier board. Australia, which was one of the last countries to feel the effects of management of the Commonwealth Bank the financial and economic depression, was the second country to extricate itself from the difficulties that resulted from that depression. I remind the honourable member for Bendigo that in 193'7 he used the splendid recovery that Australia had made from the effects of the depression as the basis for an application to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a prosperity loading on wages. The Commonwealth Bank Board was responsible for maintaining our financial structure and for so rapidly extricating this country from the effects of the depression. As the honourable member for Capriccrnia ( Mr Pearce) has said, the board is being treated as a scapegoat. I know that many members of this House suffered greatly during the depression years, but I do not agree that all of them are seated on the Opposition benches. One Opposition member told us that he was on the dole for eight years. Another has said that he existed on the dole for six years. We all agree that those who were forced to accept the dole suffered a most distressing experience and are deserving of our sympathy. Adversity usually has one of two effects on people. It either mellows them and makes them more considerate, or it embitters them and engenders a hatred in their minds against those whom they regard as having been responsible for their plight. I am inclined to think, from the utterances of those Opposition members who have recounted their experiences while they were on the dole that it has embittered their minds and clouded their judgment, with the result that they are looking for a scapegoat which they can blame for their adversity. They want to blame either the Commonwealth Bank Board or the trading banks. I have demonstrated that the earlier Commonwealth Bank Board considerably helped Australia to extricate itself from the effects of the depression. It guided our finances through a most difficult period and it did an excellent job. Its efforts have been commended by some Opposition members. In 1945, as most honourable members know, two measures were passed by this Parliament, one being the Commonwealth Bank Act which dealt with the and provided for the appointment of a Governor of the Bank whom it",26,Fadden

Mention has been made of the difficulty of selecting for appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board a person ""who will take an objective view of the problems that are placed before him. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) has said that when Mr Bruce, now Lord Bruce, accepted the portfolio of Prime Minister of Australia, he resigned from the directorates of all the companies with which he was then associated, but that immediately after he had relinquished office he resumed those directorships. That is true, but there was au inference in the honourable member's remarks that I should like to clear up. During the period when Mr Bruce was in the Ministry, first as Treasurer, and later as Prime Minister, he completely dissociated himself from the companies with which he had been formerly connected. AlthoughI took no interest in politics at that time, I knew that he had completely cut himself off from his former associates. At that time. I was doing business with one of the companies with which Mr Bruce had been associated, and I learned the facts. One of its directors complained that he was unable to get advice of any kind from Mr Bruce while Mr Bruce held office in the Parliament. Mr Bruce is not the only Australian who could be relied upon to abandon his personal interests if he were appointed to a hoard such as the Commonwealth Bank Board. It is the duty of the Governinent to protect the people from dictators, whether they be political, financial or industrial dictators. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 the Chifley Government appointed a dictator to control the Commonwealth Bank. Admittedly the Governor of the bank is answerable to the Treasurer, but he could do things which could wreck the finances of this country before the Treasurer even knew anything about them. It has been said that the Commonwealth Bank Board which is to be established under the measure now before us will meet only once a month. What authority is there for such a statement? The hoard will undoubtedly meet whenever it is necessary for it to do so, and I am sure that its members will not be divided into groups as is feared by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley). The right honourable gentleman is so imbued with party politics that he seems to think that the civil servants who are to be appointed to the board will aline themselves against the remaining five appointees. The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) in his wisdom will see that those whom he appoints to the board may be depended upon to state their honest opinions on all matters that come before them and will be capable of judging the value of the advice given by experts in the field of banking and finance. servants outnumber the other members of the board, all will be well. said that it will oppose this bill and use its majority in the Senate to reject it. I hope that before the Government takes that threat up and seeks a double dissolution it will proceed with a referendum to alter the method of electing the Senate and the number of senators to be elected. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) pointed out the position that obtains under proportional representation and the present method of electing the Senate and has suggested that nine senators should be elected from each State instead of ten. I suggest that instead of nine senators for each State there should be seven. If members in another plaee act as has been indicated here, that chamber will become so unpopular that the people will be very pleased to vote for a reduction of their number. I hope that members of the Opposition will remember that and will also realize that a referendum bill can be put to the people after a certain time has elapsed without prior reference to the Senate. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind and will consider reducing the number of senators so that if it becomes necessary to have a double dissolution a stalemate will not eventuate by the parties being evenly divided and so that the Government's legislation and the administration of this country will not be frustrated.

115,Mr Treloab,"The Opposition hasact that legislation is a dead horse in the track and need not be considered. It may be a dead horse but in the minds of the socialists on the Opposition benches it can still be used to their advantage. To-day we can call those honourable gentlemen socialists and they do not blush. They were very upset about being called socialists during the general election campaign but the Leader of the Opposition has now announced that he is a socialist and, consequently, his members are socialistically minded and can be called socialists without their taking a point of order and claiming that they have been insulted. Honourable members opposite wish to bring about the downfall of the trading banks. They want to monopolize the finances of this country and have them controlled by one man-the Governor of the Commonwealth Bankwhose decisions may be altered at the whim of the Treasurer. It would be totally unnecessary for them to introduce an act of parliament to do that. They have learned that since the High Court and the Privy Council declared to be invalid certain provisions of their legislation. They could attain their objective by slow strangulation. If the terms of the 1945 banking act were enforced the trading banks could be squeezed out of business very easily by resumption of their properties or in other ways. I am certain that it is in the minds of Opposition members that when they get on to the Government benches again they will not bother with acts of Parliament. They will proceed to squeeze out all competition by resumptions and every other little trick that the present legislait due for such a violent and summary tion allows. I hope that the Government, when framing its referendum proposals, will include a provision that will enable the people of this country to continue to manage their affairs and to have sufficient power to tell a government that it cannot go any further, and, if possible to revoke legislation, because that dead horse to which the Leader of the Opposition referred is in the track of Australian progress and is causing people overseas to lose confidence in us. Although it does not come within the ambit of this bill, I hope that the Government will see that Mr Treloar. the referendum proposals will be designed to protect the people against another raid on their savings and on the private trading interests of this country. When the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) was introducing this bill he stated that measures of such great importance should not be approached in a partisan spirit and that the primary principle was that legislation affecting the Commonwealth Bank should not be subject to frequent or violent change. I desire to examine the reasons which have animated the Government and those which have caused the Opposition to consider that this bill is not in the interests of the national economy. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar), who has just resumed his seat, expressed the desirability of approaching this matter in a non-partisan spirit. Yet the fears to which the Treasurer gave utterance and the statements that he made on this subject were the highlight of partisanship., Honourable members supporting the Government apparently regard it as their priceless privilege iu life to refer to such things as ""Raids upon trading banks"", "" Raids upon other types of banks"", and "" The inculcation of socialistic doctrines "" as a good argument. I should have thought that in order to be correct, logical and precise they should have shown that the present administration of the Commonwealth Bank had done -something inimical to the Commonwealth's interest; that it had failed to justify its existence and that as at present constituted, it had committed errors in administration or policy which had made overhaul as this measure represents. No reasons of that nature have been produced, so I say that there is no justification for the bill. Violent change is connoted in this legislation and it means another deviation from the character given to the Commonwealth Bank when it was founded in 1911. There is no justification for that violent change. The Commonwealth Bank, in its present form, is strictly a continuation of the original institution, which was born in the Commonwealth Parliament in 1911. Despite its vicissitudes over the years, the Commonwealth",33,Fadden
116,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [4.34],"Bank bas become a symbol in tbe minds of tbe people. At times its operations bave been adverse to tbe interests of people but, in the main, it has retained the vital principle of being operated and controlled by the people except for the period that commenced in 1924, when its complexion was changed. In order to justify the introduction of this bill, the Treasurer should have shown that since 1945, when the bank reverted almost to its original character, it had done something which had not been justified in the interests of the working people and all other people of this Commonwealth. Such proof cannot be and has not been produced because the record of the Commonwealth Bank since 1945 has been a truly magnificent one. Its record from 1911 to 1924 also was a magnificent one, but from 1924, when it lost its original identity and became a bank which was at variance with the people's interests, it was one which it may not be desirable to inject into this debate. I agree with the statement of the Treasurer that the determination of monetary policy should be a collective responsibility but contest his contention that this bill gives full effect to that principle. It does not, but on the contrary efficient authority its right to make a decision, subject to consideration by the government of the day. There is nothing in this bill which gives to the Parliament the right to alter, amend, or reject any of the decisions which the board to be constituted might make. The mere laying on the table of this House of an Executive Council minute does not give that right to this Parliament of the people. engendered in this discussion when it is asserted that the bill contains something that it lacks. I affirm the negative proposition and say positively that there is no such thing in this bill, which merely provides for a reversion to the old type of board which functioned in this Commonwealth from 1924 until 1945 and which did not give a very great service to the people of this country. I oan quite understand why honourable members now supporting the Government endeavour to ascribe to my party a great deal of personal opposition to the trading banks. I consider that that opposition is justified. The the great majority of the Commonwealth Bank exists, in principle, for the good of the people generally; but the trading banks, which will be the motivating force behind the newly constituted Bank Board, observe an entirely different principle, namely the pursuit of private gain. I submit to honourable members that the passage of this bill will be inimical to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The Labour party makes no secret of its opposition to it and to the private trading banks. Reference has been made during the course of the debate to the attitude of the trading banks to the elected representatives of the people in the recent election campaign. Evidence has been submitted to show that large sums of money were expended in order that the representatives of the working people might be displaced from their honoured positions in this House. The campaign was directed against me just as it was directed against every other Labour candidate. We expeet such opposition and rejoice in it, yet the level to which our enemies sank during the election campaign was something to be wondered at and despised. Even though takes away from an the Labour party's strength in this House was reduced, it still constitutes a vigorous Opposition and will continue to defend the rights of the people during the life of this Parliament. Considering the alliance of the trading banks with thc non-Labour parties, one would not expecr to receive from a Liberal member of Parliament a testimonial to the activities of the banks in opposition to those who disagree with their policy of alliance with A hypocritical argument is non-Labour parties. YetI received such a communication from a Liberal party member of a State parliament, and I take great pleasure in readine it to the House.

You are at liberty to make use of these facts I submit most earnestly to this House that in any way you think fit. (Signed) The people of Australia can draw from that their own conclusions about the relationship between the Liberal-Country party and the trading banks, whose sole objective is to crush the Commonwealth Bank. Australia has little to gain from this bill if it will bring about a reversion to the conditions that came into existence when a board was established in 1924 to control the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. My mind is drawn back irresistibly to the days of the economic depression. The policy of the Commonwealth Bank board, was merely an expression of trading bank policy, and, as a consequence, the late Mr E. G. Theodore, as the Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively cooperate with the trading banks and the Goand restoring employment. The truth was that an outside body was able to dictate the policy of the Government of the day. By refusing to grant the financial accommodation that the Government sought, the Commonwealth Bank Board considerably accentuated the most drastic effects of the economic depression. I live in an industrial suburb and represent people who work for their living and, therefore, would be subject to the first and most severe effects of any policy of financial strangulation. any reversion to the old system of board JOHN LECHTE. control of the Commonwealth Bank would be inimical to the interests of those people and others like them who constitute a great majority of the population.

I am sure that he would admit as much if he were questioned on the matter. Therefore, why should the time of the House be wasted in taking a division on the question? a motion was submitted. I was bound to put it to the House. This is a bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, as amended by legislation passed in 1945 and 1947. We have been told by .the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), and by various Government spokesmen, that the purpose of the bill is to give Jack, YV. M . effect to certain proposals to give effect to which the Government Lyons, Dame Enid received a mandate from the people McBride, P. A. at the last general election. Because of what they claim to be a mandate McEwen, J. from the people, Government supporters McMahon, YV. claim that the Opposition should accept this bill in its present form. The ComPage, Sir Earle monwealth Bank Act 1945 was passed Pittard, A. C. through this Parliament, and was submitted to the people-as an accomplished Spender, P. C. fact, it is true-a t the general election in Townley, A. G. 1946. The people returned the Labour Government to power, thus endorsing its Wentworth, W. C. action in amending the Commonwealth White. T. W. Bank Act. The parties that support the Wilson, K . C. present Government told the people before Davidson, C.

Let us assume, however, that the bill does propose to give effect to those promises. Even then, honours are even. The people have given two mandates, one to the Labour Government endorsing the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, and another to this Government endorsing the present bill. We say to the Government, deliberately and finally, that before this proposed legislation is passed into law, the Government should again consult the tralian Yvay, the issue would be decided by two out of three. After the Government's proposals had been explained to the people from every political platform throughout the country, the people could then give their final verdict. This is not the first, nor will it be the last, bill to come before the Parliament dealing with the Commonwealth Bank. Many attempts have been made to formulate a sound and workable banking system for Australia. Always when the stresses and strains inherent in the economic life of Australia have made their effects felt, the banking structure has proved incapable of dealing with the situation.

133,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [5.17],"Gwydir( Mr Treloar), in a personal explanation, which I doubt should really have been accepted as such, said that he did not blame God for the depressiongenerous concession from him-but blamed instead a former Labour government. The fact is that the malpractices, bad administration and stupid nnancial methods of a non-Labour government were responsible for the worse effects of the depression. The present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) must bear a good deal of the responsibility. During the years it was in office between the two wars, tralian Price Structure, written by Shann the Bruce-Page Government added heavily to the public indebtedness. the sort, as the figures show. were high, and the national income was high, and when the ordinary expenses of government might well have been-met out of revenue, the public indebtedness of the country was increased. able member denies it. I invite him to read a book entitled Thirty Years, written by a prominent journalist of the day, Mr A. N . Smith, in which a detailed history of events is given. In that book the writer said that the Bruce-Page Government had added heavily to the indebtedness of the country. time in which the 'financial and economic conditions were somewhat less buoyant than they are at the present time. The Government added Â£30,000,000 a year to Australia's' indebtedness overseas during the years that preceded the depression. Conference, Mr S. M. Bruce, now Lord Bruce, said that Australia was borrowing in London Â£30,000,000 a year, roughly the. amount of Australia's annual interest bill at the time. That was the stupid method offinancethat brought about the worse effects of the depression, yet the non-Labour parties in this House have continuously advocated during the last three years that Australia should revert to those unsound practices. It is true that all countries experienced the depression in some degree, but it is not true, as has been claimed by honourable members opposite, that the depression wasshorter and less severe in Australia than in any other country. The truth is that it was longer and worse in Australia than in most other industrialized countries. AgainI quote Mr S. M. Bruce as having said that the measures taken to counter the effects of the depression could not be much longer sustained in Australia, where they had been greater than in any other country. That statement is recorded in the book, The Ausand Copland in 1932. The economic history of all industrialized countries, including Australia, has been marked by a succession of booms and depressions. In boom times, the banks have expanded credits, thus further accentuating the boom. In time of depression they have hurriedly contracted credit, thus accentuating the effects of depression. During modern times, the tendency has been for the intervals between boom and depression to become shorter and shorter, and foi the depressions to become worse and worse, due largely to the ever-extending use of bank credit. It was for tha* reason that the Labour Government, in 1945, introduced its amending banking legislation. In part, that legislation wa.Â« designed to perpetuate controls introduced by the present Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), when he was Treasurer in the previous Menzies Government. The fact that those controls were imposed by regulations which required the trading hanks to open special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank shows that the activities of the trading banks needed to be regulated. If the trading banks had been themselves Speaking at the Ottawa capable of dealing with the situation, there would have been no need to introduce regulations, the only purpose of which was to ensure that the trading banks did not bring about a state of secondary inflation by extending credits. The banks themselves could have applied a policy of restriction in order to ensure that credit should not be unduly expanded, but the banks could not trust one another to adhere to such a policy. Therefore, fearful of what might happen if they were left to their own devices, the banks asked the Treasurer to take action, thus",39,Pairs

139,Mr Tom Burke,"Yes, in a boomdemonstrating that government action is necessary to control the banking system, and to prevent the recurrence of booms and depressions, with their ruinous effect upon the people. The history of banking is an interesting study. Step by step throughout the years, the various functions of the private banks have had to be taken over by governments, either by the imposition of controls, oi by direct acquisition. The first bankers in Britain were the goldsmiths, who issued notes against their gold holdings. They expanded credit in boom times, and contracted it in times of financial stringency, with ruinous effect upon the community. The right to issue coins was taken over by governments, and in England the business of the goldsmiths was eventually taken over by the Bank of England. Until fairly recent times, the banks had authority to issue their own bank notes, and they used that power to expand credit in good times, and to contract it in bad times, thus accentuating the recurring cycle of boom and depression. Eventually, governments had to intervene, and assume authority for the issue of bank notes in every modern industrial country. However, by the time that action was taken in Australia, the importance of the note issue had largely disappeared so far as its effect upon the general economic life of the community was concerned. By 1924, the expansion and contraction of credit was effected, not by the issue or withdrawal of bank notes, but by the expansion or contraction of bank credit, a process which achieved the same results as had formerly been achieved by the manipulation of the note issue. Therefore, it is clearly proved that, as in the early stages, certain functions of the private banks had to be taken over or closely and firmly regulated by governments, so to-day the control of bank credit must be taken over by governments, either by nationalization, as we proposed, or by stringent regulation such as was proposed in the Banking Act 1945. That act, which this bill proposes to amend, sought to achieve the purposes of the Labour party in two major ways. The first was by a degree of controlled expansion of advances. Of course, no provision was made, and in my view, it could not have been made, against a contraction of bank advances. However, an endeavour was made to prevent an over-expansion of bank credit in Australia, and, with the Commonwealth Bank guaranteeing deposit accounts in all the trading banks in Australia, we hoped to prevent a contraction of bank credit. The Chifley Government also encouraged the Commonwealth Bank to expand its activi ties along two natural lines. The first was by taking over the banking business of State government and semi governmental authorities. That is inherent in central banking practice. It is accepted by all experts and writers, and. indeed, by bankers throughout the world that a central bank that is operated by a central government should have control of the accounts of State governments and semi-governmental bodies. An authority much closer to home-the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systemsindicates clearly that that system should be adopted in Australia. The royal commission submitted a questionnaire to the Commonwealth BankBoard on that matter. ""We must remember that the members of that board had been nominated by the Lyons Government, a non-Labour administration, and were the representatives of various interests throughout Australia. The royal commission asked the board whether it considered that the Commonwealth Bank should control the accounts of the State governments. The reply, which was not inspired, I believe, by any political motives whatsoever, was that the Oommonwealth Bank should, as a part of its central banking machinery, hold the accounts of all State governments. The board added, of its own volition, the view that the 'Commonwealth Bank should also hold the accounts of semi-governmental bodies and other authorities that had been established by Act of Parliament or under municipal law. The board pointed out that such power was vital to its functioning as a central bank. However, that section of the Banking Act 1945 was invalidated by a decision of the High Court of Australia, on test, but. the remaining sections remain iu operation. Members of the Labour party say to the people of Australia, quite deliberately, that the purpose of the Government in introducing this bill is to ensure that thc Commouwealth Bank Act 1945 shall never be operated while it remains in office. Honourable members opposite have claimed that a bank board provides a more democratic approach to the control of banking. They appear to believe that a bank board must be more responsible, and expert, and better capable of ensuring continuity of banking policy than is possible under the system of control by a governor who is appointed for a term of seven years. But none of those views is borne out by the speeches that have been delivered by the Treasurer and his supporters on this bill. Unless all the members of the proposed board are financial experts or authorities on statistics and treasury practice, the board will not be an expert authority, no matter how great the ability of the members may be in other spheres. The fact that members of the board will retire from time to time will not provide for the same continuity of policy as does the present system of control by a governor. Therefore, none of the requirements of the test that the Government has posed is answered by the provisions of the bill. We are told that, in the final analysis, banking control will be vested in the Parliament. Of course, that will be so. The bill merely provides that, in certain circumstances, a statement setting out the details of a dispute between the board and the Treasurer shall be laid on the table of the Senate and the House of Representatives; but, so far as I am aware, neither of the two chambers will be empowered to disallow the decision of the Treasurer. That, in my view, does not fulfil the promise that was made to the people of Australia by the present Prime Minister during the recent general election campaign, and does not provide any control of the Commonwealth Bank that does not exist under the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945. Therefore, I look for the reason that the Treasurer about the activities of the has caused the Government to introduce trading banks during that campaign, and this bill. Every banking measure that I shall read to the House a part of it has been introduced into the Parliament has been violently opposed by the banks have engaged in political activities by trading banks. The original proposals (a) opposing any particular legislation, (6) for the control of the note issue were opposing strongly resisted by the protagonists of coercing their employees, (e) awarding special the private banks and the political parties promotion to those employees who do their Mr Tom Burke. that are now known as the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. The establishment of the Commonwealth Bank itself was fiercely opposed. Mr Alfred Deakin moved that the original Commonwealth Bank Bill be referred to a select committee for investigation and report, his motive clearly being to defeat that legislation. According to the evidence of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act in 1920 was strongly opposed by private financial interests. The minutes of evidence of that commission also disclose that the amending legislation that was introduced in 1924 by the then Treasurer, Sir Earle Page, was fiercely opposed by the banking interests of the day. Indeed, one provision of that act has never been proclaimed, apparently because it was opposed so vigorously by the trading banks. I need hardly remind honourable members of the strong opposition that was advanced by the private banks to the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945. The only banking legislation in Australian political history that has not been fiercely assailed by the trading banks is the present bill, but, significantly enough, it has been criticized by branches of the Liberal party in various States, whilst the proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board was condemned by the Wheat Growers' Federation conference in Western Australia only last week. The trading banks apparently accept this bill as a complete pay-off for the part that they played in supporting the non-Labour parties during the recent general election campaign. Honourable members opposite were irate when the honourable member for Hoddle( Mr Cremean) declared that in a large measure they owed their election to the Parliament to the activities of the trading banks against the Labour party. Eecently, I addressed a comprehensive question to Is there any evidence to indicate that the any party or government, (c) financing any party, (d) directing, restraining, or bidding, (/) making special bonus payments to employees on the result of certain public election, and (g) using undue influence on clients or prospective clients? tion. ask the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) to listen to the answer that I received from the Treasurer. Mr ""WENTWORTH I rise to order. is worthwhile pointing out that during the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke), the chair at the table has been occupied by the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Dame Enid Lyons). This is the first occasion on which a lady has been in charge of the business of the House, and I think that it should not pass unnoticed. Cameron) -There is no point of order. that it is very pleasant to look at the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I am not able to make the same remark about the Minister for Supply( Mr my view, the democratic institutions of Beale). The question that I addressed to the Treasurer appeared to me to be a grave indictment of the banking system. If the private banks had done auy or all of those things to which I referred, they probably exceeded the powers that have been given to them in their memorandum and articles of association. The Treasurer, in his reply, did not say that the trading banks had not done any of those things, but, by implication, he agreed that they had done all the things to which I . had referred. He saidThe honourable member will be aware that the trading banks were vitally affected by the late Government's Bank Nationalization legislation, and when the people were given an opportunity to pass judgment on the proposals, they emphatically rejected them. The Treasurer, by implication, admitted, in far stronger terms, the charge that was made by the honourable member for Hoddle. There are no grounds for argument. We know perfectly well that the trading banks played a discreditable part iu the last general election campaign. Indeed, they played a part that is not permissible in most democratic countries. selves. member has no better defence than that, he had better go back to the trading banks. In the United States of America, which is the home of private enterprise, the It trading banks are not permitted to subscribe either directly or indirectly to the funds of any political party. A similar position exists in Belgium. The same is true in Canada and the United Kingdom, in fact though not in law. Therefore, the statement that was made by the honourable member for Hoddle does not admit of argument. It is true beyond dispute, and, in addition, it is a challenge to democracy (Hon. Archie in this country. The trading banks may exert enormous coercive power. They have an immense power for good if they are willing to be regulated by some authority which has only the interests of Australia at heart. If they refuse to be regulated in the same way as private banks are in other countries, they become an enormous power for harm. They not only do great harm, but also subvert, in the country. I pass to another matter that was mentioned by the Treasurer. The right honourable gentleman told us that the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank would be continued. What we desire him to tell us is whether the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank will be expanded. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, a clear instruction was given to the management to expand its trading bank activities. The Labour party regards that expansion of business as vital to the public interest, and as a controlling factor, if rigorous control should ever again be required in the Australian economic sphere. I believe that it will be. The Labour party also considers that a foolish and uneconomic practice has been carried out in certain sections of banking in this country. A large measure of thefinancingof the capital works of farmers and business men on overdraft is stupid and even suicidal. The mortgage bank department of the",40,Pairs

We demand that the Treasurer tell us whether the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank are to be not merely maintained but actually expanded in vigorous competition with the trading banks. In addition, we desire to know the steps that are to be taken in respect of a number of important items. I believe that the Commonwealth Bank Board will be merely a facade behind which the Treasurer of the present non-Labour Government will implement his policy without having the responsibility of taking a deliberate action. Certain decisions of major importance must be made shortly by some authority, or the government. I refer, first, to the Australian exchange rate which is of vital interest at the present time. Incidentally, it has -been responsible for attracting many millions of pounds to Australia, if the financial pages of the newspapers can be taken as a guide. Speculators throughout the world are seeking to earn the benefit of the possihle appreciation of the Australian Â£1.

Under the 1945 banking legislation all those who occupy the office of Treasurer of the Commonwealth are given the same dictatorial powers over the financial policy of the Commonwealth Bank and of the Commonwealth itself until this new legislation is passed. Control was placed in the hands of one man. It was tn remedy that state of affairs that the present bill was introduced by this Government. To illustrate how in one respect the possession of such dictatorial powers could be inimical to the interests of this country I point out that although the former Treasurer, who is the present Leader of the Opposition, mu9t have known in 1947, from the advice tendered to him by the Advisory Council, that an inflationary trend was commencing, he did nothing about it. Although he had complete control of the financial policy of the Commonwealth, he did nothing to stop that inflationary trend. Wliat credence can be placed on the suggestions of the right honourable gentleman that it is not possible to find throughout the length and breadth of Australia a man competent to be appointed to the proposed Commonwealth Bank Board? Is it seriously suggested that it is impossible to obtain men of the requisite ability and integrity to undertake such a task? The Leader of the Opposition and ether honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Hoddle( Mr Cremean), have attacked the members of the Bank Officers Association for their opposition to Labour's banking policy. It is common knowledge that that association is purely a voluntary body and that during the election campaign which they themselves had subscribed to combat the Chifley Government's proposals. Not only one Labour spokesman, but many honourable members opposite have characterized the members of that association as the tools of the private banks. Let us examine the facts. It is common knowledge that many bank employees, principally the junior officers, were strong supporters of the Labour party. Many of the older employees supported the Labour party in their youth, but as they grew up and gained experience, they realized that they should change their political views. All honourable members on this side of the House are aware of the fact that in the past bank employees in large numbers voted for Labour candidates. Yet from the time that the nationalization of banking was first mooted in 1947 until to-day not one word was said about undue pressure being exerted by the private banks on their employees. We all know how the Labour propaganda machine works. Do honourable members think that during the last three years we should not have heard of undue pressure being exerted on. the employees of private banks if in fact pressure had been put up on them? Honourable members opposite would not have lost the opportunity to draw attention to such a state of affairs if in fact it had existed. To-day, for the first time, such a suggestion was made by the honourable member for Hoddle, who quoted a letter which he had received from one of his political friends. For what purpose did the employees of the private banks form themselves into a voluntary association ? They are engaged in the business of banking and although many of them may not be experts in central banking and the higher forms of banking, they see the trading banks in operation and they realize that the interests of the community are strengthened by the competition between those banks. Honourable members opposite in the speeches they make on the hustings and also in their maiden speeches in this House have grossly distorted the facts about the Bank Officers Association. During the general election campaign the association followed only one line of propaganda-anti-socialism . Were they its members used funds right? Of course they were. Did not the present Leader of the Opposition say that the election was heing fought on the It is wielded by my respected leader, the basis of socialism versus capitalism. The present Treasurer ( Mr Fadden). I put right honourable gentleman admitted that it to the House that at no time during the Labour party was playing for big these sittings of the Parliament has the stakes. Yet the employees of the banks Opposition expressed any confidence in have been attacked because they said the right honourable gentleman. To spare that the Labour party intended to bring their blushes I merely remind them that about the socialization of the banks. amongst other things they have described That same charge was levelled by honorhim as "" irresponsible "". able members opposite against every member on this side of the House. The private banks have also been attacked by honourable members opposite They have no confidence in him. on the grounds that they favour the establishment of pools of unemployed and that Liberal party. they caused the financial and economic depression that visited this country in the withstanding what I have said, they desire 'thirties. Those charges were levelled to retain in the hands of a person whom against the banks as a part of Labour's they do not trust complete power over the propaganda of fear. The statement that financial policy of this country. What the Leader of the Opposition made at a sort of reasoning is that? Do they think meeting of the Macquarie Electoral that they will not be long in Opposition? Council on that subject will have a profound effect on politics in Australia do. during the next few years. In the future, all Labour members will have to come out into the open. They will have to they are wrong.

Another charge made against the Liberal party and the Australian Country party is that they are trying to kill the Commonwealth Bank. That charge has been levelled against them on several occasions. I have taken the trouble to look up the figures relating to deposits and advances. I find that in 1930 deposits in the Commonwealth Bank amounted to approximately Â£43,000,000 and advances to Â£13,000,000. amounted to Â£129,000,000 and advances to Â£35,000,000. That is an extraordinary way to kill a bank! Another fatuous charge that has been made by honourable members opposite is that the Commonwealth Bank Board engineered .the financial and economic depression of the 'thirties. The private banks have also been continually charged with being responsible for the depression. The honourable member' for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) was particularly bitter in his attack on the private banks. I do not need to champion the cause of the private banks for they are well able ,to look after themselves. For some considerable time honourable members opposite have adopted towards the private banks the sort of ugly tactics that one associates with our friends the "" Commos"". They have adopted a smear campaign. They believe in the principle that if a thing is given a bad name for long enough the people are likely to believe that it should have a bad name. What had the private banks to do with the depression? They had nothing to do with it whatsoever. The depression began in Europe long before it began in this country. The depression in Australia was caused by the fall of export prices. Have honourable members opposite ever taken time to examine the profits of the private banks? I have taken the trouble to do so, and I have found that since 1926 bank shares have yielded a return of not more than 3^ per cent, to 4 per cent., which is approximately 1 per cent, greater than the present yield from Government bonds. A great deal of the talk against the private banks, which are supposed to be making vast sums of money at the expense of the people, is due entirely to the adoption [53] of a false view of their activities. Oan a bank make money in a depression? Oan a man who is unemployed exercise purchasing power? Of course not. The object of the banks is to maintain prosperity. The profits of banks fell during the depression. The depression is coming up in every speech in every session of this Parliament. It has an ugly note. A depression may never come again. Constant talk about depressions causes an unhealthy attitude to the future. We now know In 1942 deposits how to deal with depressions and they should not be brought into arguments in a country with a future such as Australia has before it. During the depression the banks increased their advances although there were falls in their securities. This eountry owes a tremendous lot to private banks. During the depression there were a few people that went to the wall, but in all branches of commerce there arts some bad risks and if some people suffered by having mortgages foreclosed they were bad security risks and no bank was entitled to take a bad risk with public money. What guarantee is there that if there had been one central bank there would have been any improvement ? What guarantee is there that if we had only had one bank the depression could have been avoided? None at all. The peculiar thing is that all the experts on depressions say that if there had been a socialized bank they would have been able to handle the depression better; but the whole world of banking fell down during the depression. I think it was the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) who said that the depression was worse in Australia than anywhere else in the world. That is not true. In 1934, at the International Labour Conference in Geneva, it was reported that Australia had recovered more completely and more quickly than any other country in the world. Professor D. B. Copland, M.A. D.Sc. in his book, What have the Banks Donef says, with regard to the depressionBut whether hy design or by accident, their policy was later shaped to meet thc needs of the country in a rather remarkable way. Indeed, it ""is not too much to say that the banking policy of Australia was really more enlightened than that of almost any other country. Critics w ill , no doubt, regard this real reason behind the introduction of this as an exaggeration but it w ill be wise for them to withhold judgment until the complete story is told. I think that Professor Copland has been an adviser of the Labour party on all the trade unions bank? Why cannot they bank with the Commonwealth Bank? When the funds of certain unions were frozen it was found that those funds were in private banks. One honourable member of the Opposition even had a safe deposit in the Bank of New South Wales. It has been said that these banks treated people harshly during the depression, yet people still bank with them. Lest honourable members should think that I am biased in favour of the private banks I should like to say that all my own personal business is done with the Commonwealth Bank. Throughout this debate and throughout the election campaign and in fact, ever since the passage of the legislation to nationalize the banks went through this House, we have heard the same scurrilous attacks on the private banks. None of those attacks have been substantiated in any way. They all arise from one motive, which is the socialization of all banks. That is the sole motive that I see behind the opposition to this bill. honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) said that when Mr ment and the honourable member for Scullin was Prime Minister he could not make use of the resources of the Commonwealth Bank because the institution was controlled by a board. But there were ways in which the government of that time could have used the resources of the bank. by honourable members opposite on this bill is the fact that they see in the new bank board, as distinct from the present advisory counil, an obstacle in the way of attaining socialization. the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) who was the previous speaker on this side of the House ?eferred to the attitude of honorahle members opposite in relation to the activity of the private trading banks, their profits and the part they played in the recent depression. Before dealing with the comments of the honourable member I propose to outline to the House the sinister measure by the Treasurer ( Mr Eadden). In the course of his speech the Treasurer statedI n 1945 we foreshadowed that, when ie-elected to the Treasury benches, we would many occasions. Where do regard ourselves as being obliged to review the working of the 1945 Banking Legislation, and that we would reconstitute a Commonwealth Bank Board. In 1947 we left no doubt whatever of our intention to defeat the nationalization proposals by every constitutional means at our command. That promise which he said was given to the electors was given in this House in 1945 even before he had had an opportunity of seeing how the Labour legislation of that time was to aet to the advantage of the people of this country. The changes that are being made by this bill are to fulfil the obligations entered into by the Government to .their financial supporters at the recent federal election. The Government has designed this measure in order to repay its election expenses to the private banks of this country. has no evidence of that. for Grayndler has alleged that my election expenses were paid by the private banks.

Distasteful as it is to bonorable members, this is a pay-off to the interests that supported them in the recent federal election and spent huge funds in an effort to unseat the Chifley Government. It is just another step in the efforts of honourable members opposite to destroy completely the Commonwealth Bank as we know it. If one studies the attitude of honourable members opposite and their predecessors in relation to the Commonwealth Bank one finds that from the time of its inception in 1911, they viciously opposed its creation and its continued existence. In 1924, the Treasurer of the day, the present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), brought in legislation to set up the bank board. In 1945 and 1947, honourable members opposite, or their counterparts, lined up in an endeavour to destroy legislation in relation to the Commonwealth Bank that was designed to benefit the people. The Treasurer knows that the 1945 legislation is effective. He admitted that in his speech, and the only reason that this move has been made to change the administration of the Commonwealth Bank is that he wants to satisfy those private banks which gave funds to his party to defeat the Labour Government-the people's government. Those banks paid their employees to work for the defeat of the previous Government. In 1945, when the banking legislation which is now being repealed was introduced into this chamber by the present Leader of the 'Opposition ( Mr Chifley), the present Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) said that the legislation was consistent with the Labour party's policy to convert Australia into a socialistic state. knows that the 1945 legislation is effective. He is one, no doubt, who bounced In his speech on this measure, he said that the 1945 legislation was perfect ancl did not need to be overhauled except for the purpose of the establishment of a bank board. He said that the Labour government intended the bankinsr legislation of 1945 to be the first step towards the socialization of the means of provision for production, distribution and exchange, and that the issue was socialization versus free enterprise. I said, "" Honourable memlegislation would affect our standing abroad and that the special deposits amounted to confiscation without compensation. . He criticized the note issue provisions of the 1945 legislation, paid lip service to the statements of the Prime Minister, and told the people what would happen if th? 1945 legislation was implemented. These views were also expressed by honourable members opposite who are the principal supporters of the private banking interests. Having shown what honourable gentlemen opposite thought at that time of the Chifley Government's legislation, I repeat the words that the Treasurer used when he introduced this measure a few day? ago. He saidIn respect of central banking operations and otherwise, the Commonwealth Bank and the other banks have achieved a considerable measure of harmony and co-operation and the Government is satisfied that the broad purposes of monetary and banking policy are being achieved. For this reason and the fact that it would be undesirable to make frequent changes in legislative requirements affecting the banking system he said that the Government had decided to preserve the general pattern of control by the Commonwealth Bank over the banking system and the broad structure of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet a deliberate attempt is now being made to undermine the structure of this bank by means of false and insincere statements because outside banking interests demand that honourable members opposite shall take thi.? action. The Treasurer of the honourable member for Macarthur. around the country and told the people that dreadful effects would come from the 1945 legislation. He cannot "" take it "" when the falsity of the charges against the Labour party that gained his election to this Parliament is exposed on the authority of no less a person than the Treasurer.

171,Mr Daly,"That gets under the skinsomersault in relation to the 1945 hanking legislation. Its present attitude betrays the falsity of the charges that it made against the Labour Government. I have already discussed the Government's change of front in relation to the sections of the 1945 legislation that deal with competition, special deposits, the note issue, and the establishment of a bank board. Broadly speaking, it has accepted the socialist legislation of a Labour government as the basis of its tanking reform. To use the words of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Mackinnon), because he has just sold his Gullett), it proposes to leave in control of the Gommonwealth Bank a doctrinaire socialist in the person of Dr. Coombs, who will be the chairman of the proposed board. that the Government intends to leave Dr. Coombs in that position only because, with the establishment of the proposed board, he will be bereft of power and will be at the mercy of the representatives of private interests who will be appointed to the board. At present Dr. Coombs, as Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, is responsible only to the Treasurer in the event of any great difference of opinion arising in relation to nnancial policy. He has for his guidance an Advisory Council consisting of specialists in finance who ought to know everything that there is to be known about banking policy. But the Government seeks to leave Dr. Coombs only nominally in control of the bank. TJnder its proposal he will be without power to act because he will be outvoted by the Government's nominees on the board. The Government will do what anti-Labour governments did in years gone by when they appointed bedstead manufacturers and polo players to the former Commonwealth Bank Board. The members of the present Opposition risked everything to give effect to their enlightened policy on banking. They willingly placed their Government in jeopardy in order that the people of Australia might be protected from private financial interests. Supporters of the Government may laugh as much as they like and declare that we aTe only making a sham-fight on this issue, but I warn them that, if they press on with this measure, the Opposition, Mr Daly. acting according to its principles, will ensure that they face up to their responsibilities before the electors. ""We know what will happen if the bill becomes law. The Government will choose individuals from the general community, in addition to a few financial specialists, in order to complete the proposed board. It has announced that it will find people who are not associated in any way with private financial institutions. Perhaps it will choose the honourable member for Wannon( Mr shares in private banks. .That is the sort of thing that was done by anti-Labour governments when the former Commonwealth Bank Board was in existence. It The people should realize might even choose somebody like the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), who is not connected with banking. How tragic that would be for the nation! The Opposition has resolved that it will not fall for the Government's proposition. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, we intend to oppose every clause in the bill relating to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank board. We want to retain the existing system of control that was established by the 1945 legislation, under which the Governor, aided by the Advisory Council, whose members know all that there is to be known about finance, is responsible to the Treasurer and the Parliament. The history of anti-Labour activities in relation to banking is a sorry story. The Labour party believes that the effect of banking and financial policy generally is so great that it intimately concerns the life of every citizen and therefore that huge instrumentalities that control financial policy should be governed by the elected representatives of the people. In other words, we believe that the Parliament in order should decide financial policy, irrespective of the political complexion of the parties that command a majority in it. We have had bitter experience of the control of banking policy by private interests. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Charles Anderson) declared that the trading banks had nothing to do with the onset of the depression, but I refer him to the report of the royal commission that was appointed by a tory government to inquire into monetary and Labour party is viciously opposed to any banking systems.

That is the sort of thing that the representatives of financial interests will do and that is why the Labour party opposes the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank Board and will not allow the Government to putback into power those who seek to destroy the influence of the people's bank. I also remind the House of the occasion when the chairman of the former Commonwealth Bank Board, Sir Robert Gibson, dictated to the elected Government of Australia the terms and conditions upon which the board would provide for the people, through their own bank, sufficient finance to enable them to throw back the tide of depression. This story will bear repetition over and over again as a warning to the present generation of Australians of the tactics that will be used by financial interests in order to gain their own ends. On the 13th February, 1931, Sir Robert Gibson wrote to the Treasurer of the day, Mr No honourable member on the GovernTheodore, in the following terms:Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other of the bank by the government of the day factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively cooperate with the trading banks and the Governments of Australia in sustaining industry and restoring employment. Every honourable member who believes that banks and other financial institutions exist for the purpose of serving the ordinary man and woman should bear in mind the attitude that they adopted towards the people on that occasion. The Commonwealth Bank Board should have been the servant of the people and should have been subservient to the will of the Parliament acting in accordance with the mandate of the people. Therefore, it should have provided the finance that was needed to prevent nation-wide suffering. It should not have been necessary for the government of the day to appeal to the board. Mr Theodore, to his credit, replied to the chairman of the board in the following terms:The attitude of the board throughout the recent negotiations, and as disclosed in the Mr Daly. letter now referred to, can only be regarded by the Commonwealth Government as an attempt on the part of the bank to arrogate to itself a supremacy over the Government in the determination of the financial policy of the Commonwealth, a supremacy which, I aro sure, was never contemplated by the framers of the Australian Constitution, and has never been sanctioned by the Australian people. That occurrence stiffened the opposition of the Labour party to the Commonwealth Bank Board. We say that governments, no matter what their political colour, should obtain the finance to provide for all the people, and should carry out their policies and impOement the mandates given to them. The days have gone when governments could be dictated to, as was the Scullin Government and the Lang Government, by financiers and other interested groups.. We shall not again see a case such as occurred in Victoria, where one man, because of his financial power and his desire to serve financial interests, was able to wreck a government elected by the people. The 1945 banking legislation gave to the people of this country a bank managed in their own interests and subject to the Parliament of the day. ment side, including the Treasurer, can point to one failing in that banking system. Political control, and domination to implement its own policy, cannot be shown at any point. Tribute has been paid by all members of the community to the benefits of the 1945 legislation. That being so, why should change be sought? If the bank is being managed in the interests of Communists, and if it is being brought under political control and if the officers are not efficient, why does the Treasurer not say so? He well knows that this bill is only to fulfil the Government's obligations to interested parties in the banking field in order to give them complete control of the Commonwealth Bank, as they had prior to 1932. Every honourable member in this House realizes the significance of banking in the community. They realize that the salvation of this country during the war and at other times, particularly during the present time, depended to a considerable degree upon the financial stability brought about by the Commonwealth Bank. If the Government is",51,Pairs
178,"Parliament, Mr Mcdonald, And The Man","sincere and honest why does it not carry out its policy by selling these great socialistic institutions? It is a shocking thing that honourable members on the Government side, who have bitterly assailed and tried to destroy this bank are not honest and frank enough to show the people clearly their intention, without using this back-door method of removing control from the Government and placing it in the hands of private interests. Why do they not say that they mean to destroy it? If they do so they will get their answer from the people who have learned the value of the bank. The Government may think that the Opposition is opposing this bill for political purposes. Nothing is further from the truth. We oppose banking proposals such as this because we realize the profound effect that financial policy has on the live and welfare of the people country. cf the depression years, although I am not going to dwell on that. We realize that in more recent times our legislation has been attacked by private financial interests. We fully understand the power of finance, as was shown in the recent election, and we realize how it can work under false banners. Above all else, we have the cardinal responsibility, apart from expediency or anything else, of retaining the Commonwealth Bank as the people's bank which holds the people's money and should therefore be controlled by the people's representatives. controls the bank, through men such as the previous Government appointed to its staff shall be have full control of the financial structure in the interests Australia. This sell-out the Labour party will vigorously oppose. The Government's move to destroy the bank will not stand investigation, and whatever the consequences may be the Opposition will do its best to ensure that the legislation introduced in 1945, in the face of great opposition, shall be preserved. That legislation, even to-day, has won the commendation of the Treasurer who introduced this bill. rise to support this bill but before discussing the merits of the measure I should like to make passing reference to tvro small matters which were raised during the debate by Opposition speakers. The first concerns the references made to the part taken by bank employees in the recent general election. I should like to make it plain that I am speaking not of hanks but of hank employees. I do not speak about the banks because I have no qualification to do so. I know nothing about the banks. I have no connection at all with them. I am not aware that in my election campaign I had any contact with a banker, using the term in the sense of one who directs the policy of a bank, or even any conversation with bankers unless there were by chance some bankers among the interjectors who occasionally interrupted my meetings. I desire to speak only about things of which I know. I was chairman of my of this own campaign committee. I directed We realize the bitterness that organization and I know who worked for me and who did not. I know what money was spent on my behalf in the campaign. I am aware of the existence of a bank employees antisocialization committee.

Whatever that organization did was done of its own volition and by its own enterprise and not as part of a campaign organized by me.

They voluntarily offered their services to me, a fact which I appreciated. of the people of In some cases they were men that I hai' known since boyhood and who had grown up in my community.

Turning now to the bill itself it has seemed to me that a great deal of the debate on it has been a mixture of ancient and very much perverted history, and of imagination. after speaker on the Opposition side has indicated that in his own imagination he has already appointed the bank board. The Opposition members have already decided what policies that board will adopt, and in their own imaginations have worked out certain consequences that arp sure to follow.

The main opposition was made to the provisions of the bill relating to the bank board. I listened with amazement, perhaps because I am a new member of this House, to the way the Leader of the Opposition developed his arguments against the proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. My amazement was due to the discovery that behind his air of benignity and homespun honesty there lurked as considerable a mental arrogance as one could encounter in many a day's march. There was a certainty that",53,Pairs

185,Mr Hasluck,"I know who hashe alone in this country was aware of all the implications of financial policy and that he alone was competent to say what was in the best interests of Australia. That mental arrogance extended to his remarks about experts. He spoke of his reliance on experts, and their value, but it became more and more evident, although it was not explicitly stated, that his definition of an expert was a man who thought exactly the same way as he did. And that mental arrogance seemed to reach its peak when he turned to speak in defence of the provisions of the 1947 act for the control of the financial policy of Australia. At one stage, the Leader of the Opposition said that decisions on financial policy should rest with the Government. At that point the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) interjected, ""And not with the Parliament ?"" The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Eosevear) replied with another interjection, "" It is the same thing"". The original remark and the interjection seemed to me to disclose that members of the Opposition have completely ignored the lessons of the last election, when the people clearly declared their desire that they, through the Parliament, wished to retain control over the actions of the Government. They are not prepared to hand over to governments authority to act in complete disregard of the interests of minorities. They are prepared to recognize executive authority in the' Government, but they are not prepared to abandon their right, exercised through their elected representatives, to set a safeguard upon the Government. The Leader of the Opposition said something to the effect that no one was better qualified to conduct the financial policy of the country than the Treasurer, or better informed as to how it should be done. He made that statement in support of the legislative provision which enabled the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to exercise what was virtually a financial dictatorship. The point which the Leader of the Opposition missed was that it is not a question of expertness or knowledge or information in the possession of the Treasurer that matters; it is the question of dictatorship. That is what we object to. Our objection to that honourable members opposite should the Treasurer exercising sole control remember that this proposed legislation rests, not on the ground that he is incompetent or insufficiently informed, but on the democratic ground that we disapprove of dictatorship, and a financial dictatorship is just as objectionable as any other kind. There is a close analogy between what the Leader of the Opposition said, and the sort of argument that used to be advanced in defence of fascism in Italy. There, the common argument was that at least Mussolini did make the trains run, and that his government was efficient. The whole justification for a financial dictatorship as advocated by the Leader of the Opposition was that it would be efficient, that it would be expert and knowledgeable. That same argument has heen used to justify every dictatorship. Apart from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, the speeches of most honourable members on the other side have dealt with the experiences of the financial and economic depression of the 'thirties. The argument was developed in its most concise way by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), who reviewed the history of the Commonwealth Bank and its alleged failure to act effectively in 1930. However, the criticisms of the honourable member for Bendigo, and of other members of the Opposition, was not criticism of the form of bank control exercised in 1930; it was criticism of the policies that were applied in 1930. For my own part, I admit frankly that the policies applied in 1930 were unwise, but those policies did not arise out of the form of control of the Commonwealth Bank, nor did they arise out of viciousness in any section of the community. I think we ought to learn a little humility from history, and to realize that a good deal of error arose out of sheer ignorance. That ignorance was not peculiar to one side of politics, but was common throughout the political and economic life of this and other countries. A good deal of the trouble in 1930 was due, not to any particular system of banking control, but to sheer economic ignorance of what to do in the circumstances that existed. Proceeding from that point, I suggest of 1950 constitutes a very considerable advance over any legislation that a government of the political complexion of the present Government would have been prepared to introduce twenty years ago. Political thought has not remained stationary. We are not living in 1930. The non-Labour Government in power to-day is not the government that was in power in 1929. or in 1932. We have moved with the times. The ignorance that prevailed in 1930 has, in a large measure, been dissipated. Just as we are prepared to credit members of the Opposition vvith having grown up politically since 1930, so it ought to have entered into the liberality of their thought we ean learn many lessons from history, that we, too, have learned something since 1930. If this hill be examined objectively, not in the light of twenty years ago, but in the light of circumstances as they exist in 1950, it will be recognized as a moderate, well-intentioned measure designed to provide emcient control of the Commonwealth Bank, and to give ample opportunity for that bank to play an effective part in the financial and economic life of the country. Therefore, I commend the bill to thc House. The arguments advanced against it are rooted in a condition of affairs that no longer exists. Those who oppose the hill are trying to interpret present events in the light of twenty years ago. Actually, this bill sets out to do three things. First, it removes the danger of nationalization. That is a matter upon which the mind of the people has heen made abundantly clear. Secondly, the bill institutes a form of control of thi Commonwealth Bank which pays due deference to the need for expert guidance and judgment, but which also pays deference to the need for some sort of representative or democratic membership of a body the decisions of which will have so important an effect on the lives and well-being of a great many people. Thirdly, it retains from the 1945 act those provisions which give the Commonwealth Bank ample opportunity to do the work it was intended to do. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [9.10] -On the face of it, this bill appears, as the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck) bas said, to be a liberal measure. It sets up what purports to be a democratic form of control of the Commonwealth Bank, so that responsibility for decisions will be spread among a number of persons. It even purports to grant additional capital for the bank to enable it to enlarge its activities. On the face of it, the bill appears to be designed to strengthen the Commonwealth Bank. However, we on this side of the House, are vigorously opposed to the hill, and we have very good reasons for our opposition. The honourable member for Curtin suggested that we discovered our reasons by delving into ancient history. As a matter of fact, and we should be unwise not to profit from them. Being one of those unfortunate lawyers who are so much maligned in this House and elsewhere, I believe that there is advantage in looking back over similar cases in search of knowledge and of precedents by which we may bc guided. A glance back over the history of the Commonwealth Bank is well worthwhile if we would realize the inherent dangers of the measure now before the House. When the Commonwealth Bank was founded by Andrew Fisher in 1911, it was placed under the control of a governor. Sir Denison Miller was appointed the first Governor, and under his wise guidance the bank progressed. He was Governor from 1911 to 1923, and during that period the Commonwealth Bank assisted the government of the day, particularly during the 1914-18 war, when it saved the people of this country many hundreds of thousands of pounds. A savings bank branch was developed, and gradually the Commonwealth Bank entered more actively into the sphere of general banking business in competition with the private banks. It became apparent that the private banks did not like this new competitor, and they decided that the progress of the Commonwealth Bank should be impeded. I have been interested as a newcomer to this House to note how honourable members opposite are sometimes in favour of free competition and sometimes, but not always are critical of monopolies. During the last election campaign, we heard much about a particular form of monopoly, but nothing about the monopoly known as Australian Consolidated Industries Limited and the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Proprietary Limited, which I regard as a vicious and ruthless monopoly. It has a firm grip of the glass manufacturing business in Australia, and exploits the people by forcing up the cost of living. Every time a person buys a bottle of milk or a bottle of jam he is compelled to pay tribute to the glass monopoly, but honourable members opposite have never criticized it. They extol the virtues of free competition, but when the Commonwealth Bank attempted to become a serious competitor of the private banks, its efforts were not appreciated, and steps were taken to reduce the competition. A plot was hatched to curb the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. It could not be destroyed altogether, because it was too well established, but it was to be rendered ineffective. ""What was the method applied in order to render it ineffective? The method was to place it under .the control of a board. In 1924, tion of the Commonwealth Bank amounted the Bruce-Page Government appointed a board of eight to take over control of the bank from the Governor. It is interesting to note the similarity between the board which was set up in 1924, and the board which it is now proposed to appoint. In 1924, the board of eight included two ex officio members, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Governor of the bank. The present bill provides for the establishment of a board of ten members, ineluding three ex officio members, the secrethe separation of the savings bank actitary to the Treasury, the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1924, the members of the board were chosen from persons who were actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance and industry, and I should like to hear honourable members opposite dispute the fact that those persons did actually represent the private banks. It is interesting to recall what the original bank board did, because I think that we should bear it in mind when assessing the likely results of the restorapeople. It functioned largely as a cleartion of the hank board. I direct the attention of the House to three activities that the board set about achieving, after it was established in 1924, in order to strangle the Commonwealth Bank. First, the board set out deliberately to curtaii the trading activities of the bank by refusing new business. That policy ensured that there would be no more competition with the trading banks. That fact was well established by evidence before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in Australia. It is probably within the personal knowledge of most honourable members that the Commonwealth Bank in those days refused to accept new business if that business would have been taken from the private banks. The result was that there was no more active competition from the Commonwealth Bank, so the trading banks achieved their objective in that way. The second way in which the activities of the Commonwealth Bank were curtailed was by separating the savings bank section from the general activities of that institution. That subtle move was most effective, because the Commonwealth Bank had succeeded in establishing a large savings bank business. By 1927, the deposits with the Savings Bank secto Â£47,000,000. When the savings bank section was separated from the rest of the bank, all the revenue and the profits arising from that side of the business and all the big financial resources that gave the Oommonwealth Bank strength and stability, were taken away from that institution, so that its general structure was weakened. That was the second way in which, after the establishment of the board, the Commonwealth Bank was being strangled. It is interesting to note that vities from the general banking activities of the Commonwealth Bank was made on the recommendation of a titled gentleman from abroad, Sir Ernest Harvey, the Comptroller of the Bank of England. The Commonwealth Bank was then developed as a central bank, but not in the sense in which we understand central banking to-day, whereby the central bank exercises some control over the activities of the general financial and monetary policy of the country in the interests of the ing house for the benefit of the private banks, without exercising any real or effective control over them. The Commonwealth Bank, operating in that way, was of benefit to the private banks and served their purposes, yet it had no control over them in the interests of the people. That statenient leads me to the third method by which, after the bank board was established, the activities of the Oomweakening the general banking structure monwealth Bank were curtailed. Actually, everything had been done but destroy the bank completely. However, it would not have been expedient for the government of tlie day to make a straight-out proposal to sell the bank, and, therefore, it did the next best thing. In 1938, after the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in Australia had made its report, the then Treasurer in the Lyons Government, Mr Casey, introduced a bill, the effect of which would have been to sell the assets of the Commonwealth Bank to the private financial institutions of this country. At this point, I pause to remark that a number of the leading members of the present Government were also members of the Lyons Government at the time to which I refer. The bill, which was introduced by Mr Charles Anderson) went further than Casey, provided that the capital of the Commonwealth Bank should be increased by the issue of debentures to a maximum amount of Â£34,000,000. It was quite unnecessary to increase the capital of the bank in that manner. The Commonwealth Bank had commenced with a capital of Â£10,000, a loan that had been made by the Treasury, yet it had not been necessary at any time for the bank to raise more nioney. The institution established its own reserves and capital from its profits. However, the Lyons Government proposed that Â£34,000,000 worth of debentures should be issued to provide capital for the bank, and the interest on them would have been paid out of its profits. Furthermore, those debentures would have been available to the public and the private banks for purchase. 1 emphasize that the private banks would have been able to buy the debentures, and, in that way, would have gained control of the capital of the Commonwealth Bank. I put it to the House that those are three good and substantial reasons why honourable members on this side of the chamber have grave suspicions about the proposal to revive the Commonwealth Mr W. M. Bourke. Bank Board. I remind the House again that when the board was appointed in 1924, it curtailed the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank and separated the savings bank activities from the general banking activities, thus of the institution. By the proposal to issue debentures which, fortunately, was withdrawn because of the outcry from the people, the government of the day would have transferred the bank completely from the control of the people to the private financial institutions. There is another reason why we suspect this effort to restore the Commonwealth Bank Board. Despite statements by honourable members opposite, we cannot dismiss the lessons of the depression in the airy words that were used by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck), who said that the mistakes that were made iri those years were due to sheer ignorance and not to the method of control that was exercised over the bank. The honourable member for Hume( Mr that, and said that none of the attacks by members of the Opposition on the private banks had been substantiated in any way. I do not propose to say much about the depression, but I may sum up in a few words by stating that it is not true to say that the private banks were responsible for the depression, or that they caused it. There was a general collapse of overseas markets and prices, and, in addition, the gross extravagance of the Bruce-Page Government would have brought any country, however prosperous, to its knees, and reduced it to bankruptcy. But it is equally untrue to say that the banks had no part in the depression and that many of the attendant evils could not have been averted if a wise and enlightened monetary and banking policy had been adopted. I challenge honourable members opposite to deny that, during the years of the depression, the banks called in their advances. During the boom years they had lent bigger amounts than they should have, and when the bubble burst and deflationary conditions set in. they called in their advances. According to figures that I have obtained, the advances of the private banks between December, 1929, and March, 1932, were reduced by approximately Â£45,000,000. In those years the depth of the depression was reached, and the trading banks called in Â£45,000,000 worth of advances. They did precisely the reverse of what they should have done. If they had lent another Â£45,000,000 during those years, they would have done much to alleviate the misfortunes that were associated with the depression. I challenge honourable members opposite to deny that those figures are correct, and that the private banks, by calling in Â£45,000,000 worth of advances, contributed to the miseries and misfortunes that were associated with the years of depression. Furthermore, we cannot forget that the Commonwealth Bank Board allied itself with the disastrous policy of the trading banks. It refused to grant a fiduciary note issue of Â£18,000,000 that the then Treasurer, Mr Theodore, had requested. That additional money woulcl have reduced unemployment and alleviated the miseries of the people who were suffering from the depression. I have given that cursory sketch of the background of the Commonwealth Bank because we should bear those facts in mind when we are considering this bill. The Chifley Government made a great advance in banking legislation in 1945. In my opinion, the Banking Act and the Commonwealth Bank Act, which were passed in that year, constitute the most important legislation that has been enacted by this Parliament since its establishment at the beginning of the century. The Commonwealth Bank Act placed beyond all doubt that the Commonwealth Bank should operate as a central bank and should continue with its general banking activities. I was interested to note that the Government does not propose to repeal section 12 of that act, and I shall be interested to see how it is operated in future if the bank board should be appointed. Section 12 (2.) providesThe Bank, through the General Banking Division, shall not refuse to conduct hanking business for any person, by reason only of the fact that to conduct that business would have the effect of taking away business from another bank. That provision ensures that the disgraceful policy that was pursued by the Commonwealth Bank when it was controlled by a board after 1924 shall not be repeated. The Commonwealth Bank Aot 1945 also provided for the establishment of other departments of the bank to cafcar for branches of banking business, such as the industrial finance department and the mortgage bank department, 'which were not adequately catered for by the private banks. The Banking Act 1945, which is complementary to the Commonwealth Bank Act, made provision for the two matters that are the crux of this debate, namely, the establishment of special accounts for lodgement by the private banks, and the control of interest rates by the Commonwealth Bank. Some Opposition speakers have stated that the trading banks, which contributed so heavily to the election expenses of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, were waiting for the pay-off. ""Whether the private banks made payments to individuals, or made a big fund available generally to those two political parties I do not know; but there is no doubt that the trading banks did contribute a substantial sum of money to the electoral expenses of the Government parties. I know that in my electorate there were teams of from 30 to 40 men out canvassing every day for weeks on end, working in the interest of the Liberal candidate. I have no complaint against those men as individuals. They were sent out, of course, as economic conscripts. They had to do as they were told by their employers. Their wages were being paid bj the banks, and that very important contribution was being made to the Liberal party propaganda in the election campaign. It is only reasonable that the private trading banks, which made such a big and valuable contribution to the propaganda of the parties opposite during that election campaign, must get their pay-off, their rake-off. It is common talk round the country that the pay-off that the banks are to get is twofold. In the first place they want the special accounts system abolished. That system was established originally by members of the present Government when they were previously in office, for a very good purpose. As the Commonwealth Bank has stated in its last reportThe Central Bank has been able, by making calls to hanks' Special Accounts, to draw off from the banking system a considerable part of the additional cash arising from war-time finance and the growth of overseas funds, and tc immobilize it, thus preventing its use as a base for a secondary inflation. If tliose special accounts were released, tLe results would be a huge flow of new money on to the market, a great expansion of credit, more impetus to the inflationary spiral and a further disastrous rise in prices. I put it to honourable members that that is one of the prices being demanded from this Government by the interests that supported it during the iast general election campaign, and that it is one of the things that will happen if this proposed board is established. If the board system is re-established the new board will, by administrative action, release those special accounts, and all that frozen money will flow on to the market. The people will suffer the consequences by having to pay higher prices and because inflation will get further and further out of hand. The second thing that will happen if the board system is restored is that interest rates will be increased. It ij common knowledge that the private banks are now objecting to the present control of interest rates that was established by the 1945 banking legislation which provided that the Gommonwealth Bank should control such rates in the interests of the people as a whole and so as to maintain a stable financial and economic structure. The interest rate on money lent by overdraft is pegged at 4{ per cent., but propaganda has now commenced to flow from the banks setting out specious reasons why it should be increased. It is common knowledge, as I have said, that if the board system is restored the interest rate will be increased to 4f per cent, and then to 5 per cent. Of course the people will pay the pricethe ordinary people, such as people who have bought homes and have borrowed by way of a bank overdraft to do so. They will have to meet extra interest. In my opinion there are not enough people buying their own homes, but those who wish to do so in the future by borrowing on overdraft will have to pay an increased interest rate if the Government has its way. Instead of exposing such people to the iniquitous results that will flow from the restoration of the Oommonwealth Bank Board and the consequent increase ilr. W. M. Bourke. of interest rates the Government, if it were genuine in its protestations that it has the interests of all the people at heart, would be telling this House and the people that it proposed to reduce the interest rate for home purchasers and that it would use the great financial powers that it possesses through the Commonwealth Bank, to provide home purchase loans for people at a rate of interest of not mon* than 2 per cent. But it is evident that, far from that happening, one of the prices that the trading banks have demanded and that they will receive as a quid pro quo for their help to the parties opposite during the last general election campaign, is that interest rates will be restored to what they were before. We believe that interest rates should not be raised. It is one of the achievements of the Curtin and Chifley Administrations that they were responsible for the era of cheap money in this country. That is an achievement of which they have reason to be proud. We are opposing this measure because we believe that interest rates should not be increased and that these special accounts should not be wiped out: because we do not want the inflationary spiral to get out of hand; because we believe that inflation must be kept in check, that the money power in this country should not be the master of the people and should not exact such a toll as is inherent in the Government's proposal, at the expense of the people; and because we believe that the money power should be the servant of the people. We shall fight against this proposed restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board because, if it is re-established, the effects that I have indicated will follow. We are opposed to a recurrence of such conditions in this country, and we are determined to fight the restoration of the board system at all costs., If the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) were honest he would have described this bill as a bill to hand over the people's bank a second time to the representatives of private interests, hecause that is what happened in 1924 when the Commonwealth Bank Board was established, without any warrant from the people or any authority from the democracy. In fact, its establishment came as a surprise to",54,Pairs
186,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [9.36].,"the members of the government party of the day as well as to members of the then Opposition. I shall examine briefly what happened in 1924 and in the preceding general election in 1922. At that election the Leader of the Nationalist party, under which name the present Liberal party then existed, was the present right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The Leader of the Australian Country party at that time was the present right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). Immediately after the election the Leader of the Australian Country party delivered his ultimatum to the Nationalist party. serve under Mr Hughes any longer"". Unfortunately, for him at any rate, the defeat of Sir Walter Massy-Greene, in the electorate of Richmond, by another man of the same name, robbed that gentleman of the chance to succeed to the Prime Ministership and the choice went to the next in line, the then honourable member for Flinders, who is now Viscount Brucn. The right honourable member for North Sydney did not mention in his policy speech any .proposal for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board, nor was such a proposal mentioned in the Australian Country party's policy speech. As a matter of fact, when the legislation providing for the establishment of the board was before this House, the right honourable member for North Sydney voted against it. The whole proposal was forced upon the Parliament of Australia without any authority from the people, and the Commonwealth Bank, which had been established by a Labour government in 1911 as a. people's bank, became, by virtue of the 1924 legislation, a banker's bank. The 1924 legislation established a Central Reserve Bank for the first time, but associated with it were the original functions of the trading bank known as the Commonwealth Bank. The Central Reserve Bank set out to destroy the competitive capacity of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the private trading banks. The Labour party at that time opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board and from the very time that Mr Charlton, the then Leader of the Labour party, who was the honourable member for Hunter, first expressed the view of the Labour party, we have been intransigently opposed to any board controlling the destinies of the Commonwealth Bank. We have strong reasons for our attitude. Let us consider the milestones in the banking history of this country. In 1893, during a depression period, many banks in Victoria, and some in New South Wales and Queensland, collapsed. There were suicides, destitution on all hands, broken homes, broken hearts and broken fortunes. Some of the wealthiest families in Australia went bankrupt during that period. They included the Bailleaus and the Finks. The Bailleaus paid ^d. in Â£1. He said, "" We refuse to The head of the Fink interests became known as "" Farthing Fink"", but afterwards he paid all the money that he owed. the Minister for Air( Mr White) recollects a speech that I made in 1945 when the banking legislation was before this Parliament, he will recall that I told this House that one of the wealthiest banks in this country, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, which is not an Australian bank at all, but which has its head-quarters in England, as well as its shareholders, most of whom have never seen this country and are only interested in the returns that they receive from their investment, compounded its deposits when it closed its doors in 1893 and turned all those deposits into interminable stock. It paid 3 per cent, interest on the stock, but not until 1945 did it repay to the heirs of some of the original holders and to the other people who had received the scrip one penny of the principal per cent, interest. It had contracted, under a. Victorian act, to pay 4 per cent., but by an act of the British Parliament it had the amount reduced to 3 per cent. That is what would be called, in racecourse terminology, an act of scaling or welshing or spieling. It was not until after the position liad been exposed in this Parliament that the directors in London decided to repay the principal to those who were holding the stock in Australia, despite the huge profits that the bank had",60,Pairs

A select committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria suggested in 1893 that a people's bank should be established, but it was not until after federation had been established and the Labour party had come into the Federal Parliament as a small minority party, that anything was done in the way of esta blishing a Commonwealth Bank. A motion for its establishment was submitted by Mr King O'Malley in the first Parliament. Mr O'Malley, who is fortunately still alive at the age of 96 years, became the founder of the Commonwealth Bank in 1911. ""Who opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank in 1911? They were the tories, the liberals of that day, the Joseph Cooks, the WilliamH ill Irvines and men like them. put the legislation through. Will the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr mittee of which the Treasurer of the day Bowden) ever wake up? The Labour party passed the legislation and the people who opposed it were those who thought as the honourable member for Gippsland thinks to-day. The Fisher Government established the note issue in 1911 and the same opposition was expressed to the Australian Government issuing its own notes. Before that time the private banks had issued their notes and had made a lot of profit out of doing so. The Australian Government taxed the notes issued by the private banks and so made it no longer profitable for them to carry on that line of business. What was the reaction of the press, the tories and their ilk of the day? They joined in one long chorus of denunciation. The honourable member for Batman( Mr saved the country millions of pounds Bird) referred to the fact that the tories of that time said that ""Fisher's flimsies"", as the Commonwealth Bank's notes were then called, would not be worth 5s. on any street corner before six months had passed. To-day, 40 years afterwards, nobody in Australia can say that an Australian note was ever offered anywhere in Australia for less than its equivalent value in goods. The people who were making money out of the note issue were the people who complained about Labour's legislation. We established the Commonwealth Bank; we established the note issue; and we established the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Out of the activities of all these functions of government a profit of Â£86,000,000 was made between 1911 and 1949. If there had never been a Commonwealth Bank-and there never would have been such a bank if there had not been a Labour party-and if there had never been a Commonwealth note issue, every penny of that profit of Â£86,000,000 would have gone to the shareholders of the private banking institutions. That profit was made, not for the shareholders of private banking institutions, but for the people of Australia. It has been paid to the credit of the Government and has been used to expand the capital of some of the departments of the Commonwealth Bank and, in earlier years for the reduction of our indebtedness. All the profits from the Commonwealth note issue are expended by a comis the chairman and the Chief Justice of Australia is a member. We claim all the credit for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. We claim all the credit for taking the issue of notes from the private trading banks and placing whatever profit is derived from them, which has so far amounted to Â£55,000,000, to the use of the nation. By the Banking Act 1945 we restored the Commonwealth Bank to the position which it had occupied before it was mauled in 1924. There was nothing wrong with the Commonwealth Bank between 1911and 1924 under the governorship of Sir Denisou Miller. It grew and expanded its activities. It financed Australia in World WarI . at a nominal rate of interest. It which otherwise would have had to be paid to the private banking institutions. It also helped to finance the construction of the East-West railway and many other undertakings. But between 1924 and 1945 it was stultified because of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Who were the men who constituted that board? They were estimable gentleman and good citizens, but none of them knew anything about banking. Sir Robert Gibson became chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board in his sixties. He had been a very successful businessman. He had made a",61,Pairs

Mackenzie Lees was another member of the board. He had been chairman of the Associated Banks of Queensland and manager of the Bank of Queensland, an institution which was pretty "" rocky "" at one stage. Mr A. F. Bell, the chairman of the Union Trustee Company, was a member of the board of the National Bank of Australasia Limited immediately prior to his appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board. Sir Clive McPherson was also a member of the board of the National Bank of Australasia Limited before he became a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Does anybody believe that those men, no matter how worthy they may have seemed, could possibly have divested themselves of their interests in the private financial concerns of Australia and have given their attention wholly to the promotion of the interests of the Commonwealth Bank? Of course, they could not. Mr Lees died while he was a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Mr orders. At the annual meeting of the Bell also died while he was a member of the board. much future for a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Commonwealth Bank Board. about it. there will be such a board. In fact I know that there will not be such a board. McPherson was a member of the board of the National Bank of Australasia Limited until the day before he was appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board. When we wiped out the Commonwealth Bank Board in 1945 and he was out of a job, he went straight back to the old job which he had formerly occupied on the directorate of the National Bank of Australasia Limited. These were the people who were appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, yet honourable members opposite have persuaded themselves into believing that the board of the future will be different from the board of the past. that it will be. hypnotized themselves into believing that it will be, but they are the only people who do so. The average member of the community does not believe that those selected for appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board of the future will be any different from those who were selected in the past. We do not want a Commonwealth Bank Board. We cannot find anybody on the Government side m this Parliament who can tell us in what respects the Banking Act 1945 is weak. No honourable member opposite can tell us where the Governor of the bank has failed in his duty if, in fact, he has failed at all. None of them can tell us how he could have carried out his duties better than he has done in the past. All that they are determined to do is to upset something which we did because they have to obey the demands of the private banking institutions. They have received their National Bank of Australasia Limited, the chairman, MrH . D. Giddy, saidWe would prefer a system whereby the vital aspects of national banking and credit policv would be debated in Parliament. What right have the private banks to demand anything more than any other section of the community? They seem to think that they have a prescriptive right to lay down the banking policy of this country. Mi-. BEALE Mr Giddy did not say that he demanded such a system but that he would prefer it. managers say to the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), "" We prefer you to cast your vote in this direction"", is not that accepted by him as a direction from them? They do not give him any choice. They use the language of their class. This Government is not game to repeal the important sections of the banking legislation. Not yet, at any rate!

At all events those investments sentation on the Commonwealth Bank Board. If they are honest will they not agree that the government of the day should have the right to appoint one-half of the directors of the private banks. How would they react to such a proposition? They would immediately talk about interference with free enterprise and, as you know, Mr Speaker, free enterprise is merely laisser faire capitalism. Honourable members opposite want to maul the people's property once more. They want to take control of the people's property so that, as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr ""W. M . Bourke) has said, the board oan raise the rate of interest. That is all they are worrying about to-day. Members of the Australian Country party should not be fooled on this issue. In 1934 the present Minister for Comsubmitted a motion in this House which resulted in the appointment of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems which trenchantly criticized the private banks in the terms that were quoted by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) during this debate and have been quoted by other honourable members in earlier debates in this Parliament. Included in the membership of the royal commission was only one democrat, one friend of the peoplethe present right honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley). The commission wa9 so shocked at what it discovered that it made a slashing indictment of the banking system of Australia; but the government of the day, instead of giving effect to its recommendations, extraordinarily enough permitted the present right honourable member for La Trobe Jfr. Calwell. ( Mr Casey), who was then Treasurer, lish a debenture issue for the Commonwealth Bank which was to have been taken up by the private banks. Some clauses of that particular piece of legislation are almost unbelievable. One clause 16 or 62 the effect and not the enumeration that were to have been free of Federal and State tax. Although the government of the day had sweeping majorities in both Houses of the Parliament the proposition was so hot that it was dropped. The banking legislation of 1924 and 1931 has been referred to by several speakers on the Opposition side of the House. We have dealt with the legislation introduced by the Scullin Government. I have referred to the motion made by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in 1934 which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. I have also referred to the bill that was introduced in 1938 by the present right honourable member for La Trobe. There was also the Banking Act .1945 and the banking legislation of 1947 which were introduced by the present Leader of the Opposition. Now there is the 1950 bill which is as still-born as was the measure that was introduced by the present right honourable member for La Trobe in 1938. The mental gymnastics in which members of the Australian Country party have engaged on the subject of banking amaze me. The Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has participated in this debate. In a speech which the honourable gentleman delivered in this Bouse on the 26th May, 1938, he told us of the plight of the dairy fanners of Queensland, which, he said, was due to the fact that they were heavily indebted to the private banking institutions of that State. He saidOut or"" 12,275 dairy farmers in Queensland, only 99 had taxable incomes last year in excess of Â£250. their products was not then in operation.",63,Pairs

A t that time less than 100 dairy farmers out of 12,000 had incomes of more than Â£5 a week. How any member of the Australian Country party can rise in defence of the private banking institutions passes my comprehension. In 1934 the Gepp Commission which was appointed to inquire into the state of the wheat industry found that the wheat farmers of Australia owed the private banks Â£154,000,000. standing that, the representatives of the Australian Country party in the Senate in 1931 voted against the proposal of the Scullin Government to issue fiduciary notes which would have enabled that government to guarantee the farmers 5s. a bushel for their wheat. able member to read the history of this matter.

I have heard his voice. the wall and my face to the foe. able gentleman does not consider that I am a wall. the great Prime Ministers of this country, then the right honourable member for Fremantle, made a speech in this Housei n 1931 concerning happenings to the people of Australia as a result of the depredationsof the banking interests all through the years. I quote from what he said thenIn 1914 the surplus of assets over liabilities of the banks of Australia was Â£5,071,000. After three years of human misery, tragedy and misfortune, during which thousands and thousands of our people suffered indescribably, the surplus of assets over liabilities of these Notwithbanks had increased to Â£26,447,000. That was in 1917. In the post-war period, when chickens were coming home to roost and when every industry in Australia was floundering in a morass of difficulty because of the sharp ascent of prices, what happened to the banks? The Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures to show what the assets and liabilities uf the banks were on the 20th March last. I took his figures and by the simple process of subtraction found that tlie surplus of liabilities over assets at that date was Â£7(i.792,000. The misery of the depression had not affected the banks. Their assets had risen and their surplus of assets over issue of Â£18,000,000, the liabilities was Â£76,000,000 in 1931 as compared with Â£5,000,000 in 1914. The banks did well out of the depression. They always do well out of human misery, and from 1914, they had planted, in addition to the Â£13,000,000 in reserve funds, amounts to bring those reserve funds up to Â£33,000,000 in 1928. No wonder honourable members opposite speak with guilty consciences when they try to defend the private banks of this country. The private banking institutions are a collection of traders who have monopolized the credit of the nation for do you explain the purpose of making profit for themselves and their shareholders. The private banking institutions have bought Y o u need to explain governments and politicians, and honourable members opposite largely owe their positions in this Parliament to the fact honourable that the private banks spent large sums of money on their behalf at the general election.

The main pretence of the Opposition now is that it objects to the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank Board. There has been no objection over the years to the Tariff Board. Who in this Parliament or elsewhere will say that it has not facilitated the economic development of Australia? It holds public inquiries and gives advice to governments on rates of tariff and on ways of helping certain industries. It has done great good over the years. Yet members of the Opposition object because this Government has decided that there shall be a board to advise it on financial matters whose members will know something about trading banks instead of the Yarra bank! They declare that the members of the board will not be the right people and will work for self-interest instead of for the nation. in the past. The Tariff Board has done good in the economic field, and bank boards have done good in the financial field.

These so-called wizards of finance held the reins of office and, had they wanted a double dissolution of the Parliament, they could have What brought it about at any time. But they did not dare to seek a new election and, when the time came, the people swept them from office and elected a government that believed in decent commercial principles. That has happened again. We are now repealing a socialist error, an infamy that was put upon the people, an act of ill-intent that the Labour Government committed in order to destroy a British tradition. The Labour party's banking legislation is in line with the Russian ideal. Lenin's great fiat of 1917 was that, if a Government wanted complete control of the people, it must first seize the banks. Even the Dean of Canterbury says that socialism is the half-way house on the road to communism, and he knows something about both creeds. Yet this dejected and I gladly withdraw it, shattered party in opposition still adheres to its socialistic shibboleths.

248,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.35],"!of any action by the Government which would involve them once again in active warfare. It is of the utmost importance to Australia that our people should live at peace with their neighbours. If the matter be one of defending investments, the British or the Americans or any other people who have interests in those areas, if they find the campaign going against them, can retire. They do not have to live in such close proximity to Asia as Australians do. When members of the Opposition direct questions to the Government upon important matters they do not want to be brushed aside by replies which are not answers to the questions. I want the Government to say plainly, and in unmistakable language, whether it is contemplating any participation in these various campaigns. Any such participation would be a grave mistake from the point of view of the people of this country. The Australian Government would be held up to strong criticism from a large lost rabbits, which are controlled to some section of the Australian people. This nation which is now short of man-power cannot afford to become involved in any of these overseas adventures. Therefore I ask the Government to state specifically whether any approach has been made to it for the provision of forces for operations in these areas, and if so what attitude it is adopting. I should prefer from an Australian viewpoint, that the Government should say unequivocally that in no circumstances will Australian forces be used in those areas. direct the attention of the House to the condition of affairs in the eastern States following the floods that occurred prior to the Easter vacation and which continued in many parts during the vacation. The damage done during those floods has assumed the proportions of a national calamity. I appreciate that the position is largely one to be dealt with by the States, but so grave is it in many parts of the country that I consider it to be worthy of mention here. There are many phases of this damage. In my electorate I heard with much grief that lives were lost. The damage to roads is considerable. Unfortunately it is not possible at the present time fully to estimate the damage, but in the Shire of Coonabarabran the estimated damage is of the order of Â£50,000. The Municipality of Mudgee has supplied me with a figure of Â£1,455 worth of damage in that town, and I expect that .throughout the whole of the electorate of Lawson tbe damage will be of similar degree. The Castlereagh Biver, which is one of the streams in flood, is a swift running river and practically all the bridges or the approaches to .the bridges over that river have been swept away. Fencing has been extensively damaged. It has not been just rolled over as is the case in flat country, but entire fences have been washed away from both sides of the river. I have a telegram from the Coonabarabran Pastures Protection Board-onl y one of such boards in my electoratewhich reads as follows: "" Estimate flood damage loss Coonabarabran Board Â£150,000. Five hundred miles fencing lost"". The fencing problem is not one that stands alone because when fences are extent hy fences, are free to run over the pastures. Moreover, fly-blown sheep present many difliculties because in that area the pasture is pratically one large paddock. The damage to agricultural land through soil erosion is extensive. That damage is noticed at seeding time, because the ground is so moist that it is impossible to get machinery on it to proceed with the sowing. Ultimately we shall unfortunately have to reap the wild oats through not having the normal wheat crop in. The damage to wool is considerable, apart from fly strike, and is estimated at 25 per cent, in some parts of the area. The stock losses have not been computed because as so much fencing has been lost it is impossible to muster, nor is it desirable, because of the flies. As far as domestic damage is concerned, houses have been swept away and people have lost all their possessions. In some cases whilst the dwelling still remains the furniture and personal belongings have been lost. In one small village of 30 houses 25 were affected by flood, fifteen having nothing left in them that was not completely ruined by flood waters., All that adds up to a sum total which is in the nature of a national calamity. .State activities through the medium of the Flood Belief Committee have been very satisfactory.",70,Adjournment Malaya Flood Relief Canberr A Hostels Ra T Menace Aborigines
249,Mr Failes (Lawson) [10.40],"1The committee has given immediate personal assistance by way of food, blankets and clothing, but it is hampered to some extent by lack of funds. I suggest to the responsible Minister that he should urge the federal representative on the committee to see that any distribution of supplies in the nature of fencing materials sliall be made on an equitable basis. If it were sent in bulk then the position would be "" first come best dressed "", which would be a most unfortunate state of affairs. The supply of fencing material is a matter for the States, but it is deplorable that at this time, when such material is so urgently needed, it is in such short supply on account of the recent dislocation of industry. I believe that we are still feeling the effects of the coal strike of last year, and that the manufacture of fencing wire, steel posts and wire netting is still being delayed. Every effort should be made by the Government to increase the production of thk>se commodities, which are so urgently needed for the repair of flood damage. I suggest to the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) that army engineering units might be used to assist shires in the reconstruction of roads. It is physically impossible for local bodies to do this work with the materials and labour at their disposal. Monetary assistance, not hy way of gift, but by way of loan, is necessary to enable land-owners and tenant farmers to get back into production. This is necessary, not so much for their own sake, as for the sake of the nation. The recent floods hit poor and rich alike, without discrimination. Many persons who could ill afford the loss were deprived of everything, and they are deserving of help. Even if money were made available, it would be impossible to repair all the damage immediately, because materials are not available. If the work could be done before the end of June, farmers would be able to claim a reduction of income tax. During the war, sections 53A and 53c of the Income Tax Assessment Act was invoked to allow taxpayers, who were prevented by shortage of materials from carrying out immediate repairs, to deposit the cost with the Treasury, and thus become eligible to claim a tax rebate. provision should now be applied to those. Mr Failes. who have suffered from thefloods,because the circumstances are similar to those which prevailed during the war. In my district, the damage caused by the flood was very great, and I believe that some other honourable members have even worse tales to tell. I am convinced that the Government will co-operate to th fullest extent witb the States in alleviating distress. I ask that the Government be not parsimouious, and that it arrange to raise a special loan for the purpose if that is considered necessary. [30.501 I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward).

Does the honourable member for Hindmarsh assure me that it was not directed to the honourable member for Henty? that assurance. This Government is hellbent on another war with some one, for the obvious reason that it represents the persons who always profit from wars. The Government represents those who become millionaires overnight from war. The Government was put into power by those who profit while others die. What the honourable member for East Sydney said about Malaya is true. If this invitation by the British Government to Australia to participate in the conflict is made which limits the period of time for merely an invitation to assist in defending some millionaire's capital in Malaya, then the whole of the capital involved is not worth one Australian life. Let us look at the position in Malaya, and consider the circumstances that brought about the present conflict. It was brought about by British Imperialism. The cold, hard fact is that the persons whom this Government represents are interested only in the exploitation of raw materials and the people of Malaya. Now the Government is doing its very best to persuade the British Government to permit it to intervene in the dispute in order that good Labour men may be shot in the defence of British capital, and so that the capitalists of Australia, whom the Government represents, can make a few more millions, as they did during the last war, and during every other war. This Government claims to be democratic, and to represent the ordinary people. Well, the ordinary people do not want war. The ordinary people do not want to fight in Malaya. The Malays have as much right to be allowed to mind their own business as we have to mind ours. What is happening in Malaya has nothing to do with this Government, or with That remark was any other government. It is a tragedy that there should be in office in Australia at this time a government that is bent upon making another war, and that it should be going out of its way to invite the British Government to permit it to send decent Labour men to defend the capital invested in Malaya by British, Australian and American millionaires. I propose to discuss a matter that affects the Department of the Interior. It relates to charges made in government hostels, and I have been informed that representations made to departmental ofncials on this point have been unsuccessful. The practice is to grant a rebate of board to residents of hostels who take advantage of holiday week-ends to absent themselves from Canberra in order to visit Sydney or Melbourne or places in other States. This practice has been followed for many years, but within the last few weeks an alteration has been which a rebate may be claimed. I am quarrelling, not with that, but with the way in which the provision is applied. The present situation appears to be Gilbertian, and I am sure that it will",72,Adjournment Malaya Flood Relief Canberr A Hostels Ra T Menace Aborigines

266,Mr Fraser (Eden,"Monaro) [10.56].be corrected by the Minister for the has been brought to his notice. Over the Easter week-end, the stipulation was made that a rebate of board would be allowed to those who were absent from the hostels over the holiday period, but only on the condition that they appeared in the dining-room of their hostel on Tuesday morning for 'breakfast. It is impossible, so far as I can ascertain, to find a reason basis of a report in some newspaper that for this curious stipulation. less, representations made to departmental officials by residents of the hostels huve been unsuccessful, and the only course open to me, therefore, is to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister. It is important to the residents since an absence of four days may involve a rebate of Â£1 los., which in these days of high and rising costs means much to the men and the women who live in government hostels. In one case that was brought to my notice a resident, having been absent for four days over Easter, paid Â£5 5s. as board for a fortnight. That was accepted, hecause it was recognized that he had been absent for four days. However, on the following day, he was informed that he must pay an additional Â£1 15s. because he had not appeared in the dining-room for breakfast on Tuesday morning. Apart from other considerations, many people do not eat breakfast, and it may be that after a holiday period some persons might regard breakfast with particular aversion. If it is necessary to restrict the period of absence for which a rebate may be claimed, it should be done without making it a condition that the claimant shall partake of breakfast on Tuesday morning. The rebate could be limited to the actual days of the holiday week-end. If a guest were absent for more than those days he should, perhaps, be not allowed to claim a rebate for the extra period of absence. That there should be any physical necessity for him to partake of breakfast on Tuesday morning in order to obtain the benefit of the rebate for the period during which he had been absent from the hostel, appears to me to be entirely absurd. I commend the matter to the Minister for the Interior and trust that, upon investigation, he will have this apparent anomaly corrected. Mr Fraser. cannot allow to pass without comment the accusations of warmongering that have been made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) against honourable members on this side of the chamber. I find it incredible that the honourable member for East Sydney should even consider, on the Neverthehe did not name, that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had made a statement that might commit this Government and the country to an act of war. The minds of the people of Australia should be set at rest on this matter, and I believe that unless the Government makes a specific announcement, they should disregard any mention of war that has been made by the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The majority of honourable members on this side of the chamber have known the horrors of war, and only those who are in that position realize the futility of it and the necessity of preserving this country from further conflict. I feel certain that the Government will do everything that it possibly can to prevent this nation from being embroiled in further hostilities. The two honourable members to whom I have referred have, without just cause and on the flimsy basis of a press report about which we know nothing, accused Government supporters of warmongering. If such accusations are to be made, they should be levelled against tbose two honourable members. For the peace of mind of the people of Australia, this House should treat those statements with the utmost contempt. An honourable member should not speak of such a catastrophe as another war without having some firm basis for his remarks, or in the absence of an authentic statement by the Prime Minister. In all sincerity, I urge honourable members to dismiss from their minds anything that they may read in the newspapers about the matter to which the honourable member for East -Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh have referred, because I believe that if such a decision involving Australia were made, this House would be aware of it before any newspaper could publish it.",73,Adjournment Malaya Flood Relief Canberr A Hostels Ra T Menace Aborigines

There has been no decision to send troops to Malaya. The honourable member for East Sydney has implied that the Government would send troops to Malaya. The Government will consider the matter. Government, having considered it, will send troops to Malaya. from a statement by the honourable member for Hindmarsh requires comment. The honourable member made an attack, hy implication, to my way of thinking, upon the British Government for its action in defending itself and its citizens in Malaya. Let us consider what is really happening in that part of the world. Everybody knows that the red tide is flowing down the Malay peninsula. Everybody who has any brains knows that the constituted Government in Malaya is fighting to preserve, not the property but the established institutions of that country. The British Government;-the British socialist Labour Government, by the way-is sending its troops there to defend what it regards as the right. I assume that every honourable member, with the exception of two odd persons opposite, agrees with that decision. It does not lie in the mouth of the honourable member for Hindmarsh or the honourable member for East Sydney to make such snarling and disreputable attacks on the British Government and its troops in Malaya. If we keep our noses out of that sort of thing, we shall do more to establish the reputation of this Parliament and this country than will the comments of those two . honourable members. I believe that what has been happening in Malaya is of profound importance to Australia, and that the action that the British Government has taken in attempting to defend the existing condition of affairs there should have our sympathy and blessing. action. take action we shall decide in due course; but at least let us not make snarling attacks suggesting that our brother or sister Government in the Tjnited Kingreputable.

Every honorahle member is entitled to raise any point that he likes to raise and it ill becomes any Minister, when he rises in his place to give what should be a considered reply to the representations put to his as Minister, to attack an honourable member. I desire to raise a matter that may come under the jurisdiction of the Minister not quite sure whether the Department of the Interior still controls the Commonwealth Eailways, so I wish the matter to be considered by whatever Minister is responsible. It is only incidental to The the operations of the Commonwealth Eailways. I refer to the aborigines at Ooldea in South Australia. Eecently, for the first time in four years, I came east on the Commonwealth Eailway. When the train stopped at Ooldea we were, as on the previous occasion, approached in the dining car where we happened to be, by a number of aborigines. It has been customary for passengers to hand fruit to aborigines at Ooldea and for the cooks on the train to do the same thing. Thr aborigines were in a very poor physical condition, especially the old ones, and some of them had white growths over their eyes, which I understand to be one of the symptoms of dietary dificiency over a long period. It would not seem to be a very difficult thing that the Commonwealth, which operates the trans-continental railways, should put on board the train some sacks of fruits, such as oranges or any other fruit that scientific advisers state has the necessary vitamin content, to be off-loaded at Ooldea for those aborigines. If it is desired that they should enough museums all over the world to buy specimens of aboriginal work such as boomerangs and other implements to recoup the Government for the cost entailed. I am quite sure that there would be no demoralization involved if",76,Adjournment Malaya Flood Relief Canberr A Hostels Ra T Menace Aborigines

I Am,"the Commonwealth Eailways distributed Transport (.Senator McLeay), who this sort of largess to the aborigines. comes from South Australia, so that he Fruit could be placed aboard at Kalmay confer with the Government of goorlie when the train was going east and South Australia to see whether fruit may at Port Pirie when the train was going be provided in an emergency. I think that west. I am aware that the natives at the honourable member will agree that Ooldea are not a responsibility of the fruit should not be provided regularly, Australian Government but are under because it would only attract the State jurisdiction, and I believe that the aborigines to the line. States are not permitting the Australian Government to enter into the matter of aboriginal welfare whilst at the same worse thing for our tourists to see. time they are not themselves doing a decent job. At successive conferences of edifying to see these people, who would be Commonwealth and State Ministers they better off in reservations where proper jealously keep the Australian Governcare can be given to them. ment out of this matter. I am not suggesting any large measure of reform of aboriginal policy. This is only a relatively minor matter but it might do something for the well-being of these people. I therefore ask the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Eailways sented :to determine whether or not it would be Commonwealth. Bank Act-Appointmen t Cerpossible to make this fruit available to supplement the diet of the aborigines, using the trans-continental train as the medium of supply. Mr Speaker, in asking the Minister in charge of the House a question? able gentleman has spoken to the motion. He will have to leave his question until to-morrow. Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.20] -in replyI know that the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) arise from humanitarian considerations. It is very sad to see the aborigines on the trans-continental railway line. In the honourable member's own State of Western Australia the policy is to keep the aborigines away from that line. encourage them to come there. Mrs. Daisy Bates has lived among the aborigines at Ooldea for many years. She has done great work among them. Tho care of aborigines at Ooldea is a matter for the South Australian authorities, but I shall bring the honourable gentleman's submission to the notice of the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Question resolved in the affirmative.

If so, will these rebates be passed on to for co-operation in its implementation. It is the consumer in each instance in respect of true that, although both the Israel and goods already contracted for, and delivered, at Jordanian Governments have said they are the old and greater price? 3. If not passed on, will tbe rebates be guarantees allowed to benefit the importers affected? Trade and Customs has supplied the to following information:1. Yes. 2. The rebates do not affect any timber or buildings materials under notice which were imported and entered for home consumption prior to 10th December, 1949. The local selling prices of these importations would therefore properly include the Customs duty paid. As lionorable member for the Australian regards the importations benefiting by the Capital Territory (Dr. Nott) asked the concession which have been sold at the duty paid-price it will be a matter for the purchasers following question:or users to approach the importers for a price adjustment corresponding with the duty funds are made available to the Australian rebate.

See answer to 2. 1.54] -JERUSALEM. External Affairs, upon notice1. Is it a fact that the Government of Israel has refused to carry out the decision of the United Nations Assembly regarding the internationalization of Jerusalem which decision was sponsored by Australia before the United Nations General Assembly? 2. What action has the Government taken or what action does it propose to take in an endeavour to ensure compliance with United Nations decisions by the Government of Israel? honourable member's questions are as follows:On the 9th December, 1949, the General Assembly restated its intention that Jerusalem should be placed under a permanent international regime which should envisage appropriate guarantees for the protection of the Holy Places, and requested the Trusteeship Council to complete the preparation of the Statute of Jerusalem, to approve the statute, and proceed immediately with putting it into operation. The draft statute had been drawn up by the Trusteeship Council in 1948 at the direction of the General Assembly. During the 19th January, the Trusteeship Council has been engaged in the first part of its assignment, namely, the revision of the Statute of Jerusalem. The Australian representative has individual articles of the statute is almost completed. When the Trusteeship Council has vernments of Israel and Jordan, with a request willing to protect the Holy Places and give of freedom of access thereto, they have expressed strong opposition to the General Assembly's decision regarding the interstage at which they will formally be asked carry out the Assembly's decision by helping to put into effect the revised statute, has not yet heen reached.

I now desire to infor m the honourable member as follows:Although until the 30th June, 1951. thc annual grant to the Australian National University is subject to the Treasurer's approval and any additional funds for the erection or purchase of buildings it requires are subject to parliamentary approval and the usual Treasury procedures, the university is, nevertheless, a statutory authority, and responsibility for its action lies with the interim council appointed to manage its affairs. I am, however, satisfied that the activities of the university iu buying houses in the Australian Capital Territory are not such as would have any appreciable effect on property values and I can assure the honourable member that the university keeps closely in touch with the appropriate Commonwealth departments on this matter. LAND SETTLEMEN T OF EXHSERYICEMEN. honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) referred to the disastrous fires which had occurred in Western Australia, and asked whether I would consult with the appropriate State authorities to ensure that adequate relief was available to settlers under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme who may have suffered losses. As promised, I have had inquiries made and find that only one settler under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme lost farm buildings during the recent fires in Western Australia. These buildings were insured and arrangements are in train to have them replaced. No settlers suffered loss of hay-stacks, but some lost green feed The State Settlement Authority has ample reserves of hay available for soldier settlers in need and can also make available to private farmers at cost approximately 100 tons. I am assured that the position of settlers under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme is satisfactory. Interior, upon notice1. When is it anticipated that the subdivision of the Molonglo settlement area into minor industrial leases will be an accomplished fact? 2. What area in the Australian Capital Territory has been suggested to the Minister as a suitable area for subdivision into farmlets ? 3. Has a decision been arrived at with respect to the allocation of a site for the new railway station for the Australian Capital Territory; if so, what area has been alienated for this purpose? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The area set apart for industrial purposes near Molonglo railway siding will not be restricted to minor industries. The subdivision of the land will be made when investigations into railway requirements now proceeding, and other matters necessary for adequate planning, have been completed. 2. An area in the Divisions of Narrabundah and Symonston was proposed for subdivision into farmlets when essential engineering services can be provided for the area. 3. No site has been allocated for a new railway station for Canberra, and no early action is contemplated to provide a new site. Interior, upon noticeWhen will the report on the proposed or suggested expansion of the milk supply in the Australian Capital Territory, which at present is inadequate, be made available to the honourable member for that territory? honourable member's question is as follows:The report of the committee examining the milk supply in the Australian Capital Territory has not yet been completed, but I understand it will be submitted to me shortly. I have previously informed the honourable member by letter that when I receive the report I shall communicate with hini. honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) asked me whether I would give consideration to the issue of towels, soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste to members of the Citizen Forces who are required to attend military camps of training. I have investigated this matter, and I find that at the present time hand towels are issued to all personnel in Citizen Military Forces camps of training. Toilet soap is also provided. They are not, however, issued for week-end bivouacs. With regard to toothbrushes and toothpaste, these are personal items which the member uses in civil life, and he can readily bring them to camp with him. There is, therefore, no necessity for an official issue to be made.",79,Australian Nation Al University
