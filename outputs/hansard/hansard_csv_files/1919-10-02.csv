In tlie face of that statement, it would be simply occupying the time of the House fruitlessly for honourable members to persist in asking questions of the kind to which the Prime Minister has objected unless notice is given. I , therefore, ask honourable members to observe those conditions. urgent question. Ministers have not declined to answer questions, and it is not a matter for the 'Speaker to say whether they are to be answered or not. honourable member resume his seat? I do not think the Speaker requires an intimation of that kind from the honourable member. from you. Mr .SPEAKER I remind the honourable member that it is the special business of the Speaker to decide whether questions can be permitted. Under the Standing Orders, which are the Standing Orders of the Parliament, and not of the Speaker, the Speaker is the authority to decide whether a questiton is admissible or not. new standard. ber is in error. I have never attempted to stop honourable members from asking questions without notice, as long as Ministers were willing to answer them, unless the questions themselves were out of order. But in this case the Prime Minister has intimated that he will not answer questions except those which are obviously urgent. In face of that announcement, I have merely asked honourable members to observe the intimation by tbe Prime Minister. It would, obviously, be a disorderly proceeding to persist in putting questions, with the knowledge that Ministers would require notice to be given. tion, which is, perhaps, more one of order. I understood yon to rule my question out of order. May I explain that I saw it publicly stated that the only people who had been consulted by the Prime Minister regarding the Bill were the Solicitor-General( Sir Robert Garran) and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom), and that other members of the Cabinet had not been consulted? I desired to know whether that was true. Surely that is a question which might be put to the Minister for the Navy? member's question was put to the Minister for the Navy. It appears to be one I j desire to ask a)n which might well be placed on the notice paper; but as the Minister himself did not rise to reply, I took it that he did not regard the question as one which seriously required an answer. through to-morrow. the Minister controlling shipping, upon notice1. Whetheri t is true that the wharf workers in Albany are suffering hardships through lack of work? 2. If so, will he, in view of the reported overcrowded state of the harbour of Fremantle, and the saving that would be effected thereby, divert ships, wherever possible, to Albany from Fremantle ? honourable member's questions are1. The Controller of Shipping has no knowledge of Australian wharf workers suffering hardship through lack of work. 2. Vessels carrying general cargo must discharge at the port for which cargo is consigned. Colliers have, in the past, been diverted to Albany in order to prevent clashing at Fremantle. This practice will be continued as circumstances permit. Treasurer, upon notice1.

Will he issue similar instructions to the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner? honourable member's questions are1. Preference to soldiers is the policy of the Government, and all means necessary to give effect thereto will be taken. 2.

Thesev men have repeatedly made application to thc Defence Department at Adelaide, and in other directions, but are unable to obtain any satisfaction. One man's loss represented £20, and the men desire to know who is responsible, and where they can get redress. Does the Minister know anything of the matter?

MrM c WILLIA MS (Pranklin) [2.55]. -The B ill now before us is quite a different measure from that which I understand was first prepared, and from that which many honourable members on this side successfully fought and defeated on two occasions. If the measure which is now introduced proposed the alterations which were contained in the former Bills, I should be found opposing them now as I opposed them previously. Sir JOSEPH member referring to the four Bills which were put through by means of the gag ? MrM c WILLIAMS which the right honourable gentleman successfully led a solid phalanx of Liberal supporters, with the result that they were rejected by the country. I am one who holds that the Federal Constitution Act , while it should not be sacrosanct, ought not to be treated too lightly, and I am afrai d that there is a tendency nowadays to indulge in constitutional tinkering, which is not likely to result in good for Australia. four years the Commonwealth Government has held supreme power. William Irvine told us that he could not define anythingwhich it could not do under the War Precautions Act . Commonwealth Ministers had f u l l and complete power under that Act to deal with everything which is contained in the B ill before us to-day, and a great deal more, but the experience we have had of the exercise of power given in that Act is not, in my opinion, very strong justification for seeking to obtain a continuance of it . A greater blunder could not have been made than was made in connection w it h fixing the price of meat. In Tasmania the result was that every butcher's shop in Hobart, except one, had to close, and the only meat obtainable had to be purchased at a very much enhanced price. I like still less the proposal to give the Commonwealth control of industrial matters. I do not think that we can handle many of these questions as well as can the States.

MrM c WILLIAMS W h i l e the W a r Precautions Act was ruling Australia it was not possible for the States to do very much in that direction. The Premier of Tasmania( Mr Lee) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), in the State Parliament, have arranged a common basis on which to produce a B ill which w ill enable the State Government to deal successfully with profiteering. After his interview with the PrimeM in ister, the Premier of Tasmania stated that it was his intention to go straight ahead with the Anti-Profiteering B ill , COOK -I s the honourable and the information I have received is that within a very short time that B ill will be the law of the land in Tasmania.

71,Mr Charlton,"The honourable membecause of the War Precautions Act. Every State is in the same position. MrM c WILLIAMS liaments are free now to handle the problem, and every State Parliament but that of Queens.and has indicated its intention of doing so. According to different points of view, Queensland has either the most extreme or the most advanced Government in Australia. They have been passing advanced or extreme legislation for a considerable time, and Queensland is the only Statei n the Commonwealth where Ministers are scurrying to get out of State politics. There we have the extraordinary position of a Government who have power to deal with profiteering to a considerable extent ber knows that the State Governments cannot deal with profiteering. MrM c WILLIAMS I do not accept the honourable member's dictum on that point. The States have absolutely sovereign powers to deal with any matter with which the Pederal Parliament has not dealt, and I believe that the passage of this Bill may very seriously affect the immediate action that is being taken by some of the States. two parties have agreed that profiteering must be dealt with, 'and they intend to do it at once. We shall have an An t i Profiteering B ill in existence in that State at the very time when the Federal representatives of Tasmania, are asking the people to agree by referendum to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with the same question some months later. When we were opposing successfully the Referendum Billsi n 1915, I expressed the opinion that many of the matters to which the Bills related could be dealt with by the States better than by the Commonwealth.

There is a tendency on the part of some people, and of eame members of this House, to steadily whittle opposing the B ill in this Chamber, I away the powers of the States and inpledge myself to support it in my own crease those of the Federation.

The Constitution of Australia is the best in the world. I know of no country that gives to its people so wide a franchise as the people of Australia enjoy under the Federal Constitution. have equal representation in the Senate. MrM c WILLIAMS In the United States of America, which has a population of 110,000,000, the same principle has served f a i r l y well for 140 years, although the inconsistencies of the State representation in the American Senate are greater than those in the Australian Senate. When we deliberately federated, we consented to a federation of peoples in this House and of States in the Senate. Proportional representation for the Senate is a very big question, which will have to be considered on its merits. There is plenty of work for this Parliament to do without attempting to tinker with the Constitution. A Frenchman once remarked that Englishmen say, "" It is a wet day. We have nothing else In Tasmania the to do; let us go out and k ill something."" There seems to be a growing tendency in this House when honourable members have not much to think about politically, to have a shot .at the Constitution. The only reason why I w ill not deliberately oppose this B ill in the House is that a time l i m it has been placed on its operation. is giving the show away now.

I have said from the public platform that I have absolutely no sympathy with the man who is prepared to give 6d. for a "" p o n y ' "" beer, or a t h i r d of a pint, and calls an indignation meeting if he has to pay 7d. a quart for milk. Neither have I any sympathy with a man who will submit without a word to the price of tobacco being raised from 6s. to 12s. per pound, but who screams out if the price of butter is raised a penny or meat a halfpenny per pound. profiteering has been in the cities; and it is not hard to discover it . I have j i : my possession some figures given me by a man who is directly interested in the business; and I learn that three and a quarter yards of cloth, sufficient for an ordinary man's suit, is sold by woollen mills for 25s., that it is made up in Melbourne at a little over 25s., and that the man who retails the suit over the counter is paid 25s. for doing so. It will be seen that as much is paid for selling the cloth over the counter as for the whole production of the wool and cloth and its manufacture into the finished article. I believe that tradesmen in Melbourne, and all the cities, are guilty of profiteering to an almost criminal extent, and that this has been going on during the whole period of the war. W it h the hides grown in Australia, and the leather and boots manufactured here, there is no reason why boots should have been in creased so much in price, but the price of the locally manufactured article increases with that of the imported article, which has to bear the cost of carriage oversea. While I hold no brief for the importer, who is a great profiteer, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the local manufacturer keeps well on the mark with h i m in the matter of prices. Much more effective work could be done if this Parliament would do its utmost to encourage increased production. oable message appears in the press to-day which suggests a way in which more could be done for the benefit of the country than has been done by the legislation we have been passing for years. This is the message:A despatch received in New York from Buenos Ayres states that the President of the Argentina has sent a proposal to the Argentine Congress for the formation of a National Agricultural Bank, which will extend ' credits to farmers and cattlemen, and aid in thc carrying out of the colonization, irrigation projects, and thc construction of granaries. As I say, such a scheme would result in more benefit to this country than * thousand Bills like that on which we are now spending our time. This cable caused me to look up the subject of the Argentine, and see how that country compares with Australia. I find that the total number of sheep in Australia dwindled from practically 98,000,000 in 1890 to 76,500,000 in 1916. There was a steady decrease year after year, w it h occasional fluctuations; and I am afraid I repeat that the chief that if we had the figures for to-day we should find them very much lower, owing to the unfortunate drought. Argentine, on the other hand, Has 81,500,000 sheep, as compared with our 76,500,000. It may come as an awkward surprise to members to learn that while the great State of Queensland contained about 15,000,000 sheep, Great Britain, which could be dropped into Queensland and lost, has nearly twice as many; indeed, GreatB r it a in contains more sheep than any State of Australia, with the exception of New South Wales. As regards cattle, the discrepancy between the Argentine and Australia is enormous, and while the production of wheat is decreasing here, it is increasing there. These facts are sufficient to make us pause and think. The great policy that this National Parliament must face in the near future, with our enormous debt, is steady, continuous increase in production, and we cannot increase production if we pass legislation which will hamper the producers and bring them under the ironheel of those who think that the country should be altogether subservient to the wishes of the city. There is no reason or room for a battle-royal between city and country; but I am glad to see that there is now growing up a determination on the part of those in the country, who deprive themselves of many A of the benefits of civilization, to take a firm stand and insist on a fair and f u l l reward for. their industry. It is difficult for a layman like myself to thoroughly grasp what is the real in tent and scope of a Bill such as this; and that is not to be wondered at when we find it necessary for the Government to consult the ablest constitutional authorities in regard to it . I desire to make my position quite clear. If I find that the intention of this B ill is to take control of local industries, and specially of the primary producers, and hamper them in any way, it ia not going to receive my one or two serious objections to this B ill . support when it goes before the country. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr. I do nob wish to labour the question; but McWilliams) said he would support it I do think that it rests upon those of us, because of the time l i m it attaching to it . who 'hold the views that I do, and who In my view, that is the weak feature of have opposed and defeated similar conthe whole proposal.

'3,000 years. so, this Bill, providing, as it does, that -the amendments of the Constitution em-bodied in it shall not operate for more .than three years, is only a sham and a make-believe. The Government propose to ask the people to give them power to deal with profiteering, but their supporters approve of this Bill only because -these wider powers if agreed to by the people are to he limited to a three years' period. In the one breath Ministerial supporters say 'that these powers are sought in order to protect the public-to fight the profiteer-'and in the next they want them for only a limited time. Profiteering cannot be crushed' in three years, and, therefore, this Bill gives the lie direct way they could prevent the export of to their avowed object. Labour party said last night that the Government could have dealt with profiteering under the ""War Precautions Act during the last three years. the Government haye had power to deal with profiteering, but have not attempted to exercise it. I take the. view that this Bill is merely an electioneering placard, and that there is no sincerity behind it. orable member ought not to vote for it. order to put the Government to the test. They say they wish to stop profiteering, and I would give themevery .opportunity to do so. It is plain, however, that this Bill is merely designed to carry them over the approaching elections. Had the Government desired to deal with profiteering, they could have done so under the War Precautions Act. Their powers under that Act are wider even than those now sought in this proposed amendment of the Constitution. I know that it is a difficult job to deal with profiteering. ber would sooner find fault with those who try to deal with it than undertake the job himself. months of the war, when a Labour Government were in power, there was practically no profiteering. But the profiteers know that the present Ministerial party is sympathetic, and they have been and are using their opportunities to exploit the public to the fullest possible extent. This Bill will be found totally ineffective. Since the public are being exploited from day to day in Tegard to the prices of food they consume and the clothes they wear, surely the Parliament ought to be unanimously in favour of taking action to protect them. Surely such a matter should be above party politics. We find, however, that the Government, have not been prepared to deal with the profiteers as they could have done by regulation. Honourable members complain about the price of boots, and yet the Government have allowed thousands of tons of leather and hides to be exported. They could prohibit the export of hides and leather until local prices return to a reasonable level. In the same meat until supplies for local consumption are made available at reasonable prices. every time! very well.

The procedure is an elaborate one, and the Government are going to resort to it to secure an .alteration of the Constitution for only a limited period. I am not a lawyer; but as a common-sense man, it seems to me that once these amendments are approved, as required by the Constitution, it will be impossible to vary or remove them without resorting once more to the process of an appeal to the people.

[ 3 . 3 5 ] with the speech delivered by honourable member for Franklin( Mr Mcwilliams); since, although he endeavoured to throw some light on the constitutional aspect of the B ill , he seemed to damn it with fain t praise. The part of his speech to which I take most exception is that in which he attempted to champion the Statesi n their desire now to come in and do that which, by this B ill , we seek to do. It seems the States have stood by for three years, during which he himself admits that profiteering has been going on, and they have made no attempt to check it or satisfy the public that they intended to check it at any time. It was not Hughes) called the Premiers of the States together, and made it quite clear to them that he intended to act, that any of them have been put into action with regard to this matter. Now, we see Tasmania moving in the question; and we hear of New South Wales attempting to move. My opinion is that the States could, three years ago, have dealt with this question; and, that if the Prime Minister had been here, the Government and the House could have dealt with it under the War Precautions Act. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) has taken up a more reasonable position than some of the gentlemen on his side of the House. He feels very naturally the fact that, on a previous occasion, he and his party not only voted for a measure of a much more comprehensive character than the one now before the House, but that they actuallv introduced it . They would place themselves in a very peculiar position before the public if now, supposing that the B ill were to be more extreme, and with less exceptions in it , they were to vote against it , or advise the public to do so. The honourable member says that his great objection to it now is that it is too limited ; but I remind the honourable member that half a loaf is better than no bread. If this House were prepared to pass, for a year, or for three years, a measure which he joined in advocating some years ago for I hope, howall time, the honourable member ought to be one of the first to support it and advocate it , instead of objecting to it because it does not go quite as far as he desires. I think I shall have credit in this Housef o r generally approachingquestions, even party questions, in an imparI was somewhat disappointed tial spirit. I confess that when I came the down to Melbourne this week, without knowing exactly what form the Government's B ill was going to take, I began to wonder whether an attempt would be made by the Prime Minister to re-introduce the measure which he unsuccessfully introduced some years ago to the people of the Commonwealth. If he had done so, I should have felt it my duty, in view of the course I had taken previously, and of my feelings with regard to Federation, to vote against it , in party, and in the House, and to advise the public to reject it. But I read with very great care the statement which the PrimeM in ister made, and do not hesitate to say until the Prime Minister( Mr that it was a thoroughly sound and sane review of the situation in which we are placed to-day. I have no hesitation in supporting this measure, and will show the House why I support it . I shall explain how I differentiate the position in which I stand to-day from the position which I took up on a former occasion. I have listened with great care to some of the speeches on the other side-som e of them. I preferred not to listen to-and I am bound to say that they seem to me to have been cast in the same mould, and to be all animated by one spirit. In the first place, it was ""quite evident that the old feeling of intense hatred towards the Prime Minister was dominating most of the honourable members who spoke on that side. I can look back on past years in this House, and remember how, even when he introduced the very measure of which this is a partial repetition, they dwelt on his every word and breath, and thought h i m a demi-god. To-day, because he has l e f t them, we see the same gentlemen giving voice and effect to their intense personal",30,Alteration Tasmania Will Deal With Profiteering Very
89,Mr Bruce Smith ( N O R T H Sydney),"hatred of h i m I do not call it political hatred-becaus e he has succeeded, notwithstanding all their opposition and all their attempts to defeat and destroy him. I am not at all surprised at that attitude. I have seen it ou many occasions since the Prime Minister has held his high position. They know very well, and the House knows, that I am not animated by any overweening love for the Prime Minister. I have opposed him in this Chamber for twenty years, and only lately I had the temerity to publish letters against h i m and his attitude over the League of Nations, so that I do not stand here as an admirer or advocate of his in regard to everything he does. But I do say unhesitatingly that the statement that he made yesterday was one on which he had evidently exercised great care; and I do not hesitate to characterize it as a thoroughly sane and sound presentation of the extraordinary position in which we find ourselves in this country to-day. It is all very well for gentlemen on the other side to ask, "" W h a t did you do then? What are you going to do now?"" Do they forget that the world has undergone an upheaval such as it has never known before? Do they know-becaus e they sometimes took very little interest in it-that this war has been the greatest in the history of the world, and has had extraordinary economic as well as moral effects upon mankind ? Do they recognise that the world to-day is hysterical and neurotic from one end to the other? I George's statement in the world is finding f a u l t with everybody else."" terical and not normal, and one of the consequences of the war has been that we find on a l l hands, not only here, but in Great Britain, the TJnited States of America, Prance, Canada, New Zealand, and even SouthA f r i c a , an extraordinary development of the attempt to make out of the public profits Which the circumstances do not justify. The economic and competitive spirit has been disturbed; nothing is fixed; nothing is stable. The consequence is that merchants and shopkeepers righ t and l e f t ; men who on other occasions would have been ashamed to enter in their books the enormous profits they have been making, have been overcharging the public and drawing from them moneys to which they were not entitled. hysteria ? ion is that a very large amount of it in this country has been due to resentment at the war-time profits tax that was put upon trade by this House. There has been a desire, although perhaps not a conspiracy, to pass that tax on to the consumer; and in doing so there has been a tendency to overcharge the public and draw from them sums of money to which these traders were not entitled. I need not here dilate upon these instances of profiteering. The honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) gave us yesterday some examples which are only parallel with those we all know of. I know of extraordinary instances myself. I heard of one case only the other day, in which a working f u r r i e r was turning out a particular kind of cape, without the expense of a shop or of rent, at £13 per article. He had sold similar articles to some, of the big shopkeepers in one of the Australian capitals. They were followed up,' and it was found that some of those big shops were charging 45 guineas and 60 guineas for the identical article that had been turned out by the maker at £13, and would have been sold to the public at that lower price, if people had happened to go direct to him. The hysterical condition of the people is shown in a variety of ways. I thoroughly agree with Mr Lloyd heard of a case in Sydney where a certain that "" everybody kind of lace was exposed in the window of a large shop at Is. 6d. per yard. It The world is hyshad been long in stock, but no sales could be made. Somebody suggested to the shopkeeper that he should raise the price to 6s. per yard, and the whole stock was sold in a short time. That is only another evidence of what I call the neurotic condition of the people at the present time; and while that condition is present it is our duty as a Parliament to do something towards reassuring the people and checking the tendency of certain persons to take advantage of the disturbed condition. There is no need to charge these people with a crime. There is no need to use ugly language, because we know that throughout the world people are ever trying to make money.

There is nothing to fear from the point of view cf the Commonwealth. This is a temporary proposal,"" put forward in view of an abnormal state of things existing in this country. We know that profiteering has reached an extraordinary development, not only here, but in other countries also. I suppose that most people have seen that extraordinary power is taken in France to l i m it the profit which a trader can. make Well, it upon a particular article. Government inspectors may enter establishments and was the other way take possession of certain goods which are apparently overcharged, and compel the proprietors to trace the goods to their origin in order to show that the specified profit has not been exceeded. We may do something in that direction by-andby; but, in the meantime, we are merely taking power to create the necessary machinery, and we shall have every opportunity of discussing it . I cannot see why honourable members of the Opposition should object to the B ill , or how honourable members on the National side can object to it . We take a certain step, no further than is consistent with the traditions of the Nationalist and Liberal parties, in order to prevent the recurrence If anybody and continuance of the difficulties created by an abnormal state of things. I shall have considerable pleasure in supporting the B ill , because I feel that we are on thoroughly safe grounds, and that we are taking the very best, sanest, and mostbalanced way of attempting to cure the difficulties which have arisen.

Why could not thisB ill say definitely what is to happen at the end of twelve months ? If we provide in this measure that these powers are required by the Commonwealth Government, and if the people approve of giving them, a Convention will be quite unnecessary, and the proposals can be permanently embodied in the Constitution. If it be good, to have the powers for twelve months or three years, surely it is better to have them for all time. My complaint against Federation has always heen that the powers allotted to the National Parliament were too limited. We are the National Parliament governing the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, yet we' have to make the admission that we cannot deal with anything in tlie way of trade and Bommeree. years ago. Commonwealth Parliament is still called the National Parliament, but every honourable member knows that our powers are limited, and that we are obliged to leave many national questions to the State Parliaments. Until power to legislate in respect of Trusts and Combines is embodied in the Federal Constitution permanently, those organizations can continue to operate in one State or another with im punity, because we cannot expect that six State Parliaments will pass uniform legislation to deal with them. Therefore, Let us the sooner we have a re-arrangement of the whole system of government, the better it will be for all concerned. The country is overburdened with debt, but there is still an overlapping of legislation and various governmental activities. What is needed is a Convention which will review the whole Constitution. If that were done, it would be possib'.e to effect savings which would give us some hope of liquidating our immense war debt. Do honourable members realize that the national debt of Australia, including the State debts, is greater than that of Great Britain was prior to the war? And yet we have a population of only 5,000,000 people. We have fourteen Houses of Parliament, seven representatives of the K in g , seven Supreme Courts and sets of Judges, and seven agencies in London. It is time that we set our house in order, and so re-arranged the Federal and State powers as to put an end to the present 1 am not quite sure enormous waste of public money. The Bil l provides that within twelve months a Convention shall be held to review the constitutional amendments proposed by this B ill . If the referendum endorse this measure, the Commonwealth Parliament will enjoy additional powers, but only for twelve months, because then our right to exercise these powers will be handed over to the determination of a Convention, probably composed of men outside this Parliament. This measure is tainted. It is obvious on the face of it that it has been introduced only for the purpose of influencing the election. There is not one line in the B i ll which provides that anybody shall arrange a Convention. Clause6 merely statesProvided that if no sueh convention is constituted by the Commonwealth before the 31st day of December, 1920, the alterations was true ten made by this Aet shall cease to have effect on the said 31st day of December, 1920. I admit that. TheI f the Government within twelve months do notarrange the Convention these additional powers will pass out of the Constitution, and the money expended on the referendum will have been thrown to the winds. We are told that if profiteers are discovered during the next twelve months they will be punished, but at the end of that term they can continue profiteering as much as",34,Alteration Tasmania Will Deal With Profiteering Very

I hppe that the Government will achieve success with the measure, and that profiteers will be dealt witb, but I say that it is an insult to the people to ask them to tinker with the Constitution in this paltry way. for Works and Railways) [4.12] I rise to make a few observations on some of the points which have been raised during the debate. by one honourable member on the Opposition side that a proposed alteration of the Constitution should be considered apart from party politics represents the proper spirit in which this measure should be debated. We are dealing with a Bill to alter the Constitution and to confer additional powers of legislation upon this Parliament. The method by which those powers shall be exercised afterwealth had to invade the, jurisdiction of wards will depend upon the complexion of the party authorized to give effect to them for the time being. But the essential consideration in each case is: What is the nature of the powers to be conferred? that ought to be invested in the National Parliament? That is the main issue. Our instrument of government, the Constitution, was' never meant to be a hard and fast piece of machinery incapable of alteration. The wording of the Constitution itself, providing for its alteration, the period of war, the Commonwealth had presupposes that it will be moulded and shaped from time to time according to the development and growth of the nation, and in order that it may be adapted to the changing necessities. We are now closing the war period. Fortunately for us, under the wide definition given to the power of defence, the Commonwealth had jurisdiction while the war continued to invade many of those domains which the Constitution reserves to the States. the safety of the Commonwealth, and the people who inhabit it, that the Commonwealth should exercise certain powers, which represented a very big inroad on the authority of the States. The Commonwealth exercised those additional powers mainly through the authority con*Precautions Act. It was found necessary to interfere in Intra-State trade and commerce, to interfere in industrial matters, to assume control over corporations, and to do many other things which the Constitution did not specifically empower this Parliament to do in times of peace. And the High Court in the case of Farey v. Burvett sustained the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The Chief Justice( Sir Samuel Griffith) stated, in the course of his judgmentIt is true that . . . in answering the inquiry regard may be had to extrinsic temporary circumstances of which the Court takes judicial The statement notice. That is to say, in order to decide the inquiry whether or not the Federal Parliament had power to legislate on a particular subject, the Court was entitled to take notice of extrinsic circumstances, those circumstances being that the war was in progress. Por the preservation of the nation the Commonthe States. Throughout the war period, those wider constitutional powers were exercised; but now that the war period is closed, the defence power in the Constitution under which we operated bears a difAre they powers ferent complexion. The extrinsic circumstances have been altered. Honourable members opposite have asked why this Parliament was able to pass the Commercial Activities Bill and yet is not able to exercise a general power of price fixing. There is an explanation. During complete jurisdiction in all matters affecting the defence and safety of the Commonwealth, even though State jurisdiction were invaded. Nobody could tell when the war would end. The termination came more quickly than was expected; but while the war continued we had power to pass legislation in certain circumstances even for a period that might extend -beyond the \war. For instance, this It became essential for Parliament decided that the moratorium should continue for a period beyond the duration of the war. This Parliament had not an indefinite power. It was vested with power to deal with the circumstances with which we were faced, and to pass legislation under it extending even beyond the date of the termination of the war,",35,Alteration Tasmania Will Deal With Profiteering Very

122,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Ministe rBecausei t distinctly arose out of the extraneous circumstances of the ""war itself. Inasmuch as the Commonwealth had undertaken obligations, and entered into contracts which were likely to extend over a certain period, and which did, as a matter of fact, continue after the close 'of the war, we had power under the defence provision of the Constitution to make laws which were necessary for the completion of those obligations and contracts,, even though there was an intrusion upon the State domain of legislation This Parliament had power 46 fix tlie price of . sugar, for instance. That was an exercise of the wider powers which the Oommonwealth possessed during the period of war. Parliament could, during the war, pass legislation covering the domain reserved to the State to continue even beyond the absolute termination of the war; but the extent to which it may legislate under these powers on post-war problems no one can precisely define. The War Precautions Act has been continued for a -period of only three mouths after the -termination of the war, when it will expire, and all powers under it will be gone. ment sought power to continue that Act for six months after the war, they had no more strenuous op-ponents opposite, who wished the Act to be repealed at once. Now, however, they desire to know why the Government does .not exercise a power which, according to them, ""is given under a discredited piece -of legislation. The position is that the war has closed, -the Constitution so as to increase or deand we are faced with a very serious set of circumstances arising out of the war. We are faced with profiteering and with tbe necessity of regulating trade and comis proposed now is to provide that this merce-wit h what the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) described as the aftermath 'of the war. We have also to deal with industrial unrest; and the desire of the 'Government is that they may be enabled for a limited time to legislate, not under a power that may be challenged -no t under a power which, if challenged successfully, would bring all our legislation to the ground-bu t with clear, -specific, definite authority, undisputed so far as our source of authority is conAfr. Groom. cerned. The only way that can be done is by amending the Constitution. We are, therefore, asking for power to deal for a limited period with trade and commerce, though within a State, corporations, trusts and combines, and industrial matters. By means of this Bill we shall be able to exercise effectively powers which cannot be challenged in any Court of law. Last night the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) asked me whether I thought the Bill was constitutional; and now I answer him in the affirmative. The Bill we are passing is within the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and when it is ratified by the people Under the defence powers this it will become a' valid law. The honourable member raised one question, and be will check me if I am wrong in my presentation of it to the House. He pointed out that the Government were taking only three years' power under paragraph a of clause 6, and that under the proviso the period might be -only twelve months. On this, the honorable member declared that the Government sought to amend the Constitution, and were by the proviso seeking a further When the Governamendment in an underhand way, which, in his opinion, was unconstitutional. I think the honourable member will admit that that is a fair statement of the point than honourable members he raised. Now, what are the Government really seeking to do? We are asking for an alteration of the Constitution. It -shou'Id be remembered that the power of -alteration is not limited or defined in the Constitution, except in three or' four specific cases. There is power to amend crease the Pederal powers under it, and to seek powers subject to conditions or for defined periods, and so forth. What Parliament should have certain -powers for three years, and setting forth that if certain conditions are not fulfilled, the powers will last only one year. That, I say, is a perfectly legitimate form of amendmenta perfectly valid amendment within the Constitution. It is proposed to confer powers on this Parliament which would enable it to deal effectively with particular problems without challenge during a certain period; and in this we are complying with the terms of the Constitution. The preamble to the Constitution Act commencesWhereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania. . . have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth . . . The source of our power and authority is the people, who were responsible for the Constitution, although legally and technically our authority comes from the Imperial Parliament. The principle of omitting from paragraph (i) the words "" with the Constitution is that, as this Parliaby ment receives its authority from the words Provided that the alteration of this people, no alteration can he made paragraph by Constitution Alteration (Legisin the Constitution without the aplative Powers) 1919 shall not be construed to proval of the people. The Governempower ment view is that, seeing the people spect are the source of our authority, a on such railways:"". Convention should be held to frame recommendations for alterations, and such proposed alterations must receive the ratification of the people of Australia. The proposal before the House, therefore, is essentially democratic. The desire is to enable the people to confer meanwhile on the Commonwealth such powers as, in the altered condition of things, are essential moveto the good government of Australia at the present juncture.

When the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill was before this Housei n 1904 Mr Pisher, on behalf of the Labour party, moved to bring railway disputes within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and ever since then this Parliament has deliberately decided that State railway employees should come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court.

There is a tremendous industrial upheaval in Great Brit a in to-day in connection with its railway services. party, however, shut their eyes to these facts, and say, in effect, that State railway employees are beyond the pale They do not recognise that railway servants have any rights, and they decline to take action to bring them within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court.

Drakeford, General Secretary of the Victorian Locomotive Engine-drivers, Firemen, and Cleaners Association: 2nd October, 1919. of letter and resolution forwarded to the Prime Minister to-day from our Conference.

The following is a copy of the letter sent by Mr Drakeford to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes): The Prime Minister of Australia, Federal Parliament House, Melbourne. Sir, By direction of the Conference of Locomotive Enginemen of Victoria, now sitting, I have been instructed to forward to you a copy of the resolution carried at its sitting this morning, and to make the request that your Government will be good enough to give favorable consideration to the desire expressed in the resolution, of having the question of enabling railwaymen to have access to the Federal Arbitration Court submitted to the people in common with the other matters proposed to be included in the Government's Referendum Bills. Hoping that this will receive favorable consideration, 1 remain, yours faithfully, It would seem that Ministerial supporters think that these men, instead of going to arbitration, should take direct action. Do they want this country to be thrown into a state of industrial turmoil ? Do they regard the State railway employees as pariahs, devoid of rights? But for the fact that a conference of the locomotive enginemen of Victoria happened to be sitting to-day it would have The Ministerial been impossible for this united representation to be made to the PrimeM in ister. The resolution readsThat this Conference, representing all branches of the Locomotive Enginemen of Victoria, strongly protests against the proposal of the Federal Government that the railwaymen of Australia should be denied access to the Federal Arbitration Court, and asserts that it is the desire of the 10,000 locomotive enginemen of Australia, whose policy has always been that of arbitration by .the Federal authority, to have the opportunity of approaching the Federal Arbitration Court for the regulation of their wages and working conditions, and it asks further that provision be made in the Referendum Bills now before Parliament for the question to be submitted to the people of Australia for decision.

If the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition were carried, the State Premiers would consider that their agreement with tha Prime Minister had been broken, and their proposals flouted, with the natural result that they would urge the people to reject the B ill . In my view the Prime Minister has acted in the best interests of the people in taking as much as he could secure with safety. A t the present time a committee consisting of Professor Harrison Moore, Jethro Brown, and the Solicitor-General( Sir Robert Garran), is meeting to see if the powers provided for in this B ill are wider than are necessary. If they come to the conclusion that -they are wider, has not the Prime Minister given his word to the Premiers that he will restrict them? That is a fair agreement. ThisB ill embodies an agreement, and if we introduce. amendments we shall alter the whole basis of it . For the honourable member for Yarra to move an amendment that would wreck the B ill , and then accuse those who oppose it , in-order to keep the B ill intact, 'cause, for political reasons, he thinks it of having some ulterior design against the railway men or some other section of the community, is 'to put them in as unfair a position as any man could t r y to place another in . I hope that the honourable member will not attempt to make political capital out of his -amendment, and waste the time of the Committee. His proposal is not going to gull .the people outside. The people of Australiaare too good sports to 'be gulled in that way. They will .see who are really trying to do the f a i r thing in the present situation. It is going to be hard, enough to stop profiteering as things are, and the Prime Minister is making the best effort he can to do so. He is giving this Parliament the speediest opportunity to do it , and, in the circumstances, tlie B ill ought to be allowed to go through a6 it stands. The very character of the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot ( MrA t kinson) indicates the illogical attitude adopted by the Government. The section of the Constitution particularly affected by this clause is one of the most important and far-reaching in its consequences and application to the affairs of Australia. We are proposing to extend the powers of the Commonwealth to deal without limitation with the most important avenues of trade and commerce throughout the whole of Australia. Yet the Government are opposing our amendment which removes the limitation that the Government themselves^ seek to impose. This clause will give them unlimited power over shipping, all kinds of air transport, and all kinds of land transport except railways. In view of the developments in the world to-day, one wonders why the Government propose to accept all responsibility regarding trade Professor and commerce as far as transport and communication in every direction are concerned, except railway communication. Undoubtedly, the elimination of the railway control is due to the attitude of the State Premiers at the recent conference with the Prime Minister. It is quite in line with the attitude of State Governments on previous occasions when a similar proposal was made. The PrimeM in ister ( Mr Hughes) has always taken up the attitude that the State railways should not be excluded, but he now accepts their exclusion, obviously not because he thinks they should be excluded, but bewise to leave them out at this juncture. MT . BOYD -I s not that a policy which both sides generally follow? with regard to-such an important matter as the Constitution of Australia, it is obviously a policy of make-shift that should not be tolerated. the practical, and not for tile ideal. nently practical to insure that the powers of the Commonwealth shall be unlimited over all avenues of trade and commerce, particularly in these days, when transport and communications are the vital avenues of trade and commerce. Thosei n particular, therefore, should be under Commonwealth control. There are on the Government side of the House a number of men who honestly and consistently support this referendum proposal. How can they square their previous professions with the intention of the Government to exclude the railways? When we were with the Prime Minister on the other side of the House, we and they strongly asserted that the railways should be included within the Commonwealth's trade and commerce power. On the other hand, there are members on -the Government side who opposed these",40,Arthur S Drakeford General Secretary

133,Mr Pinlayson,"But it is emiproposals, but are jiow supporting them. I believe they support this particular one because it excludes the railways, and they find a special virtue in that exclusion. I have been wondering ever since this Bill' was introduced what particular -brand of raenital soothing syrup the Prime Minister administered to induce those members now ^supporting h i m , who previously opposed them, to accept these proposals, and how he has been able to placate those who at one time refused to accept the elimination of the railways. He did the same thing with the Labour party in 1915, when we had agreed, as is well.known, to submit certain proposals to .the people. On his very urgent suggestion, we consented to withdraw them at that time. We are now confronted, we are told, with a different set of circumstances. Of course, the Prime Minister had a reason for doing what he did -then. He wanted to get away to England, and he told us that certain arrangements had been come to with the 'State Governments. I have always had serious doubts whether what he called facts then, as he put them before us, were really facts, and whether he had any distinct promise from the State Govern. ments that they would pass those enabling Bills conferring certain powers on the Commonwealth. Two things which must alter our whole view of these referendum proposals have emerged since then. The first is the war, and the second is the fact that Australia now ranks as a sovereign nation among the nations of the world. In the light of our experience those two points must profoundly affect our attitude towards the Australian Constitution. I stand here absolutely immovable in the belief that the reserve power with regard to trade and commerce, industrial affairs, corporations, and everything else should rest in this country with the Commonwealth Parliament, and not with the State Parliaments. If Australia is to take its place as a sovereign nation in coneglect to convene the Convention next operation or collaboration with other nations, our Government must have a clear and almost unlimited reserve of-power in these matters. Otherwise, they will be unable to.make arrangements, or to come to understandings, or even to act in any spirit of co-operation, with other nations, a quiet underhand, confidential way, because they will be hobbled, and restricted, and confined through their powers being circumscribed by the terms of the Constitution. What do the Government propose to do now? They arelimiting the powers still further. That will be the effect of this B ill , and I have no hesitation in saying that, as I have shown by my vote to-day, I would rather refuse these powers to the Commonwealth, even under present circumstances, than saddle them with the limitations, exemptions, and eliminations contained in this measure. 'The trade and commerce section of the Constitution is the principal section affecting our powers to prevent what is generally known as profiteering. As has been said, profiteering is not unknown in any country. It is always in evidence during war time. But what concerns me is the fact that -during the war this Government has had, by the direct authority of the H i g h Courti n its interpretation of the Constitution, clear and unlimited authority to deal with trade and commerce. For at least three years the Governmeut has been able to exercise that power in order to stop profiteering in every aspect, and the word "" failure "" has to be written across every act and effort of the Government in that direction. Yet the Government has the effrontery to say to the House and the people, "" Although we have to admit failure during the last three years to use our unlimited powers under the War Precautions Act , although we have withdrawn all the price fixing regulations, and although the Prime Minister has clearly admitted our absolute inability to deal with the matter, we ask you to give us these constitutional powers for twelve months, and we will show you what we can do. L e t us have them until the 31st December, 1920, and we will shake up the Bolsheviks and the profiteers."" I refuse, in view of the fact that the Government-have, in three years, failed to do anything effec-tive. to believe that they are capable or prepared -to do anything effective in the next' twelve months. If they refuse or year, all these powers automatically fall to the ground. The Government have simply to say, "" We will not call the Convention this year,"" and they can readily find an excuse for their attitude. Who knows whether they have not already, in which they are so clever at managing, come to an understanding with the profiteers ? How do we know that they have not said, ""Say nothing until this Bill goes through. We will take no action with regard to the Convention, and the whole B i ll will be worth nothing?"" making a most unjustifiable suggestion. believe anything about the Government, because it has to depend upon the profiteers for support at the next election. It has to depend on them for its election expenditure, and unless it is prepared to give them some sort of guarantee they will fight it instead of supporting it. ment at all in the matter, we may be quite sure that the Government is taking good care that it has an understanding with the profiteers before it goes to an election. The Prime Minister is not such a novice in political affairs as to take on an election without some understanding with the people onwhom he relies for support. perience of him ? is no novice in political strategy and tactics, and if he has taken action at this juncture, he is not doing it for any particular love of a fight, or from a desire to risk his ofiice, but in the sure and certain knowledge that he has prepared the way, and that the time is opportune. In regard to trade and commerce generally, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) says the world is hysterical, and that we should legislate only to cover the period of hysteria, and allow other matters to wait unti l things settle down. He thinks that we should therefore be content with this temporary extension of powers. In view of the fact that even those who have hitherto opposed every proposal to amend the Constitution now admit that amendments are necessary for the sake of the national life and security of the Commonwealth', we should not look upon the alteration of the Constitution simply as an expedient to get over a temporary difficulty. We should so t r y to amend it as to make it broad, and sound, and sure enough to safeguard the future government of the Commonwealth, and protect the interests of the people in every direction. This Bill does not profess to do anything of the kind. It proposes merelv a little bit of patchwork and a modicum of temporary relief. If that is not successful, we are given a promise that something else may happen, but we are told that if it is successful, it will prove sufficient for the purpose. The mere fact that the Government so utterly and absolutely failed to use the trade and commerce powers I am prepared to when they were able to deal with profiteering proves that what is really wanted is not an extension of powers, but a change of Government. Another reason why I oppose the B i ll is because I believe that there will be a change of Government at If there is any political arrangethe next election, in which circumstance it w ill not be a partial measure of amendment of the Constitution that will be brought in . The Labour party will promise that if they are returned to power the people will have an opportunity, within six months, of so amending the Constitution as to provide a permanent guarantee for the efficient control of the affairs of this country and the interests of the people of the country by giving them greater security in their various operations. That is the alternative proposal of the Labour party. The proposal before the. Committee now is anything or nothing, just as it suits the purpose of the Government. It may be used; it may not be used. It is a double barrelled gun in which _ only one barrel is loaded. There is no guarantee that if the necessity should arise the measure will be put into operation. The fact that the Government, having the power, have refused to exercise it is sufficient proof, if proof be necessary, of the truth of what I am saying. TheB ill is merely an election placard. The people will see through this obvious device to trap votes. Take the position of the railway men affected by the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor). They are to be excluded from the B ill , although the referendums proposed by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in former years included them, and naturally they must oppose this Bill on the very ground of their exclusion.

What the Government have done is thought the most effective way of achieving our purpose, which is to secure the welfare of the whole Commonwealth. This Parliament ought to have greater powers thau it is now clothed with, and it was not for us to seek to stir up strife in our efforts to get those powers. I recognised that this was not a State, Federal, or party matter, but a National matter. I called the Premiers together, as did the Labour Government in 1915, and laid before them the amendments as they were proposed in that year. But I came out of tlie recent Conference not as the head of the Labour Government did in 1915without an amendment l e f t ; I came out with the most effective amendments that are necessary to protect the interests of The honourable the people. The only limitation in the B i ll is a limitation of time, and it is an eminently proper one and suited to present circumstances. I say now, deliberately, that I do not think this is a final and satisfactory distribution of powers as between the Commonwealth and the States. I never have said so, and m y opinions remain unaltered. But we have to get these things done. Wha't is the history of the proposed amendments as to the days gone by ?They were defeated by the people, whether we submitted them at an election or otherwise, and whether as one amendment or as six. It is not by getting amendments defeated that the in terests of the people are conserved, but amendment, and honourable by securing new powers for the Commonwealth. As the Premiers were hostile, or, at any rate opposed to the amendments to. meet me in order that we might work together in the great purpose which the States and the Commonwealth are alike desirous of achieving, I thought it proper to listen, as I had done in 1915, to what I give honourable they had to say. Of all the amendments, the one affecting the railways was the only one to ""which the Premiers would not agree in any shape or form .

The clause does not l i m it the trade andcommerce power which is necessary for safeguarding the interests of the people.

Every one who knows Sydney knows what happened. The records show that in the electorates surrounding the railway termini in Sydney fche vote went against the amendment. It may be that in some of the other cities the vote was for the amendment; but where the bulk of the railway men were in New South Wales the vote was against it in 1910, and again in 1912. I was confronted with the position that I must press on with the amendment, which fche men whom we sought to benefit have turned down', or challenge the Premiers and invite hostility in regard fco all the other amendments. I took the course that anysensible man would take. I took a course which will enable the States, and those who desire to do something for the people, to work hand in hand with us. Let me come to another point. The honourable member for Maribyrnong rary.

There is the posiof all, the amendment) had t i o n ; and, on a fair analysis, not only criticism, especially from inember to whom I have referred, are overwhelmed, not because of the omission of the railway amendment, but because of the inclusion! of the other amendments. That is the last blow under the fifth rib that has pierced their armour and utterly dismayed them. never seen a more pitiable exhibition than that which the Prime Minister( Mr bitration Court had fewer friends Hughes) has just given us. In order to curry favour with his new-found friends, he spoke of what had happened at a caucus meeting of the Labour party, and also of many things that had never happened there. We on this side of the House could defend ourselves from his attack ouly by betraying the secrets of our party meetings. I would point out, however, that the chief statement made by the Prime Minister carries on its face its own condemnation. He said that the amendment of the Constitution proposed in 1915 to bring railway employees within the scope of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court had fewer friends in the Labour caucus than any other. I say so again. had the support of a majority of the party, otherwise it would not have been included in the Bill to provide for the amendment of the Constitution at that time. That fact in itself is a complete refutation of the right honourable gentleman's statement. I have not the slightest intention of mentioning the name of any honourable member opposite who at thattime also opposed such an amendment. I have never descended so low as to in dulge in personalities, and I hope I shall always retain my self-respect and the respect of m y honourable friends by . refraining from any breach of confidence. Unlike the Prime Minister, I shall not indulge in any "" hifalutin,"" nor shall I draw upon my imagination as to what has happened at party meetings. However we may disagree on political questions, we should at least have respect for each others' opinions, and not 6eek to make political capital against those who have been our friends by repeating statements made at party meetings. To do so is not to play the game. stand the Prime Minister to do anything of the kind. The point he made was that in 1915 the Labour party surrendered this same power to the States. fair, and do not intend to be on this occasion.

This amendment, under which it is proposed that State-controlled railways shall be brought' under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, is to m y way of thinking a piece of gross impertinence. It is an arrogant assumption of superiori t y on the part of this Parliament, and an attempt to usurp the rights of the elective representative bodies which own the railways, and whose constituents, as taxpayers, have to carry them on. 'who control the State railways are responsible for finding the money to maintain them. their own pockets, but out of fche pockets of the electors of the States. As Parliaments elected by the very people who own the railways are responsible for their success or failure, they are perfectly entitled to the f u l l control of them. honourable members who talk about the powers of this Parliament that it is a Pederal Parliament, created with delegated powers. Ifc is of no use for honourable members to kick because they have not the sovereign powers of the States, and because the States have not merely delegated powers. If they had asked for those conditions when Federation was brought into existence, there would never have been a Federation. It is because the States were jealous of the powers they hold that we had a certain amount of difficulty in getting the powers that exist in our Constitution to-day. Federal Parliament, when it was created, obtained all the possible powers that the people were prepared to give it ; and the people have been very chary of extending those powers when the question has been submitted to them by referendum. approve of the action of the Government in excluding the railways from this Bill. We are asked to give the Government necks which they could not manage. certain powers to deal with profiteering. have had a little experience in busiI t is because every honourable member on ness, and know the difficulty of building this side regards profiteering as an iniquity that we are prepared to give the Government those powers. I very much doubt Those honorahle members, howwhether, when they have them, they will be able to do anything wifch them. they will not. I am one of those only repeating what has occurred in history: In looking up some ancient history recently, I found t h -t one of the greatest autocrats that ever governed in Indiathis was 500 years before the time of Christ;-ha d his economic State organized into seven Departments, one of whicli dealt with price-fixing and profiteering. The penalty for the offence of profiteering was sudden death. I suppose that the worst_ even our opponents would support would be imprisonment. In spite of the severity of the penalty, the whole of the system of that monarch collapsed within Those his life-time. Do you think there have not been'wise men in this world since then who have tried to stop this kind of thing ? They do not find it out of Do you imagine there are noloopholes of escape from any regulation that you can devise ? The cure for this thing is free and open competition, and the prevention, as far as thafc is possible, of monopolies raising prices. You may be able to preI remind vent monopolies raising prices by legislation, but what happens when you have to deal with individuals in the way that has been suggested ? In Germany when these things were tried under war conditions the producers either did not produce, or they hid their produce. You would require a perfect army to control these things, and when you paid the cost of your army of inspectors, and added it on to the price, you would be a great deal worse off under your regulations than if you had left the thing alone in the first instance. I remember an old relative of mine saying long ago, "" My sympathy goes out to the Government, because The about twelve men put their heads together and t r y to regulate things in what they consider the best interests of the country, and every other person in fche community tries to see how he can defeat them.""

Would the directors of the Steel Corporation pay a man like Schwab £250,000 a year to manage their concern if he was not worth it ? If the Government nationalized an undertaking of that sort, do j'ou think they would pay any of their employees £250,000 a year? Do you think the people would let them do it? And how long do you think a. nationalized industry would be a success once it was passed over to Government officials? We should have an army of officials controlling these things, whose wages would have to be paid, and all the extra cost would have to be added to the cost of the product. Is not one of our great objections to-day to the enormous increase in public expenditure caused by placing extra officials here and there to control things? How do you think you are going to control these things without creating another army of officials if this power is granted? I have little or no confidence in the effect which these provisions will produce, even if they are carried. The Government want them, and I am prepared to support them. I say candidly that I would not vote for them if the B i ll did not contain the three-year limitation. I would sooner take all the responsibility of opposing the Government, as I have done on other occasions, and take the consequences, seeing' that we ar,e about to face the electors, use coal. than consent to sacrifice the rights of the States to the Pederation so ..that the Federation might play ducks and drakes with them. vernment could do anything effectively in three years? honourable member that I do not think this or any other Government, one from that side included, could d'o anything effectively in 3,00.0 years. You can talk about it , and promise all kinds of things; but, in my judgment, those promises are worth nothing. The main purpose of the B ill is to stop Wherever you have Government in profiteering. The amendment has absolutely nothing to do w i th profiteering, and, therefore, its introduction is merely taking advantage of the B ill to air ,a tions of the old Labour party, one section of which is now amalgamated w i th this party. with industrial unrest, and the railway question is, therefore, affected by it . perjence of the efforts of the Government to deal with industrial unTest. Before the Prime Minister went to England,, he tried to settle the coal dispute in New South Wales. Although he settled that difficulty then, all the difficulties that have grown up since are the outcome of Government interference -settled then ? what they asked for, and passing the cost on to the suffering public. That is an illustration of Government control; amd' that is how the seamen's difficulty has been settled. settled their difficulties, in the Old Country all through the waT. way. Talk about preventing industrial unrest! The Government, by interfering in the coal dispute, and giving the men all they asked for, instead, of allowing the case to go to the Arbitration Court, also gave the employers the right to put the price of coal up by 5s. 9d. per ton. That was not paid by the employers. It was paid by the people who had to Those are the actions that help to increase the agitation outside, because fhe cost of living is rising.

While some people 'have made big profits through the war and have no moral right to them, it seems to me that we are constructing an engine to crack a nut. on investigation that a very large percentage of the increases that hava taken place has been due, not to the operations of one trader here or another there, but to a multiplicity of operations by a number of traders through whose hands the article passes. These include freights, rates, in terest, and charges of all descriptions. In England most of the mills were converted for war purposes, and now have to be altered back again. This causes in creased capital charges, and consequently increased interest charges. factors add to the cost of the article before it gets here, but the peculiar thing is that the people who are producing similar articles here are charging equally as much. All such burdens as I have illustrated in the case of coal and in the case of shipping freights-ar e added to the cost of articles, and so the cost of living is increased and the agitation.outside is intensified.

This afternoon we were told by the objection to any dictation by the Premiers Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), in an of the various States. We were elected excitable manner not him, State servants; but we understood at the miers. However, I have come to the contime the Constitution was framed that all clusion that the only object of the Prime persons in Australia outside gaols and Minister calling the Premiers to Mellunatic asylums were to be afforded the bourne was to save his neck at the protection of that Constitution. We are told that if the railway employees of the States have the right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court, it will interWe shall find fere with the State management of railways; but, seeing that every private employer has to abide by the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, there is no reason why the State Railways Commissioners should not equally be bound by the awards of that Court. There ought to be uniformity in regard to the working conditions of railway employees in the various States. In . the State of New South Wales Wages Boards deal with the working conditions and wages of the State railway servants, bat similar tribunals are not to be found in other All these States. It is one. of our responsibilites to see that there is no differentiation as between members of the community. The State railway servants have as much r i g h t to go to the Federal Arbitration Court as haveotheremployees in the community. I object to the innuendoes of the Prime'Minister'this afternoon.

I do riot think the people 'will endorse his action in allowing himself to be domineered by State Premiers insteid of going straight to the electors and asking them to give to the Commonwealth the increased powers set out in the Bills which were brought forward in 1915. The Prime Minister must be f u l l y aware how jealously each State Premier guards every b it of red tape and wax, and will not give way in any direction in regard to the expenditure of money.

If we exclude railway servants, we might just as well excludeharbor trust employees, or the whole of the employees of the States. Sitting honourable members can vote against the amendment. TheB ill deprives a section of the community of the benefits of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. It is not many weeks since every honourable member on the Government side felt that it was his duty to urge the eeamen who were on strike to avail themselves of the Arbitration Court. Now, for no reason that I can see, they propose to exclude the railway servants from the benefits of that tribunal. Parliament should not, without the gravest reasons, differentiate between sections of the community. When tlie Constitution was framed, provision was deliberately made for the settlement of industrial disputes by a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I am at a loss to understand why the position of railway employees should not be the same in Queensland as in New South Wales; but how can we have uniformity unless all railway servants are brought under a Pederal Arbitration Act? I look forward to ihe day when all the railway systems of Australia will be under one control, and a passenger will be able to book from Sydney right through to the Northern Territory, or Western Australia, without any consideration of State boundaries. I was not altogether favorable to the Federal Constitution when it was first submitted to the people, but, like many others,* I accepted it as the best that we could get in the circumstances. It was never regarded, however, as a final and unalterable instrument of government. Provision was made for its amendment as the nation developed and conditions altered. It is quite easy to understand that, when the Prime Minister called the State Premiers together hurriedly, they had no time to consider what the Commonwealth Government desired. But impress upon them was that he desired to repeat Lloyd George's trick by hurrying forward the election. I believe that the results of the last elections in GreatB r i sent strike of railway men in that I am speaking to the country. A t the general elections Mr. Lloyd George's party swept the polls; but the subsequent by-elections have shown a change of opinion on the part of the electors. The railway employees of Australia will increase in numbers and suspended from 6.30 to 7.J/.5 p.m. become a very important section of the industrial community. I can understand I do not know how that Ministerial matters are in an awkward position. When the last Referendum Bills were introduced by a Labour Government, the then Leader of the Opr position ( Sir Joseph Cook)a very cute politician-withdre w his supporters from the chamber rather than vote against the measures. Honourable members opposite are faced with the same dilemma to-day. If they vote against the inclusion of the railway servants, they will have a difficulty in explaining their position, and they -will do! much, to prevent the B ill being accepted by the people. I shall do nothing to prevent the passage of the B ill , because I am ready to accept even the smallest addition to the powers of the Commonwealth. I look forward to the day when this Parliament will have greater powers, and be able to deal with all questions that arise, without being obliged to appeal to the people. Is there any honourable member who, at the commencement of Federation, dreamt that a Bill of this character would require to be submitted to a referendum of the people ? What is the need for appointing a Convention to consider whether whatever powers are given to the Commonwealth",54,Smith W E Would Give The Various Phases Of This Bill Although

226,Mr West,,55,Smith W E Would Give The Various Phases Of This Bill Although
227,Mr West,"on this occasion shall he continued ? We were prepared to trust the people on the occasion of the iast referendum; we were quite content to accept the decision of an intelligent Democracy. The reason why the agreed to in people viewed the proposed ments with some apprehension. is a good thing that the people do not act hastily. I do not believe that any issue that is submitted to the people by referendum will be accepted on the first appeal; the people will require to be educated to an understanding of the proposal before they will accept it . I understand that in Switzerland no referendum issue has been carried on its first submission. Honourable members must not think that, because the Referendum Bills were rejected in 1913, they will suffer the same fate on this occasion. ThisB ill considerably improves the prospects of the Labour party being returned to power in the Commonwealth Parliament, because the people do not trust those who' are sitting ori the Government benches to-day, and if they agree to an alteration of the Constitution they will feel more confident if the administration of the additional powers is in the hands of a Labour' Government. They will know that they will not then' have occasion to fear such tyrannical and extreme measures as were adopted 'by the present Government under the War Precautions Act. will vote to give the Commonwealth in creased powers, and at tlie same time put the Labour party in office. I do not think there is a precedent in any part of the world for the curtailment of a debate on a proposed amendment of tlie Constitution. Nothing could affect more seriously the interests of the people, and every facility should be given' for the fullest discussion. I have no confidence in the actions of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes); I have never abused him I have known him longer than any other honourable member in the House, but in regard to this matter he has not shown himself at his best. he is not confident of the result of the next election', and he regards this B ill as a means to help him to save his political neck.

230,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [8.20],"Th eof view. I am delighted with the process of conversion that has gone on during the last few years. It is delightf ul to find that so many honourable members opposite who, in the public interest, opposed these amendments of the Constitution in 1911, and again, in 1913, are today their most ardent supporters. Nothing is better calculated to justify the attitude of the Labour party in regard to the need for an amendment of the Constitution than is the fact that so many honourable members opposite who at that time opposed such amendments as bein? most inimical to the interests of the community, now cheerfully support them. The value of this Bill from a political point-of view is that it does not mean anything, and willdo no harm to any one. It has, indeed, a vital political value in that it will carry the Government over an election and show that they are progressive and anxious to secure the great era of peace for which we have all been devoutly wishing. I know of no stronger criticism that could be levelled at this Bill than that which has been offered by the daily newspapers. They have shown, that, even if this Bill be endorsed by the people, nothing can be done until July next, and that some months after that date will have to elapse before any of these powers can be brought into operation. shown, further, that by the time that these powers can be brought into operation they will be dead. These amendments of the Constitution are to die a natural death, because even should they be accepted by the people, a Convention is to meet and decide what shall or shall not be done with the Constitution. If the Convention is not convened, then these powers will automatically lapse. ' We are to spend thousands of pounds on a referendum, we are to work up intense excitement amongst the people,' to denounce profiteering, and then Parliament, after six months' adjournment, is to meet, and, if we do anything"", we shall have to thank God that even a little is possible. that is provided for in this Bill is not bound to be called into existence, but if it is convened, it can upset even the massed vote of the people of Australia. It can render the decision of the people null and void. [487]2 This Bill comes too late. There was a time when the amendments of the Constitution for which it provides were regarded as imperative. There was a time when, as the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) ' has pointed out to the House and the country, peace was essential, and when it was necessary to solve industrial unrest and the dislocation of the people's interests upon the fundamental rock of public robbery. The problem of public robbery, it was said, had to be solved. It ought to have been solved years ago. There was never a day nor an hour when that problem pressed itself upon us in a more marked degree' than it did when the war commenced. Pive years have since gone by. During that five years we have put into the political dust-bin, and have ignored from day today, week to week, and month to month, every instrumentality by which we might have protected the people and given effect to some of the things that we are promising to carry out under this Bill. In the early days of 1915 I told the House and the country that, whether the war lasted three months or three years, I was satisfied that .neither the Labour Government, behind which I was then sitting, nor any Government that might follow it would use their powers for the -annihilation of human liberty to protect the people against the profiteers who are They have now being denounced. That prophecy .has been fulfilled. A few days ago the Age newspaper uttered a greater condemnation of the present Government than could come from any honourable member on this side. It gave voice to a stronger condemnation of them than I could utter if I were to continue speaking for an hour. It pointed out to the people of Australia, .if they had ears to heaT and eyes to see, a fact which no man can ignore. It showed that the Government had, and still have at the present time, vast powers. It showed that while the War Precautions Act and the regulations made Under it were still maintained for The Convention many purposes, in those directions in which they could be exercised to protect the public-wher e they might be utilized for some purpose of public good -the Government had swept them aside and had left the general public to the profiteers whom they now denounce. This' is not my affirmation, or the affirmation of an extremist; it is the statement of the Age. ' the States to deal with. ber is speaking of this B ill . I am referring to something else. too late to deal with these matters. We have not merely to consider the question of solving the industrial unrest that can be settled by arrangement. The principles before us are vaster and greater than anything that could be touched by this B ill . The evils which the Government could have solved last year cannot be solved next year. Australia, like the rest of the world, is face to face with problems .to which the Prime Ministeri n the earlier part of this discussion referred. The future of this Australiaof ours is involved in the situation in Europe and America to-day. And the situation in Europe and America must inevitably be our situation next position is wholly and solely dependent upon the production of raw materials to supply the markets of the world. markets of the world to-day where our raw materials are required are absolutely incapable of buying them. hungering for our raw materials; but its machinery is dislocated, worn out, and in capable of replacement. Many of its railroads have gone, the machinery in its mines is falling to pieces, and we are told -that they are incapable of carrying on. So bad is the position that England cannot even produce as much galvanized iron as America can. America, 'we are told, has £600,000,000 worth of raw material in Europe, but cannot sell it . Paish, one of the greatest statisticians in -the world, says that the food-producing -countries can be kept from chaos and from dissolution in the immediate future only so f a r as they are able to. protect the great countries of Europef r o m absolute economic collapse. Hoover says that we are now face to face with the economic tyrants of the world, who can control the supplies on which the people live. Paish recommends that in order that Europe shall not be thrown into the melting pot by the instruments of hunger and unemployment, and the countries which produce the raw materials and the food saved from dissolution, a loan' of £5,000,000,000 should be made by the TJnited States of America. How does he propose to secure that loan? He wants America to subsidize Europe with food, machinery, plant, and other things of that character. He says to the Argentine, which is a foodT h e honourable memproducing country and also produces many raw materials, "" Europe cannot buy It , is now these raw materials, and, therefore, you must help to finance Europe. You have not the money, but you must help to guarantee to the money market of the TJnited States of America the interest on the money required."" To-day we see that the Argentine is advancing and subsidizing the markets in Europe to the extent of £40,000,000. Paish wants Australia, if it is to be saved from chaos in the immediate future, to guarantee immediately to the Americans the interest upon £50,000,000, which they are to advance. Prank Vanderbilt, of the National State Bank of New York, says the same thing. This is not the teaching of extremists, of Labourites, or year. Our of Socialists, but the greatest economists and financiers of the world, who see the world moving towards and being preciThe pitated into a great chaos. The war of blood has produced an economic situation. How then can this tinkering, this t r if l in g Europe is B ill solve the problem when men are walking about the streets of our cities looking for work? It matters hot how much you regulate things, or how f a r you fix the rates of wages. The question is : Howf a r shall prices themselves be restricted? And then, behind the wages and behind the prices, is the fundamental fact, with which you are coming face to face every day, that you must meet your enormous debts and obligations. You Sir John may levy another toll to-morrow to meet the crisis, but how f a r forward does that bring you? We owe, according to the Prime Minister, a war debt of £364,000,000. To that must be added another £100,000,000 to produce the war pensions and our other obligations to thesoldiers. There is another £55,000,000 worth of Australian notes to be redeemed. All these things pile up and pile up, and the Government have not attempted to meet them. These are the-problems which confront our country, and this B ill is so much piffle.

It has an insignificant population, smaller than that of New Ybrk, and little more than half that of -London. To a very large extent its immense territory is not utilized, and yet monopoly is rampant in it . They fake their statistics; they do all sorts of things, but the fundamental fact remains that two-thirds of the population of Australia have no proprietary interest in the lands, the domiciles, or the industries of the country in which they live. That is the outstanding fact produced by the present system, but what are the Government doing? W h at do either the States or the Federation propose to do in connection with the land question alone? Nothing! What do they propose to do in connection with the great trusts ? Nothing! What do they propose to do regarding the great monopolies ? Either the profits of those industries must pour into the public exchequer, the great financial in stitutions and corporations themselves must be utilized as public utilities, and capital and labour must be brought into harmonious relations, or we must have all the evil effects of clashing interests.

' The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question before the Chair. follow the Prime Minister, particularly in regard to this measure? BecauseI believe that he will carry out what he says he will do. Let me quote the words of a gentleman who was speaking recently in a rather aristocratic quarter of his constituency, an atmosphere different from that in which he spoke to-night, and from that in which he sometimes moves. I make this quotation to prove that I am supporting the right man. The Northcote Leader of the 17th September contained the following paragraph :"" The idol of the Parisian populace,"" is how Mr Anstey described Mr Hughes at the great Peace Conference. He wielded a mighty influence amongst "" the heads "" in England, too, according to Mr Anstey. Mr Larkin, Controller of the Commonwealth shipping, had told him that when they made difficulties about his ships, thethreat to go across to Paris and "" tell Mr Hughes about it "" ended the trouble. "" He was a great man when he was with us"" further commented Mr Anstey; and he left it to be inferred that he did not think the leopard had changed his spots, so far as ability was concerned. That is the honourable member's opinion of a gentleman he has so bitterly criticised to-night, and whom he says we should not follow because he does not carry out his promises. We see how this honourable member changes his views according to the atmosphere in which he is speaking. WhatI said before I repeat now, that it is in the interests of the workers of Australia that I should follow the Prime Minister. [8.55] I am amused when I hear the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith). On the first occasion on which I heard him he was addressing the workers of Hobart, and his language was -something after this styleHow long have we built houses we do not live in ?' How long have we made clothes we I remember one do not wear ? How long have we built railways and worked them, and yet are not allowed to -ride on them? Now, the honourable member is keeping company with those gentlemen who wear He the pants, live in the houses, and ride in the first-class railway carriages. member for Melbourne Port.3 does not ride second class'. whenit suits me to do so, and when it suits me to do so I travel second class. During this debate the honourable member for Denison has tried to score off honourable members of the Opposition by making statements which he had to stretch his imagination a great deal to believe were true. He claimed that there was no keenness on the part of honourable members of the Opposition to include railway employees. The Prime Minis-, ter ( Mr Hughes) has made the same statement. What are the facts? It is certainly true that the Prime Minister did try to prevent the inclusion of railway employees of the States, because he claimed that it would overburden the Bill to include them. The Prime Minister gave away some Caucus secrets to-day. Why should I not do so? What he said was true information was not true information He gets up in the House and makes statements, and thinks that the people will believe him. I can assure him that they will not do so. The very fact that he showed no keen desire for the inclusion of railway servants on the previous occasion, and has agreed to omit them on this occasion, is sufficient proof that he never intended to include them.

259,Mr Ttjdor ( Y A R R A ) [9.7],"As Iomitted. I regret .that honourable members opposite have seen fit to vote against the inclusion in the B ill of one' of the most important bodies of servants in Australia. I also regret that we had no opportunity of recording a vote on clause 6. I again place on record the fact that I was opposed to that clause, but, owing to the operation of the guillotine, I had either to vote against the clauses which I considered beneficial in order to show my opposition to clause 6, or vote for all of them. The limitation imposed by clause 6 makes the B ill absolutely valueless. It is well known that the reason why the B ill is being guillotined through the House is that the Government have determined to hold the elections on the 13th December, and they must get this B ill through the Senate next week in order that the two months prescribed by the Constitution may elapse before it is submitted to the people. The Government have a majority in another place,and, having seen the way that they have bludgeoned the B ill through this House, I realize that it is quite possible for them to do the same in the Senate to-morrow. The Prime Minister has told us that there is to be a second .Referendum B ill , but so far we have not been given the remotest idea of its contents I suppose that it will be submitted to the people at the same time as the other measures. Therefore it , too, must pass through both Houses, before the 10th of October, in order that an election may take place while the Prime Minister thinks the flowing tide is with him. It is quite possible that the honourable gentleman will find that the tide is flowing, not exactly in the direction he thinks it is. Although he has been able to persuade men like the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith), the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Palkiner), to matter correct. bers said not a word against the measure, the honourable member for Yarra are rebut sat here as dumb as the animals .in garded as a reflection upon honourable which some of them are interested.

The honourable member's statement is incorrect. garding the honourable member's vote, but it is correct in so far as the honourable member did not offer one word of 'protest against the B ill . He has swallowed blindly and dumbly everything the Prime Minister has said. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), the honourable member for Flinders( Mr. Bruce), the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith), the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) , the honourable member for Dampier( Mr. Gregory), followed the Prime Minister blindly, relying on his promise to them that the B ill is absolutely useless. order. The honourable member, for Yarra has stated that certain honourable members followed me blindly and dumbly, relying on my promise that the B ill was absolutely, useless. That statement is distinctly out of order and quite untrue, and I ask that it be withdrawn. Johnson) I have no doubt the honourable member for Yarra will correct his statement if it was erroneous, now that the right honourable the Prime Minister has taken exception to it , but I remind the Prime Minister that if he desires to correct a misrepresentation he must do so by personal explanation later, and not interrupt another honourable member's speech in order to do so. Prime Minister made t h a t promise, I have no doubt a trained legal gentleman like the honourable member for Parkes can see that the B ill is useless. I would be glad if the reflection cast upon myself and certain other honourable gentlemen on this side of the House were withfollow him religiously in this drawn. It is quite without justification.

Hadi t been possible to devote to it an ordinary amount of time, so that the various amendments could have been discussed, and had members been free of their ""arty pledges, and not bound by the vote recorded up-stairs, we should have produced ^ a much better measure than the B ill that is to be submitted to .the people. I regret that this measure is not one under which it will be possible to curb the profiteer in any shape OT form . It is merely a bit of camouflage, representing the .Prime Minister's last throw in a political gamble. He hopes to persuade the people that they were deceived in 1915, when the Premiers refused to grant the powers asked; b u t the B ill , if passed in its present form, will only be provocative of industrial unrest, in view of the fact that one of the largest bodies of workmen in the country is prohibited from taking advantage of it . These men w ill be driven to direct action instead of being able to appeal to the Arbitration Court, as they have been advised to do by honourable members opposite. I regret that it is impossible to vote on clause 6, which I consider to be the greatest blot on the Bill.' [9.17] -The concluding remarks of the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Tudor) practically give a "" l e a d "" to the railway employees to adopt direct action, thrown out may be adopted by them. Suggestions of this kind from either side of the House can do no good; and, in any case, It h i nk the exclusion-of the railway men is sound policy. t r u th in the old English practice of not going for too much, for a great deal can be gained by compromise. members opposite will never attain anything, for it is their characteristic to bang their heads against a wall. The railway men were, included in the first referendum proposals, and showed their gratitude by voting in the negative, as a reference to the figures w ill show; at any rate, that was so in my State, and I think in Victoria. As to the second referendum, the reply of the railway men might be described as a very attenuated one. The Government are anxious to have power to T h a t is not the statement control trade and commerce, and if we can disarm our opponents by accepting a I regret that we have B ill of this character, we shall have taken a very substantial' step. That, together with the assurance. that the matter w ill be further considered, is, I think, one of the reasons why the wing of the old Liberal party on this side give the measure their support. I respectfully ask the railway men not to adopt direct action. A time may come when the people w ill think it desirable that this Commonwealth Parliament should control the whole of the railways. That w ill not happen in my time, though it may come to pass in the time of some of the younger members. The railways at present are under the control of the State Governments and Parliaments, who find the wages, fix the rates, and are responsible for all the liabilities. Under the circumstances, there is much to be said in favour of their having f u l l control, as at present; but if , with the sanction of the people, the Commonwealth were to take over the railways, then their inclusion in a measure of this kind would be perfectly logical. In Victoria there is no necessity for direct action on the part of the railway employees, seeing that there is a State Parliament sitting in Melbourne, and a Labour party, which provides one-third of the members of that (Hindmarsh) Parliament. Can any honourable member who has been in public life for twenty years believe in the stupid, hypocritical yarn that this Labour party can do nothing for the railway men? A party and the suggestion ' thus which provides one-third of the members of a Parliament must, if it has any brains, obtain a great deal, if not the whole, of what the railway men desire. The Labour members in the State ParThere is much liament, however, are more interested in the abolition of State Governors, or the vaccination of cats, than in matters Honourable which affect their own constituents. If the railway men of Victoria, or any of the States, feel disposed to take direct action, they are to be condemned, for they are now in possession of political power; and I have been in politics long enough to know that consistent pressure by a strong party is bound to have its influence on any Government.",65,Third Reading

272,Mr Archibald,"However, one of tlie chief objects of the Bil l is to give the Commonwealth Government control of trade and commerce, and if we obtain that control it wil l mean much. Bourke( Mr Anstey) possesses brilliant talents and eloquence, but his speech of . to-night was such as any one can make. We all know the present situation, with the shortage of production in Europe and scarcity of food and raw materials. Is there anything that we can do to increase production and mitigate that unrest? Given the power, tliere is no reason why this Parliament should not do all that is humanly possible to solve the present industrial difficulties; but t h e y will never be solved by preaching class hatred. Direct action, which I have never advocated, means, logically, armed force and civil war. We must either have government tlirough the ballot-box or ' this armed force; and the supporters of direct action, while not believing in m i l itarism, seldom condemn foroe, and give a pretty clear indication of what a certain section of the community ought to do in order to attain their ends. In my time. I have said some very stiff tilings about the capitalist, and I cannot say that what I said was not true; but if the capitalist were ten' times than he is said to be, there is no reason for the feud to be carried on for ever.

The honourable member for back information so as to obscure their clear and conscientious view of the position. It may be said that amongst the people there are strong prejudices in connection w i th profiteering and so forth , but it does not become public men to pander, to the prejudice and ignorance of those who are suffering from high prices.

The railway _ men objected strongly to the way in which this was done. now tell the railway men throughout Australia, "" This Commonwealth Court of Arbitration is closed to y o u ; you are not fit to enter it . "" That is what that vote means. Those 60,000 men, among whom are many of the most keen and intelligent minds in the community, travel all over the country, and w ill tell the people everywhere how they have been treated, I am inclined to think and the infamy of debarring them from honourable members on that going to the Court w ill sink into the minds of the people. The honorahle member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) spoke about the British example. It is said in England that when justice is refused to any body of people, if tends to make them revolt. It was in that sense that my Leader( Mr Tudor) said that the vote taken in this House meant almost compelling the railway men of this country to resort to direct action. ' No man can ever say that I have advocated direct action way men voted against arbitration. England ever had a vote on the score of manhood before this war. If there was in England an Arbitration Court as there is in Australia, they would be glad to go to it . Our Arbitration Court has faults. There is terrible expense and delay in approaching it .

We were fooled. that? Only one of those six Premiers kept that pledge; only two tried to do so. My belief, and I say this in sober earnest, is that the Prime Minister was party to that in order to deceive his followers. It is said that if Ananias had lived long enough he might possibly have told the truth before he handed in his checks. The most . crooked iuan can sometimes go straight. If the Prime Minister is going straight on the profiteering question, he w i ll have my f u l l support; if he goes straight in the matter of bringing in a proper Tariff, as has been promised year after year, he w ill have my f u l l support also. W h y has he not been man enough, when putting this B ill before us, to do what he promised in the pamphlet he .issued on the 16th September, 1915?

The Labour party will, before using any of the new powers, pass the Initiative and Referendum Bill, which gives the electors power tr veto any measure of which they do not approve. That is the final and complete answer to all such criticism. If the Prime Minister had introduced that proposal on this occasion, he would ""have had me as a loyal follower, and the heartfel t support of every member of the National Association of Victoria, which adopted the initiative and referendum as a plank of its platform He would havo made a great name for himself as ths first to take this step. carried out what I thought in 1915 he honestly believed in ; and I have yet to learn tliat he has changed his opinion. He would have given the people who create this Parliament the power to direct its legislation. If the people outside had the power to control prices, what member of this House would refuse to put down profiteering? Every woman who goes to the shops knows that prices are beyond her means. An y mother of a family, who has to meet the bills of a household, will tell you that, as the pound is now able to buy only 12s. 6d. worth of food, she cannot make ends meet. The old-age pensioners are striving to exut on 1.2s. 6d. a week, but week after week passes and we do nothing to help these did he do people. I received a letter to-day from Mrs. Keily, of Corowa, enclosing a sample of coarse brown sugar, the kind that used to be sent to the stations in the old days at £ 7 a ton. This, she says, they are being charged for at 4d. a l b . , although I understand that the fixed price is 3£d. for the best white sugar. They are being threatened that if something is not dene soon they w ill have to pay 8d. per lb. for it. Throughout the whole category of necessaries, there is not one article on which the people are not being robbed. YetI could not get a division on the question of giving the people the power of the initiative and referendum. Perhapsi t is as well. Perhaps the Ministerial Caucus has decided that no amendments are to be accepted. If the Prime Minister had proposed it , he would have had the whole of the members on this side behind him, together with all his late followers who signed the pledge in support of it , and the whole of the Victorian members of the National Party, which adopted it . Then the people, who are the creators of this Parliament, would have had control of it . Under the present system, we, the created thing called Parliament, are giving the people outside, by our kind, permission, the right on one day of the year to create a new Parliament. A f t e r that we can do nothing, because the new senators who are elected cannot take their places in the Senateu n t i l next July. That has not been contradicted by anyhonorable member opposite.

I shall have no hesitation about going on the platforms during the election campaign, and recommending my friends to vote against the B ill , because the price attached to this temporary provision is altogether destructive of every principle on which we may base any reasonable amendment of the Constitution. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has had a motion on the business-paper for quite a long time in favour of the appointment of a Convention for the amendment of the Constitution; of course, he has had no opportunity of moving it , but the Government have evidently secured his support to their measures by proposing to have a time l i m it and call a Convention. It is evident, on the face of the measure, that the opposition to these proposals from honourable members on the Government side, who have always consistently, up to now, opposed such amendments, has been bought at the price of a temporary application of the amendments. gard the Constitution of Australia as an important matter; and although I realize that it is in need of suitable and reasonable amendment, to me to tinker with it and patch it up as a temporary expedient is an unworthy proposal. I have already pointed out that the Bil l ])owers that have already under the War Precautions Act ; and if the Government, during the three years in which they have had the unlimited power given by that Act , without restriction of time or circumstance, failed to make use of it to the advantage of the country, what guarantee is there in this Bill that it is possible for them to do any better with these amendments than, they did under the War Precautions Act? That measure had its proper place, and was useful in protecting the in terests of this country in some special is very directions, but in so far as these amendments of the Constitution seek to accomplish that same object, as It is. not my attithe W a r Precautions Act failed or proved inefficient, so also will these amendments f a i l, particularly as they are .only operativefor a limited period. honourable If they are to prove useful, they should be useful for the permanent remedying My votes have of social and economic evils, because the I emergencies with which they propose to grapple, and the abnormal state of affairs with which they propose to deal, are nofc passing phases of our economic l if e, but, unfortunately, are permanent features of it that require to be dealt with, not by spasmodic and temporary expedients, but by an honest and sincere endeavour to remove them. TheW a r ""Precautions Act sought to accomplish certain things in a very timid, halting, and lazy kind of way. ' Efforts were made in regard to profiteering, and economic affairs, and industrial unrest. TheB ill before us professes to' be the roaring lion going around seeking whom it may devour, and I am quite prepared to hear the PrimeM i nister and his supporters during the elections telling the country how unfortunately the Government were limited by the operations of the Wa r Precautions Act, and how they were unable during tbe war time, when things were unsettled, and opportunities were so unsuitable, to exercise all the powers they could have brought into play, but now let the people give them these amendments of the ConI restitution and they would see what the Government would do in the matter of giving protection against profiteering, and some satisfactory industrial peace. It is remarkable that while the same Ministers had f u l l and unlimited powers under the War Precautions Act to deal with prefiteering and industrial matters, profiteermerely proposes to perpetuate ing was most rampant in this country operated and the industrial unrest reached its climax. honourable member's party was in office? it did. member's party do ? honourable member would allow us to do.
