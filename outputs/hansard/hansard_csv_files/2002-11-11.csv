The following answers to questions were circulated: Trade Practices Act (Question No. 48) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Does he have administrative portfolio responsibility for Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. (2) Does section 50AA of the Corporations Act 2001 define control of a corporation in a broad manner, without specifying the percentage of controlling interest. (3) Does schedule 1 of clause 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act state that if a person has an interest in a company exceeding 15%, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the company. (4) Pursuant to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, is 15% the test applied for him to block acquisitions that would result in the control of a business passing to foreign persons. (5) Is he able to say whether, pursuant to the SANTOS (Regulation of Shareholdings) Act 1989 (SA), no shareholder can own more than 15% of SANTOS. (6) Pursuant to the clause 850B of the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001, is 15% the test applied to prevent market operators such as the Australian Stock Exchange or the Sydney Futures Exchange before ministerial approval is required. (7) Pursuant to the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, is a person prohibited from holding a stake of greater than 15% in an authorised deposit-taking institution. (8) What is the policy rationale upon which the figure of 15% is based. (9) At 15%, does the operation of a parent company over pairs of airport lessee companies constitute a controlling interest; if not, why not. (10) Does the parent shareholding interest provisions for paired ownership of Australian airports bring this threshold of 15% into conflict with Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act; if not, why not. (1) The Treasury Ministers have administrative portfolio responsibility for Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. (2) Section 50AA of the Corporations Act 2001 defines control of a corporation in a broad manner without specifying the percentage of controlling interest. (3) Schedule1 of clause 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 states that if a person has interests in a company exceeding 15%, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the company. (4) No. The 15% limit is a notification trigger. A foreign person proposing to acquire a substantial interest (i.e. 15% or greater) in an Australian asset or business must notify the Treasurer of the proposed transaction prior to the transaction being executed. This notification requirement is subject to specific exemption thresholds. The test applied to “blocking” a proposal is two fold. Firstly, it is necessary to determine whether the proposed transaction would result in a change in control of the Australian asset or business. If this is the case, the Treasurer must then judge whether the proposal is contrary to the national interest. If there is no change in control, the Treasurer can not issue a final order prohibiting the transaction. (5) Pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of the SANTOS (Regulation of Shareholdings) Act 1989 (SA), it is unlawful for a person to hold an entitlement to more than 15 per cent of the voting shares in Santos Limited. (6) The meaning of the honourable member’s question is unclear.

244,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) I refer the Honourable Member to the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to parts (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of question 2881 as it appeared in Hansard on 27 September 2001 at page 31826. (10) The cross-ownership restrictions in the Airports Act 1996 (Airports Act) do not conflict with the Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Part IIIA). Part IIIA and the cross-ownership restrictions of the Airports Act operate to achieve different purposes. The rationale for the cross-ownership provisions of the Airports Act is to ensure diversity of ownership. In contast, Part IIIA, in conjunction with certain provisions of the Airports Act, provides a procedure to seek access to certain essential services and facilities of airports. This enables businesses needing access to negotiate with airport operators on commercial terms, or if negotiations fail, to have terms and conditions arbitrated by the ACCC. Fuel: Rebates (Question No. 85) Does the Government have any plans to abandon and or modify the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme; if so, what are the Government’s proposals. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: Sunset provisions in the legislation for the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (DAFGS) mean that the scheme will cease to operate on 30 June 2003, at which time it, along with the off-road Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS), will be replaced by an Energy Grants Credits Scheme (EGCS). The EGCS will maintain benefits equivalent to those available under the DAFGS and DFRS. Australian Taxation Office: Communication Services (Question No. 99) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: Was Black Is White awarded a contract in excess of $1.3 million by the (ATO) to provide strategic advice and writing services to develop, implement and evaluate a communication program for all business tax reform products. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: In January 1999 the ATO invited tenders from providers of writing, editing and other communication services to assist in the delivery of an appropriately targeted education and information campaign. Black is White Communications Pty Ltd was selected as part of this process. Services Provided The Service Provider provides high level expert strategic advice and actions related to: developing and implementing a public relations and issues management program to support the tax reform public and business education campaign; building and maintaining relations with key stakeholders in relation to whole of government communication approach to tax reform; designing and implementing the Business Tax Review (Ralph) communication strategy; mentoring senior staff of the Whole of Government and Administrative unit within Tax ReformBusiness Education & Communication; expert strategic advice in the development, implementation and evaluation of an education and communication program for business tax reform products; development of communication strategies for sub-projects of tax reform to be provided in written and electronic forms; strategic advice and writing and editing services; editing and proof reading materials; and writing of materials and briefs for publication (such as fact sheets, booklets, electronic publications, and other materials relating to tax reform).",125,Questions On Notice

247,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has provided the followAustralian Taxation Office: Part IVA Panel (Question No. 157) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the existence of the Part IVA Panel at the Australian Taxation Office. (2) What is the specific role of the panel. (3) Is the panel a formal body; if so, what powers does it have. (4) Who are the members of the panel. (5) Who appoints the members of the panel. (6) How many meetings did the panel have in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000 and (f) 2001. (7) Are minutes kept of the meetings of the panel. (8) Are the minutes of these meetings readily available for scrutiny by the public. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The Part IVA Panel has been established to ensure that the Commissioner’s power to make determinations under Part IVA is exercised appropriately and fairly, by ensuring that each case has been considered objectively on its facts. For this purpose leading professionals from outside the Tax Office have been appointed members of the panel (see below). Apart from the application of Part IVA itself, the panel also checks that proper consideration has been given to the primary tax liability questions in the cases that come before it. The Panel also helps to settle, maintain and develop the ATO position on Part IVA, monitors consistency and helps identify trends. The Panel looks at cases usually just before the application of the general anti-avoidance provision is formalised, so that taxpayers will know their case has been properly considered before that step is taken. However, it is not necessary for a matter to be referred to the Panel if a materially identical matter has been previously considered by the Panel. (3) The Part IVA Panel is an informal, rather than a formal body. It does not have, or exercise, any power. The Panel provides advice to officers who have power to make Part IVA determinations. The Deputy Chief Tax Counsel who attend the meeting have authority to define the ATO position on matters of law. (4) The composition of the Panel varies between meetings. The Panel is generally comprised of a number of senior technical tax officers from the Tax Counsel Network. It is supplemented by community representatives with expertise in taxation law and Part IVA. The Panel is also attended by officers responsible for the case being considered, including an officer of the Tax Counsel Network. The people who constitute the Part IVA Panel in 2002 are: Des Maloney Deputy Chief Tax Counsel, ATO (Chair) Peter Walmsley Acting Deputy Chief Tax Counsel, ATO Phil Foster Deputy Chief Tax Counsel Amarjit Verick Community representative Jim Momsen Community representative (legal profession) Prof. Robert Deutsch Community representative (academia) Bronwyn Livermore Secretary (5) The members of the Panel are not officially appointed. A standing Chair is informally agreed with the Chief Tax Counsel. Community representatives are drawn from the Register of External Consultants maintained by the ATO. (6) The Part IVA Panel met for the first time on 14 April 1998. In 1998 the Part IVA Panel met nine (9) times;",126,Questions On Notice
248,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has provided the followIn 1999 the Part IVA Panel met eight (8) times; In 2000 the Part IVA Panel met nine (9) times; In 2001 the Part IVA Panel met nine (9) times. In 2002 the Part IVA Panel has met (9) times. (7) The outcomes of Part IVA Panel meetings are recorded in a report that is kept on file with the papers that were presented to the Panel. (8) These reports generally contain taxpayer information. Tax officers are therefore prohibited from disclosing the reports publicly by the secrecy provisions in the Tax Act. Individuals may request access to a report under the Freedom of Information Act, and such requests would be subject to the ordinary provisions, including exemptions, contained in that Act. Transport and Regional Services: Program Funding (Question No. 332) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) Since March 1996 how many feasibility studies or seeding grants have been funded from programs currently administered by his Department. (2) Which programs have provided the funding for each feasibility and seeding grant. (3) What sum was allocated to each feasibility study and seeding grant. (4) How many of these feasibility studies and seeding grants have matured into projects. (5) How many of these projects have received funding from programs currently administered by his Department. (6) From which programs has this funding been provided. (1) 440 (2) See Attachment A (3) See Attachment A (4) 128 feasibility studies and seeding grants have matured into projects within their original programme. Thirteen more are known to have matured into projects via other programmes. Many feasibility studies and seeding grants are still underway and a significant number of these are expected to mature into projects in the future. Feasibility studies approved under the Regional Assistance Programme (RAP) are expected to generate funding for subsequent stages from sources other than RAP. As a part of the RAP assessment process, funding is not given to feasibility studies where the project has little hope of being implemented or would exclusively depend on Commonwealth funding for implementation. At present, data on RAP projects is only available from 1 July 1999. Under the Rural Transaction Centres (RTC) Programme the development of a business plan is a prerequisite for submission of an RTC establishment application. RTC business planning projects do not mature into an RTC establishment project unless the business plan is able to establish the viability of an RTC for a community. Projects arising from funding for planning under the Regional Solutions Programme may be eligible for further support under that or other programmes. See Attachment B for an analysis of the status of projects under various programmes.

Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 651) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Does the Budget state that the Government has announced a policy for the offshore reception and processing of unauthorised boat arrivals seeking asylum, either at facilities on Australia’s external territories which are excluded from the Migration zone or third countries; if so, why is money being spent on the Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and why is money scheduled to be spent at Darwin and Brisbane. (2) What was budgeted for the construction of the proposed Brisbane detention centre in budgets prior to the 2002-2003 Budget. (3) What are the costs now budgeted and not disclosed in the 2002-2003 Budget. (4) What, if any, discrepancy is there between the two sets of figures. (5) Can his Department give a commitment that these centres will be used; if so, when. (6) What is the future for Port Hedland. (1) Yes. I announced the results of a Government review of mainland immigration detention facilities for unauthorised boat arrivals on 11 April 2002, including: The completion and commissioning of the Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre near Port Augusta;",146,Questions On Notice

255,Mr Ruddock,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,147,Questions On Notice
256,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The closure of the facility at the Curtin RAAF base, which remains available as a contingency centre; The scaled down operation of the Woomera IRPC; A preferred site for a purpose-built immigration reception and processing centre in Darwin at the 11 Mile Antennae Farm; and The establishment of Australia’s first permanent purpose designed and built immigration reception and processing facility on Christmas Island. (previously announced). As part of the announcement of the review it was stated that the ongoing need for the development of an Immigration Reception and Processing Centre in Darwin would be revisited after the preferred site at the Department of Defence’s 11 Mile Antennae Farm was decommissioned in 2003. The Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre has greater amenity and security and will be more cost effective to run than contingency centres in the more remote areas. The commissioning of the Baxter facility allowed the closure of the Curtin IRPC. The continued development of the Immigration Detention Centre in South East Queensland is required to take account of the need for detention facilities in that part of Australia as part of the Department’s ongoing compliance program. (2) No funding was provided for construction. Funding was provided on the basis of private sector development and leasing. (3) Funding provided in the 2002-03 Budget is for the acquisition of land, as reported in the DIMIA 2002-03 Portfolio Budget Statements. (4) None. (5) The Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre has commenced operations. Brisbane will be used as soon as it is completed and commissioned. (6) Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre remains part of the strategy for unauthorised boat arrivals. Employment: Nauru and Manus Island (Question No. 654) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: What are the industrial relations and human resource arrangements for Australians working on Nauru and Manus Island employed by UNHCR, IOM or any of the companies separately contracted to provide security, cleaning, or catering services. My Department does not employ people other than its own staff on Nauru and Manus. Employees of my Department are Australian Government employees under the Public Service Act and their employment conditions are governed by the provisions of respective Certified Agreements made under the Workplace Relations Act. There are arrangements with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other agencies to provide a range of services on Nauru and Manus, but the arrangements which Australian employees might have with these organisations are subject to the human resource management policies and agreements of their employers. My Department does not have details of employment arrangements and conditions provided by these agencies, but understands, for example, that Australians employed with IOM may fall under a range of different agreements according to international civil service standards for its staff. These agreements also need to conform with the industrial relations and employment legislative frameworks and conventions of the host countries involved. Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal (Question No. 657) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002:",147,Questions On Notice
257,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Does the Migration Act require both the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal to hand down decisions by making such decisions available to his Department and the applicant within two weeks. (2) Are decisions taking longer than two weeks to hand down. (3) What is the average time being taken to hand down decisions. (4) On how many occasions in the last three years have decisions been handed down outside the two week period. (5) What percentage of total decisions have been handed down outside the two week period in the last three years. (6) What is the reason for the delays. (1) Sections 368B and 430B of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) require the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) respectively to hand down decisions in all cases except where: the decision is given orally (MRT and RRT); the decision concerns a person in immigration detention (RRT); the decision concerns a person in immigration detention because of a decision to cancel or refuse to grant a bridging visa (MRT). Neither the Act nor the Migration Regulations 1994 (the Regulations) require the decision to be handed down within a specified period. However, the Act provides that applicants and the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) must be given a minimum period of notice of the handing down. In respect of MRT decisions, s.368A(3) of the Act requires the Tribunal to give the applicant and the Secretary of DIMIA written notice of the day, time and place at which the decision is to be handed down. The period of notice must be at least the prescribed period. The prescribed period for the MRT starts when the Tribunal gives the applicant notice of the day, time and place at which the decision is to be handed down, and ends at the end of 5 working days after the day on which the notice is received; or, if the applicant agrees in writing, at the end of a shorter period that is not less than 1 working day (r.4.27A). If the notice is posted to an address in Australia, the applicant is taken to have received the notice 7 working days after the date of the document (s.379C). In respect of RRT decisions, s.430A(3) of the Act requires the Tribunal to give the applicant and the Secretary of DIMIA written notice of the day, time and place at which the decision is to be handed down. The period of notice must be at least the prescribed period. The prescribed period for the RRT starts on the day on which the Tribunal gives the applicant the notice of the handing down, and ends at the end of 7 days after the day on which the notice is received (r.4.35E). If the notice is posted, the applicant is taken to have received the notice 7 working days after the date of the document (s.441C). With regard to both the MRT and the RRT, where the applicant or the Secretary of DIMIA are not present at the handing down of the decision, the respective Tribunal must notify the applicant and the Secretary of its decision by giving each a copy of the written statement of the decision within 14 days after the day on which the decision is handed down (ss368B(6) and (7), MRT and ss430B(6) and (7), RRT, refer). (2) to (6) As explained in the answer to part (1), there is no requirement that a decision must be handed down within 2 weeks. For the RRT the average time taken to hand down decisions is 21 days from date of invitation to attend the handing down to the date of the handing down, while for the MRT decisions are handed down between 14 and 17 days after the date of the invitation to attend the handing down. Where the applicant fails to attend the handing down of the decision, which in the RRT context is 79% of cases, and in the MRT context is approximately 69.5% of cases (as set out in the tables below), the written statement of the decision is provided to the applicant by the respective Tribunal within the 14 day period prescribed.",148,Questions On Notice
258,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In respect of the RRT, since the introduction of the handing down procedure, 79.4% of applicants have failed to attend the handing down, as set out in the following table. In those cases, the decision was mailed to the applicant within the 14 day statutory period. In respect of the MRT, since the introduction of the handing down procedure, approximately 69.5% of applicants have failed to attend the handing down, as set out in the following table. In those cases, the decision was mailed to the applicant within the 14 day statutory period. Year% Not attended RRT Year% Not attended MRT 1998/1999 67.0 1999/2000 79.7 1999/2000 65 2000/2001 81.0 2000/2001 70 2001/2002 78.3 2001/2002 72 2002/2003 77.3 2002/2003 71 Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 663) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) What are the details of the times, dates and reasons that the 80 air traffic movements an hour cap has been breached at Sydney Airport since the introduction of the cap. (2) What action has been taken with regard to these breaches. (3) Can he guarantee that there will be no further breaches of the cap; if not, why not. (1) Under the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, Airservices Australia is required to report to me on the extent of infringements (if any) of the maximum movement scheduling limit in each quarter. The movement cap reports covering exceedences of the 80 movement per hour cap since its introduction have been tabled in the House on 30 August 2000, 6 December 2000, 27 March 2001, 7 June 2001, 18 September 2001 and 14 March 2002. The reports and the supporting documents include dates, times and reasons for any exceedences of the 80 cap. (2) The Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 does not provide for any action to be taken for breaches of the cap itself. There is a separate regime under the Slot Management Scheme for aircraft that operate without a slot and aircraft that operate outside the allowed time limits that apply to an allocated slot. (3) There can be no guarantee that there will be no further breaches of the cap. The Sydney Airport Slot Management Scheme is a planning mechanism that limits the number of allocated slots to 80. Operational factors such as unforeseen delays can cause aircraft movements to “bunch up” and the aircraft movement may not occur in the hour for which it has a slot but move into the next recording hour. This could mean that the actual number of movements in the next hour may exceed 80, even though the number of allocated slots is still 80 or less. Aviation: Airport Noise Levels (Question No. 667) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 401 in which he stated that the effects of the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) at Sydney Airport has been to significantly spread noise impacts with a consequent reduction in the overall numbers of properties within the noise contours that form the basis for eligibility for insulation under the Noise Amelioration Programme, what is his justification for that statement. (2) Will he provide data on the number of noise affected households eligible for the Noise Amelioration Programme (a) prior to and (b) after, the introduction of LTOP. (3) How can an increase in the spread over a large area of the Sydney Basin lead to a decrease in the number of properties eligible to participate in the Noise Amelioration Programme.",149,Questions On Notice
259,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) What standard is used to measure noise in the mapping of noise contours to determine eligibility of a property to participate in the Noise Amelioration Programme. (5) What is the scientific basis for the selection of the chosen standard and what are the merits of selecting that standard over the alternative standards available. (1) See answer to question 2. (2) (a) In excess of 4,500 (b) the eligible number is currently just over 4,300. (3) Prior to the introduction of LTOP the burden of aircraft noise was essentially concentrated in areas in line with the parallel north-south runways. The effect of LTOP has been to spread this burden. As a consequence a smaller number of residential properties are subject to the high levels of aircraft noise exposure which would qualify them for insulation under the Noise Amelioration Programme. (4) and (5) The Australian Noise Exposure Forecast System was established following a major socioacoustic survey undertaken by the National Acoustic Laboratories. The ANEF system is considered more technically correct than other aircraft noise metrics and is therefore regarded as the most appropriate metric to use when determining eligibility for insulation against aircraft noise. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 678) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to his reply to parts (2) and (5) of question No. 403, can he indicate or give examples of how the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) might become aware of a change in the circumstances of the state of health of the former Senator, Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston, which might lead to the DPP reviewing the capacity of Dr Colston to stand trial on the twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts; if not, why not. (2) Further to his reply to part (6) of question No. 403 and part (2) of question No. 555, what would need to happen for the DPP to deem it necessary to review the case of Dr Colston. ston. (4) What did that report indicate in terms of the state of health of Dr Colston. (1) The DPP has indicated previously that it would, if necessary, review the matter. In July 2002 the DPP initiated a further review of the matter. (2) See (1). (3) 9 February 2001. (4) That Dr Colston was unfit to stand trial. Family Court: Allegations (Question No. 683) Mr Windsor asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Has he received correspondence and supporting documents from me concerning allegations made by Mr Dennis Brown JP that a Justice of the Family Court and Mr Peter Johnson interfered with a judgement of the Supreme Court of Queensland; if so, will he investigate the allegations. (2) Will he obtain a transcript of the Supreme Court proceedings. (3) Will he consider referring the matter to the Australian Federal Police for investigation when the transcript is obtained.

262,Mr Williams,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,151,Total 79 4 Total 69 5
263,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:I am advised that Mr Brown’s allegations appear to relate to a decision made by the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1976. In September 1999, Mr Windsor was advised that the material that Mr Brown forwarded to my Department in September 1997 was referred to the Australian Federal Police (‘AFP’) for their consideration of the issues raised by Mr Brown. The AFP decided to take no further action in the matter, noting that contributing factors in the decision were the lack of specific information provided to support Mr Brown’s allegations and the length of time since the alleged incident occurred. As Mr Windsor was advised, if Mr Brown has further evidence to support his allegations then my Department could make an assessment as to whether to forward such evidence on to the AFP for their further consideration of Mr Brown’s allegations. I am advised by my Department that Mr Brown has not provided any further evidence and that the material supplied by Mr Windsor, with his letter of 7 May 2002, consists of Mr Brown’s annotations on a speech given by Chief Justice Gleeson and does not constitute further evidence of Mr Brown’s allegations. It is not the role of the Attorney-General to investigate allegations of interference with court proceedings. This is properly the role of the AFP, which has in this instance declined to take the matter further. (2) Any investigation of Mr Brown’s allegations would be done on the basis of the evidence provided by Mr Brown. If Mr Brown considers that the transcript of the Supreme Court of Queensland proceedings in which he was involved might be of assistance in an investigation of his allegations, Mr Brown should obtain such a transcript. (3) If Mr Brown is able to provide any further evidence, the material will be assessed by my Department and, if appropriate, forwarded on to the AFP for its consideration of Mr Brown’s allegations. Sustainable Regions Program (Question No. 689) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) In relation to the Sustainable Regions Programme (SRP), who are the members of the committees for all the eight sustainable regions and when were they appointed.

Any official communication with the media should be sanctioned by the Chairman and approved by the Minister’s Office. CODE OF CONDUCT 1. Principles Members of the Committee must: 1.1 act with impartiality and integrity, conscientiousness and loyalty to the public interest; 1.2 ensure that the work of the Committee is not compromised or affected by any direct or indirect pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest; 1.3 ensure wherever possible that there is no public perception that the committee’s work may be so compromised or affected; 1.4 act as an independent adviser rather than an advocate for any stakeholder organisation; 1.5 ensure the confidentiality of information dealt with by the Committee; 1.6 act in good faith for proper purposes without exceeding their powers; and 1.7 be frank and honest in their official dealings with each other. 2. Confidentiality 2.1 With the exception of material referred to in paragraph 2.2, all information, whether written or not, dealt with by the Committee shall be treated as confidential unless agreed otherwise by a majority of the Committee. 2.2 Any member tabling a document may identify it as not being of a confidential nature, and seek the Committee’s agreement to that status. However, Committee members should not use such information for purposes unrelated to the Committee’s functions. The distribution of such information outside the membership of the Committee may be limited or restricted by agreement of the Committee. 2.3 Information available to members must not be used to obtain any advantage whether direct or indirect, for themselves or for any other person or body. 2.4 Confidential information available to members must be used only in ways which are consistent with the obligations of members to act impartially, with integrity and in the public interest. 2.5 Where confidential information is provided to a Committee member, care must be taken to ensure that the information is kept in secure storage, and that numbers of copies are kept to the minimum necessary. If such information is to be disposed of by a Committee member, it must be destroyed. 2.6 Members should avoid investments or business activities in relation to which they might reasonably be perceived to have access to confidential information which might give them an unfair or improper advantage over other persons. 3. Improper or undue influence Committee members must take care not to use their position on the Committee to influence any other member of the Committee, or an applicant or potential applicant for assistance under the Sustainable Regions programme for the purpose of obtaining any advantage for themselves, or any other person or body, whether that advantage is direct or indirect. 4. Conflicts of interest 4.1 For the purpose of this Code of Conduct, conflicts of interest arise when members are influenced, or appear to be influenced, by personal interests in carrying out their duties as members of the Committee. 4.2 Conflicts of interest generally fall into one of two categories : pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests. Pecuniary interests 4.2.1 Pecuniary interests involve an actual or potential financial gain. A pecuniary interest could be described as an interest that a person has in a matter because of reasonable likelihood or expectation of appreciable financial gain or loss to the person, or another person or body with whom the person is associated. 4.3.3 A person is taken to have a pecuniary interest in a matter if either the person’s spouse or de facto partner or relative, or business partner or employer of the person, has a pecuniary interest in the matter, or the person, or a nominee, partner or employer of the person, is a member of a company or other body that has a pecuniary interest in the matter. 4.2.3 A person is not taken to have a pecuniary interest in a matter referred to in paragraph 4.2.2: if the person is unaware of the relevant pecuniary interest of the spouse, de facto partner, relative or company or other body, or just because the person is a member of, or a delegate of a company or other body that has pecuniary interest in the matter, so long as the person has no beneficial interest in any shares of the company or body. Non-pecuniary interests 4.2.4 Non-pecuniary interests do not have a financial component. A non-pecuniary interest generally involves some form of personal advancement or gain for the individual or for others (for example, friends or relatives) in whom they have a personal interest. For example, it would include assisting with the preparation of an application for a member of an organisation. 4.3 Disclosures to be made by committee members 4.3.1 If: a member of the Committee has a pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest in a matter being considered or about to be considered at a meeting of the Committee; and the interest appears to raise a conflict with the proper performance of the member’s duties in relation to the consideration of the matter; then the member shall, as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come to the member’s knowledge: (a) disclose the nature of the interest to the Chair at a meeting of the Committee; and (b) refrain from voting on the matter. 4.4 Action to be taken when interests are declared at committee meetings 4.4.1 Any disclosures of interests and the member’s consequent refraining from voting on the matter in hand will be recorded in the minutes and, where a majority of the Committee considers it necessary, the disclosure will be reported to the Minister together with any relevant advice on the matter. 4.4.2 Where a member discloses a pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest relating to a matter under consideration by the Committee that member may, with the agreement of the Committee, contribute to the Committee’s discussion on the matter. 5. Use of public resources 5.1 The Department of Transport and Regional Services will ensure that financial, material and human resources are provided so that the Committee is able to perform its functions. All these resources should be used for the work of the Committee only, and be used effectively. 6. Gifts, gratuities, hospitality 6.1 Members must avoid giving any indication that gifts, gratuities or hospitality relating to their membership of the Committee will be accepted, either for themselves or for any other person or body, or that these may influence their advice. 6.2 Members may accept only token gifts and modest hospitality. Token gifts are taken to be those valued at around $20 or less. Hospitality is modest when it is not more than the Committee member would provide in return to that person, people or company. 6.3 If any gift, gratuity or hospitality of other than a token kind is offered, full and prompt disclosure must be made to the Chair, or the full Committee as appropriate. 7. Notification of suspected corrupt conduct 7.1 Any matter that is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to concern corrupt conduct should be reported to the Chair or directly to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. (6) and (7) The selection and announcement of projects is a continuous process. Each region is at a different stage and applications are considered regularly at SRAC meetings. Each SRAC recommends projects to me for funding. (8) A copy of the standard contract has been provided to Mr Ferguson. (9) Community groups, the private sector and local government.

Science: Stem Cell Research (Question No. 764) Mr Gibbons asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Has any embryonic stem cell research been carried out in Australia prior to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 being passed. (2) Has any funding been granted for the establishment of a centre for the purpose of carrying out research on embryonic stem cells; if so, what sum has been granted. (1) Yes. The Council of Australian Governments agreed that research with existing cell lines will be permitted to continue in Australia subject to observance of conditions set by the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 will regulate the use of excess assisted reproductive technology (ART) embryos for the derivation of new embryonic stem cell lines. (2) I am advised that there has not been any funding provided for the establishment of a centre specifically for purpose of carrying out research on embryonic stem cells. However, two grants have been made or offered for the establishment of centres to undertake research on a range of different",170,Organisation Summary Of Project Funding
273,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:types of stem cells as well as research into tissue engineering more broadly. The Biotechnology Centre of Excellence grant of $43.6 million, awarded to the National Stem Cell Centre, is for research on animal and adult stem cells as well as embryonic stem cells. Research on excess ART embryos to create new embryonic stem cell lines will only occur if the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 is passed. The government grant to the National Stem Cell Centre is not dependent on the Bill being passed. An offer of $5.5 million has been made to the National Centre for Advanced Cell Engineering over 2002-03 to 2005-06 to support the establishment of infrastructure to provide capacity to undertake stem cell and related systems research directed at tissue engineering. This contract has yet to be finalised. Superannuation: Preservation Age (Question No. 838) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 22 August 2002: (1) In a letter to the Police Federation of Australia, dated 1 October 2001, did he state that the Heads of Government Agreement that deals with the preservation age for superannuation schemes was being reviewed by the Commonwealth Treasury. (2) Has the review by the Commonwealth Treasury made a decision regarding the application of the preservation principles contained in the agreement to superannuation schemes for police officers; if so, what is the decision; if not, why not. (3) Which States raised concerns regarding the application of the preservation principles to superannuation schemes for police officers. (4) What steps will the Federal Government take to facilitate an agreement with the States to exempt police superannuation from the Heads of Government Agreement. (5) Does the Government support the police officers’ submission that they be able to access their superannuation at the age of 55. (1) On1 October 2001, I wrote to Mr Mark Burgess of the Police Federation of Australia in response to a letter from him dated 2 July 2001. I informed Mr Burgess that the Heads of Government Agreement that deals with public sector superannuation schemes was being reviewed by the Treasury and that, as part of that process, the preservation age concerns raised by the Police Federation would receive consideration. (2) I am informed that the Treasury has since completed its review of the preservation age requirements for police that apply under the Heads of Government Agreement. At present under the Agreement, superannuation schemes that are exempt from the provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act) are required to adhere to the principles of Commonwealth retirement incomes policy. The government has decided that it would not be appropriate to change the preservation age requirements of police under the Heads of Government Agreement. Accordingly, police will continue to be subject to the general preservation age requirements that are in place to deal with the challenges posed by an ageing population and to ensure that superannuation is used for retirement income purposes. (3) I understand that certain states raised concerns with the former Assistant Treasurer in the context of the review of the Heads of Government Agreement. However, the government’s position is based on the desirability of having a uniform national superannuation policy. (4) I am informed that the current preservation age arrangements that apply to police under the Heads of Government Agreement are consistent with those that apply to other sectors where work is physically demanding. Since November 1991, those entering the defence force, for example, are subject to standard preservation age requirements. Moreover, not all police are in superannuation schemes covered by the Heads of Government Agreement. The government is mindful that any change to the Agreement would, therefore, lead to differential treatment of police between those covered by the Agreement and those subject to general preservation age requirements under the SIS Act. (5) I am informed that on 20 September 2002 the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer wrote to the Police Federation on behalf of the government informing them that the government would",171,Organisation Summary Of Project Funding
274,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:not be changing the preservation age requirements for police under the Heads of Government Agreement. It should be noted, however, that consistent with requirements under the SIS Act, these police are currently entitled to access their superannuation at age 55. The increase in the general preservation age from 55 to 60 years is to be phased in between 2015 and 2025. Questions on Notice (Question No. 852) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 26 August 2002: (1) Is question No. 2 which appeared on 13 February 2002 on the first Notice Paper of the 40th Parliament the same question No. 2476 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 28 March 2001 during the 39th Parliament. (2) Did he receive a letter from the Speaker following my request to the Speaker on 20 August 2001 to write to him seeking an early reply to question No. 2476 understanding order 150. (3) Did he receive a further letter from the Speaker following my request to the Speaker on 14 May 2002 to again write to him seeking an answer to question No. 2 understanding order 150. (4) Did he receive yet another letter from the Speaker following yet another request by me to the Speaker on 19 August 2002 to write to him seeking an answer to question No. 2 understanding order 150. (5) When will he answer question No. 2. (1) to (4) Yes. (5) I refer the Honourable Member to House of Representatives Hansard of 15 October 2002 Page No. 7621. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 861) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 August 2002: (1) Further to question No. 678, does former Senator Colston’s recent demonstrated capacity to undertake both motor vehicle and air travel indicate a change in circumstances whereby the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) might consider reviewing the current state of health of Dr Colston with a view to assessing his capacity to stand trial on the twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts; if so, what might that review involve; if not, why not. (2) Since July 1999, was the DPP advised on each occasion of the full details of Dr Colston’s taxpayerfunded motorcar or aircraft travel; if so, what was the DPP advised and what action did the DPP take to satisfy himself of the nature of Dr Colston’s travel; if not, why not. (3) Since July 1999, did the DPP inquire of Dr Colston, or any of the medical practitioners treating him, whether any of Dr Colston’s taxpayer-funded travel was for the sole purpose of medical treatment; if so, what was he advised; if not, why not. (4) In light of the independent medical assessments by two eminent medical specialists who reported on Dr Colston on 14 and 19 May 1999 that his life expectancy was only months and which led to the DPP at that time determining that there was no prospect of Dr Colston being fit to stand trial on the twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts, is the DPP prepared to invite Dr Colston to offer himself for fresh medical examination and assessment by appropriately qualified expert medical specialists; if not; why not. (5) Will the DPP initiate immediate up-to-date medical assessments of Dr Colston by appropriately qualified expert medical specialists with a view to establishing Dr Colston’s capacity to stand trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts; if not, why, not. (1) I refer to my answer to Question on Notice 678. (2) Advice is being sought on Dr Colston’s fitness to stand trial. The DPP has requested that travel be taken into consideration. (3) No. See (2).",172,Organisation Summary Of Project Funding

Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 863) 28 August 2002: (1) Does the Sydney Airport Noise Complaints Line record statistics for the number of complaints made to the line in the evening after 5 p.m. when the staffed service ends; if so, what are the figures so far for 2002 and what proportion of those calls are from people living under the flightpath of the western runway. (2) Why are the phones not staffed between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. when families to the west of the airport generally experience the worse noise. (1) Yes. The Sydney Airport Noise Complaints Line records statistics for the number of complaints made to the line in the evening from 5pm when the staffed service ends. The year to date figures to August 2002 show that 1230 complaints have been received during out of service hours. 14% (172) of these complaints were received from people living under the flight path of the western runway.

279,Mr Williams,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer tonancial years of 1996-97 to 2000-01, was based upon the requirements of the Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth 1994 (the Policy) introduced by the previous Labor Government in 1994. Under the Policy there was no requirement for departments or agencies to provide my Department with much of the fraud information sought by the honourable member. I am therefore only able to provide answers to his questions in a limited sense, that is, where the previous Policy required departments and agencies to provide my Department with the information sought. I should also indicate that the type of detailed fraud information sought by the honourable member reflects the requirements of this Government’s Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines (the Guidelines) which I released on 13 May 2002 and which becomes operative for the 2002-03 financial year. (1), (2) and (3) Under the fraud Policy that operated during the period of 1996-97 to 2000-01 departments and agencies were required to provide details of the number of fraud cases referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the number of cases handled administratively by the department or agency.

Under the fraud Policy that operated during the period of 1996-97 to 2000-01, departments and agencies were not required to provide details on the number of cases referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions; the number of cases prosecuted by departments and agencies; or the number of cases where no further action was taken. (5) My Department does not hold this information. Under the fraud Policy that operated during the period of 1996-97 to 2000-01 departments and agencies were not required to provide details of the number of persons employed by or serving as contractors to the Commonwealth Government that were successfully prosecuted for offences involving fraud against the Commonwealth. (6) The information that departments and agencies were able to provide on losses under the fraud Policy did not distinguish between losses attributable to fraud and other losses and waivers. Accordingly, after 1996-97 this process of reporting on losses was discontinued. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 901) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 2002: (1) Who carried out the post-mortem examination following the death of a 28 year old Afghan asylum seeker in August on Nauru. (2) What was the determined cause of death. (3) Given the age of the man and no reported signs of disease or self-harm, why was his body not flown to the nearest available facility where a proper autopsy could be conducted. (4) What arrangements have been made for the return of the man’s body to Afghanistan. (5) What costs has been incurred and who will meet those costs. (1) Following the death, the Nauru Coroner ordered an autopsy, which was conducted on Nauru by a pathologist from the Victorian College of Forensic Medicine. (2) The precise cause of death could not be determined despite extensive post mortem examination including microscopic and toxicological analysis. There was, however, no change to the conclusion of the Chief Medical Officer of Nauru that the death was of natural causes. The pathologist indicated that being unable to find the precise cause of death is not unusual for sudden deaths in this age group. The pathologist raised the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia or epilepsy.",174,Organisation Summary Of Project Funding

Hague Conventions (Question No. 905) Will he bring up to date the information that he gave concerning conventions in the Hague Conference system in his answer to question No. 2743 (Hansard, 17 September 2001, page 30816)? Australia has ratified or acceded to nine Hague Conventions. There has been no change to this number since my previous answer of 17 September 2001. The Attorney-General’s Department’s work on Hague Convention matters is currently focussed on: administrative work required under Hague Conventions to which Australia is already a party (including the 1970 Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, the 1980 Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, and the 1993 Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption; work with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies on ratification of other Hague Conventions with priority currently being given to: The 1996 Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. The Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Act 2002 implemented those aspects of the Convention within Commonwealth jurisdiction.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) administers HECS repayments. The HECS management information system used by the ATO for this purpose is not designed to generate all of the data requested by the honourable member. The ATO data system can only identify HECS debtors as a single group. It cannot distinguish between graduates with a HECS debt and current students with a HECS debt.

(3) What incentives will the Government introduce for students to enter nursing training courses. (4) What major changes will the Government introduce to improve the (a) retention and (b) working conditions of nurses in Australia. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes (2) The National Review of Nursing Education contracted a number of bodies of research. One report, by Shah, C. and Burke, G. (Job Growth and Replacement in Nursing Occupations) projects 31,000 openings in positions for new entrants across the period 2001-2006, from directors of nursing to assistants in nursing. The paper provides these projections to enable estimates of the numbers needing to be trained to fill various types of positions. It provides no estimate of the relationship between demand and supply. (3) The Commonwealth currently provides the following: (a) Scholarships for undergraduate nursing in aged care $26.3 million over four years (2002 2006). (b) Support for aged care workers to access education, training or upskilling opportunities $21.2million over four years (2002 2006). (c) The Australian Remote and Rural Nursing Scholarship Program $13 million over four years (2001 2005) to improve access to undergraduate nursing education for rural and regional students. (d) The Puggy Hunter Memorial Scholarship Scheme $1.23 million over five academic years (2002 2006) for 44 undergraduate scholarships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in medicine, nursing and Aboriginal health worker courses.

Health: Iophendylate Dyes (Question No. 955) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 26 September 2002: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the view of an eminent American Director of Neurosurgery Dr Charles Burton that it does not appear that any significant study or due diligence was undertaken in regard to Iophendylate at the time the product was introduced or over the almost half century of its international use; if so, does the Minister accept that view. (2) Is the Minister aware of any evidence that shows that the producers of Iophendylate monitored adverse effects or continuing safety and efficacy of the product. (3) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the views of Associate Professor Palmer that a causal relationship between Iophendylate and chronic Arachnoiditis was well established in studies undertaken in the 1950s; if so, does the Minister accept that view. (4) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a 1995 report of the NSW Health Department’s Radiology Advisory Committee which acknowledged that Myodil is a cause of Arachnoiditis, a condition which may result in chronic severe and debilitating pain; if so, does the Minister accept that view. (5) Is it a fact that Iophendylate was never evaluated by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

290,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(10) On what basis did the Therapeutic Goods Branch grant general marketing approval of Pantopaque on 9 October 1979. (11) Is it a fact that the removal of Pantopaque and Myodil through aspiration was not universally practised in Australia. (12) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the advice of The NSW Radiology Advisory Committee which in 1995 stated that Myodil was not always removed following Myelography; if so, does the Minister accept that advice. (13) Were there standard Departmental and medical procedures which required aspiration by doctors and hospitals. (14) How many patients undergoing Myelography procedures were left with the dye intact and with no aspiration conducted. (15) Has the TGA the responsibility to reassure the Australian community that drugs in use are safe, effective and meet national quality standards. (16) Is there a need for an independent inquiry to investigate the (a) effects of exposure to the chemical Iophendylate, marketed under the name Pantopaque and Myodil, (b) basis on which Iophendylate was licensed, marketed and used in Australia and (c) social and economic costs arising from the disease. (17) Does the Chemically Induced Adhesive Arachnoiditis Sufferers of Australia group play a valuable role in assisting and counselling sufferers and as such deserves a commitment of resources and financial assistance from the Government. the honourable member’s question: (1) & (3) Yes. I am aware of the views of Dr Burton and Professor Palmer. I am also aware that iophendylate dyes were introduced into European and North American countries and Australia before modern evaluation and regulatory requirements for medicines were introduced. I am also aware that from the early 1970’s, arachnoiditis was mentioned in the prescribing information as a possible adverse outcome of myelography using iophendylate dyes. (2) Yes. The sponsors of iophendylate updated the prescribing information concerning these dyes based on monitoring of safety and effectiveness. (4) I have been advised that enquiries of the NSW Health Department have been unable to establish the existence of such a report. (5) No. In the late 1970’s the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s predecessor, the Therapeutic Goods Branch of the then Department of Health, evaluated an application to register the iophendylate dye, Pantopaque, for general marketing in Australia. This application was approved in October 1979. (6) The TGA is not able to substantiate any such advice from its records. (7) Yes. (8) The Therapeutic Goods Branch of the Department took the matter up with the company directly and also asked the company to finalise outstanding matters relating to its application for general marketing approval of Pantopaque, which was under evaluation at that time. (9) -(10) A general marketing application for Pantopaque was evaluated during the 1970’s. Such applications need to be supported by data related to chemistry and quality control, animal studies and evidence of the drug’s safe use in humans. The sponsor submitted chemistry and quality control data related to Pantopaque, a list of scientific publications related to the use of Pantopaque and all labels, product information and promotional literature intended for use in Australia. All of this material was evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Branch. General marketing approval for Pantopaque was granted with the following conditions: (a) all reports of suspected adverse reactions or related experiences were to be provided immediately on receipt; (b) any proposed changes to the chemistry and quality control details were to be forwarded for approval prior to implementation; and",183,Total $63 602 36 $3 401 69 $67 004 05
291,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(c) any proposed amendments to the product information were to be forwarded for approval prior to distribution. (11) -(13) The Commonwealth cannot comment about the way in which individual doctors or the medical profession in general conduct their professional practice, as this is an area that the Commonwealth has no direct power or authority over. Medical practice is regulated at the local level by the various State or Territory Medical Boards and by State or Territory legislation. I am advised that the prescribing information for health professionals for Myodil from the early 1970’s stated that the product should be removed after the myelographic procedure, and warned about the possibility of arachnoiditis. Once formally approved in 1979, the prescribing information for Pantopaque contained similar information for health prescribers. (14) It is not known how many patients undergoing myelography procedures were left with the dye intact and with no aspiration conducted. (15) The TGA is responsible for administering the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the Act). The objective of the Act is to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods. (16) -(17) There is no basis for conducting such an inquiry. These dyes were used by doctors to diagnose and manage serious conditions of the spine, such as tumours and herniated discs and were the best method available at the time they were introduced to the market and for many years thereafter. The availability of these dyes in Australia preceded Commonwealth involvement in medicine regulation. Information was provided to doctors about the risks of these dyes, and how to avoid adverse effects of such procedures, such as arachnoiditis. It is the role of the treating doctor to assess the risks and benefits of treatments for their patients and to make the best decision keeping their patient’s interests in mind. It must be remembered that these dyes were the best available technology when they were primarily used 20-40 years ago. It would not be appropriate to judge decisions made by doctors at that time against currently available technologies. As is appropriate, allegations of clinical practice issues concerning myelography and these dyes should be dealt with in the courts and through medical practice complaints mechanisms operated by the States and Territories. There have also been actions taken in court against those companies supplying the products in Australia. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 957) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 26 September 2002: (1) What are the arrangements for the provision of sanitary products to female immigration detainees. (2) How many tampons or pads are female detainees entitled to at a time. (3) How often are they allowed to request tampons or pads. (4) What is the process for female detainees to follow when requesting tampons or pads. (5) Following a request, how are tampons or pads delivered to female detainees. (1) to (5) Under the Immigration Detention Standards Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) is required to operate in a manner that preserves the dignity and privacy of all detainees including females. Request and distribution arrangements for sanitary products are therefore established to ensure that female detainees can be provided with their sanitary products in the most discreet manner possible. Each Immigration Detention Facility has individual arrangements in place for the distribution of sanitary products to female immigration detainees. These arrangements are tailored to meet the needs of female detainees at each centre and the arrangements take into account the physical layout (infrastructure) of each centre, the composition of ACM staff (availability of female ACM officers) and the profile of the detainee population. The individual arrangements operating at each centre are as follows:",184,Total $63 602 36 $3 401 69 $67 004 05
292,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Baxter Immigration Detention Facility Upon verbal request to a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member all female detainees are provided with sanitary napkins from a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member. ACM has advised that tampons are provided on request. However, tampons are not generally a popular product among the female detainee population. Female detainees are given a three months supply of sanitary products at the time of each request. They may seek further supplies when they foresee that their three months supply will run out. Sanitary products may be obtained from the nurse who is located at the nurses’ station in their compound. Sanitary products are supplied in discreet bags. Perth Immigration Detention Centre Various sanitary products are available to all female detainees. There is no restriction on the supply of sanitary products. There is no restriction on the number of requests. Female detainees usually ask a female ACM officer on duty for sanitary products or they can put in a written request to an ACM officer (preferably a female officer). On receipt of a request, an officer (preferably a female officer) will deliver the sanitary product to the female detainee by hand in packet form in a manner that is discreet. Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Female detainees are able to access sanitary products by requesting the products from ACM Welfare Officers. Sanitary pads are supplied by ACM to female detainees, or they may purchase tampons from the shop if they wish. Once a request has been made, a female detainee is provided with one packet of sanitary pads. Detainees may submit requests as often as necessary. Female detainees submit a request to an ACM Welfare Officer in order to obtain sanitary pads. Female detainees can collect sanitary pads from the ACM Welfare Officer on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Sanitary products are available in each compound from the ACM administration office block which houses provisions for the detainees. There is always at least one female ACM officer on duty. There is no limit placed on the number of pads or tampons available for distribution. Female detainees may request sanitary products as often as necessary. Female detainees may request sanitary products from a female ACM officer in the compound, as there is always at least one female officer on duty. Sanitary products are issued in packages that are discreetly wrapped. Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Sanitary products are stored at the ACM officer post in Charlie block dormitory. A small supply of sanitary products is also stored in the medical clinic. Upon request to a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member, a female detainee is provided with sufficient products to last five to six days. Most requests are for sanitary napkins, not tampons. There is no restriction on the number of requests made. Female detainees may either speak to medical staff, or to an ACM female officer, or they may request the products in writing. Either medical staff or female ACM officers provide the sanitary products to the detainees. Villawood Immigration Detention Centre As the majority of female detainees are housed in LIMA compound, which is fully staffed by ACM female officers, sanitary products are stored in the compound. Sanitary pads are issued five or six at a time (the female detainees have indicated that this is their preference), while tampons are provided in sealed packs of ten. Sanitary products are provided when required and on request. Female detainees, including those in the general compound, verbally request sanitary products from a female ACM LIMA compound staff officer. Pads are issued in discreet bags, while the tampon packs are small enough to be placed in a pocket or small bag. Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre Sanitary products are available from the ACM female dormitory officer. There is no restriction on the supply of sanitary products. There is no restriction on the number of requests. Female detainees can request sanitary products from the ACM female dormitory officer. Sanitary products are delivered to the detainees by hand. Curtin Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (now closed) Sanitary napkins were supplied upon request. Tampons were not popular with the female detainees. Supply was consistent with detainees’ monthly requirements, with a slight oversupply rather than undersupply of the products to the detainees occurring as a general rule, in order to ensure detainees’ needs were fully met. When required or anticipated to be required. Female detainees would attend the welfare area where products were dispensed through the assistance of a female detainee who assisted ACM staff in the area. Supplies were delivered in discreet bags.
