Monday, 11 September 2006 ----Migration Committee Report Debate resumed. Migration inquiry could be taken from the 2006 report of the Productivity Commission called Economic impacts of migration and population growth, which concluded: Compared with other countries, the Australian regime for assessing and recognising overseas skills and qualifications is well-developed and generally achieves its goals. However, there is evidence that, in some instances, the skills assessment and recognition arrangements for Australia could be improved to better meet their objectives. The Productivity Commission identified the need for better arrangements for recognition of overseas qualifications and skills, as well as consistent regulations and licensing requirements across jurisdictions, with links to competency standards. The work of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and this report go a long way towards addressing those areas identified as being in need of improvement. It should go without saying that as a nation we benefit from using the skills of our population to the greatest extent. But as was pointed out to the committee, as many as one in five independent migrants do not use their qualifications in Australia, and that is a waste of our most valuable resource-the skills of our people-a waste we cannot afford as a nation. This was also shown during the committee’s inquiry in relation to the not uncommon situation where a successful tradesperson applying under the general skilled migration program is later unable to satisfy licensing or registration once they have arrived in Australia. There are also cases where successful applicants under the general skilled migration program choose for whatever reason not to work in the trade for which they qualified. It may be that we have the most highly qualified taxidrivers in the world, but it must be said that there are factors within the trade recognition system which deter qualified migrants from working in their trade. I could add that location, which was the subject of the committee’s 2001 report on state specific migration, may have some effect on the willingness of skilled migrants to work in the field of their qualifications or skills. Another factor which the committee identified was that skilled migrants increasingly come from non-English-speaking countries, and poor English skills will reduce the chances of the migrant being able to work in his or her area of skill until they have improved their command of the English language. This leads to the well-recognised situation where the skilled migrant works in an area below his or her skill level, while they attempt to improve their English. Many find that they become locked in a low-skill occupation which does not challenge them to improve their English. It is a catch-22 situation and, while the committee recommends continued monitoring of the English language component of the migration program by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to ensure that migrants possess appropriate levels of vocational EngMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Notices

226,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (4.00 Pm),"The starting point for the Joint Standing Committee onlish, it is clear that intensive English programs can help to break the cycle of skilled migrants not using their skills and qualifications to the full. Another thing which affects people, particularly those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, is the difficulty and delay experienced in assessments by Trades Recognition Australia. The committee heard from a number of witnesses, and in submissions, who were critical of the delays experienced in the processing of applications and of the process itself, including the lack of a genuine appeal process. While there was some comment which suggested that the trade recognition authority has lifted its game, it was clear to the committee that radical change to the role of the TRA and its processes will be necessary if it is to fulfil its role in a fair and timely manner. While the TRA has the task of assessing overseas qualifications, it also has the task of assessing domestic skills in electrical and metal trades. This often means that applications are handled twice-once overseas for migration purposes and then on arrival in Australia for licensing and registration, including for an Australian recognised trade certificate. The committee noted that the trade recognition authority is not the only body capable of accrediting electrical and metal trades. This accreditation may also be carried out by registered training organisations, although it should be noted that the TRA places greater emphasis on work experience alongside qualifications such as an Australian Qualifications Framework certificate III. The committee’s recommendations calling for the Tradesmen’s Rights Regulation Act 1946 to be repealed and for Trades Recognition Australia to cease to conduct domestic assessments of skills in electrical and metal trades and confine its activities to international assessments are, as I said, quite radical proposals and will need to be reviewed by the Council of Australian Governments. Leaving the Australian recognised trade certification system to state based systems may not overcome the double-handling problem of trade certification. While the committee looked at the issue of skills recognition as it applies to a number of visa classes, the glaring omission in this report is the question of 457 visas. Now, for other visa classes, we are of course looking at migrants who will become permanent residents. As part of the selection process, we ask for levels of qualifications and skills which are in demand in Australia. But the whole 457 process seems to get around this. We do not check the qualifications of those coming to Australia to fill temporary skills shortages, even though this may lead to permanent residency. There is no assurance that 457 visas may not become a back door for permanent entry to Australia and, as the member for Fremantle pointed out earlier, the situation for family members is very uncertain. My main concern is that, while Australia has gone to great lengths to ensure that our high standards of recognised skills and qualifications are maintained, the admission of lower skilled workers into Australia can seriously compromise those standards. The effect of this was related to me recently-and you will see just what this means for the Australian workforce. A young man with a family who was a boilermaker by trade took a job with a contractor where he was working alongside about 10 other tradesmen welders on 457 visas. As a qualified tradesman he was able to carry out all of the demanding tasks on the job. He soon found that the overseas welders were not capable of carrying out many of these tasks and, while he found himself busy for the full day, the other welders could stand around waiting for him to finish a task. When he queried this with his boss, he was told that he was being paid $18 an hour because he was a boilermaker and they were only being paid $16 an hour MAIN COMMITTEE because they could not do some of the work. He complained that, since he was doing much more work than the others, he deserved even more money and said he was leaving unless he was paid more. His supervisor went to see the site manager and said he could pay him $28 an hour, but the young man refused and went and found a job as a forklift driver. He explained that the work was not as demanding and paid better than the $18 an hour that he had started on in the other job. That is what we need to keep in mind when it comes to skills recognition, whether it is in the trade area or the professions: if we dilute our standards, whether through relaxed recognition of qualifications or through a flood of unqualified 457 visa holders, then we will find that the bad drives out the good. Australians with qualifications and skills in demand in a world market will not sit back and see their wages and conditions eroded by an influx of overseas workers. This report deals with the important question of skills recognition, but until this parliament takes a closer look at issues such as 457 visas we will run the risk of seriously undermining a whole range of recognised skills to the great cost of the people of Australia. In the short time. I have left, I want to thank the great staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The secretariat have done an excellent job and they all deserve a great pat on the back. I thank them dearly. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Energy Initiatives Debate resumed from 4 September, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following document: Energy Initiatives-Ministerial Statement, 14 August 2006. some ways to listen to the Prime Minister’s ministerial statement in terms of energy initiatives. I would like to make a number of comments in relation to some of the things that the Prime Minister put forward. Obviously-and I think most people would agree-the LPG announcement that the government made is positive to a much smaller degree than the government is hoping it will be. Some people may feel a little bit cynical in relation to its introduction, particularly at a time of very high oil prices. In a sense, the government is looking for a detour in the debate, hence the introduction of the LPG arrangements. I think there will be a small uptake and that, for a number of reasons, it will be much smaller than that which the government is budgeting on. I know that members of the chamber would be aware that liquid petroleum gas in a few years time will move into an area where it is taxed, whereas in the past it has not been taxed. One of the underlying problems with the whole energy debate and the debate that we are having now on energy initiatives is the fact that we are taxing energy in this country. When I was an economics student, and since, in business et cetera, I always believed and had been taught that if you had an advantage in something in terms of export et cetera-particularly nowadays in a global market with globalisation taking place at the rapid rate that it is-then you took advantage of it.

There is public transport in the major metropolitan areas and very little elsewhere, but we continue to have a policy which is developed around what you would see in a closely developed, public transport oriented European society. We do not live in that sort of world but our energy policy and initiatives tend to be based on that sort of outlook. Even though I have heard the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and others on a number of occasions try to justify that particular policy view, it is difficult to comprehend when we live in a nation of this size where energy costs are part of our daily lives, particularly for country people who do not have a choice between a subsidised public transport system and using their own vehicles. In a sense, I would say that the government has shown very little initiative in terms of energy. Its approach has seen a simple form of taxation receipts where, as usage goes up, it can take more and more. By taking tax in little dribs and drabs at the bowser, where people do not necessarily notice it coming directly from their pockets, the government can accumulate vast sums of money. Those vast sums of money are currently at about $14 billion annually. About $2 billion of those receipts actually goes back into the road network in some shape or other. Many members would remember that the origin of the federal excise was, in fact, the road tax arrangements that were put in place about 25 years ago. The taxation receipts from energy have grown over the years because of that. Admittedly, a few years back the government removed the indexation of the excise-and I compliment them for doing that-but there is an enormous amount of money coming from the excise on fuel. I do not see that as being an initiative at all; in fact, I see it as operating against a country that is trying to compete internationally. We are continually told by some ministers within the government that agriculture and industry have to be able to compete internationally and to stand on their own two feet or they will go by the wayside, but we have in place an undermining of their financial structures. The question of energy runs through all industries, all communities and all individuals, who use it in their homes and so on. In some shape or other we have this regime of energy use, particularly petroleum energy, as a form of taxation receipt. Some in the government may suggest that it is way of rationing the use of the product by sending an economic signal to people to modify their behaviour and reduce their use of fuel. I say that is a red herring. I think the system is in place purely to raise revenue, and I do not see any initiatives where the government is actually looking at a means of raising revenue other than through fuel excise et cetera. I would say the government’s movement on energy initiatives has been quite appalling. Even in areas where taxation did not apply some years ago, the government recently introduced legislation that would impose taxation where taxation had not applied before. They have developed this argument that the excise is related to the energy generated from the various products. I refer particularly to one instance: ethanol was once untaxed. Now there is legislation, even though there is an excise-free period-and thank you to the Democrats and others in the Senate who stood up on this issue-until 2011, I think, and then taxation will be applied. Here again we get this mixed message. We have great concern about greenhouse gases. We had a debate in the parliament today during question time about whether the Kyoto agreement MAIN COMMITTEE should be signed or whether there are other ways of delivering the same outcome, depending on which side of the debate you happen to be on. What has the government actually done? It has imposed a taxation regime on people who are very keen to invest in renewable fuels. It has imposed a regime similar to that already on fossil fuels to sustainable renewable energy sources of fuel. The message it sends to the investment community domestically is quite horrendous. The government also put in placeback in the year 2000 before I was a member of this parliament-a mandatory renewable energy target of 350,000 megalitres. That was the target then. I am told-and the member for Kennedy and others have mentioned this figure from time to time, and statistical information I have seen verifies it-that currently we are at a rate of 30,000 megalitres. The Prime Minister had a cup of coffee with the fuel companies about 12 months ago to try and avoid the mandatory position that some were suggesting we should take-I was one of those people. Following the cup of coffee, some voluntary agreements were reached by the fuel companies and the Prime Minister that the fuel companies would achieve certain levels on an annual basis with a movement towards this 350,000 megalitre figure by 2010. We are six years in and we are at 30,000 megalitres. We have to multiply that by a factor of 10 to get to this paltry rate of 350,000 megalitres. This year the fuel companies, I am told, were supposed to have reached something like 90,000 megalitres. They got to a third of that. That says a number of things to me. The fuel companies are not serious about renewable energy in terms of biodiesel and ethanol, and the Prime Minister and the government are quite happy to let them play the game in front of the ball. Even if 350,000 megalitres were reached, it is 0.8 of one per cent of our petroleum needs. If that is an achievement, an initiative in terms of moving towards a sustainable form of energy, a renewable form of energy that has an impact on a whole range of environmental and health outcomes-small particle emissions from vehicles, the carbon balance and a whole range of positives-and an initiative of great magnitude, I would hate to see a small one. One of the things I suggest-and I have suggested it before by way of a motion in the parliament which was not adopted, I must say-is that the government and the opposition look seriously at setting up an authority. I would call it a sustainable energy authority. Rather than politics taking the main part of this debate, we should put in place an authority made up of expert scientists et cetera that can develop a strategy for the future and some decent initiatives for the future in terms of our energy requirements; that that authority not only look at the health and environmental aspects but also at the domestic production of some of these products; and that that authority also look at ways and means to achieve some sort of selfsustainability in relation to some of our energy needs. The United States are doing that. They have recognised that, given the events of the last five years in terms of terrorism and some of the religious conflicts that are occurring, they have to remove themselves from a reliance on the Middle East for some of their energy sources and they are moving at a massive rate to look at biofuels et cetera and many other alternatives. I am not suggesting biofuels are the beall and end-all, but it is part of the fix and it is a renewable part of the fix that our agricultural sector could be very much involved in. That authority should also look very closely in my view at the messages-economic, health and environmental, social and investment-that are sent by taxation on fuel, using fuel as a source of revenue. Perhaps, heaven forbid, we could actually look at achieving similar sources MAIN COMMITTEE of income from other means. The goods and services tax was introduced to replace what was seen at the time by this government as archaic penalties which were being imposed on the communities by the states through some of their ridiculous taxation incentives. I think the same thing could be applied here. We have to look at some of the options. I was recently in the United States. Their federal government had backed up the states in their energy standards and quality legislation relating to biofuels. One of the things that came across very clearly was that the industry could never have taken off if the states had not mandated a certain level of usage, with that level of usage being phased in over a period of time. For instance, in the city of Minneapolis the 10 per cent mandate had been phased in over a four-year period. Major cities were done in the first year, the outskirts of the major cities were done in the second year and the country areas were phased in in years 3 and 4. It was not necessarily done just to support the regional economies of agriculture, although that was a very important part. It was also done to improve the health regimes-the emission controlswithin those particular cities. In conclusion, I would say to the Prime Minister that the initiatives have been very poor. We need to address these issues and we should do so in a much more substantive fashion. (Time expired) member for New England, as always, in looking at alternatives for this country. We live in a time of volatile fuel prices due to some of the turmoil in the Middle East, the difficulties in Nigeria, the diminishing supplies in other areas, a lack of further oil discoveries in Australia and a lack of government response to help stimulate more exploration. A committee that I sat on in this parliament, the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, made a recommendation for flow-through shares, which is an opportunity for small companies to raise money for exploration. In Canada it was a very successful model which allowed their smaller companies to get involved in more exploration. We have had none of that here. Some of the government members on that committee certainly lobbied for it, but of course it has not been taken up. The Prime Minister’s paper was very poor and there were very few ideas in it. There were a lot of words but no initiatives of note. This all comes at a time when the economy is beginning to show signs of slowing down. The Prime Minister does not want to recognise that and he always has a contrary view. This government is really not looking at the burden that the price of fuel is putting on many Australians. The Prime Minister’s paper stated that the most important thing was the high demand coming from developing countries like China and India-that they were putting enormous pressure on the supply of oil-and that events such as Hurricane Katrina and the shutdown of the pipeline in Alaska limited the amount of oil coming from the United States. That leaves Australia with a problem. Because we have very little capacity to control petrol prices, that has left us at the sway of market forces, and that is happening now. Fortunately, many of the constituents that we look after have a lot more understanding of their own concerns than this government does. They are feeling those increased prices-fuel prices are hurting them in their back pocket. People are saying that we in the parliament and the government in general should be sorting out the energy needs of the country by looking for alternatives, providing alternatives and encouraging alternatives. Instead, we continue to be beholden to outside powers for the supply of our fuel. MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Ministerial Statements
228,Mr Adams (Lyons) (4.26 Pm),"That was a very good and thoughtful speech by theThe population of this great country, Australia, is so scattered and widely dispersed that the cost of fuel has a huge impact on the daily lives of many people, but they have few alternatives. In my electorate, for instance, even if people wanted to ride a bike, they would have to ride a very long way in some areas to do what they wanted to do. They have to use a car. Many people have to drive their cars a long way to get to work, and fuel is an extra cost that they have to meet out of their weekly income. For many people, travelling is a basic necessity; it is part of their day-to-day activities. People in remote and regional communities have enormous energy problems. In many areas of Australia, people rely on diesel not only for transport but also for power generation. Most areas of Australia do not have good, renewable hydro-electric energy to use as we do in Tasmania. We have also had good opportunities to use wind power; hydro-electricity and wind can cut in and out very easily. When the Prime Minister arrived in Northern Tasmania recently, the closure of the windmill factory at Wynyard, which is just on the other side of Burnie, was announced and 65 jobs were lost. This occurred because the government has not considered giving the opportunities to wind power that it should. When we think about it, there are many roads that we can go down to look for alternatives. There are many alternatives being developed. In Tasmania, one of our universities is undertaking research into hydrogen engines. This will be a vital bit of research for our transport future. There are many roads that we could go down in our search for alternatives to petrol and diesel. We could consider ethanol, not just as an addition to fuel but in its own right. There is also natural gas, propane, hydrogen, biodiesel, electricity, methanol and p-series fuel. P-series fuel is a family of renewable non-petroleum liquid fuels that can be substituted for gasoline. They are a blend of 25 or so domestically produced ingredients. About 35 per cent of p-series fuel comes from light by-products known as C5-plus or pentane-plus, which are left over when natural gas is processed for transport and marketing. It is composed of about 45 per cent ethanol fermented from corn and 20 per cent MeTHF, which is derived from lignocellulose biomass, paper sludge, paper waste, food waste, yard and wood waste or agricultural waste. There are enormous opportunities for us to use these wastes and turn them into fuels. This is where we should be spending some money. So there are many opportunities that we can pursue and could have pursued earlier if this government had been a bit more proactive and had seen what would happen if we hit out at the biggest source of our fuel-the Middle East and, in particular, Iraq. The US thought they could get something for nothing when they instigated all this and now we are hearing the lies that we have been supporting and the hypocrisy that has been evident to cover it all up. It has also been about oil. It has always been about oil. All the funds we have pursued with this war in Iraq could have been better spent in investigating alternative fuels and alternative machines to run with alternative fuels. The Labor Party has been a strong supporter of alternative energy development, including biofuels. The use of ethanol in the Commonwealth government’s fleet has already been brought on. Labor governments in New South Wales and Queensland have also already introduced its use and are providing incentives for people to change. Now we have the government leaping into producing thousands of dollars of incentives for people to change their cars over to LPG. What the government has not said is that the cost is going to be a lot more than that MAIN COMMITTEE which is being allowed for through these grants. It is going to cost people considerably more-probably double what can be claimed for. The government also did not mention that there are very few people who can actually undertake the work. We are not very skilled up in this area and we will need to skill people up before people can get this conversion work done. I tried to get someone to quote on converting one of my family cars and I was told that there was no-one available to quote and that 2007 was probably when the conversion could be done. So we have a long way to go and I am sure a lot of people are going to have to wait a long time to get their car converted to LPG. There are about five or six outlets in Tasmania-Launceston, Hobart and three in my electorate on the east coast. I do not know if there are any on our west coast. There are none up the middle. So there are a lot of issues that you have to plan quite thoroughly if you do intend to convert. I do not think we should hold our breath that we will get assistance and that this paper announced by the Prime Minister’s will be a great initiative. The PM has also recommended that there be capital funds to support new biofuel production capacity. I do not dispute that that will be a very good idea, but it is a bit late to be doing it. Labor has been talking about alternative fuels for many years now. It was the Keating government that introduced an 18c a litre production bounty for ethanol in the 1993-94 budget, in addition to zero excise weighting for the product. It was the Howard government that abolished that bounty scheme a year early, in the 1996-97 budget, and it has constantly undermined the industry by changing the terms of operation on a regular basis over the last 10 years, including having three different positions on excise in the last parliament alone. We are dealing with a government that really is making policy on the run. It is very important that we have research in Australia, but we should be using some of the material already available to this parliament. There is already a Gas to Liquids Taskforce report that is gathering dust somewhere. We need an industry framework in which to encourage and establish the industries in Australia to convert our coal and gas resources-which are vast-to clean diesel. We need to develop training courses to help those people who wish to enter this new industry deal with the mechanics of changing existing technology. We need more emphasis on broader research on the energy fields and on how to make Australia self-sufficient in fuel. Australia has the resources, both fossil and renewable. We have more than anyone else. We are lucky in that respect and we could be independent from and competitive with the rest of the world. However, this is a paradox when we look at the mission statement of the Biodiesel Association of Australia: We are more than 50 per cent reliant on international supply of fuel for all major industry, with a sharp decline in our self-sufficiency over the next 10 years to less than 20 per cent. We could be doing so much better. A report on Landline on the weekend said that Australia is more than ever in a position to start mainstream production of biodiesel. There is a person in my electorate who wants to talk to me about that and about using waste oils in a by-products plant that that small company uses. I remember my brother putting the oil from his takeaway shop in the garden. It certainly encouraged the worms, but it was not going to be a long-term solution. Making this stuff into biodiesel can be. We need some guidance and we need a national standard. All of the hard work still has to be done, and we really want this government to do that and we want the Prime Minister to say MAIN COMMITTEE those sorts of things. But the PM has said that we should reduce our future dependence on the Middle East. He is not really doing anything from a government perspective to encourage activity and research, and the private sector can only go so far. The government’s support is needed to expand our horizons of research and the infrastructure on which new ideas can be developed. We need to make the most of our advantages and develop leading edge technology, thus creating jobs while training our young people to be ready for the next wave of energy resources. (Time expired) portunity to speak to the ministerial statement on energy initiatives, a topic made popular by the Australian motoring public, who continue to feel their wallets being ripped out of their back pockets whenever they leave their houses, because of the increasing cost of petrol. The price of fuel, with a 40 per cent increase in the last two years, has caused a lot of grief. Private health insurance has increased 35 per cent in the last four years. Even the proportion of people’s incomes taken up servicing their mortgages has gone up 30-odd per cent in the last four years-remarkable, given the commitments by this government at the last election. Add to that petrol increases because of the energy crisis, and we see the Australian public and Australian families really hurting. And yet we still have leading members of the government stating that any financial pain the Australian public say they are feeling is either because they are whingers or because it is simply their own fault. But true to form, just like in early 2001, when the Prime Minister starts to feel some electoral heat, the government sheds a whole lot of money in an attempt to buy relief for themselves with the public’s money. If only the public could do the same. In the case of 14 August 2006, we saw the government’s grand plan for Australia’s energy needs. We have seen elements of this grand plan before: we have seen parrot power favoured over wind turbines, we have seen the government’s pro-nuclear choreography push biofuels to the wings and we have seen the heralded mandatory renewable energy target surgically neutered to cause a decrease in true conservative form-a decrease in the proportion of the nation’s energy generated by renewable means over the next decade. Only a week ago, the Vestas wind turbine nacelle manufacturing plant in Wynyard in north-west Tasmania, in the seat of Braddon, announced it was closing down at the end of the year. This means that some 65 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs, such as those at Aus-Tech Compositer in nearby Camdale, will be lost. The major reason for this is the Howard government’s anti wind energy policy that does not extend the mandatory renewable energy target scheme. Wind energy projects in Tasmania have now been stymied by this regressive anti renewable energy stance, yet there has been not a word of regret or apology from the local Liberal member for Braddon. I assume he is just another apologist for the government’s appalling record of being anti renewable and alternative energy options. The Prime Minister has said that petrol prices in Australia are low by international standards. This would be in contrast to interest rates, of course. While Australians have been feeding the highest proportion of their incomes into their mortgages for decades, we have spent the last 4½ years paying an average of 2½ per cent more than Europe, Canada and the United States. Two and a half per cent more in interest rates than comparable countries means one heck of a lot of money out of Australian household budgets. While the Prime Minister says we do not know how good we have got it, people continue to hurt. MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Ministerial Statements
229,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (4.41 Pm),"I would like to thank the House for the opIt is somewhat ironic that the government is wanting to spend money-in this case, on LPG conversions-but there are not enough skilled workers around to earn it. We all support LPG conversion. At the time the government got up and said, ‘Look, we’re doing the right thing; we’re announcing a $2,000 subsidy,’ the LPG conversion industry went into turmoil. Stock was not and still is not available; tradesmen are not available; overseas supplies are not available. The following questions have to be asked: was it planned? Was there consultation with the industry or was it another off-the-cuff attempt at the billboard policy which we are becoming increasingly used to? People will have to wait up to 12 months and longer for their conversions and the financial relief that a conversion will bring along with it. How many motorists around the country will benefit from the government’s LPG announcement? It has been estimated at three per cent. That is not what I would call a national energy plan. It is also highly disappointing that the not-for-profit organisations’ fleets are not eligible for the rebate. You would think that the thousands of people whom charities assist every day would benefit just that little bit more from the public’s donations if not-for-profit organisations could also access and use cheaper fuel. If not from LPG, perhaps not-for-profit organisations’ fleets could benefit from another government initiative or trial at some point, if the alternative fuel industry develops certain products and opportunities arise whereby the government needs a small market to trial initiatives. Perhaps those who help our community could be included and thereby helped in their work. While it is not exactly new technology-test cases exist right around the countrycompressed natural gas has been recently highlighted. Some 800 buses in total use compressed natural gas to fuel public transport in all of our state capitals, bar Hobart. Adelaide has had them since 1988 and no doubt has increasingly benefited from the 95 per cent reduction in exhausted sooty materials. Supporters of natural gas say it produces fewer greenhouse emissions than petrol. Motorists could save 50 per cent of their fuel bill and it has been technically proven that it can be used in different mixes and in all classes of vehicles with reduced engine wear, and it is available now. I look forward to seeing the alternative energy markets starting to work with each other, complementing each energy’s individual benefits and seeing just how efficient and costeffective we can become. For instance, how would a diesel bus run if it used biodiesel as its more or less traditional fuel to provide pilot ignition with natural gas used at the same time for the rest of the combustion? The ratio of the much cleaner and cheaper diesel to crystal-clear natural gas is 30-70. So the amount of dirty old diesel being used is comparatively very low. One CNG user was interviewed by the 7.30 Report, which, in a fair umpire’s fashion-as is the ABC’s way-reported that the interviewee took eight hours to fill his car’s CNG tank. He uses dual fuel: compressed natural gas until it runs out, at which time the engine reverts to petrol. He gets home in the evening, hooks the car up to the CNG unit and leaves it overnight to refuel. That is not the kind of thing we would see in grand prix motor racing, but it is something nevertheless. The process sounds pretty inconvenient, but, whatever the particulars of this interviewee’s situation, many vehicles around the nation are now using CNG, just as they are overseas. In Argentina, one-fifth of the vehicles are powered by natural gas. It is a potential way forward, either in combination with other fuels or used in isolation with any given vehicle at any MAIN COMMITTEE one time. Just as we have seen combinations of fuel tanks in and under vehicles for many years, we may increasingly see more combinations of fuels, hopefully in smaller fuel tanks, in years to come, engineering the best, cleanest, cheapest and most sustainable mix of fuels that we can use through much of the 21st century. I hope that all governments will support the energies that are driving these technologies forward for the public benefit. These issues should have been on the agenda for the government for some time. They have been in power for 10 years and we have not seen anything from them on alternative or renewable energy in that period. The writing was on the wall: more than 10 years ago, anyone could have told you that at some stage in the very near future we would have an energy crisis. The government did nothing to avoid the problem or to ease the pain now facing the Australian public due to higher petrol prices. Prime Minister on 14 August 2006 on energy initiatives, which we are debating today, is a very interesting topic. It is not just an interesting topic; it is a fundamentally important one for this nation and for the world. At the very end of the statement the Prime Minister draws us back to the white paper of just two years ago and argues that the white paper gave a fundamental framework for pushing forward to the future and that it continues ‘to provide a robust framework for meeting the nation’s energy goals of prosperity, security and sustainability’. any depth-at the white paper of two years ago and at the responses by the Prime Minister to this over time-knows that not enough is being done and in relation to what is being done there is certainly no great urgency. A good part of that, one might think, is because of the fundamental point of view that is taken by the Prime Minister about this issue and whether or not much can be done. Al Gore is in Australia today-on the fifth anniversary of the attack on the twin towers-to promote his film, An Inconvenient Truth, which, along with other members and senators, I just saw in the last sitting. It is a fantastic promotional vehicle for him in terms of another potential push for presidential nomination from the Democratic Party in the United States. But it is not, as this government’s Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said, simply or purely entertainment. That is the most dramatic misreading I think I have ever seen of anything. I just wonder whether the minister has seen this film at all. It is a compelling piece of work. One of the misconceptions that is put-misconception No. 5, as Al Gore calls it-is this: There is nothing we can do about climate change. It is already too late. He regards this as the worse misconception of all because if you deny most of it and if you look at most of the government’s responses we effectively have pure denial-not complete unadulterated denial, but as close to it as you can get. The Prime Minister in question time today told us, as is his wont, that there may be climatic change-and we may have some proof for that-but the way to fix this is not to do what everybody else in the world has done, except for the United States and Australia: that is, sign up to the Kyoto protocol because the Kyoto protocol will not do enough and because it will not do enough we will not sign up to it.

231,Mr Adams,Nonsense!,168,Ministerial Statements
232,Mr Hatton,"The member for Lyons is right. Anyone who has had a look at this area in the weight and, as the Prime Minister has done in this very paper again, say that too much of the burden would be on Australia. What is most indicative about the arguments put by Al Gore is that the kind of pillorying of him by the Republicans as a presidential candidate and, previous to that, as a vice president is mirrored here by this Prime Minister’s response to Labor and its approach to these matters and to the environment. What they did was take Gore and try and demonise him-put a stamp out to say Al Gore is so out there, a crazy leftie; he is off about all these environmental things. They said that the core business of the United States is just ensuring the other side of the coin-economic prosperity-and that they will do this by continuing to do things the way they have been done in the past. He just missed becoming President of the United States by a fraction-a very small number of votes in Florida. Since President Bush has been in office we have seen that he has not addressed the fundamental problems that Al Gore started to talk about many years ago. The film lays it out very simply: his motivation in this area and the manner in which he has approached it have largely been driven by his experience as a science student in the United States under the leading proponent of the theory of what was going to happen in the future with the exponential effect of the increase in greenhouse gases in our environment and the fact that they would be trapped by the upper layers of the atmosphere. As that quantity of greenhouse gases produced largely by our industrial activity was trapped over time, you would get a cloud effect-an increasing and denser cloud-far fewer of the sun’s rays hitting the earth would be reflected and you would get a gradual but inexorable increase in the amount of heat that is retained. Utilising some of the work that has come from the CSIRO as well as other leading groups in climatology in the past couple of years, what Gore demonstrated-and demonstrated to great effect-is that this effect is true and it is real. What he laid out when he first went into the Senate, when he first had hearings in the United States congress on these matters and their potential effect, has been demonstrated so conclusively and so compellingly that you cannot just gainsay it and say, ‘There is plenty of time to do something about this,’ which is part of the other key point. The only significant measure that we have seen in the past year is through the United States and China, India and a few other users coming together and saying: ‘Kyoto is not enough.’ Most of the people who are involved in this either did not sign up to Kyoto or, having done so, have said that more needs to be done. They identified that you need not only the Kyoto protocol but ‘Kyoto protocol plus’ to actually have a go at this fundamental problem. They found that you really need to drive at this through new technology and new approaches to fuel use in order to decrease the burden of greenhouse gases on this planet. We need to use innovative ways to get a resolution of this problem and a diminution over time compared to the current rate. In fact, if the Kyoto protocol were put into place fully and all of its measures undertaken, we know that would do part of the job of reducing greenhouse gases significantly, but it will not do the whole job of dealing with the current projection that science is telling us we need to consider. In Gore’s book, he makes it very simple: what is the fundamental target? The target is a 60 per cent reduction in our greenhouse gas production. His argument and the argument that is put forward in a leaflet that accompanied this book from the Australian Conservation MAIN COMMITTEE Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund, titled Australia’s Inconvenient Truth, is that it is actually possible to reach that by a series of measures. Gore had a pie chart at the end of his presentation which indicated that a series of measures could, in fact, achieve that by 2050 if we have the will and the determination. As a former Vice-President, Gore has argued that that will and determination have been absent in the United States, and he gave Australia a mention in passing. It is true: they have not been evident here. What is in the Prime Minister’s paper to address this? A number of relatively small changes-again, small, iterative changes-and really no fundamental desire to take this up and really run with it. There is a complete refusal to mandate a whole series of areas. I think we do need some mandatory policies in this regard. I think we need to look at the situation carefully. The problem we have got was recently dramatised by Tim Flannery in his book on this area. A comparison is that it will not be a problem for us in geological terms. In the past-100 million years ago-the earth’s climate was very different. We have had periods of intense greenhouse activity in the past and there is indeed some really good scientific work that has recently been done, demonstrated in a TV program called The Future is Wild, which looked at the world 100 million years hence. They argue that the world will suffer a massive greenhouse effect in some ways dwarfing what it is currently facing. The reason that those greenhouse conditions will be generated and that the effect they will have on the climate will be so great will be the continuing movement of the Australian continent and other continents. In 100 million years forecasters expect that the Australian continent will effectively be a high plateau that will smash into North America and help to create a whole mountain range as high as 12,000 metres. The Himalayas are about 5,000 metres high. I doubt that in 100 million years we will be around as a species. In geological time you can have a glacial approach to these matters. The earth will survive. It will renew itself. But it will be enormously different. In our time-because we do not live in geological time-we actually need a pretty good approach to this and pretty quick action. Vice-President Gore argues that we have a window of about 10 years. The Prime Minister has proposed that the government will spend some money on one of our greatest resources-liquified petroleum gas. They will give 1,000 bucks to people as an incentive to buy LPG fuelled cars-that is, if they have already come off the production line. We have a massive resource in LPG. That resource has not been properly tapped and driven. This is an area you could mandate more. You could do a great deal more with government fleets-federal and particularly state owned fleets. You could start the process by getting this thing running hard. Secondly, there is ethanol. The discussion in this paper is about the distribution of ethanol. The Prime Minister finally came back to say that 10 per cent ethanol is okay. In this paper he takes a whack at the shadow minister for primary industries, resources, forestry and tourism, Martin Ferguson-extremely ungenerously-and at a number of other people within the Labor Party. Then he says, ‘It is only the coalition that has ensured this.’ The Prime Minister only took the step of going back to the ethanol debate and getting an agreement on ethanol and its use because the shadow minister came to the government and said that it was time to fix this. MAIN COMMITTEE The original approach did a great deal of damage to a number of people in the industry. Labor’s fundamental approach was that there was one person and one company that was benefiting from those measures. A fundamental argument was being used. There was a broader debate on that. I know how deeply affected that company was by that debate. I know how deeply affected people who had petrol stations were as part of that. It happened in my electorate, which is why I was involved in the discussions. But the fundamental thing here is that you actually need an agreement on both sides. We have had that and we can push it forward. But, where the government is providing money to help with the implementation of these measures, it will not mandate 10 per cent ethanol. I see no reason whatsoever not to mandate that 10 per cent of ethanol in order to get this up and running and driven along by whoever is in government. The Prime Minister is capable of doing it and he will not do it because he believes that you should just leave this open to choice. We could do a small part of what has already been done in the United States. We could do a fraction of what has been done in Brazil. All of those members from regional areas know what the capacity is. Henry Ford worked out in 1925 that you could use just about any source of vegetable matter on this planet to produce alcohol and therefore fuel. We could do a great deal more. This energy paper just does not do enough. Further, we have the question of petroleum exploration. The Prime Minister rightly points out that, at a time of rising prices, we have a historically low level of exploration being undertaken worldwide. Australia properly needs to really get this moving very quickly. It is a correct thing to do to use Geoscience Australia’s work in order to look for a great deal more. But there is not a single sentence uttered in this paper-not even a syllable-about shale oil and what Australia has already done with that. We have massive resources in that area. It could be exploited. The government has done nothing to help that along. Gas-to-liquids and coal-toliquids are important technologies that have not yet been addressed. A great deal more needs to be done. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Debate resumed from 6 September, on motion by Mr Lloyd: That this House: (1) recognises that local government is part of the governance of Australia, serving communities through locally elected councils; (2) values the rich diversity of councils around Australia, reflecting the varied communities they serve; (3) acknowledges the role of local government in governance, advocacy, the provision of infrastructure, service delivery, planning, community development and regulation; (4) acknowledges the importance of cooperating with and consulting with local government on the priorities of their local communities; (5) acknowledges the significant Australian Government funding that is provided to local government to spend on locally determined priorities, such as roads and other local government services; and (6) commends local government elected officials who give their time to serve their communitiesupon which Mr Albanese moved by way of amendment: That paragraph (1) be omitted and the following paragraph substituted: MAIN COMMITTEE “(1) supports a referendum to extend constitutional recognition to local government in recognition of the essential role it plays in the governance of Australia.” thank the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Mr Lloyd, for introducing it in the House because I think a number of points raised in the motion do need some elaboration and, in my view, raise some concerns and some positives in the area of local government generally. There are a number of problems that I am sure most of us see in local government from time to time, but I would like to spend a few minutes particularly on the subject of the impact that the Australian Local Government Association has or could have on policy that is emanating from the federal sphere. As we all know, local government is in a sense a plaything of state governments, but the federal government does help in a number of ways through federal assistance grants and, more recently, through initiatives such as the Roads to Recovery program and a number of other programs. So the federal government does have a role. I have never been a councillor on a council. I have been in two tiers of government, but I have no desire to be in the third, even though I think the local level is probably the most important in a lot of ways to people on the ground, particularly country people, whose numbers are spread out and whose service requirements are significantly different in some ways to those of city people. However, the federal government does play a role in funding arrangements through the Commonwealth Grants Commission and other agencies. It is a pity that the referendum that was carried out some years ago did not constitutionally recognise local government. I think it is a shame. Because of the way in which that referendum was conducted, most people really did not know what was being asked. I would encourage the Australian Local Government Association and other people in the political parties in this place to revisit that issue. Perhaps in the election after next or whenever possible that issue could be revisited, because there is absolutely no doubt that the cost pressures that local government are under are, in many cases, actually eroding the localism that local government was essentially put in place to deliver. Localism is being eroded in the name of economic efficiency, cost shifting or economies of scale and under the guise of eradicating two or three general managers because you then only have to pay one general manager et cetera. We have seen all of it happening across Australia, and there are always very good reasons why it would be better to eradicate the localism from local government. However, I think the great strength of local government is that it does have the capacity to represent local people at a local level on local issues. Quite obviously, with technology et cetera now you could, theoretically at least, run the business of local government from the top of Ayers Rock. But that misses the point of some of the major things that local government provides-that is, a local voice for local people on local issues. I am very much in support of local government being maintained and that we do not just look at this business of how you can most efficiently deliver the services to people at the cheapest possible cost. I have said in this place before that, in terms of that sort of economic rationalist thinking, the most efficient way to deliver the greatest number of services to the highest number of individuals at the lowest possible unit cost is to put those people in a feedlot, and that is exactly what we have done in terms of some of our major cities. I was absolutely disgusted in recent days to see the Prime Minister in this place scoring what I considMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Ministerial Statements
233,Mr Windsor (New England) (5.05 Pm),"It is with pleasure that I speak to this motion. Iered to be fairly cheap political points against the opposition. I do not think the opposition has been right in terms of its stance on this issue either, but the Prime Minister has maintained a view that we should be opening up more and more land around our major cities and that, in some sort of convoluted fashion, that would cheapen the price of housing. That is an indication of where the government is going in terms of policy, and it is a very strong indication to regional local government that the two major parties here, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, essentially stand for a centralisation of the population-the feedlot mentality, which is the issue that I was talking about a moment ago. The most efficient way to deliver the greatest number of services at the lowest possible unit cost to the greatest number of people is to put them in a feedlot. We can look at the geography of the Sydney basin, the pollution impacts of the Sydney basin and the health impacts of the Sydney basin in the future, yet the Prime Minister stands up in this parliament day after day and says that we should release more land in our major cities and that that in some way will have an impact on the cost of housing, in a nation the size of ours. The Prime Minister quoted the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today regarding some very similar statement that she had made. So the feedlot mentality is in fact the policy of both sides of this parliament, and the cheapest way of providing services to people is to put them into major cities and ignore the regional consequences. On the other hand we have this debate about the need for greater infrastructure inland. The two issues tend to run at a tangent, in a sense, and somebody might be able to explain how you can run both those agendas when on the one hand you have the policy mix that is saying, ‘Proceed to the nearest feedlot and, if possible, use gravity to some sort of physical advantage,’ while on the other hand we have people saying that we need such things as inland rail networks and that we need to develop regional Australia. Whenever regional Australia issues are mentioned-for instance, the development of the ethanol industry-we have this argument going back the other way: ‘No, unless the market can dictate the terms, it is not possible-we can’t foster the advent of new industries; we can’t assist in any meaningful fashion to encourage the development of those industries.’ But with respect to the building industry-and I am not opposed to this, but I think the House should be aware of it, and I have raised it a few times when the drought has been raised-if you look at drought assistance, about $300 million over four years has actually been spent on business assistance to the farming community. Some would say, particularly those at a local government level, that that is not sufficient for the worse drought in 100 years. The Treasurer and others would suggest that you cannot prop up industry; that over time they have to learn to stand on their own two feet. But look at what has happened to the building industry over that period of time-or for one year longer than the worse drought we have ever had. The goods and services tax came out. The government recognised a political problem-and a real problem-in that the 10 per cent imposition of the goods and services tax would have an impact on the price of a house. The building industry cried foul and said that this would decimate this particular industry. They said, ‘You can’t do this to us. You have to help us through this particular period.’ The First Home Owners Scheme was born to assist our young people into housing. I am not suggesting that is a bad thing, but in a real sense it is a direct subsidy of the building and construction industry. I think at last count somewhere between $5.6 billion and $6 billion has been spent on that program, with the employment impacts that that obviously has for the inMAIN COMMITTEE dustry. I am not arguing the rights or wrongs of that, but I do argue that the $300 million spent on business assistance during the worse drought in living memory should not be viewed as a massive subsidy to a few peasant farmers when assistance of the order of $6 billion is offered by the same government, in the main to the western areas of our major metropolitan areas where, coincidentally, most election results are determined. I will leave that issue at that point. I have spoken about the constitutional issue of local government and the recognition of local government. The other point I would like to make is that, in my view, the Australian Local Government Association do very little to promote their cause in this place. I would suggest that, rather than come to this place with last year’s 150 motions determined at their conference, they come to the government, the opposition and the crossbenches with one, two or three major issues that they see of importance. If those major issues happen to include the constitutional recognition of local government, they could actually drive that debate. I do not see that happening in here. Maybe they do not come and talk to me; they probably talk to some of the other members. But I do not see it and I do not read about it happening. I have absolutely no doubt that local government has a problem with its income stream. That is mainly state induced; I am not blaming the federal government for all of this. If there is not enough income to deliver the services that local government is required to deliver and there is very little growth in federal assistance grants and other sources of revenue that local government is able to garner, the 450 local government bodies across the nation could weld together on two or three specific issues and demand what they want of the government and the opposition of the day, be it one per cent of income tax, so much of the goods and services tax or whatever else. It may well be a proportion of the fuel excise to reconstruct the country bridges on local roads across the nation or a variation of that theme. But I do not see the Australian Local Government Association setting the agenda in this place. I see it more as receiving the agenda of the government of the day and almost saying ‘Thank you very much’ for any little bit extra that it gets. To the credit of the federal and local governments, I have seen an initiative where, when they came together, they were able to set an agenda and have it delivered by government. That was the Roads to Recovery program-an excellent program. It actually cut the head off the state governments on the way through and delivered the funds to local government. They made the decision locally about how the money was going to be spent and the federal government was able to deliver. I think that funding comes to about 1c of the excise from each litre of fuel bought at the bowser. It has had a massive impact, but, if all the country bridges on local roads in Australia are in a dreadful state, perhaps it is time to look at a ‘bridges to recovery’ program that uses some of the fuel excise. I am against the concept of energy tax as it currently exists, but, if it is to remain, perhaps some of it should be targeted towards some of the infrastructure needs that people have. I say this to the Australian Local Government Association. Don’t come in here with an agenda that is 150 motions long. Determine what is important. Get your people behind it. Determine what you agree on, not what you argue about. And set the agenda within this place. I am sure that in terms of those major issues, if you need an income stream, constitutional recognition or having bridges fixed, then, if you come as one and are prepared to get behind those issues and not go to water when the heat comes on, you will have enormous success in MAIN COMMITTEE achieving a policy outcome not only at this level but, most importantly, at local community level. for Barker, I inform the Main Committee that we have present in the gallery the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Alan Haselhurst. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome Sir Alan. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Debate resumed. Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. This morning I had the pleasure of spending about an hour with him, talking about different matters that we have a common interest in, including the way parliament is run and this Main Committee. It is a pleasure to have someone of his stature here watching us in this Main Committee. I found it very interesting to listen to the member for New England when he referred to feedlots. I know there is a very interesting agricultural analogy with the centralising of our populations in cities around Australia. That has been going on from time immemorial: as long as this country has been a federation, the population has been going into the cities. I would agree with him in one area: I would not want to bring my children up in the city; I would rather bring them up in the country. I think we would all be better off socially if more people were brought up in rural areas-where there is more of the real world approach to life and a more honest approach to life.

Minister’s reference to interest rates and the availability of land, which is a local government matter and often a state government matter. He was not using that as a reason to centralise populations in Australia; it is more about the old supply and demand. There is demand for people to live in cities. If you do not supply enough for the demand-if you do not supply enough land-then that excess demand raises the price. I think that is very simple economics MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Local Government

241,Mr Secker,"I think it is too, but I think it was a little bit unfair to refer to the Primethat the Prime Minister is referring to. I certainly do not think it was fair to verbal him and to suggest that we raise that as ‘feedlots’, in the terminology of the member for New England. The member for New England also raised the GST issue. In 2000, local government lost a real opportunity to get a share of the GST income. We have seen the state governments go from one level of income and then go up quite a bit to another level of income, which the local governments all around Australia have not benefited from. I have always been a believer because I think local government generally is a very efficient user of government moneys. We have seen that local governments used every cent of the Roads to Recovery money that the member for New England also referred to. As a result of that, I think we have seen a great improvement in our roads. I was part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, which really came up with that idea. There was a real need for us to go directly to local government and increase the funding. The Australian Local Government Association chairman at the time showed us that we had a real problem with not only the upgrading of roads but also keeping up with the maintenance of roads under local government responsibility. The Roads to Recovery program has been a great program and we have increased it. I am not quite sure whether the member for New England was correct when he used the terminology of 1c excise. My quick calculation was that it was about 3c. Mr Windsor interjectingwas interesting. I was in local government when that idea was put to a referendum. One of the arguments was that we could not, as a federal government, deal directly with local government because it was not recognised under the Constitution, although several of the local governments were recognised under state constitutions, which were in turn recognised by the Australian Constitution. The argument was that we could not deal directly with local governments. We have proved that wrong now. Ms Hall-Did you vote against it? always believed-and we showed this with Roads to Recovery-that we are able to deal directly with local governments. There was not a constitutional bar and in fact we did not need that. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I have a question. accept a question? that constitutional recognition to deal directly with local government. We have proved with the Road to Recovery program that we do deal well with local government. Because we do not have that constitutional recognition, it does not mean that we cannot actually achieve a lot with local government. In fact, Regional Partnerships is a great example. I know that the Labor opposition opposed it and said it was a rort for rural areas. But it has actually been a great way of having partnerships between federal government, state governments, local governments and local community.

244,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Am Somlyay),Does the member for Barker wish to,176,Local Government
245,Mr Secker,"I am not answering it. In actual fact we have proved that we did not needwould know. I have received more Regional Partnerships funding in South Australia than any other area in South Australia. It is not for marginal seats. It is actually balanced all around Australia for rural areas. It came about as a result of a summit-I believe it was in 1999-at which the Deputy Prime Minister at the time brought together ideas on what local rural people wanted. That is the history. We have been able to achieve things with local government and state governments through programs such as Regional Partnerships. TodayI rose to speak on local government, which I have a reasonable knowledge of. In fact, I spent 11 years as a councillor in local government in South Australia. I was first elected at the age of 25. I think I was the second youngest councillor in South Australia at the time of my election. I am quite sure that local government is a place that quite a few members of this parliament have cut their teeth on and in which they have learned about representing their constituents, although the local government area is much smaller, with smaller constituencies. I found it interesting that, when I was first elected, we did not receive any payment at all except for expenses for travelling. I think after a few years we received the princely sum of $200 annually. When I retired-and I was deputy mayor of the Mount Barker council at the time; that is probably a good name for the council, given that I represent the federal seat of Barker-I received the princely sum of $1,500 annually. I think I worked that out to be about 7c an hour for my labours. We were not highly paid, but most people who go into local government do so to serve their community. Most of them do it to the best of their ability; it is a good training ground for politicians. To me, local government has always been that level of government that deals even more directly with its constituents because of the issues it deals with. It might be rubbish collection; it might be direct planning; it might be a whole lot of issues-food quality-that are more important on a day-to-day basis than the big picture issues we deal with. I certainly have great pleasure in working with the local government areas in my constituency, the seat of Barker. In fact, I have 16 councils in my electorate and I have regular contact with them as well as with the local government associations. I also try to get to the annual South Australian Local Government Association meeting in South Australia each year. Local governments do have a feel for the local issues, and that is another reason why they are a very important contact for any member of parliament. You can ring them up very quickly and they can say, ‘This is what’s happening with this issue; this is our feeling; we talk to a lot of people.’ They are certainly a great resource for any politician if they wish to use them. So it gives me great pleasure to speak on this resolution before us. As I have said a number of times, including in my maiden speech, I believe that where possible-and I echo the comments of the member for New England-local people should decide their own fates as best they can for their own areas. I am very much decentralist when it comes to government: if local areas can make decisions for themselves, that devolution of power back to local regimes works well for democracy. They play a very important part in democracy in this country. They provide us with the basic services that allow us to work and do business, to socialise with friends, to gain an education and to ensure that we have a clean and safe environment. The role and functions of a council, as set out in section 6 of the South Australian Local Government Act 1999, are: MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Local Government
246,Mr Secker,"In actual fact, I do not have a marginal seat, as Deputy Speaker Somlyay(a) to act as a representative, informed and responsible decision-maker in the interests of its community … (b) to provide and co-ordinate various public services and facilities and to develop its community and resources in a socially just and ecologically sustainable manner … (c) to encourage and develop initiatives within its community for improving the quality of life of the community … (d) to represent the interests of its community to the wider community … (e) to exercise, perform and discharge the powers, functions and duties of local government under this and other Acts ... The range of regulatory services provided by all councils include land use planning, development, building control, fire prevention, dog and cat management and control, parking control and food and public health inspection. Further to these services, councils oversee local road construction and maintenance; footpath construction and maintenance; street lighting; waste management; recycling; stormwater and drainage; library and information services; maintenance of parks, ovals and sporting facilities; coastal care; home and community care services for elderly people and for those with a disability; tourism initiatives; and crime prevention programs. So there is a very wide, very direct relationship between local councils and the people they represent. Coming back to the Roads to Recovery program, I recall that the Leader of the Opposition called the Roads to Recovery program a boondoggle. How out of touch is he with what local councils think about the Roads to Recovery program? I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every local council area in my electorate, and I would suggest all around Australia, thinks the Roads to Recovery program is fantastic. Councils contribute to many issues that are important to everyday living. Without these services being attended to, we would be in quite a state. Our local roads would be poor, footpaths would be dangerous, rubbish would be strewn in the streets, and other hazards and issues would be poorly managed. Our government has increased the total amount allocated by way of financial assistance grants to local government for 2006-07 by $67.4 million, so we do continue to increase funding in this area. But I come back to my earlier point: I firmly believe that a share of GST should be going to local government. I think that is an issue that they really need to put some work into, and I would support them wholeheartedly. motion moved by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. Of course, local government is very important to people’s lives. Other honourable members have referred to this. Any honourable member who goes doorknocking, holds a mobile office or has any other form of community interaction would say that many of the issues that are raised with them are local government issues-less so than perhaps federal or state issues. Of course, local government affects people’s lives very directly. In my case, I served for nine years in local government, including as a mayor, and as the President of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, WESROC, in the fourth largest city in terms of population in New South Wales and the fifth largest city in AustraliaFairfield, which has 200,000 residents and a budget of $100 million. I have seen first-hand MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Local Government
247,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (5.36 Pm),"I am pleased to make some brief comments on thisover those nine years in local government the stretch on resources faced by a council that is trying to do good work, that is trying to improve its community, but that is dealing with constant cost shifting from both federal and state governments, which come in and perhaps start programs and then abolish them. At this stage the community has come to expect them and has a real need for them and it is then incumbent on local government to continue them from a very limited funding base. I think there is much more scope for local government to be much more effective across the country with more support from both federal and state governments. It is hard to disagree with the sentiments expressed in the motion moved by the minister, but I would like to deal with some of the matters of substance. The first matter I would like to deal with is funding. In 1996, the figure for financial assistance grants to local government as a percentage of Commonwealth tax revenue was 0.97 per cent. In 2006-07, it has fallen to 0.77 per cent and by 2009-10 the figure is estimated to fall to 0.75 per cent. I think that is a retrograde step and I would support the calls from the Australian Local Government Association to restore financial assistance grants to one per cent of Commonwealth tax revenue. In fairness, I do know that there are other forms of grants for local councils, including Roads to Recovery, but financial assistance grants are grants which the council is allowed to spend on their priorities as they see fit. They are a level of government that is very close to the people and they know what priorities are important in their own area. I think the financial assistance grants are underdone and I think it would be a good thing if they returned to one per cent of Commonwealth taxation revenue, as they were under the previous government. Perhaps even more importantly, I think one of this government’s most retrograde steps was the abolition of the Better Cities Program, the abolition of the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs and of the office of the Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs. Not only would I like to see the Better Cities Program reinstituted; I would like to see it reinstituted on an expanded scale. Local councils could do much for their local environment with more support from the federal government. I have seen local councils come up with great ideas and plans to improve their local environment, but they have very limited resources to do so. The Better Cities Program would be one where federal and local councils could work together, with assistance from state governments, to improve local environments and to do some really good things. The honourable member for Shortland particularly would know the benefits of the Better Cities Program through the Honeysuckle Development, which I know is not in her electorate but is in the general region. Ms Hall-And benefits everyone in the region. ies Program was abolished and we have seen 10 years of lost opportunities when it comes to the sorts of programs that could have been funded under Better Cities. I would also like to make mention of the issue of flood mitigation, which is a particularly important issue in my electorate. Under the previous government’s Urban Flood Mitigation Program, funding was provided to local councils on a 2:2:1 basis-that is, two from the federal government, two from the state government and one for local councils. A lot of work was done under that program, particularly in Fairfield city. Many of us in Fairfield, including me, remember the impact of the 1988 floods, which left a damage bill in our city alone of $15 million and at least 700 dwellings and more than 30 factories flooded above floor level. EmerMAIN COMMITTEE",178,Local Government
248,Mr Bowen,"And benefits everyone in the region. It is now 10 years since the Better Citgency services rescued 550 people. I remember trying to get home in the 1988 flood. I had to jump fences and swim across my neighbour’s backyard just to get home. It was a particularly devastating thing for Fairfield, and over the last 20 years Fairfield City Council has made a really strong effort to conduct flood mitigation works to reduce the impact of future floods. The 1988 flood was what we call a ‘one-in-a-hundred-years flood’, but it is likely to come again and Fairfield City Council has identified $23 million worth of outstanding flood mitigation works. The Urban Flood Mitigation Program was effectively emasculated by the incoming Howard government in 1996 and there has been very little federal government support for flood mitigation since that time. I think Fairfield City Council has written to every successive minister for local government and to the Prime Minister, and the issue has been raised at local government conferences; yet we have seen no action and no progress. I want to refer briefly to the matter of child care, which is of course an important matter in the community. I was concerned that the federal government recently changed the way in which the child care supplementary worker program was implemented. Fairfield City Council, amongst others, has for 20 years provided the supplementary worker program, which is a program whereby child-care centres are given support and assistance in dealing with children with special needs, who have a greater call on resources and have special educational needs in the early years of their life. That program was put out to tender and Fairfield City Council bid, with other south-western Sydney councils, to continue the work that they have done over the last 20 years. They lost that tender and the work has now gone to another organisation. I have nothing against that other organisation and, in principle, putting government services out to tender is nothing that I would object to, but where you have a council that has done good work-nobody has complained about the work; it has been done efficiently for 20 years-I really would question whether the move to put that work out to tender has been driven by a case-by-case analysis or by an ideological approach. I do want to say something about local government itself. I think local government could do more to help itself. The honourable member for New England referred to this. I feel there is more scope for amalgamation in local government. I cannot claim to speak for other states. Sydney is the only city that I know well in terms of the local government boundaries. But I think that, for efficiencies, larger councils are better. I served for nine years on a council of 200,000 people, which makes it the fourth biggest city in New South Wales. I think that councils with very much smaller populations than that could do well to examine the prospects of amalgamation. I do not refer particularly to rural areas, because they obviously have big areas to cover, but to metropolitan areas where you have very small councils. Fairfield City Council, I once said when I was mayor, mowed the same area that some of the smaller councils were in total. Fairfield City Council’s parklands were equivalent in area to Hunters Hill Council, which is one of those councils that should be looking seriously at amalgamation to improve the services it has available to its residents. I think amalgamation should as a general rule be voluntary but that local government should be taking it very seriously. The other initiative that I think councils should be embracing is the Independent Hearing and Assessment Panel, which again we introduced in Fairfield council. We were, I think, the second council in Australia to introduce one after Liverpool. It is a process with a much less confrontational approach to development approvalsMs Hall-It operates like precinct committees. MAIN COMMITTEE somebody has a development application before the council, the council delegates the consideration of that to a panel that consists of a community planner, a lawyer, an architect and a community representative. They sit around the table and work out if there is a way that objections to a development can be overcome and then make a recommendation to the full council. We found in Fairfield council that our legal bills in the Land and Environment Court fell very dramatically. People were much more satisfied. Not only were objectors much more satisfied that they had their case heard but also developers were much more satisfied, because they got a quicker result and they were able to overcome issues without taking them to the Land and Environment Court. It has been some years since I put my mind to local government, having retired at the last election and not having to think or talk about local government since then, but I did want to take the opportunity to make this brief contribution. I think local government does deserve our support. I support constitutional recognition and a referendum to achieve as much, but I think that it is more important to give resources to local government and provide them with more funds to do the job they do best. on this historic parliamentary motion on local government, which was introduced into the House of Representatives last week by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, the Hon. Jim Lloyd MP. I take this opportunity to congratulate Speaker Hawker, who at that time was the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, whose inquiry produced this report. I also congratulate the other members of that committee, because I understand it was a unanimous bipartisan report. The objective of the motion before the House, which came out of the report, is to recognise the contribution that local government makes to democracy. Through this motion, the Australian government acknowledges the role and importance of local government and the role they play at the local community level. The Australian Local Government Association, represented by the president, Councillor Paul Bell, was instrumental in bringing this motion forward in consultation with Minister Lloyd, and I have written in support of it. I am pleased to place on the record my support for the 19 local government areas that are responsible for local communities spread over the 26,000-odd square kilometres of the Pearce electorate. Both the electorate representatives and the full-time officers in local government deserve recognition for the tremendous work they do. Most local government elected representatives, at least in Western Australia, receive no remuneration for the work they do. It has become obvious to me over the years that more and more responsibilities are placed on local government councillors, and some of the issues are exceedingly difficult to manage. Issues in growing communities of town planning matters and approval of new developments are very difficult matters indeed and often cause great consternation in the community-and I notice that our councillors come in for a fair amount of criticism. Personally, I find that staying in touch and consulting with local government on a range of issues in the Pearce electorate-issues that affect the communities for which we have a shared responsibility-is a very worthwhile activity and a great opportunity to find out about the aspirations of local communities. This regular contact with the 19 councillors and shires keeps me abreast of the local issues and matters of concern. Having had discussions with local govMAIN COMMITTEE",179,Local Government

250,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (5.46 Pm),"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speakernment, I am then able to come back to this place and convey their concerns on various issues to relevant ministers, and on many occasions we have arranged meetings. I note that the member for New England talked about greater interaction by local government with members and senators. On many occasions when there have been specific issues to be addressed, we have arranged for people to come over here and talk directly with the relevant minister. There have been many occasions when we have had great success. Probably two of the biggest issues for my electorate are the crossroads between the eastern seaboard and the road that takes all the traffic to the northern mining and pastoral areas. Those two roads have been under greater and greater pressure from large trucks carrying double and treble loads, and the roads simply were not designed for that kind of traffic. So these have been two ongoing issues, both of which have been resolved substantially by local government representatives coming here to Canberra, all the way from Perth in Western Australia, and talking through those issues with our ministers. In the case of Northam, I have had the greatest support and activity from both the council and the shire. There are two local government representatives there, and both the former and current incumbents have been tireless in meeting with ministers and putting their case. The result a few years ago was a $55 million bypass road for the town of Northam, which had been something they had wanted for two or three decades. In relation to the Great Northern Highway, nobody could have worked harder than the shire president, Jan Stagbouer, and both her previous chief executive officer and the current incumbent, to get money to fund improvements to the Great Northern Highway, which carries all of the traffic up to the northern pastoral and mining centres of Western Australia. With the boom in mining, this was very urgent roadwork. Once again, they have been tireless in coming to this place or, when our ministers have been visiting Western Australia, making sure that they were in touch, putting their case and very often having to straddle both federal and state governments to ensure that these works were put on the urgent list. I cannot speak highly enough of the work of local government in the Pearce electorate and about the way in which our local government representatives conduct themselves. In most cases, it has just been exemplary. Many projects apart from roads have been undertaken in the electorate of Pearce. I cannot name all of them; they have just been too numerous. I think we all recognise the importance today of the need to reduce greenhouse gases and the need to conserve water. There have been some wonderful projects supported by local government and funded by the federal government in energy efficiency. The energy efficiency house at Northam won a number of awards and it is a great demonstration project about how the average citizen can actually save energy and conserve water. It was a fantastic project and it continues to be a very popular one. Community water grants have been available for several Pearce councils for important water conservation projects. For those who do not know the electorate of Pearce, it is an electorate that grows a large quantity of grain and sheep, with both wool and meat being major exports. In addition, we have a lot of intensive agriculture, such as olive growing, the Swan Valley wineries and table grape production in the Swan Valley. In fact, it is the oldest wine-growing region in Western Australia. Many new industries have been set up. So water conservation has become a very significant issue in the electorate of Pearce. MAIN COMMITTEE I spoke after the 2004 election in a grievance debate about housing affordability, which I think is a very significant issue, particularly in trying to make sure that young couples can afford to get into new housing. As I said at that time, that could have been achieved by opening up more land. Certainly in Western Australia and in the Pearce electorate that is achievable, if only the state government would commit to spending some money on infrastructure. The Chittering shire president, Jan Stagbouer, met with Malcolm Turnbull, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, on water, who then made representations to the Western Australian government to try and transport water 30 kilometres from Bullsbrook to Chittering. With that extended pipeline, there would be plenty of land available for development. They are trying to build an aged-care facility, but they are constantly stymied by a lack of water and a lack of commitment by the state government to fund the extension of the pipeline. As I said, it is only a matter of about 30 kilometres, so it is a great tragedy that these projects could be up and running very quickly if only we had that commitment by the state government to infrastructure. The member for New England talked about bridges as well. The government did have a program. It was funded to improve and repair bridges that were in disrepair. I recently opened the Glebe bridge in York. This money came out of the original Roads to Recovery funding allocation. Another thing an electorate like Pearce needs to consider, because we have got a lot of national parks and large tracts of heavily wooded areas, is bushfire and natural disaster mitigation funding. Our electorate has been the beneficiary of the federal government’s funding for natural disaster mitigation. We have seen local government become more and more involved in providing social services including medical services, childcare facilities and support for people with a disability in their communities along with other programs. One of the programs very strongly supported and funded by the federal government has been the rural medical infrastructure fund. It has been well received by local governments in the electorate of Pearce. I could go on. There are so many programs that the federal government has funded, but one of the most popular, and one that I have been asked continually to write to our ministers about and raise in the party room, is the Roads to Recovery program. It has been so successful that every year before the budget I get a flurry of activity from local government representatives asking me to make sure the government keeps funding this program. It has been an enormous help. Again, representing an electorate with many rural towns and small rural communities, the road conditions are so important not only in fuel conservation in these days of high fuel costs but also to get people to medical treatment and to transport farm produce to the wharves and to the airports and by rail. This has been very welcome in the electorate of Pearce and we hope the federal government will continue to fund the Roads to Recovery program for some time to come. It has been an important catch-up program. Sometimes we do not talk about the Green Corp project, but local government has been the beneficiary of both Green Corp money and Work for the Dole funding. This not only has helped young people to get a better understanding of the importance of conserving our natural environment but also has done very practical work to help communities in local government areas. Local governments have been very supportive of the federal government’s Green Corp and Work for the Dole projects. Work for the Dole has offered employment opportunities to people in the community who might otherwise remain on the dole for a very long period of MAIN COMMITTEE time. I welcome the interest that the shires have shown and the practical attempts they have made to take advantage of these two fantastic programs-Work for the Dole and Green Corp-and we see the benefit of those programs every day. I want to finish by saying that I look forward personally to continuing to work closely with the 19 local government area representatives in the Pearce electorate. I hope to build on the productive working relationship I have with them so that by working together we can endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people that we represent and continue to provide the infrastructure and the support services that are so important in an outer metropolitan, regional and rural seat such as Pearce. This motion has my complete support. Debate (on motion by Ms Hall) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 6.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Visas (Question No. 3476) Ms Burke asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) For the period since 1996, will the Minister provide a list of each type of temporary entrant visa (a) currently issued and (b) no longer issued including a description of the visa’s conditions and purpose together with the number issued. (2) Are there records of the names of all individuals issued a temporary entrant visa; if so, (a) what year do the records commence, (b) for how many years are the records retained, and (c) what other details of the visa holders are recorded and for how long is this information retained. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) For the period since 1996, the table at Attachment A lists each type of temporary entrant visa currently issued by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), including a description of each visa’s conditions and purpose, together with the number issued. (b) For the period since 1996, the table at Attachment B lists each type of temporary entrant visa no longer issued by DIMA, including a description of each visa’s conditions and purpose, together with the number issued. Note: Visa conditions are listed by number. Attachment C provides a list of all visa conditions by number. (2) Yes. DIMA records the names of individuals issued temporary entrant visas on a number of computer systems. Currently, the names of temporary visa applicants and the details of their visas are found on the Department’s Integrated Client Services Environment (ICSE), Immigration Records Information System (IRIS) and Electronic Travel Authority System (ETAS) – depending on the applicant’s circumstances. The names of all individuals granted visas are also loaded onto the Department’s Travel& Immigration Processing System (TRIPS) which includes the Movements database. Data from TRIPS is also uploaded into other systems such as Advanced Passenger Processing System (APPS) and ETAS. The Department also keeps paper file records on some temporary visa holders. Some records of visas issued before 1990 are also available on microfiche and some related electronic documents are stored on the Department’s Total Records Information Management (TRIM) system. (a) The records available on different departmental systems commence at different times. ICSE records date back to 1998 and IRIS records date back to late 1981. Automated data on temporary visa holders is available on TRIPS from 1990 onwards. Earlier data is available, however, drawing on data entered manually from passenger cards. Paper records on temporary visa holders have been created by the Department since its inception. Since 1999, these records have been registered on the Department’s TRIM system. (b) All records held by the Department on temporary visa holders, whether paper or electronic, are managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983 and are subject to related legislation such as the Privacy Act 1988, the Evidence Act 1995 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982.",181,Local Government
251,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided theOnshore applications for temporary visas are destroyed two years after departure of the visa holder is confirmed. The majority of offshore applications for temporary visas are destroyed two years after the relevant period of temporary entrance has ended or a decision has been made to refuse the application. Some tourist visa applications are, however, destroyed immediately after approval or within six months of the decision to refuse the application. Electronic departmental records on temporary visa holders are retained indefinitely. (c) Other details of visa holders recorded by the Department vary. At a minimum, departmental computer systems record basic biographical data, including a visa holder’s date of birth, country of birth, sex, marital status, passport number, country of passport and date of passport grant. More detailed information about visa holders is, however, often available, particularly on ICSE and IRIS, depending on the nature of the case and the information provided to the Department during the visa application process. For example, IRIS case notes could contain details about the visa holder’s family composition, financial status, study commitments and employment status. Departmental paper records similarly contain any details of the visa holder included in the relevant visa application, any supporting documentation provided and any written correspondence between the visa holder and the relevant departmental officer.
