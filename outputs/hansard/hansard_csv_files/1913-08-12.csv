Prime Minister) [3.1]","I ask the House, before it enters upon business, to agree to a motion having reference to the life and work of the late Sir William Lyne. We may well pause in our contentions to pay this last tribute to one who has passed beyond the veil, and who for so long took so prominent a part in the public affairs of the community. Sir William Lyne devoted practically the whole of his life to the service of his country. However much some of us may have differed from him on political questions, we all, I am sure, recognise the great value of his life's work to the people. ' His was a strenuous caresr from its beginning to its close. The deceased gentleman was associated with many of the public movements of Australia, and with many interests affecting the welfare of the people. Few have lived a life so strenuously devoted to the good of the public, whose cause Sir William Lyne had always ' at heart. for many years, and although we were usually on opposite sides in Parliament, I at all times recognised the patriotism of his labours, and the kindly feeling and good fellowship which influenced all his public actions. I never remember a wrong word passing between us in our private relations. For thirty-three years Sir William Lyne served the people in Parliament, and during the whole of that I knew him",12,Setup

2,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta,"time he represented the one* constituency. Among the offices he held were these: In the Government of New South Wales he was Secretary for Public Works, and afterwards'Premier. He was a member of the Federal Convention, and in the first Federal Ministry held the portfolio of Minister of Home Affairs. Under the Commonwealth he was also Acting Minister of Defence, Minister of Trade and Customs, and Treasurer, and he was a Commonwealth delegate to the Imperial and Navigation Conferences of 1907. This list of offices suggests but an outline of his many distinguished services to the people, and it is well that we should mention them now that he has passed to where ""beyond these voices there is peace."" I move That this House places upon record its high appreciation of the great public services rendered by the late Sir William Lyne, and tenders its sincere sympathy to the bereaved widow and fnmily of one who devoted so many years of his life to the promotion of the welfare of the people of Australia. Speaking for all the members of the Opmanent character. position, I concur in the action taken by the Prime Minister. The late Sir William J. Lyne was a man big of heart, and I take this to be a fitting occasion on generous to a fault. His public serwhicli to implant in the records of the vices were rendered with the one aim and House a little of what was done by the object of securing the welfare of the great man who has just fallen by the people of his native country. He has way. While Premier of New South fallen by the way, and, because of illness, Wales, the late Sir William Lyne was his membership of this Chamber ceased instrumental in the passing of over 160 prior to his demise. He was a man who Acts of Parliament within a period of never deserted a friend. During a pereighteen months, and I say unhesitatingly, sonal acquaintance with him extending after a study of the work of the Premiers oyer about fourteen years, I never heard of the several States, that I know of no him reflect on an opponent. He was a leader of a. Government who, within so brave fighter, hitting hard when his opshort a space of time, was able to bring ponent was in front of him, but generous forward, and to carry, so many Acts beneto his foes behind their backs. Australia ficial to human beings, as he did. The cari i ll afford to lose such men. He has record which I propose to make of the gone, and I agree with the Prime Minisdeceased gentleman's work is one that I ter that it is right to convey our sympathy trust young Australians will turn to if, . to those who were nearest and dearest to in the future, they should hy chance him, who, no doubt, have in large meastudy the pages ot Hansard. sure the sympathy of the people of Aus32 of 1899 provided for the abolition of tralia. If it be not trespassing beyond the Marine Board of New South Wales, the motion, I ask members and the counand for the establishment of a Departtry whether the time has not come when ment of Navigation and Courts of Marine Australia should give more thought to the Inquiry.

This question may or may not be a popular one to raise, but it is the duty Of this young nation, which, J. hope, will one day become a great nation, to see that the dependents of those who render good service to the country shall not in the end be in a worse position than they would have been in had the efforts of their breadwinners been devoted to private instead of to public affairs. Some may consider this suggestion unnecessary, but in making it I am voicing the sentiments of my heart as well as obeying the dictates of my mind. I believe that the time will come when Parliament will say that no man shall suffer because of services rendered by him to his country. The widow and dependents of the late Sir William Lyne will be able to say that they were associated with a citizen of Australia whose name will live long in (he memory of the people, and whose services in helptralia have been, and will be, of a perAct No.",12,Death Of Sir William Lyne

An y miner will tell honourable members of the benefits that have accrued to the worker from that legislation. Again, in 1900, he introduced and carried a B ill providing for the resumption and purchase of public wharfs in Sydney Harbor. Any citizen of Sydney will speak of the good that has resulted from that law. Then, again, the deceased gentleman amended the Sydney Corporation Act in such a way as to make Sydney the most democratically governed city, not only in any country under the British flag, but in any European country. No. 55 the deceased gentleman provided that all wages payable in New South Wales should be paid in cash, thereby removing an abuse of which every honourable member knows. of humane legislation was Act No. 56, by which he determined the size and weight of baskets used in discharging coal ships. know how many brave hearts failed because of the overloading to which they were previously subjected. ByA c t No. 72 the deceased, as Premier of New South Wales, provided for an easier method of appeal on the part of railway employees. That also was an act of justice to a large body of workmen. Then, again, he passed Act No. 74, which provided for the payment of old age pensions in New South Wales. No better piece of legislation was ever in troduced in any State. gentleman was also responsible for Act No. 81, providing for early closing. These are but a few of the 160 Billsi n tion Court. In explanation of my questroduced and carried by the deceased gentleman, from 14th September, 1899, to 27th March, 1901a record that should stimulate every politician when he takes high office, and satisfy him that the more the legislation introduced by him pertains to the benefit of the human race the more is he likely to be remembered by the people. vious Parliament I gave the deceased gentleman my seat in the Ministerial corner, our friendship was cemented, and I always looked up to him as a son should look towards a father. A truer friend never took part in politics, nor, as my leader has said, has there ever been a braver fighter. He was a hard hitter when facing an opponent, but, as soon as the political war was over, his kindly and courteous nature again prevailed. One of the greatest of the English-speaking race, he was with us but a few weeks ago, and I could have wished that he had died with his harness upon his back. That, however, was not to be. I think it was only because of the ill-health that came upon him that he was not in harness when the end came. There was one incident in connection with this Parliament of which he spoke to me with some bitterness. I refer to the occasion when one of your predecessors, Mr Speaker, suddenly collapsed, and one of the scribes, who writes under an alias, was cruel enough to attack UnderA ct him, as well as others in this House, in connection with it . He resented most strongly that attack, more particularly when he learned the identity of the man a man who would not dare to say to Another piece his face that which he wrote under cover of anonymity. I wish to add my word of praise at a time when we are lamenting the passing of this great spirit, and when Honourable members well the time comes for us to pass through the shadows, may he, and all men like him, whose hearts when on earth were pulsing for humanity, be there to welcome us.

That the following Address-in-Reply to His they were not in sympathy with their Excellency's Speech to both Houses of Parliapolicy. In support of this statement, let ment be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parposed amendments of the Constitution on liament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in which the electors were consulted by reParliament loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to against thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. A t the beginning, I wish to acknowledge my appreciation of the privilege afforded to me by this opportunity to address this Chamber for the first time.

It abolished a system of voting seat in this HouseI shall endeavour to which was of distinct advantage to a great maintain the best traditions of parliamany of the most deserving of the elecmentary government, and the honour and tors. privileges of this the first Legislative Chamber of the Commonwealth. gard my selection by the Government to said that the absentee voting system was move the Address as a compliment to the rural constituencies of Australia, which gave the Government party such splendid support at the last election.

The results of postal vote was, I understand, that, folthe general election can hardly be relowing upon the election before last, there garded as satisfactory by either of the were ten or twelve successful prosegreat parties which have striven for the cutions for breaches of the confidence of the people. The position of the present Administration is almost without parallel, in the history of constitutional government, and certainly in the government of the Commonwealth. The composition of the two Chambers is such possible electoral abuses, and therefore that the Government does not occupy the gives but little indication of the extent position which its Ministers would like it of these abuses, shows that at the last to occupy in proposing legislation for the good .of the country. Three years ago, the party which is now in Opposition was returned with solid majorities in both Chambers, and the last Government was therefore in a position of legislative and administrative capacity such as no previous Government of the Commonwealth had occupied. W it h this advantage, Ministers proceeded to put the party platform into effect by legislative enactments, and their method of administration of the great Departments of State.

186,Mr Ahern,"Had I more exelection there were 3,000 or 4,000 instances of duplicate voting, and I believe that a large number of these duplications were due to the absentee voting system which was substituted for the postal voting system. I look forward, therefore, with a good deal of interest to the attitude of the present Opposition in regard to the amendments or modifications of the absentee voting system which may be proposed by the Government. The party opposite, which, I understand, claims for itself exclusively the virtue of consistency, will, no doubt, assist the Government in bringing into operation these necessary and desirable changes in our electoral law. I congratulate the Government on putting before the House, as their first business, this question of the amendment of the electoral law, for, in view of the possibility of an early appeal to the constituencies, it is desirable that every preparation should be made, and that we should have a thoroughly satisfactory system of electoral registration and properly-prepared rolls. In addition to these requirements, I would also impress upon the Government the desirability of bringing before the House, when submitting these proposals, some scheme to insure that no candidate will be returned to Parliament unless he represents the views of the majority of the electors recording their votes in the constituency for which he stands. It is true that there is at present a clear line of demarcation between the two parties, and the result at the last election shows that the so-called independent candidate is not wanted. quite possible, by the entry into the field of campaign of two or more candidates holding similar views, to have a split vote on the one side, and to have an electorate represented by a member whose views are not in accord with those of a majority of the electors. I would urge that the Government, in submitting these proposals, should also put before Parliament some system of preferential voting, so that whoever is returned as the representative of a constituency shall represent the views of the majority of the electors recording their votes. In the course of my appeal to the electors, as well as on other occasions, I strongly advocated the adoption of a system of preferential voting, and I intend to do so in this House when the question of electoral reform comes up for consideration. In this connection, there is another matter to which I should like to refer. I trust that the Ministry will see their way to remove the unwarranted restrictions that were placed upon the freedom of the press by a recent amendment of the electoral law. I think we shall all agree that a strong, virile press makes for the welfare of the people. strong! times that the press should be strong; but I think that we in Australia can feel proud of our press, on the whole, and that we should not submit it to such undesirable restrictions as were imposed by the recent amendment of the electoral law. I would now invite for a few moments the attention of the House to the attitude of the Government towards employment in the Public Service. In their statement of policy, the Government have intimated that competency and merit shall be the sole basis of employment and preferment in connection with the public works of the Commonwealth. I am glad that they have already intimated that they do not propose to give to any section of the community preference at the expense of another section. This is an exceedingly important matter, for it is highly desirable that every member of the communityevery elector-shoul d have the same riglit to enter the Public Service, or to an engagement under the Commonwealth, without being compelled for that purpose to ally himself with the views of any party. I observe that it is also proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbiB u t it is tration. My experience during the last campaign was that there was m this connection the grossest misrepresentation on the part of those in opposition to our party. A large body of members of the late Cabinet were campaigning in my constituency, and it was put to the electors in the first instance that the Liberal party was responsible for the arbitration laws in their present form. An attempt was made to make the rural producers, more particularly, believe that the demands of the Rural Workers Union were being made through the Arbitration Court in consequence of the legislation of the Liberal party. When that misrepresentation was exposed, another position was taken up. It was then said, in connection with those demands, "" Oh, well, they will not come into operation.""

188,Mr Ahern,"It may be desirable attliey were frequently informed that the demands made by the Rural Workers Union would not come into operation. When, however, 'those demands assumed definite shape, by means of the log that was subsequently circulated, the electors in my constituency were informed that they were really in the nature of claims, and . would not come into operation through the Courti n any way. that statement having beeu explained away, it was said, "" Well, even if the demands do come into operation, the rural producers, in being called upon to meet them, will be no worse off than they were before."" I see that the Government have declared their intention of exempting the rural workers from the operation of the Act, believing that the conditions of their employment ought to be left to the States. Electors in my constituency have been told during the last few weeks that they would see how far the Liberal party were sincere during the recent campaign in their opposition to the demands being made through the Arbitration Courtthat they would find that there would be uo amendment of the law at the instance of the Liberal party. not the courage to place in their policy such an amendment of the law. the Government have given this question a prominent place in the statement of policy now submitted to the House. I venture to say that if , for reasons beyond their control, they should not be able to carry an amendment of the law in the direction indicated, and it should be necessary to appeal to the country on the question, they will have behind them the solid support of every rural constituency in Australia. I observe a declaration of the intention of the Government to maintain the accepted protective policy of the country. That, of itself, might almost be regarded as the reiteration of a truism. The real question is what is necessary to make Protection efficient in Australia. We are committed definitely to the policy of Protection, and the question that remains is what is necessary to make it efficient. In this connection, I might refer to the appointment of the In ter-State Commission, and take the opportunity to congratulate the Government on having made the appointments so early. I feel sure the House will be quite in accord with the action of the Government in appointing this very necessary Commission. The -personnel of the Commission has given satisfaction to me, in view of the feeling that has been growing u p I do not say whether rightly or wrongly-amongs t the members of the community, that appointments and preferment to the high offices of the ComThen, monwealth could only be obtained by those associated with the public life of the Commonwealth, or with political parties. In these appointments, however, the Government have shown their determination to go outside political life altogether, and to select those whom it considers most suitable and competent to fill high offices in the Commonwealth service. This, of itself, must give satisfaction. W it h in the last few days I noticed a statement in the press, attributed to the Prime Minister, to the effect that the first business of the Inter-State Commission would be the revision of the Tariff. I observe, also, in the statement circulated to-day, an intimation to the effect that, in the meantime, any existing anomalies will be dealt with. The question of the Tariff is an exceedingly important one to the people of Australia ; and it must be admitted that there are glaring anomalies which seriously affect employment, and which mean, as a result, huge importations of foreign goods made by cheap labour, to the detriment of our own people, and a corresponding necessity to remit abroad large sums in gold that are required for our own purposes, especially in view of the stringency of the money market. This being so, I impress on the Government, pending inquiry by the In ter-State Commission, the necessity to take in hand at an early date the consideration of this important question. During my election campaign I strongly advocated efficient Protection; and,' as I come into this House a strong adherent of that policy, I hope that, pending action by the Inter-State Commission, the Government will take the necessary steps to deal with the more urgent and pressing defects. From what I understand is the constitution of this House, there is, I think, a majority on both sides committed to the policy of Protection; and if those members of the Opposition who, during the last part of the election campaign, announced themselves as professed Protectionists are",26,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

190,Mr Ahern,"I am glad to see thatsincere in their desire for that policy, they will give every assistance in removing the existing anomalies. I find, also, a reference to the intention of the Government to control trusts and combines which operate to the detriment of the public. This was a very prominent question during the election campaign; and I am glad to see the Government expressing their determination to control combines ( that are injurious to trade. sary we shall, no doubt, see the antitrust law, which the late Government permitted to remain a dead letter, put into operation in order to give effect to this determination of the Government. The proposals in regard to reciprocal trade, referred to in the statement, will certainly be welcomed by the rural producers. markets as an outlet for our products must be in the interests of our primary producers. Our wool, wheat, butter, and other primary products are of enormous value to the people of Australia. wealth; and any steps that can be taken for, or any encouragement that can be given to, the extension of trade, with a view to the opening up of over-sea markets, will certainly be welcomed, not only by the trading community, but by the primary producers of Australia. The farmers of the northern part of Victoria and the Riverina will welcome the early settlement of the important question of the waters of the Murray River and its tributaries. On this side, the interests of the Murray valley are well represented, under the new constitution of the House, and I feel sure that the Government w ill get every support and assistance from honourable members in the settlement of this very vexed question. It is most desirable that the extensive areas which are suitable for closer settlement, and which only await the supply of water, shall be made available to the people who are ready to use them. Therefore, water conservation works and the construction of locks and weirs will be welcomed, at any rate, by honourable members who are interested in those parts of the continent. of the development of Australia, I should like to refer to the Northern Territory. That part of Australia sadly needs developing, and I see amongst the Government proposals one which indicates that a LandB ill will be shortly prepared and submitted dealing with this important Territory. In that B ill , provision is to be made that settlers in that portion of Australia shall receive their freehold. This proposal should certainly be welcomed by all the people who are interested iu the development of the country; and, in addition to the opening up of the Territory by the construction of railway lines and other public works, I hope that the Government will see their way, in this B ill , to make If necesproper provision for that development, in the first instance, by pastoral enterprise. Our general experience in Australia has been that wliere the pastoralist first goes and opens up the country, the agriculturist soon follows, if the conditions of climate and soil are suitable. If , in the first instance, people are sent to the Northern Territory for the purpose of An y extension of our oversea pastoral development, we may hope that development in agriculture and in other directions will soon follow. The question of immigration, in view of our need of population, is an exceedingly important one. In the They are our main sources of absence of an adequate population it is not possible either to settle the lands of Australia or to defend it from foreign aggression. During the three years of office of the late Government no satisfactory steps were taken to give effect to an immigration policy, although a number of immigrants have been brought to bur shores under the auspices of the States. I note with pleasure, therefore, that the present Ministry propose to take control of the selection of emigrants in Great Britain and other European countries, and afterwards to hand them over to the States, who will make provision for their settlement upon the land upon their arrival here. If only a desirable class of emigrants is selected by the Commonwealth authorities on the other side of the world, we shall be in a better position to attract persons to our shores than we have been under the divided method of selection which has hitherto obtained, and under which the States took charge at both ends. Only by attracting people to Australia can we hope adequately to develop it and to defend it from aggresSpeaking sion. To my mind, the question of defence is one of the greatest importance. The Government recognise that the position in the Pacific is daily becoming more serious, and I observe with pleasure that it is intended that immediate attention shall be given to that aspect of the matter. Our system of defence, both naval and military, should be developed in every way and that end can best be accomplished by attracting people to our shores. too, that the Government propose to encourage in every way the formation of rifle clubs. ance, particularly in our country and I hope that special provision will be made to provide them with ""ranges, in order that their members may be able to practise cases in my owu constituency where rifle clubs have been in existence many years-certainly ception of the Commonwealth-but till to-day they have not been able to secure permanent rifle ranges. instances they boast 100 or more members, and, in addition, there are a large number of cadets as well as members of other branches of the Forces who must necessarily take part in rifle shooting-and taken to provide them with rifle. ranges. As a matter of fact, the gravest obstacles have been placed in their way. take the first opportunity our country districts with proper ranges.

From the for very statement of the Prime Minister which ever since the inhas been circulated, I gather that the up Government propose to deal with the enormous and unnecessary expenditure In some that has been incurred by reason of the duplication of our Savings Banks throughout the Commonwealth. Only this afternoon a question was submitted to available-persons the Prime Minister under this heading, and I am glad that the statement which yet no step has been is contained in the circular to which I permanent have alluded, affords that question a complete answer.

No doubt when this The proposal of the matter is being discussed we shall be able to submit all these great to express our views upon that aspect of it. I come now to some very important matters regarding the proposal of the I wish now to refer to the Government to establish a system of national insurance throughout Australia. Some such system has been in operation in different countries in Europe-particu Speaking as one who lacks larly in Germany and Great BritainI understand that and if the Ministry only introduce in our various a system which will operate on are not dealt with by the the lines they have indicated they will certainly render great service to those who are entitled to benefit under that system. system of national insurance, provision can also be made for putting the maternity grant upon a proper footing. The late Government took to themselves great credit for the introduction of that grant. persons have taken advantage of it who were not entitled to it . proper system of national insurance, only those who are fairly entitled to participate in such a grant would be eligible to receive it . The Government also intend to deal with Old-age Pensions. Upon this question the grossest misrepresentations .were indulged in by the supporters of the Opposition during the recent election. For days and weeks prior to. the election I was asked by numbers of old-age pensioners whether it was a fact that if the Liberal party were returned to power they intended to abolish old-age pensions. I assured them that the party which had introduced that system certainly not abolish it , and that in they need not entertain the slightest fear that they would lose their pensions. It was everywhere said that return party would mean the last of old age pensions. statement supplied by the Government to-day is that, instead of abolishing old age pensions, they propose to make them more serviceable to those who receive them. It is unnecessary for me to deal at greater length with the special matters to which I have referred, but there are many other matters included in the statement submitted by the Prime Minister which will deserve the very close and careful consideration of honourable members. cry used by our opponents that the party on this side has no policy. Perhaps today they are disillusionized. I venture to say that when they read the statement submitted by the Prime Minister they must come to the conclusion that the object of the Liberal party now in power is to govern this country in the interests of the people as a whole. Their desire is not to set one section of the people against another, or to create industrial strife and unrest, but to deal with the great national problems confronting us in a way that will be becoming and in accordance with the duty of representatives of the Commonwealth Under such a in this and the other Chamber of this Parliament. If honorable members opposite desire to deal with the great national problems before the country we may expect that in this House they will give the Government every assistance in In my opinion, a great many carrying out their policy. I hope that there will not, because of the state of Under a parties, be any wrangling or quarrelling in this Chamber vchen these questions are being dealt with. I hope that all parties will approach their consideration in a national spirit, and with a view to f u r thering the interests of the country in every way. Speaking for myself, I can say that in dealing with these great problems the Government can rely upon the most generous and loyal support. If they are unable, by reason of the state of parties and the action of the party opposite to deal with these national problems in the way they propose, it may become necessary to leave their settlewould ment to the arbitration of the people. If the spirit displayed be such as to voting for Liberal candidates indicate that it is impossible for the Government to carry on the affairs of the country in a way becoming a Parliament the such as this, I hope that an appeal will to power of the Liberal be made to the country at the very earliest moment. Perhaps my willingThe answer to that ness to appeal to the country is due to my inexperience of political matters, but I may express a hope that if it should become necessary to 'again appeal to the electors, the result will be the reconstitution of this Parliament in both Chambers in such a way that the government of the country may be conducted in one without serious opposition in the other. It has been suggested that the existing constitution of the other Chamber may be made use of to block legislation asFor months past it has been a sented to by this. I trust that that w ill not be so. I hope that the other Chamber will see its way to assist in the carrying of legislation necessary for the country. If it should not do so, and an appeal to the country should become necessary, I trust that the Government will take an opportunity to clear the political atmosphere by letting the whole of the members of this Parliament go to the country at the same time. I hope that the result of the appeal, if made, will give satisfaction, and that honourable members on both sides, and especially those in Opposition, will be found ready to assist the Government in facing the great national problems before them, and in carrying legislation necessary for the good of the Commonwealth. be well for me before stating the question, and in order to avoid the necessity of interrupting honourable members who are new to the House, to mention the fact that it is not the practice of the House or in order to refer to anything done in the other Chamber of the Legislature. very great pleasure, from many points of view, in seconding the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for In d i . am a novice in Federal politics, but I am not expecting to receive any special consideration on that account. perfectly satisfied that if I give expression to views which are not in accordance power. with the views of my honourable friends on the left of the Speaker, they will very quickly indicate their objection to the amending B ill than in getting a particuremarks I make. the omission will be a lesson to me in think it a very wise provision whereby it deportment which I have not received in is intended to restore the definition in the any other part of the Commonwealth.

I am pleased to notice that increased assistance is intended to be offered to rifle clubs. rifle club ovar there. said that we are going to descend to personalities. I am very pleased to see that assistance is to be given to rifle clubs, a branch of defence that has not been as satisfactorily attended to in the past as I would have liked. One matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence is the need for advancing the horse-breeding requirements for remounts and gunners' horses. It is a matter that we should take into serious consideration. I believe that in the very near future we shall require 20,000 remounts a year. As far as I can see, we have foreign buyers in our markets who are depleting the Commonwealth of our best sorts, so that it will be a difficult matter for us, in time of need, to supply, in a hurry, what is necessary to move our troops from place to place. I think encouragement should be given in some way or other to men in the country to supply the right breed of horse. I am glad to see we are going to deal with the Northern Territory in a rational way. I say "" In a rational way,"" because I want to give my friends i u the Opposition every credit for the attempts they have made; but I think they were very short-sighted. If, terras upon which they were offering the land in the Northam Territory under leasehold conditions, they thought they were going to attract the right sort of men, they must be woefully disappointed to-day. Under the leasehold system, no finer or fairer terms could be offered; but I did not hear of any wild rush of our young men to take advantage of those terms. for forty blocks. ber wants to understand what is going on conditions in manufacturing in the Northern Territory, let him ask his respected chief to give him a copy of Brady's report. It would enlighten him. The proposition of the Government receives my hearty support. In dealing with the agricultural possibilities there, the settlers should have a generous living area, and they should have the right to the freehold some time during their occujsation. If any gentlemen wish to go I wish to refer for a few there and take up grazing areas of hundreds of square miles, by all means let them have the leasehold; but where men have to go into green country and toil and moil in agricultural propositions, Y o u have a very good thero should be a clause in their agreements or contracts allowing them, at some their own land. I am pleased to see that provision will shortly be made for that. Now, with regard to the policy of cooperation with the States, and the utilization of the waters of the Murray, I reciprocate what my friend the honourable member for In d i has said. The electorate I represent is just across the Murray from his; in fact, we have just satisfactorily cleaned up the whole of the Murray valley, and I am satisfied we can come to some agreement whereby the magnificent volume of water in that valley, instead of going to waste, will add the productiveness we so much desire to see. portant question before Australia. honourable member. I am glad to see that proposals are to be submitted to deal speedily with that matter. My reference to it leads naturally to the paragraph which informs us that proposals are to be submitted with a view to encouraging immigration. I do hope that, for the future, no political qualifications-are to be attached to any man who chooses to come to this country as an immigrant. I say deliberately that no Minister or. Governunder the extraordinarily easy ment officer has any more right to ask a man who comes to Australia whether he is a unionist or a non-unionist than whether he is a Jew or a Gentile. If we are to have political agents in ports abroad to put the tar brand upon a man who desires to emigrate to this country, it will certainly be a bad thing for us.

I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he knows what bathing accommodation was provided for the immigrants on the ship alluded to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong? As the Minister knows, immigrant ships are not required by the Board of Trade regulations to provide even one hot bath. I hope to do so toI n view of the vast number of deaths from measles, as compared with the comparatively small number from small-pox, I urge that the Minister should take steps to induce the Board of Trade to make better provision for the health of those who intend to become Australian citizens.",33,Paper S Ministers Laid Upon The Table The

215,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.29],"wish to know whether the Prime 'Minister, or the Minister of Trade and Customs, has any statement to make in regard to the small-pox scare in New South Wales? I can assure the Government that it is causing a serious amount of loss to the busiuess people of Sydney. It is a matter that should be altogether above party considerations. The workers are losing money because they cannot attend to their work. I ask the Minister of Customs to take some steps to end this business by isolating the contacts, and allowing the rest of the public to go free. It is a very serious matter, indeed, to the people of New South Wales. right. ate that the doctors are acting from any pecuuiary motive. I ask the PrimeM i nister, or the Minister of Trade and Customs, to make a statement on the subject to-morrow, and t r y to put an end to what is injurin g every class of the community. regret that I have to rise again to call the attention of the House to the administration of the Quarantine Act in New South Wales. When I sat on the other side of the HouseI said that I would never do anything from this side which would belittle Australia, or tend to its in j u r y. This afternoon I intend to justify the words which I then uttered from the other side. On the 5th July last, the Minister of Trade and Customs issued a proclamation quarantining the area within a radius of 15 miles of the Sydney Post Office. If the proclamation meant -anything at all it meant that the portion of New South Wales embraced within the quarantine area was not fit for other inhabitants of the State to enter. I was on my way to Melbourne when I received the first intimation that the proclamation had been issued. I arrived here on Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock, when, of course, it was impossible to see the Minister. But on the 7th JulyI waited upon him, with the view of trying to induce him to modify, if not to revoke, the proclamation. I am well satisfied to-day with the justice of the course I then took, because I claim that small-pox, which is a dirt disease, has not been proved to exist in the metropolis of New South Wales. When I interviewed the Minister bere he treated me in what I regarded as a cold-blooded manner. He seemed to look upon my complaint as a mere frivolous matter. He appeared to regard the issue of the proclamation as an ordinary official duty. It was issued in such a manner as to satisfy me that he did not give a moment's consideration to what he was asked to do. U p to the present time we have had no intimation from the medical men that there has been a case of true small-pox in the quarantine area. What they have admitted is that there have been some cases of a mild form of small-pox. I venture to say, if the proclamation had been issued by any other Government, the press of New South Wales would not have put the headlines they have to their reports; to my mind they have displayed an animus. When I brought this question before the House more than a month I do not wish to insinuago, I tried to impress upon honourable members that there was no possibility of any danger except in the quarantine area. I pointed out that there was no possibility of the spread of small-pox, because Sydney has natural opportunities for drainage. Both the Water and Sewerage Board, and the property-owners in and around Sydney, have spent millions of money for the purpose of keeping this area as free as possible from any form of contagious disease. It is many years since they instituted a proper system of underground sewerage, with efficient ventilation, and sanitary inspectors to call upon inhabitants to take necessary steps to prevent the spread of a dreadful d i sease like small-pox. I tell the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Wentworth, and the honourable member for Parkes that had the Government proposed that tliose electorates should be placed under quarantine, no members of this House would have been found more determined than themselves in resisting the proposal to put a stigma upon people such as was done by the issue of the proclamation on the 5th July. The honourable member for Wentworth, for example, would have used strong language in expressing the. indignation he felt at a proposal to quarantine his constituency. Do honourable members on the other side realize the stigma which the proclamation has cast upon Australia ? Travellers in every portion of the world will think twice before they take steps to come to Australia, owing to the reported breaking out of this disease. Is there no one opposite who is prepared to stand up and defend Australia from the stigma?",34,Committees Wobk S At This Contagious Disease May Be Prevented

219,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.31],"IAre they content to sit quietly in their places and give me no assistance in my efforts to get an unjustifiable stigma removed? interviewed the Minister of Trade and Customs, who exhibited the same cold in difference to what is going on. I do not think that he realizes what he has done. There is one thing for which I can claim credit, and that is that in consequence of my first interview with the Minister he took steps to alleviate a good deal of the hardship which otherwise he would have inflicted upon the general public. I give him credit for that. But this A d patients, those who are suffering at the ministration is doing nothing to destroy the disease germs where there has been an outbreak. Nothing has been done to cleanse the premises from which persons supposed to be suffering with small-pox have been taken. The only action of the authorities is to remove suspected cases and the contacts to the quarantine ground at North Head. joying themselves well enough in quarantine. make that clear. In one of these, a youth of fourteen wrote to his father, "" Dad, we are having great times in the quarantine area. I have got nothing the matter with me, and the only trouble is to dodge the doctor to prevent him from sending me home."" In another case that I know of, a lady was taken to the quarantine-ground because one of her children had a speck on its forehead, the doctors disagreeing as to whether it was small-pox. She wrote to her 'husband saying, "" D o n ' t worry about us."" That good lady is receiving two bottles of stout a day, and is having the best time of her life in quarantrade of Australia, and for every business, tine. Honourable members may laugh, but the stigma cast on Australia is no laughing matter. Althoughi t behoves .a M i nister of the Crown to have regard to the opinions of his professional advisers, he should show discretion and business capacity in dealing with questions of public interest, and when he has not sufficient knowledge of a subject to be able to deal with it properly, he should educate himself upon it . A Minister should not take so serious a step as the putting of any part his vaccination. But on the eighth day of Australia into quarantine without convincing himself of the necessity for it . Sydney is the cleanest and healthiest city in Australia, and, indeed, in the world. Small-pox broke out there in 1881, and between that year and the present time millions of pounds have been spent in prewas quite black. venting the recurrence of an outbreak. What the Minister should have done was, not to quarantine the whole city of SydOnly last week, in Sydney, I ney and the surrounding country for a distance of 15 miles, but to quarantine the small areas within which the disease has shown itself. That was done when the State authorities had to deal with the bubonic plague. Small areas in which cases of plague occurred were quarantined and cleansed, and then the inhabitants were free to go about again as usual. In my humble opinion, as in the opinion of many others who have seen some of the present time would not, under ordinary circumstances, be sent to the quarantine station. ' I have seen several of the cases, having made it my business, when I heard of any one being ordered to quarantine, to see the patients; and, in my opinion, none of those cases would, under ordinary circumstances, be sent to quarantine. It The contacts are enis a serious thing to have 1,000 persons taken from their homes and quarantined I have seen many letters which merely for a whim. The scare would not have lasted fourteen days had not the Government had the press behind it . It is unfortunate for Australia that this is a press-ridden Government, Ministers having to do exactly what the papers tell them to do. It is the newspaper proprietors who at present are the real rulers of the country. That is shown by the action of the Government in quarantining Sydney and its suburbs. As I have said, all the contacts now in quarantine are having a glorious time, which is as it should be; but the quarantining of Sydney is a serious thing for the shipping trade, and calling in Sydney, or having relations with Sydney. The Government, too, is answerable for the death of persons through hasty vaccination. I do not accuse Ministers of mnrder, but I submit that Mr Furness, of Paddington, is a man who would have been alive to-day had he not been vaccinated. He was, for fifteen years, in private employment without having a day's sickness, and played in a football match only nine days before after vaccination he had to go home, where he lay down on a sofa, and was soon no more. When I went to see the body, I found that one side of it was for some distance as black as my hat. One arm, for a distance of 14 or 15 inches, The doctors declared that he had had some kidney trouble. Possibly that may be so; but I am satisfied that that man, as well as another man who died at Surrey Hills, would today be living with his wife and children had he not been hastily vaccinated. Of course, we have absolutely no control over the medical profession. I do not say that vaccination is a good thing, or that it is a bad thing; but, in my opinion, any person, whether male or female, who has reached a certain age, should not be vaccinated without a medical examination. There may not be risk in vaccinating children, but a number of adults are not fit subjects for vaccination; and when such persons are vaccinated, the result is their untimely death. No one desires that. I hope that my speech will cause the press to discontinue the scare headlines which appear in the newspapers day after day. I do not know whether it is merely a coincidence, but every day, in the Sydney newspapers, we see the heading, ""The Small-pox Scare,"" and alongside it the heading, "" Prime Minister's Speech."" Many persons have been made quite nervous by these headlines, although the scare is absolutely unnecessary. I trust that the newspapers will in future show more discretion of cases, and make surer of their facts than they have done hitherto. I certainly hope that they will not refer to cases of small-pox where small-pox does not exist. As one of the representatives of Sydney, I shall stand up for the residents of that city and its surroundings, although others are not prepared to do so. I have the courage to appeal to the Government to try to put a stop to the unnecessary injustice that has been inflicted, and to reduce the area that has beeu placed in quarantine. IfI do nothing more as a representative of New South Wales than secure a reduction of the quarantine area, I shall have conferred some benefit on the people who are suffering, and shall likewise have assisted in removing as early as possible the stigma that has been cast upon Australia. Those who, like myself, follow, or have followed, the occupation of a sanitary engineer, know that small-pox is a preventible disease, and that, given a proper system of sanitation, there is no cause for alarm even if there is an outbreak. I feel strongly on this matter. I have done my best, but without success, to induce the Minister to take action to remedy the Ur. West. grievance under which the people of Sydney are labouring. The honourable gentleman seems to be quite cold and indifferent to our representations in this regard, and to deal with them just as he would deal with some "" six and eightpenny "" question of law on which he was asked to give an opinion. I trust that the Government will take warning from what has happened in connection with the smallpox outbreak, and that before they act upon the report of even ""an experienced officer they will exercise what ability they have to avoid injustice. They should certainly refrain from any hasty action that is likely to give rise to an injustice. I know of no greater injustice than has been inflicted upon the people of Australia, and more particularly the people of Sydney, in the uncalled for, and quite unnecessary, quarantining of 30 miles of the best city in the world. Minister) [5.53""] I do not propose to traverse the efforts of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat to make party capital out of a calamity that is in the reporting confronting Australia. But, as one of the representatives of Sydney, I believe that the electors of Wentworth will support their member in placing as highest amongst the public responsibilities that any Government can have, the health, well-being, and, indeed, the life of the country we are sent here to govern. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has asked a question with regard to the appointment of a doctor at the Naval College at Jervis Bay. The honourable member brought this matter under my notice a few days ago, and his representations have already borne such fruit that the initial steps are now being taken to have the position filled without any delay. It is not only urgently necessary, in the interests of the men concerned in that detached settlement, that a doctor should reside amongst them, but, owing to the Acts under which we have to administer such camps, it is also necessary in the interests of the revenue, and of Commonwealth purposes generally, that we should have a medical oflicer there. The appointment, therefore, will be filled immediately.

I did not think that the Commonwealth Bauk was established to assist the big cities of Australia, or to make profits for people trading with London, the great metropolis of the world. WhatI did understand was that one of the great objects in view in creating the Bank was that it might help pioneers and settlers to open up the country by lending them cheap money. When the Commonwealth Bank was established, the State Savings Bank of New South Wales was doing excellent business. operation there Settlers' Boards and a Closer Settlement Act , and the State Bank loaned settlers the money necessary to enable them to develop the country. But the Commonwealth Bank has absorbed the money that was being used in that way, and, instead of helping to develop the country along these proper lines, we find it lending large amounts, such as this particular sum of £300,000, at low rates of interest to city institutions by others-h e suggested that the Labour like the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.

W it h them it is a question, not of obtaining money at a low rate of interest, but of borrowing it at any price. We find that the country is being starved, as it were, by the Commonwealth Bank, whereas the big cities of the Commonwealth are able to obtain from it loans at an extremely low rate of interest. The attention of the Government should be devoted to this matter, and an adjustment should be made in the right direction. should not have risen but for the endeavour by the honourable member for Eden Monaro to make political capital at the expense of this side of the House. I have a great admiration for his knowledge of political warfare, but think that he can possibly win his seat without endeavouring to do an injustice to our party. When he addressed to the Treasurer a question with regard to a loan of £300,000 made by the Commonwealth Bank to the Board of Works, and implied that the Bank did not assist the farmers Bank has not lent the money to the Board of Works. The loan was simply underwritten by the Bank. made a success of the loan for the Board of Works. We farmers must have consideration, or we shall want to know the reason why. "" The farmer.""

It is a common practice on the part of some honourable members opposite to endeavour, in the same way, to make political capital. As a matter of fact, every representative of a Federal of a city electorate like that of Melbourne or Sydney, must have a considerable knowledge of the farmer's difficulties. He must know of his difficulties, in the first instance, in obtaining land, his difficulties in cultivating his land, and, having cultivated it , the difficulties he encounters in seeking to obtain a fair price for his products.

I need only refer to their antipathy to the Commonwealth land tax, which has done something in some parts of Australia to get for the farmers cheaper land than they could get before. If my honourable friends opposite question that statement, I refer them to what was said by the honourable member for the Grampians, when he informed his constituents that the land tax had resulted in the depreciation of land values to the extent of 30s. per acre.

Honourable members are much indebted to the honourable member for Eden Monaro for bringing this matter forward, and, doubtless, also indebted to the honourable member for Capricornia for the information that the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to lend farmers money at 4 per cent. Money is extremely hard to get at the present time; and, if the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works has been able to obtain £300,000 on the terms mentioned, they have done very good business. the rate of interest! hope the Treasurer, with his long experience of Australian affairs, will look into the matter. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is appointed for seven years at a salary of £4,000 per annum without any chance of being discharged; and, if he can see his way clear to lend £300,000 at 4 per cent., he will have a good many applications from the farmers of Australia, especially after what we have heard in the House to-day. In reply to the honourable member for Maribyrnong as to quarantine, I have to point out that under the Act all expenses charged and payable to the Commonwealth are fixed as a charge on the vessels. The other matter to which the honourable member referred has, for the first time, been brought under my notice, and that, together with the question raised by the honourable member for Melbourne, will be looked into.

As I said at the time, this was necessary in order to enable us to regulate the Inter-State traffic; and the regulations as originally framed are continued. I also stated at the time that, while preserving, the public health and enforcing all reasonable safeguards, the Government desired to consider as much as possible the convenience of the travelling public. During the last week or so, in enforcing the regulations, we have ascertained that there has been a certain amount of inconvenience owing to the fact that persons who have been successf u l l y vaccinated, and have passed the fourtaking every precaution to localize this teen days' period, have been called upon to practically go through the same process several times in obtaining certificates. .1 asked that the matter should be [4]-2 inquired into, and this week we shall issue an instruction under which persons who have been successfully vaccinated will be able to secure exemption certificates which will permit them to move freely from Sydney to Melbourne, or from Sydney to Brisbane, without being called upon to submit to a harassing regulation.
