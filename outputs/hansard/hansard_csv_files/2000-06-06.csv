To be precise, after nine years of continuous economic growth, it is of great concern that this loosening has been allowed to continue through a period when Australia has been racking up high current account deficits. These high current account deficits should have been responded to some time ago with concerted action, in particular by tightening fiscal policy. To defend his latest budget against these charges of fiscal looseness, the Treasurer has relied on the claim that he has reduced Commonwealth debt by $50 billion. However, the extent of his dependence on asset sales to achieve that debt reduction should raise further concerns about his poor financial management. To be exact, the latest estimates show Commonwealth general government net debt falling from $95.8 billion on 30 June 1996, which was the end of the financial year covered by Labor’s last budget, to an estimated $47.4 billion on 30 June 2001. That is a reduction of $48.4 billion. What the Treasurer failed to tell the public is that all that reduction in debt is attributable to asset sales. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table that shows how over the Treasurer’s five budgets the value of asset sales is expected to be $50.3 billion and will exceed the reduction in debt.
