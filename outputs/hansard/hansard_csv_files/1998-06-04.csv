395,Mr Brough (Longman) (5.59 P.m.),"We 98/3.4926 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 Thursday, 4 June 1998 Queen's Birthday Holiday holiday. It is the Queen's birthday holiday. As an avowed republican, I always work in my office on this day to make a statement, although my staff take the day off. In reality, it is not Mrs Betty Windsor's birthday at all. This, I understand, is in April, and for many hundreds of Australians this long weekend has absolutely no relevance at all. It is just another day added to the usual weekend break. I have long believed, and this has been a feature of a few of my remarks in this place, that the Queen's birthday weekend ought to be replaced by another more substantial and relevant occasion. In my view, May Day should replace it in recognition of the achievement of workers in the trade union movement in Australia and throughout the world. In many countries of the world May Day is declared a public holiday. In fact, in many Asian countries, such as Malaysia, the government believes that May Day is significant enough to be declared a public holiday. Indeed, in many European countries it is a holiday. When we go to the people next year with a referendum on this very issue, I am confident that the majority of Australians, especially in my own electorate, will vote in favour of Australia becoming a repUblic. The point I would make-and I see those opposite are a little bit upset-is that changing the Queen's birthday holiday to May Day would have no cost impact on the country because you are only replacing one date with another date. I think it is much more relevant to modem-day Australia to have May Day, if we are going to have a public holiday, and that may be a debate. I am all in favour of it, but I can understand that there is a debate about whether we should have a public holiday. In fact, despite what some of the critics say, when you look at a chart of public holidays of many countries throughout the world, the number of public holidays in Australia is quite well down compared with other countries such as France and Italy. I think we have more than the United Kingdom but most certainly a lot fewer than a lot of other countries. Therefore, I think it is important that the days we celebrate, by having the day off and getting paid for it, should have a significance to us. I really do not see why Mrs Betty Windsor's birthday has more significance than my birthday or any other person's birthday, but I do think that May Day does have a significance. I will be in my office on Monday. The local media often checks me out on this because they know my view, and they have a tendency to ring my office. I am sure if they rang the office of the honourable member for Gilmore( Mrs Gash) she would probably be there on Monday as well. I am always there, and I make a point of saying, 'I am working today as a statement.' My staff do not work on that day. They have it off, and they are welcome to have it off. But I strongly urge that May Day replace the Queen's birthday as the public holiday. (Time expired)",121,Adjournment A Retrenched Miner A Genuine Job Seeker Has

We will talk about the fact that unemployment in my electorate went from 1.4 per cent when Labor came to power to about nine per cent when they left and how it has come down under our government. We will talk about interest rates and how they went through the roof under Labor and have come down under our government. We will talk about government debt, which went through the roof under Labor and has come down under our government. We will talk about the fact that we have inflation under control, the fact that we are up-front on taxes and that we actually reduce taxes. But I also understand that we may well find that we have a One Nation candidate in my electorate, and I just want to say a couple of words about the subject of the One Nation Party. I can understand that, whilst some people in this country might be attracted by the superficial appeal that comes from One Nation, it is a complex world we live in. It is a changing world. There are attractions perhaps to having some simple cut-through solution that people think is going to fix everything. Unfortunately, the real world is not like that. I would suggest to people who may be considering looking at One Nation that they need to look very closely at the policies of One Nation. They ought to ask for the detail. They ought to ask how these grandiose statements are actually going to be achieved. We saw a good example yesterday in question time when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) stood up and asked the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) why he had not imposed a tariff on pork imports from Canada. The Prime Minister quite rightly made the point that it is not as simple as that, because, if we do that, the Canadians will then impose a cut-off on imports we send to Canada. As we send eight times as much to Canada as we bring from Canada, we would have a net job loss. It seems to me that that is not a very smart move. It seems to me that that is typical of the sorts of policies we get from One Nation. They are simplistic, they are there to appeal to the average person in the street who perhaps does not understand some of those complexities but would in fact do damage to this country. What One Nation is all about is saying that it wants to do this, that or the other, and, when you look through it, it is going to do damage to the country. It is going to do damage to the country in a whole range of areas. I would appeal to the electors of Aston and in fact the electors across the country that they ask One Nation candidates not for the cheap rhetoric, not for the grand phrase but to spell out how they are going to do things. I would suggest that, when it comes to how things are going to be done and you compare the record of my party and my government with what One Nation is saying, this government has been delivering. This government has been delivering in tough times. We acknowledge that there is more to be done and we will continue to do it, but people out there should not be fooled or be taken in by the fool's gold of One Nation.

As Mrs Gash wrote to the Prime Minister: Prime Minister, as you would understand, people do not stomach cuts to basic health needs particularly well. Indeed they are outraged at our insensitivity and I have a lot of trouble defending the decision to abolish the scheme. I applaud the frankness and forthrightness of the member for Gilmore. I want to recount to the House just what sort of impact this is having, and this is just a random selection of people who have rung my office. I will not quote the names of course, but one constituent will have to wait two years to have a filling and a plate made. Another constituent will have to wait 12 to 18 months to have teeth in urgent need of repair and fillings seen to. Another constituent was told that he would have to wait 15 to 16 months to have repairs done to his dentures which are split. He was advised that he should just use superglue to tack them together and to wait 15 to 18 months to have them properly seen to. Another constituent will have to wait three years to have her teeth seen to at Blacktown hospital. Another constituent has been told she will have to wait seven to eight months for an assessment: this is merely the assessment. She broke her front tooth in January. She, and this is someone not of a great financial capability, ended up having to pay $800 going private. Her husband, whose bottom denture is in need of repair, has equally been forced to pay $800. That is $1,600 in one year for a pensioner couple. The point I am making is that a lot of our fellow Australians are suffering because of the abolition of this dental scheme. I thought it was an excellent scheme. The states do not have the capacity to pick up the leeway that this scheme filled. I would certainly urge the government to reconsider its decision and reinstitute the program. It is heartless and uncaring. They do not understand how important good dental health is. Employment families, young people and other local residents have been for many years feeling the effects of unacceptable unemployment rates. The doom and gloom picture of what this does to people of all ages is well documented, particularly in terms of the low self-esteem, employment opportunities and networks of long-term unemployment people. Many projects in the Gilmore electorate, including one of the biggest work for the dole pilot programs, are contributing to rebuilding the confidence of many people about returning to the work force. It is now time to build the confidence of employers. An initiative by some very special members of the Gilmore community have done just that, proving that the jobs are out there and that people who are willing to have a go can achieve anything. Following months of promotion, talkback radio comment and lobbying, award winning local radio station 2ST DJ Barry Macaffrey developed a plan to promote jobs in the southern highlands and south coast. In conjunction with Gail Schmierer and Ray Carrall of the local offices of the CES and myself, Jobs Drive 98 was born. I would like to detail to the committee some points about Jobs Drive 98. It received no direct government funding. It was totally community based. It took one month of planning and it went for just 12 hours. It aimed to provide employers and potential employees with information about jobs and the assistance which is available to get them. It was supported by local businesses, media and the wider community.

Radio 2ST donated advertising and news time to promote the event and many hours of work by the staff in the week before making sure all went smoothly. Local newspapers donated hundreds of dollars worth of free advertising to support the cause. I spent the two weeks prior notifying all businesses of the Jobs Drive and how they could become involved through letters, press releases and my business fax stream information service. Most importantly, Jobs Drive 98 was a resounding success. We aimed to achieve $500,000 worth of jobs for local people, that is half a million dollars in wages which would have been spent in the local area. On 21 February, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., while I helped man the phones at the CES office, we and Radio 2ST took numerous calls from employers with available work opportunities, business people looking for more information on the government's innovative and very successful assistance schemes, traineeships and apprenticeships, and potential employees who gave their skills, experience and career choice over the air. At the end of 12 hours I am delighted to advise the committee that not only did we achieve our goal of $500,000 worth of jobs but we more than doubled it, achieving $1.34 million worth of jobs for local people. The success of Jobs Drive 98 has been celebrated by many employers and employees throughout Gilmore. It has been so successful in generating confidence in the employment sector in Gilmore that we are looking to hold another in the next two months. Employment this week for interjecting on the minister for unemployment. Much as I would have preferred not to have been suspended, I was concerned that Dr Kemp was talking about the job placement programs as being such a great success. I do not know whether this might be occurring in some parallel universe for which Dr Kemp has responsibility, but it is certainly not what is happening in the electorate of Wills. For example, my office had a call from Mr Max Keating of North Essendon in relation to new employment service providers. He said his son had a job with one of the councils but was recently made redundant. He went off to the local employment services provider, Job Net, and found a gardening job that interested him. He was referred on to Job Plus in Nicholson Street, Footscray. He was later contacted by Job Plus and advised that he was not eligible to apply for the position because he was not registered as unemployed. Mr Keating pointed out to my office his belief that the minister had stated publicly at some stage that anyone looking for employment could apply with the new agencies. Indeed, that is correct. Dr Kemp, in response to a question without notice from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), said: A free employment service will be provided by the government through the new Job Network. It will provide upgraded facilities to all unemployed people, whether they are on benefit or not. But what happens to Mr Keating's son? He is told he cannot apply for the gardening job because he is not registered as unemployed and is not receiving unemployment benefits. Mr Keating quite correctly points out that this was an opportunity for his son to gain employment but, under the new system, his son was denied this opportunity. Under the old system, the CES, his son would have been given the opportunity to compete for this job. It is simply not good enough and makes a mockery of Dr Kemp's claims that the new job placement services represent an improvement.",124,Representatives Main Committee

The answer came back that, of these postcodes, we have one participant in one of them, and that is in 3058 which is Coburg. So, in the entire electorate of Wills, we have one person involved in work for the dole-a mickey mouse scheme replacing Labor's great Working Nation program which had reduced unemployment in Wills from higher than the national average to the national average. This government replaced what was an excellent scheme, a first-class scheme, with a mickey mouse scheme with only one participant. (Time expired) Employment today. As far as the Job Network scheme is concerned, it is going well. It is in its infancy stage and it is working well. Although people are concerned, they have to understand that a new scheme like this which is in its infancy will change and will adapt. It is working well for unemployed youth. But today I want to talk more about the middle-aged group; I want to talk more about the people aged between 40 and 60 years of age. A lot of these people have found themselves unemployed. We are talking about people who are former bank managers or who may have left Telstra and other large employment groups and who have been trained in one particular trade or have one particular set of skills. What we as a government need to do is to look at new initiatives that will cover and pick up these people. I am on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It is interesting to see the trend that many employers have looked at in the past where they have particularly focused on staffing their businesses with people from the middle age bracket because they present themselves as stable, trustworthy and secure. Basically, in the past, our youth have been having trouble getting work while the middle aged have been picked up-no worries at all-owing to the fact that they are very well skilled and are secure, trustworthy and stable as well. The employers also looked at the three variables of attitude, competency and skills which the middle aged responded to without question, because they were brought up in an era which grew and worked to these variables. These attributes are prerequisites for any employment position, particularly in that order of attitude, competency and skills. What has happened is that the youth of today have understood this situation. They have changed and amended the way they portray themselves in the community and, accordingly, employers arc now picking up more youth. We arc now finding ourselves in the situation where some of the middle-aged people are having trouble getting work. Technology is also moving very fast. I believe we as a government have a responsibility to put initiatives in place that will help these individuals. I certainly believe that we can address this. We have the work for the dole scheme and green corps projects for youth, but we need to put in schemes that will now help middle-aged people. Financial incentives must be made available to employers, as the government have done with youth, so that employers might pick up the middle aged as well. It is a great initiative that we should look at. (Time expired) the time for members' statements has concluded.",125,Representatives Main Committee

405,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with sessional order 275A,Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4931 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O'KEEFE (Burke) (9.58 a.m.)-I will just take a few minutes of the Main Committee's time this morning to indicate that the opposition is supporting the Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998. It is one of the elements of the package that the government announced in September last year called the AAA package, AgricultureAdvancing Australia. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you were in the chair yesterday for the discussion of another billMr O'KEEFE-that we touched on this particular bill. The point I was making is that I think it is highly representative of what I call the attempt to deceive the rural sector that the government had actually produced something remarkable and different in the AAA package, because this farm management deposits bill, as it is now presented, effectively replaces the old income equalisation deposits and farm management bond schemes which were there under the previous Labor government to assist farmers. They had two key roles. One was an income averaging role. That meant that farmers, when they had surplus profits in a year and which would have resulted in a high tax yield, could actually average their income over other years by placing the surplus money in these deposits, and it was not taxed until it was taken out, and the applicable tax rate would be that in the year in which it was taken out. I remember when we introduced these schemes in the 1980s. They were used in the sport area, including the horseracing industry. There were a number of industries saying to the government at the time, 'Our people have high yield years and low yield years. We need some kind of income averaging situation so we can level out the tax.' And that was introduced, along with farm management bonds which were a further development in that. They were more intended to encourage farmers to provide some funds for a bad year, and it amounts to the same thing. But one was income averaging in the sense of high years versus lesser years. The other was to encourage farmers to actually put aside some money for a good year to use particularly in times of hardship. If a hardship situation were presented to DPIB, the funds could be drawn out and the tax rate that applied was the rate at the time-which often in a hardship year was zero because the farm income was below the taxable rate. That system has been working. It suffered a lot of criticism during the latter years of the Labor government and the new government pledged it would overhaul this and come in with a brand new scheme that really worked for farmers. The fact is that basically every criterion that applied in the former schemes has been rolled into this one farm management bond. Having studied it closely, I can only see one difference: it has been privati sed. The farm management bond can now be held with a bank, a credit union or a local approved financial institution instead of being held by DPIB and Treasury. That is the only difference. I do not have any problems with that. The system has also been marginally amended to take account of the fact that a person placing funds in a private sector bond or private sector coupon will receive a slightly higher",126,Representatives Main Committee
406,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"I do remember.4932 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 interest rate than that which is paid by Treasury and, therefore, the interest on a farrn management bond is 100 per cent taxable. Under the previous scheme, a certain amount of the interest investment was exempt from tax to take account of the fact that the interest rate paid on a Treasury bond was lower than would be received on a commercial bond. But the net effect is that it is the same for the farmer. So why would I take any objection to this? Of course, I would not take any objection. It is basically identical to what was provided before-and that was the key to the points I was making yesterday which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will remember the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) took some exception to. I was making the point that most of the components of the AAA package when sectioned out and studied amount to a rebadging of Labor's former programs; even the amounts provided for them are the same, as was confirmed by the National Farmers Federation. But the minister took great umbrage at my pointing that out. I might also just read into the record for him a point I made during the discussion yesterday that relates to this. I was talking about the fact that some of these programs will in the end require extra funds or some may not be drawn down as much as was expected. I think the budget allocation for the farm management deposit scheme is probably overstated. That is not a good thing. I am simply saying that I expect farm incomes to be down in this financial year and possibly in the next financial year compared with the estimates at the time. Therefore, the amount of surplus cash to be left over and placed in these bonds will be probably lower than anticipated. The point about it too is that it is the higher income farmers who will actually have the funds to put in this scheme and therefore attract the 20c in the dollar tax rate if they are able to leave the funds there for 12 months or more. That is where the benefit really lies. I was making the point that the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) is not overly sympathetic to the position of the farm sector when these things come back to the budget table for one reason or another. I quoted a reference from the Financial Review, and I saw the minister looking at me in a strange way, as though I had come from Mars, and thinking, 'What on earth is he talking about?' The reference I gave him was 4 September last year and the point I was making was that the Treasurer was on the record as saying that none of us should get too excited if the farm sector takes a bit of a hit from EI Nino or the Asian downturn. He said: If the El Nino effect continucs as it looks at the moment, you would expect it to have an effect on fann product. Farm product, however, is not a huge part of GDP.' In other words, 'We will not get too excited and we will not worry too much about its effect on the government's forecasts or the government's budgets because farm product is not a huge part of GDP.' That was an article from the Financial Review of 4 September last year. If the minister can get the Treasurer to have a look at that and review his attitude on the importance of agriculture to the Australian economy, I will be grateful for it. In the meantime, if he does not do anything about that, I will keep on making the point. That is the battle he has got. He has got to get into that cabinet room and have these battles with the Treasurer, who really does not take agriculture all that seriously. With those few comments, I will leave it at that and indicate that we are supportive of this legislation. Deposits) Bill 1998 is an extremely important initiative on the part of this government. It provides for a scheme which will allow farmers to deposit funds in a commercially held farm",127,Representatives Main Committee
407,Mrs Stone (Murray) (10.07 A.m.),"The Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm ManagementThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMmEE 4933 management deposit and have no tax payable until the year the deposit is withdrawn. This scheme is an important component of the government's Agriculture-Advancing Australia initiative because it is a risk management tool. It is not anything to do with tax avoidance. It will allow farmers to set aside pre-tax income earned itl the good years to give them some cash, the reserves that they need, when they inevitably have the lean years. Of course, I speak strongly in favour of this bill because in my electorate of Murray the agricultural sector underlies the economic and social well-being of all of the population. Even though we are, in fact, drought proofed in most of Murray because much of the electorate is irrigated, we have the same fluctuations in prices, output and profit, and I will give a couple of examples. In the heart of the Goulburn Valley and the Murray Valley where we have irrigation water supplied annually, we recently had the apple and pear fire blight scare. This slashed the incomes of the pome fruit industry, reducing their profits for that year-in the cases of some individual farmers by $60,000 to $600,000. The next year, their profits were back to what they normally expect. Likewise, with the anthrax scare, beef and dairy producers were doing well one year but then, out of the blue, an anthrax outbreak meant that their incomes suddenly plummeted. Across the other half of the electorate is the Mallee region, the wheat growing country. As every Australian knows, a wheat grower's profits are very much determined by whether it has rained or not. As well, however, the international price situation fluctuates so, through no fault of their own, wheat growers may have a superb crop of the quality that is demanded on the international market but, because of international trade interference with perhaps another country deciding to dump wheat into the markets that we have traditionally held, the wheat grower's income may be substantially less than they anticipated. They need a cash reserve for those very bad years. In the past, what has often happened in the very good years when there has been a surplus of cash generated, because of our tax system the farmer has been obliged to go and buy a piece of equipment or some more land to make sure that all of their hard-earned income is not sent off to the tax office. That does not leave them with the cash reserve for when, inevitably and invariably, they have a downturn. It also means that it militates against farmers considering contracting to replace their capital equipment needs, for example bringing in contracting harvesters. A lot of our farms have extraordinarily expensive equipment that is only used for a month or two in the year because of the way our tax system has bitten when they have had that better year. This particular amendment bill will create a farm management deposit scheme. It is anticipated it will be of great value to all primary producers across Australia. The accountants are already saying that this is a scheme that is long overdue, and they can see no downside. Certainly we do not have across Australia a huge proportion of our farmers generating the sorts of incomes that need to be tucked away in the good years for the bad but, even if it helps a substantial proportion of our farmers, that is well worth the scheme being put in place. In particular, let me name some of the major features of this scheme. It includes, of course, a limit on holdings in the scheme of $300,000 per taxpayer, fully tax deductible deposits in the year of deposit but taxable in the year of withdrawal. Companies, trust and partnerships will not be able to access FMDs. However, beneficiaries of trusts and individual partners of a partnership may make deposits. Interest will be payable on 100 per cent of the deposit. Eligibility is restricted to primary producers with a taxable non-primary production income 4934 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 of less than $50,000 in the year of deposit. Other than withholding tax in a 12-month minimum term for deposits, no withdrawal limits apply to the deposits. On withdrawal, 20 per cent of the amount withdrawn will be deducted for tax purposes, if a tax file number is supplied, otherwise top marginal rates will apply. Deposits must be held for 12 months. However, funds may be withdrawn at any time before this, but they will lose all their tax benefit. Interest is taxable in the year it is earned. It cannot be automatically rolled into the deposit, but it may be deposited itself, up to the $300,000 limit. Deposits must be a minimum of $1,000 and withdrawals must be a minimum of $1,000, or the balance of the deposit. There are no transaction limits, so long as the balance is $300,000 or less. Financial institutions will pay an interest rate determined in the marketplace. Investors must specify only one institution at anyone time with which to hold their FMDs. However, they will be able to change that institution at any time, and transfers between institutions will not incur withholding or other tax effects. Only prudentially controlled or government guaranteed institutions will be eligible to hold these FMDs, including banks, building societies and state government finance corporations, but not pastoral houses. This is a very important initiative. It is an important change from the old income equalisation deposit/farm management bond system. It is, in fact, if you like, a combination of those two schemes. We found that farmers did not access those two schemes. They were not producing the results that we need in Australia to give farmers some ability to manage their risk, to give them some long-term planning advantages. It is a high risk business being in agriculture today. We are export dependent, particularly in the food growing, manufacturing and exporting business. Our overseas markets, as I said before, are subject to interferences and management that makes it a business that you cannot guarantee year in and year out in terms of either your prices, your market access or your volumes to be supplied. This government has recognised that. It recognises the importance of agriculture in terms of its contribution to our gross domestic product. It is a scheme that, as the opposition has rightly said, cannot be seen to be anything but very good news. I strongly commend this bill to the House. parliament see very good news in government legislation. While I support this Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998, I do not think it goes very far and, in reality, I do not think it does very much. It would seem to me that the money would be better handled through taxation with the deposits held by the government, on which they paid the current rate of interest to give it full security. I am a little bit concerned about the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) where he says it is limited to farmers who have no more than $50,000 off-farm earnings. I am not quite sure whether this would include farmers who engage in contract work. If it does include them, I think this is an anomaly and it should be removed. Farmers who are engaging in rural contract work should not be included as nonprimary producers, but that is something that will have to be left to detail. The problem is, of course, that, when you leave this to detail, the taxation department always puts the worse possible connotation on it. The fact is that we tend to bring these schemes in when there is not much scope for taking advantage of them. The whole of the rural sector is generally depressed, and farmers are not going to be in a position to put aside this sort of income to assist themselves. It is a pity that",128,Representatives Main Committee
408,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (10.13 A.m.),"It always amuses me when members ofThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4935 we do not bring in these schemes when the industry is buoyant. What happens is that the general public gets the idea that the rural sector has been greatly assisted when it has not. Of course, there are many other things the government can do. I believe that we should re-establish a development bank with the charter of the original development bank to go out and lend money to farmers long term, at reasonable interest rates, without full regard to security, based on their hard work, initiative and the integrity of the Australian people. This, of course, cannot work with the present Commonwealth Development Bank, which is nothing more than a grubby merchant bank-and has been for about 30 years. In fact, in a privatised system, it is probably ultra vires the company law for it to be operating at all, as the requirement under company law is for directors to maximise the income of the company for the shareholders. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) keeps talking about the low interest rate regime available to the community. This is generally not available to farmers. I have many farmers who are currently paying 12Y2 per cent interest. I would like the Treasurer to explain just how this can be when he tells us interest rates arc low. The reason is that there is a real premium put on the farms by banks, and, in many cases, the worse offender is the Commonwealth Development Bank, which has locked people into long-term loans at interest rates way above the market. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray( Mrs Stone), talked about some of the other problems with the rural sector. She mentioned fire blight. AQIS recommended that we allow in New Zealand apples because they felt the risk of bringing in fire blight was very small. Unless that risk is zero, they should not be allowed in. Nowhere in the world where fire blight is established has it ever been successfully eradicated. While it is true that apples are quite resistant to it, the new types of apples, which Australia has pioneered, are very susceptible to it and even more so are pears. The reason New Zealand does not have a pear industry is that it has fire blight. If fire blight were to get into the electorate of Murray, it would simply destroy the pear industry in Australia. Governments and government departments do not have the right to do these sorts of things. While talking about this bill, I want to talk about where governments clearly affect the interests of the rural sector on other issues. The pig industry is in crisis in this country, and they are not in a position to access this legislation. They simply are not going to have any earnings to set aside. Had we had this scheme in buoyant times things would be different, but that is not the case. Why are things in the industry so bad? I would submit simply because of government action. the world and that we should increase production. They talked about the markets in Asia, which, of course, are so ephemeral. You would think that Keating was running that department. That market did not eventuate but increase in production did. Then the government said that it would allow in Canadian pork partly to keep pressure on, to keep the Australian pig producers honest and partly because they had signed this treaty which stopped us banning the import. ABARE predicted that in the first year 3,900 tonnes would come in. In fact, 12,000 tonnes came in. One has to wonder, when the industry is so badly affected by actions and forecasts of the government, why the government does not have a responsibility to compensate, to make good the results of their actions. We are told that we have a level playing field. Quite clearly, we do not. Let us get this straight: it is not Canadian pork coming into the country; it is American pork. It is coming 4936 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 in from ConAgra farms in America, going across the border to ConAgra plants in Canada and coming out to ConAgra agents here. Quite clearly, as a result of these trade agreements which the previous government signed, but it was fully supported by this government, we are supporting multinational companies at the expense of the interests of our own producers. I think that is a scandal. If we were to have a level playing field, I believe that we should make the Canadians send in whole pig. We are told that we cannot bring in whole pig because there is disease in the bone. Disease in the bone! If there is disease in the bone, how do we stop it going from the bone to the meat? Let us review that argument all over again. As a fall back position, let us say, 'Okay, bring in the whole boned pig.' This will not occur because they can get more for the sirloin in North America than they can get here. They are attacking Australia with leg meat, which is Australian prime meat where it is not so in the United States and Canada. So they clearly have a big advantage. There is no level playing field. I believe, very strongly, that to make it level we should insist that they bring in the whole pig, not just selected portions. But that is unlikely to happen where governments in this country show far more interest in treading the world stage and abiding by GAIT than they do in the interests of our own farmers. I just wish that some of our ministers could go to France and get bitten by some French politicians so that there are people who will look after the interests of our farmers. This bill is a feel-good bill in many ways. It is simply not going to achieve very much. Unless we address those other issues which I have mentioned, nothing substantial will happen in the rural sector. Let us look, too, at orange producers. Orange producers are not going to be able to take advantage of this. This industry is in crisis. It is interesting to see that the government has put great stress on the fact that the National Farmers Federation supports this legislation. Well, who is the National Farmers Federation? Whom do they represent? They certainly do not represent rural producers. NFF clearly stands for no family farms. These people are entirely imbued with the rational economic theory. Their advice to government was, 'There are winners and losers. You can sacrifice the orange producers in the interests of the beef, wheat and wool producers.' Those beef, wheat and wool producers are my constituents, and they are not going to be better off one iota if you kill the orange industry. They are, in fact, going to be worse off because what you do is you contract the whole rural vote. That has to be realised. Let us face reality. We only produce half our requirements of orange juice so we have to import. It was not Brazilian farmers bringing in concentrate to Australia; it was American agribusiness. They wanted to flood the market to kill the whole industry. They knew that once the trees were out they would never be planted again. But the rational economists that seem to inhabit government these days seem to have the view that you pop trees in the ground, pull them out and pop them back in again. It is simply not like that. If you kill that industry, those trees will never grow up. Bear in mind that we only produce half that juice because we had a spate of pulling trees out some years ago. We have been saved in the short term by the drought in Brazil, which, of course, is a good thing for us. It makes me think that perhaps there is a god after all. So much needs to be done for the rural sector. When you kill the rural sector, when you drive people out of the country towns into cities, the cost imposed on society is enormous. There is not one person who goes to a capital city that does not require new infrastructure, Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4937 but our cities are bursting at the seams, yet we anleaving all that infrastructure in country towns underutilised. There can be no sense in that. You would have to be a rational economist to perceive any. I support this bill. As I say, it does very little. In reality, it certainly is not a bill that can be accessed by farmers at the present time. I am hoping there will be an upturn in improving conditions. One thing has to be realised by this nation, and that is this: there is not one capital city of Australia that lives on its intrinsic worth. Everyone lives by sucking the lifeblood out of the rural sector and the mining sector. They work on the wealth of the hinterland. That is what keeps Australian cities going, not intrinsic value. That has to be realised because, if that is not, the continual dichotomy will grow in Australia between city and country people. If that is allowed to continue, this country cannot survive because it cannot survive as a nation divided against itself. the Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998. I note some of the comments of the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell). I would hope that this is not a nation divided against itself but a nation where city and country can work together. Under this government we will have the opportunity to perhaps extend the arms from the city to the country and from the country to the city and bring people together to benefit. I put to you too that this government for the first time has really taken on the concerns of country people through the Agriculture-Advancing Australia policies. We have addressed ourselves to some of the issues that are really affecting country Australia today, particularly in my area of Gippsland, in the seat of McMillan and country Victorians generally. It is not denied by anybody that we are faced with a drought at the moment that runs from central New South Wales right down through the Monaro into Gippsland and down into Tasmania. This has caused enormous hardship for communities, but the member for Kalgoorlie actually denies that there has been restructure going on in rural communities. Since the 1960s the change in transport, the change in information technology and the change in the way we communicate with one another has changed the whole face of the farming community. I would agree with the member for Kalgoorlie and say this: the soul of the cities is in the country. We rely on country people for the national soul. They look to country people for the expression of everything that is Australian. I do feel that locally in the seat of McMillan, and I know the member for Kalgoorlie expresses that generally in his approach to his politics. I can accept that there are those that are passionate about how we go about holding together our country communities. There is the thrust of the government's approach and the thrust of the approach of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) in his response to the pork industry that the member raised. The Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Tim Fischer) yesterday said that he agrees that there is no level playing field but there is a minefield out there that we are having some success in addressing ourselves to. There is the good work done by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) in bringing all these pieces together into one cohesive policy where the previous government failed to do that. There are farmers right now in parts of my area who are in great distress because of this drought. We have gone through a shocking period for dairy farmers. We are automatically restructuring the beef industry throughout the whole of Gippsland because of the size of",130,Representatives Main Committee

We have to find ways to address ourselves to keeping rural communities together. Part of Agriculture-Advancing Australia is to put in a program to support rural communities, which we have done. With the granting of drought exceptional circumstances in Gippsland it has been proved for the first time ever that we are not drought proof, unlike the electorate of Murray, and that the great lush land of Gippsland can be affected by the lack of rain or by the excessive amount of rain and then the withdrawal of that rain. Under the government's proposal for exceptional circumstances for farmers, we look at a number of issues including meteorological conditions, agronomic and livestock conditions, water supplies, the impact of production, environmental impacts, the impact on farm income, sale and significance of the events, and other forms of support being provided or which are available from Commonwealth or state government agencies. In combination with the state government, we were recently able to deliver a $3.7 million package to farmers in Gippsland. That package has been extended to East Gippsland and has also been extended further into the Monaro. This is the first time government has had to turn and react in these parts of Australia. My concerns are that we put proposals and programs in place-such as the bill before us, that will at least give some opportunity for farmers and producers across Australia to address the issues, particularly of good years and bad years. That is what the bill does in this instance. The member for Kalgoorlie also addressed the issue of farmers in contract work. I will take up the proposal that he put forward, because a tremendous number of the farmers in Gippsland are also contractors. I would not like the nature of their work to prevent them accessing this program because, without that contracting out work which is often done for other farmers, it would make a mockery of the opportunity for this program to work effectively on behalf of farmers. But we must not forget in that process that, in this global economy, we have a number of areas in which Australia has to address itself to the whole of the issue rather than to one individual grouping at any given time. We have to look at the beginning of our pork exports and the fact that we have begun to export citrus products. Our beef markets need to be protected. We as a government have put in labelling legislation which will also help the pork industry and there is, too, of course, the anti-dumping legislation that only this government has been able to provide. This is important legislation not only for the pork industry but also for the paper and pulp industry. It gives a clear indication for Australia as to what is a product of Australia and what is made in Australia. It is only this government, through the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs( Mr Truss), that has been able to deliver on behalf of Australian producers. Today, with this farm management bill, we have taken the opportunity to deliver, once again, on a promise to rural Australia and particularly rural Victoria. It is one of the many lists of core promises that this government under the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has delivered and will continue to deliver. But it is not just about legislation; it is not just about economics; it is about people. This Agriculture-Advancing Australia package, of all of the legislation that we have been addressing, is directly about people: people on the farms, people in regional areas, people that have a real concern about their future and about the generations to come. Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4939 Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, you would know from your own area that there is a concern out there as to where rural people are going to be in 10, 15 and 50 years time. Are we going to have the family farms that are currently there? Will there be further rationalisation? Will there be the opportunity for their children to stay? Some of the information that we have read says that the numbers of people between the ages of 24 and 34 in country areas right across Australia are diminishing. We have an ageing community with some 14 per cent of the community made up of children. The income in the rural areas is no longer the dream, where city people often used to see farming life as giving a large income and a great lifestyle. That is certainly not the case across Gippsland. We are constantly addressing ourselves to the issues that affect people on those farms, in those communities and in those small businesses. In another place today I will be addressing some of the issues that have impacted so badly on regional Australia. I will remind this Main Committee chamber of one of those issues; that is, after the 1993 election campaign the taxes in this country were increased. The wholesale sales taxes were increased to the tune of $4 billion and the taxes that were going to be reduced to those people by another $4 billion. The previous government actually cost every person $444. That was done by stealth. It was unfair. There was no compensation for it. Who paid it? Teachers in rural communities, farmers, women trying to manage the household budget, low income families in country areas-all of those regional people. They are the ones that paid it. They suffered it. Mr Melham interjectingof the former federal government in 1993. These are real people out there that had to pay a real unfair cost when they were previously promised that there would be no tax increases. So never ever talk to me about social justice. I remember a member sitting in this House giving his maiden speech on social justice. Every time he mentioned social justice, he had his bus load of people in the parliamentfor that person at that timeto actually sit there and claim social justice after increasing taxes by 10 and 20 per cent to the poorest parts of our community, which is often in rural Australia where they do not have the service, they do not have the transport, they do not have the opportunities and they do not have the educational opportunities. Those people were never, never compensated. Mr Bruce Scott interjectingbe dealt with very effectively and quickly. I have taken my time, but I just remind the committee that any time anybody from the previous government gets up and talks about social justice, we can just tell them that Agriculture-Advancing Australia is what social justice is about. The gold card for veterans is what social justice is about. Social justice is about what this government has delivered, which is the reduction of our debt, and fairness in our whole approach. What you will see from the government is one of the fairest packages that this government has ever put together. Mr Melham interjecting-",133,Representatives Main Committee

I look forward to taking up the cudgels again on another occasion. today to support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998, which is delivering yet another coalition promise. It will be a cost to revenue of approximately $20 million but, in effect, it amalgamates the old income equalisation deposit scheme and the farm management bond scheme, neither of which were working well. They were hardly used at all. They were so structured that they were virtually ineffective. In fact I will never forget that, when the Labor Party came to power in 1983 in the month of Marchbecause, two months down the track, in May, the Labor Party totally gutted almost every measure that the farming community enjoyed, one of which was the IED scheme. That scheme never worked after that. Peter Walsh was one of the driving forces in getting rid of that scheme. He is a former Labor member whom I do have some regard for and I enjoy reading his weekly comment in the Financial Review, but he did make a mistake in this area because that scheme was put in place to allow farmers in good years to provide for themselves in bad years, rather than calling on the taxpayer. After that scheme was done away with, some years down the track the Labor Party realised their terrible mistake when we had difficulties with the wool industry. They fiddled, prodded and poked with various measures to try to reinstate it, but none of them worked. I am pleased to say that, after 13 long years of Labor and within two years of a coalition government coming to power, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) has introduced a workable scheme back into the parliament. The farm management deposit scheme will be run by financial institutions, which is another refreshing change. Rather than the deposits being held by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, something I was always uneasy about, they will now be held by financial institutions. The FMDs will be a tax linked management tool and they will be much more commercially attractive than IEDs and farm management bonds ever were. They allow farmers to deal with the uneven income streams that are inevitable with agriculture-not only inevitable but very common, particularly over the last decade or so. Farmers will be able to set aside money in the good years-and we hope they return soon for the mainstream primary industries-for when farm income is low. So farm management deposits are to be used to complement other risk management strategies, such as putting away fodder in reserves, water conservation, diversification of income streams, forward selling and all these other tools they have had. Drought, very sadly, has been very common particularly in eastern Australia over the last 10 years or so and it has been a tragedy for primary producers, having gone through wool price collapses, beef price collapses and grain price collapses. Just about every commodity has gone",135,Representatives Main Committee

416,Mr Melham,It was a very good year.,136,Representatnes Main Committee
417,Mr Cobb,"It was a terrible year for the farming community and primary industry generallyThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4941 through difficult times and they have been exacerbated by drought. It almost seems that everything that could go wrong has gone wrong in the farming industry at some stage. The farmers have not been able to hold on to those dollars that they have been able to earn in the good years to provide for themselves in the bad years. As the previous speaker, the member for McMillan( Mr Broadbent), so eloquently put it, the pork industry is going through a very difficult time at the moment. All pork producers are losing money. The cost of pork production in this country is about $2 a kilogram in round figures, and they are getting at best $1.50 to $1.80 a kilogram. The new World Trade Organisation arrangements, whereby pork can come in from Canada, is worsening the situation, on top of the depressed world prices, on top of the depressed domestic prices and on top of consumers switching to beef because of the low prices. Fortunately, we have seen a sharp devaluation of the dollar over the last two, three or four weeks in particular-in fact, in recent months by 20 per cent against the Canadian dollar-and I think that will help our pork producers. The government has brought in other measures, of course, such as labelling laws. We have got those right after 13 years of the previous government doing nothing. We are addressing the freight costs and we have got interest rates down, so I think all of those things will help the pork industry-as they will help other primary industries as the months roll by. The farm management deposits will be available commercially through banks, credit unions, building societies and the like, but those other institutions which do not have the correct prudential requirements-such as pastoral houses-will not be available for these deposits. That is no reflection on pastoral houses, but I think the government has made the correct decision in this instance. The banks, particularly as time rolls by and they have some experience with managing this money, will be able to offer the farmers more choice and flexibility with what they do with that money. The interest that is earned will be at market rates on 100 per cent of the deposit. Under the old lED scheme, under the Labor Party, it was offered on only 61 per cent, and, on the farm management bonds that the Labor Party brought in, it was offered at 100 per cent for the first half of the total deposit limit-namely, 100 per cent on $150,OOO-and then it was reduced to 80 per cent on the next $150,000. Under our scheme, quite generously and properly, because it will simplify the administration of it, it will be on 100 per cent of the full $300,000. It is limited to $300,000 per taxpayer. So, in a farming family, if you have a couple in a partnership, or whatever, each individual will be able to deposit up to $300,000. If, for example, a husband and wife with a son struck a good year, as sometimes happens in the grain industry in the broadacre farming, they could put away up to $900,000, almost $1 million. So it makes it a very generous scheme in that regard. I acknowledge, in saying that, that there will be very few farmers in that position who will be able to put away such an amount of money; nevertheless, the opportunity will be there. If you do get a windfall year, as does happen in some primary industries from time to time, it mainly all goes through tax. It messes up your tax averaging for the next five years, and it is almost impossible to hold on to. So the reward for the effort that you put in over the bad years can never come to you, even when you get a good year. When you put the money in, it will not be taxable in the year that you deposit it. That, of course, is the beauty of the scheme: it will be taxable when it is withdrawn. Anybody who 4942 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 already has money in IEDs and FMBs can transfer, without any penalty whatsoever, that money into farm management deposits as soon as they start up. There will be certain limitations. For example, under the old farm management bonds, if you had an off-farm income of in excess of $50,000, you could not take advantage of these schemes. We have decided to keep that requirement, which I think is quite proper. So, if your non-primary production income is greater than $50,000, you will not be able to participate in this scheme, and I see nothing wrong with that. When you put deposits in, you cannot sort of put them in on 30 June and take them out on 1 July to avoid tax. You will have to put them in for a minimum of 12 months, unless you can demonstrate particular hardship. Again, I think that is a proper provision. Also you may lodge any moneys with only one financial institution, so you cannot have them scattered around-you will always get the odd person who will try to hide what they have put awaybut you can change from one financial institution to another, if you can demonstrate good reason to do so. When you withdraw, of course, there will be a 20 per cent withholding tax in the first instance, which is adjusted up or down when you finally pay your income tax. But that 20 per cent can be varied in times of hardship and could be waived in times of hardship. Of course, if later down the track when you do come to pay your tax at the end of the financial year it is seen that you have made a mistake in your calculations, there will be no penalty conditions applied to that. I think that is a generous and sensible provision, put in place by the government. There will, of course, be a $300,000 per taxpayer limit, as I have said. Companies, trusts, partnerships, et cetera, cannot participate in this scheme. However, any individual who is a member of a partnership or trust can participate in this scheme as an individual. Again, that is a proper provision. Overall, this is very well thought out. It is quite simple. It is relatively generous, and it has been done that way for proper reasons so that the scheme will work. I did compliment the minister for the wide consultation that he engaged in over the last 12 to 24 months before he brought this bill to the House. The coalition, in the short time we have been in government, has rapidly addressed many of the farming problems that we have inherited. Sadly, we are in a situation in this country today where 70 per cent of farmers in our proud farming community that made this country what it is are earning less than $20,000. That is an incredible situation when the average wage is of the order of $35,000 a year, I think. Some 70 per cent of our farmers who have made this country what it is today earn less than $20,000, and many of that 70 per cent are on negative incomes. This week I have been getting letters across my desk from pork producers, and they bring this fact home to me sharply. One fellow wrote to me only yesterday saying he had to borrow another $150,000 because his income will be many tens of thousands of dollars in the red this year. Even though he is contributing probably in excess of $100,000 of export income and on the domestic market-he is producing something worthwhile for the country-he is running a negative income of several tens of thousands of dollars and has had to borrow, yet again. That is a very sad situation indeed. But the coalition has done many things. We have straightened out the Austudy scheme to a great degree for country people. We have increased the ICPA allowances. We have given people in remote areas who cannot make an untimed local telephone call a $160 rebate each year, and I think we will improve that as the months roll by. We guarantee anyone in a remote Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4943 area that they will receive at least two mail deliveries a week. We have put in place things like the family restart scheme. We have put more generous provisions in place for the exceptional circumstances drought assistance. I well remember that, in my own electorate in the Cobar and Wilcannia areas and part of the Nyngan rural lands protection board, the previous government would not have those areas declared. No sooner were we in government than we got those areas declared and at least put bread on the table for the families in those areas that are contributing to Australia's income. We have put generous provisions in place, even in the last budget of a fortnight ago, for land care. We have done everything humanly possibly to straighten out the horrific problems of native title in this country. I know native title is off the agenda at the moment, but it is still out there in my electorate. There are 60 to 70 projects held up in the western division of New South Wales because the opposition, through their bloody-mindedness, will not pass it through the Senate. It is a tragedy. It is costing hundreds of jobs in the bush, including Aboriginal jobs. The Cobar Archery Club and the Broken Hill Field and Game Club could not even renew their leases, for heaven's sake. It is a shocking situation. A film crew wanted to go to Broken Hill to film, which would have provided $150,000 wages in the first week. They were turned away. So sad things like this are happening, which we are doing our best to address. This bill we are talking about today is part of that package of restoring sensible provisions for the bush, and I compliment the government on it. primary producers. is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Cobb), my parliamentary colleague and electorate neighbour.

It is a pleasure to sum up for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998, because this is really a great initiative of this government. I acknowledge the hard work that went into this by our minister who really has gained a tremendous tool for the farm sector to use. Had it been in place under the previous administration many primary producers in Australia today would be in a much better position, having been able to conserve their own cash reserves in better times, but, unfortunately, under Labor the scheme was totally gutted and was not tax effective. It certainly was not attractive, and that is borne out by the levels of deposits in the existing schemes. The member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) raised an issue in relation to contractors who may use their own farm equipment for, say, harvesting 01' hay making. I will not give an answer to the member for Kalgoorlie, but I will ensure that the minister does respond to this particular query relating to contractors.

Party by moving such amendments, because they are quite contrary to the intent of what the government is trying to achieve. This just demonstrates that the Labor Party has no-one on the other side of the House who understands agriculture, nor the needs of a modem agriculture sector in Australia. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bi111998 establishes the farm management deposit scheme, which is one of the most important elements of the government's integrated strategy to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable farm and rural sector. The rural sector is a vital part of our Australian economy. It accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for this nation's value adding food and fibre processing industries. However, the rural sector has faced unprecedented change in recent years, bringing new challenges and opportunities through globalisation of markets and international trade reform. The sector also has had to face devastating climatic conditions in some parts of the country and declining terms of trade. This has pushed many farm businesses in the rural sector to a very low point. Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, I know that, in your electorate, you are well aware of the plight of many farmers and the people in your own community. Many, tragically, in my own electorate and in many parts of rural Australia have not survived. Much has already been done by the government to position rural Australia to succeed in the years ahead. Of particular importance have been our efforts to return the federal budget to surplus, and the ongoing reforms, which have helped create the solid economic foundation supporting the maintenance of low inflation, and, very importantly for all Australians, continuing low interest rates. Lower interest rates have helped produce a situation which has put Australian farmers in a very competitive position. The Australian dollar is making our exports more attractive and also encouraging growth in our vital export industries. of the House. I remind the other side of the House that when the Labor Party was in government business indicator rates were 20.5 per cent. To service their debts and to meet the general business of living costs, lower interest rates have been a major benefit to our farm sector and all Australians. this nation in a very sound position to deal with the fallout from the Asian economic crisis. However, more is needed to take Australian agriculture into the future. The bill is about positively helping farmers towards financial self-reliance. The farm management deposit scheme is a key plank of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package and delivers on a major commitment given by the government prior to the last federal election. The scheme is a tax linked risk management tool that builds on the previous IED scheme and farm management bond scheme. However, the farm management deposits are an important",139,Representatnes Main Committee

The benefits of managing the economy have also putThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4945 risk management too] to help farmers deal with the uneven income streams so common in agriculture. Although they are not a panacea for the management of the many risks faced by farmers, farm management deposits will enable them to hold over pre-tax income from years of good cash flow and also be able to be drawn down in the years when additional cash flow is needed. They are a tax enhanced savings tool and can be used as a complement to other risk management strategies such as developing fodder and water reserves, financial planning, diversification, insurance, forward selling and also futures contracts. The previous schemes were amended after extensive consultation with rural industries and the financial sector, including the Australian Bankers Association. The initiatives have been receiving widespread endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers Federation. The new scheme will also be much simpler from a taxation perspective, and that is important. All deposits will now be treated the same way and will have a 100 per cent investment component on deposits totalling up to $300,000. Producers will no longer have to determine at the time of the deposit whether they wish to make an lED or an FMB deposit. The schemc is more appropriately delivered by the private sector where banks will compete for the deposits. That is also particularly important because it will, in many cases, encourage the banks to stay out there in rural Australia enabling them to attract these deposits. So it will be an incentive for our banks to stay in rural Australia. Any participating financial institution must be prudentially controlled or have a government guarantee so that eligible participants will include banks, credit unions and also building societies. This will ensure the security of the deposits held by financial institutions, including the taxation component of the deposits. In addition, the bill and regulations will specify a range of reporting requirements to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to ensure the accountability of the scheme. In the commercial arena, there wil1 be a range of financial institutions offering farm management deposits. Each institution will have specific products so depositors will have much more flexibility in the types of FMDs they can choose. For example, fanners may have a range of deposits with different terms and conditions or they can change to another institution for different products. This means that farm management deposits should appeal to a larger number of primary producers as they bettcr tailor the investment decisions to their particular circumstances. Currently, there are only two standardised products. They are the lED scheme or a farm management bond scheme. The availability and accessibility of the farm management deposits will improve as they will be offered through financial institutions which have substantial networks including in rural areas instead of being administered by a unit in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy here in Canberra. What this means is that producers will have closer contact with the managers of their funds and should find it simpler to make withdrawals and deposits with more personal explanations to clarify the terms and conditions. If farmers are in financial hardship, they may also apply to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for a deduction exemption certificate. If the department agrees that the farmer is in serious financial difficulty, the financial institution will not have to deduct-and this is important-20 per cent of the deposit on withdrawal. Financial difficulties will be assessed by the department against criteria similar to those which currently apply to the farm 4946 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 management bonds.

It is appropriate; it extends the scheme to the territories that are named. I commend the bill to the parliament. Bill 1998 is just another example of legislation this parliament enters into without any real concern for its end result. It was not entered into for any reason other than to promote the image of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) as a strong leader. It is true that there was an incentive when a madman, Mr Bryant, allegedly killed all those people in Tasmania. I must say in passing that I cannot understand why the governments-the federal government and the state government of Tasmania-are opposing a royal commission into the events of Port Arthur. I think there are some unanswered questions there. With an event so significant we should have a full and thorough investigation. It is quite clear that Mr Bryant exercised an expertise with that gun that would have required a lot of training. I do not quite see how Mr Bryant acquired that expertise, but it would be a good thing if we could find out. What happened when this sad event occurred was that the Prime Minister's advisers in Sydney said, 'Prime Minister, this is your chance to be seen as a strong leader-and to hell with the consequences.' It has been very divisive across Australia, as the National Party is about to find out in the Queensland election. If you look at the statistics since 1915 when records were first kept, the incidence of gun related violence in this country has been continually dropping; it is graphing downwards. Sadly, in the United States, it is going the other way at about two and a half times the rate of Australia. But, if you take out of contention just seven cities in the United States, the incidence of gun related violence in the United States is actually much lower than in Australia. Some of the states which have very low incidences actually allow people to keep concealable firearms. There are very low instances of assault. In Western Australia. I do not know the figures for other states but I am sure they are comparable-there has been an almost doubling of armed violence since this legislation came in. Do the government consider that this was a success? I am sure they do not but then they do not care because that was never the intention of the legislation. Its intention was to fulfil a desperate need felt by the Liberal Party at the time. The Labor Party was happy to follow it because the Labor Party always supports this sort of legislation. We are told what a great success the scheme was and that $500 million was raised with the Medicare levy. There is no doubt that far more lives would have been saved if that money had been put into the health system than is going to occur through this scheme. What has happened? People handed in guns that became illegal and then immediately went out and bought brand new guns that were expensive, adding to our current account deficit. So there has been a significant increase in the number of guns into Australia. Why is it that, for all the time that governments of either persuasion have had the power under the Customs Act to prohibit the entry of high-powered military rifles-they have always had that power-they have never taken any action? The sporting shooters do not require those guns. They have made that clear; they have said there should have been a ban on them. Those guns are basically inaccurate and are designed for killing people at short ranges. There is certainly no great need for them. We had a special category for military weapons, a very tightly controlled category, and there was never any trouble from people within that category. But the government had the power to act and it did not do it.",142,Representatives Main Committee
437,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (Ll.08 A.m.),"The National Firearms Program Implementation4948 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 I was talking to a gun dealer in Sydney who said, 'Look, I didn't agree with that but everyone else is doing it, so business is business.' He told me that most of his customers are Vietnamese. If you check the records, very few AK47 guns and AK47 look-alike guns have been handed in by the Vietnamese community in Sydney. I will bet London to a brick on that. So those guns are still out there-the very guns that are probably the ones that cause most concern. You had the stupidity of the Prime Minister refusing to allow 12 gauge semiautomatic shotguns, self-loading shotguns, which were choked to allow only two shots, to be used in competition. It is an absolute absurdity. The Prime Minister said in the House that it was his advice that the mechanism could be reversed. You can make a whole gun in a workshop. I was out in western New South Wales not so long ago and actually saw and handled automatic pistols made by farmers who were angry about what has happened. The initiative of the Australian people will not be thwarted by this sort of legislation. It is just a very costly absurdity which has divided society enormously. This legislation extends the buyback provisions to the islands and territories surrounding Australia. The facts are these: home invasion is a fast growing crime. I think it is awful when you cannot feel secure in your own home. In France, home invasion is not heard of; in France, you are allowed to have a gun for defence in your own home. It is a policy of Australia First that we will continually seek to amend this legislation until the right of defence in your own home is conceded. It is, in my view, an inalienable right that should never have been taken from the people of Australia. Now let us look at another absurdity. The government banned the sale of self-loading .22 calibre rifles. Most murders and most deaths were caused by a single shot. One of the largest causes of death was suicide in the rural sector. Banning the guns is not going to stop the suicides; fixing the economy is going to do much more for that. The reason people are driven to suicide is absolute desperation. So what does the government do? It bans guns. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd? The truth is this. I have used a self-loading .22 to shoot rabbits commercially. If you are shooting rabbits commercially, it is probably the only calibre you can use and the only type of gun that will make your operation successful. I have also used a repeating rifle, a bolt action 243, to shoot kangaroos, and that gun is still legal. I know that I used to zero that gun at 200 yards and, if I could not put the whole magazine through a cigarette packet at 200 yards, I would readjust it. I could do far more damage with that gun than anyone could possibly do with a .22. That is the absurdity of this. But we are a dealing with a Prime Minister and a bureaucracy that do not understand. I will warrant that three-quarters of the bureaucrats and all of the attorneys-general did not know the difference between an automatic rifle and a self-loading rifle. They called them all automatics. The difference of course is that an automatic will keep firing while you have your finger on the trigger. We had this action taken as a feel-good action, as I said. It is interesting that, while the idea was very popular in Sydney, its popularity diminished as you got further from Sydney. I believe that, had our state premiers had the nerve to demand a constitutional referendum, this legislation would not have passed. It would have passed in New South Wales because of the all-pervading effect of Sydney, but it certainly would not have passed in Western Australia, Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4949 Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland and probably Victoria. But those premiers, in my view, sold out by not forcing it to a referendum so that the people of Australia could decide. One of the important reasons why we need to introduce into Australia the concept of a citizen initiated referendum is so the people can have a say and so that they are not continually subjected to decisions made by a government which they have no opportunity to oppose because both parties have the same policy. Bipartisan politics basically destroyed any concept of democracy in Australia, and it must be replaced by CIR. If you look at the situation in Australia, there was a great clamour from the Labor Party to do away with the appeals to Privy Council. What happened? When there were appeals to Privy Council, our High Court was arguably the best appellate court in the world and I think it had a great record. But within a very short time after those appeals to Privy Council had been abolished, our High Court had become a bunch of social engineers. That is not the job of the High Court. It is a destructive process of government when the High Court is allowed to go down that way. It has gone down that path because of the vacuum left by the political parties. WhatI say is that citizen initiated referenda have the ability to reapply the intellectual vigour that was necessary to bring the High Court under control. It will be effective not only against politicians but against the judges and the bureaucrats. It is something we must have. I believe it will not often be used and it will be used decreasingly as these people realise the power of the people. I have faith in the people of Australia. I believe they can be trusted. It is quite clear from legislation like this that neither the government nor the opposition believe in the people of Australia. This legislation is indicative of a lot of stuff that comes into this parliament. It does no good, it is probably counterproductive and it costs. We have seen this cost. The government is admitting to this cost. The cost is significant. Had that money been put into new roads, it would have saved more lives. Had it been put into research, it could have saved more lives but, no, that was never the consideration. The concern was always to portray the Prime Minister as a great leader. When the present Prime Minister acceded to his position, I had faith in him. This was the first act that weakened that faith. Since then, I have seen successive acts from the Prime Minister which make me believe he is no longer worthy of support. It is about time this parliament got back to really representing the will and the feelings of the people of Australia. That cannot happen while we have legislation like this coming into the House, legislation which is supported by both parties and where there is no option for the alternative view to be heard. I know that I am wasting my time. This legislation is going to go through, but there will be a reckoning and I believe that reckoning will come in Queensland very shortly, where the people have already said, 'We have had enough of this draconian government.' Believe me, if Mr Beattie is elected to government, it will not be because the people have faith in him; it will simply be because they have no alternative. The people of Australia are going to resort to putting governments in and out in quick succession and that is going to lead to the instability and possibly the anarchy that you have seen happening in Italy. I will not be supporting this legislation, but then it will not need my support, unfortunately, to pass. thank the opposition for their bipartisan support for the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1998 and I anticipate, as the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) does,",143,Representatives Main Committee

This bill actually provides for the Commonwealth to provide funds for the territories of Norfolk Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island to implement the territories' surrender and buyback schemes in relation to firearms. It completes the buyback legislation across the whole of the Australian territories and it gives to the external territories the benefit of the buyback that has occurred throughout the rest of Australia in the months up to the middle of 1997. The member for Kalgoorlie has made a number of comments critical of the agreement reached on 10 May 1996 at the meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council on the uniform firearms laws and their effect. I do not propose to comment in detail on those. However, I can tell the member for Kalgoorlie that, if he has empirical evidence that there has been an increase in violence subsequently; if he has empirical evidence that there has been an importation of new guns at an increased rate since the uniform firearms laws; and if he has information relating to any particular community storing firearms illegally, I would like to see that. In relation to his suggestion that farmers have the capacity to make firearms that would not fit within the uniform firearms laws, that is undoubtedly true. If they do, in fact, exercise that capacity, as the member for Kalgoorlie would know, that would be illegal. The suggestion that the defence of the home with a firearm is an inalienable right is, in my view, unsustainable. I do not propose to say any more than that. He mentioned suicide in the rural sector. This is a matter of great concern to the government. It is a matter of great concern, I am sure, to all members of the House of Representatives, particularly those from rural and regional areas. There is a deal of research being done on that subject in a number of different places. OneI am pleased to have been associated with in a former existence is the TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, and I know that the Minister for Family Services( Mr Warwick Smith) has in his department a considerable focus on that subject. Firearms are not the only method by which people commit suicide, but they are a significant method, and the available research has demonstrated it has an impact on the number of suicides. The suggestion that bipartisan support of a measure destroys democracy is interesting, but I think we have democracy in action with the member for Kalgoorlie indicating his opposing views. It seems to me that democracy is alive and well even if it has, for him, the unfortunate consequence of bipartisan support depriving his vote of a vital effect. There has been very little said about the actual bill itself and its relationship to the external territories. I do not need to add to what I said in the second reading speech, and I commend the bill to the committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative.",145,Representatives Main Committee
439,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Forrest),"If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail,Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4951 Family and Community Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 19 November 1997, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the House take note of the paper. on this report. In another sense, I feel the enormous responsibility that this generation bears towards our younger generation. One feels, I suppose, more concerned about an issue like youth suicide and general suicide, I might add, in the community when one is a parent. In my own case, I have two sons--one has just turned 21 and one is not long 18. Through all the trauma of last week when I resigned from the Liberal Party, the thing foremost in my mind, more than anything else, was the welfare of my 18-year-old son because he is one of those young people who is very much struggling with his identity, struggling with trying to get a job and struggling with a direction. . As a parent, one feels an acute sense of concern at times about what is really going on in his mind, when I think that, at 18, I was three-quarters of the way through my apprenticeship. It was so easy to get a job in the 1960s, let us face it. When I left school at 15, I had an apprenticeship offered to me as a carpenter the Monday after I finished school on the Friday. I did not take it because I thought I needed a bit of a break from school. I was only 15, and I said, 'No.' But, having returned to school for a brief few weeks for grade 11 the following year, I decided that school was not for me and I walked straight into an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. Young people cannot do that today. That really is the core of the problem here. This is in no sense intended as a criticism of the report, but we have to look to the causes and the factors. The essential cause of this problem, the core reason perhaps, if I may say so, is the lack of employment opportunities for young people. I see it in my own electorate. I recall a very emotionally charged meeting just before the last federal election. Generally speaking, it was partisan political where people from one side were saying it was the other side's fault and the other side was saying it was the other side's fault. In the midst of that, the Salvation Army chaplain got up and said, 'Look, the real problem around here is unemployment. That is the problem. Get the employment situation right, get these young people into work, get them a direction, get them a goal, get them some opportunity to work for a living and plan a future where they can look forward to meeting a girl, falling in love, getting married and having kids and a home. That is when you'll give them something to look forward to.' That was the opportunity that I had as a young person, but it is not the opportunity that my sons have, especially my No.2 son-and I have two younger ones coming on. They do not have those opportunities. That is the concern of every parent and, I am sure, every parent in this House who has young children. What opportunities have we bequeathed to our young people? We need to come to terms with that challenge. We need to realise that that is the most fundamental thing of all-giving them a job, giving them something to aspire to, to move on to, and creating in their minds that a job is an honourable thing. There is a notion these days, which was not present in my day, that there is something wrong with working with your hands and that you really need to be in an office job somewhere,",146,Representatives Main Committee
440,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (11.26 A.m.),"I am, in one sense, pleased to be able to speak4952 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 sitting before a computer, doing something that is more of a professional job. The emphasis is put on having a professional job. We have nurses going back to university instead of doing their time as apprentices on the hospital floor. They are in university, they do one year in the wards and they call themselves nurses. They are not the nurses of old. People say that you need an education to get on in life-the emphasis being that an education is something you learn from other people-and that that is the way ahead, as opposed to working with tools, digging with a pick and shovel. While that might be seen to be menial, at least it is achieving something. Even to dig a hole and put a post in or build a fence, while it is labouring work, is an achievement. There is a notion around that somehow or other that sort of work is not as good. That is inculcated into young people, and young people are turned off by that a bit. People say that they are lazy. I do not think they are lazy; they are just turned off a bit. There is a notion that you have to jump right up to the top from the very first job you have. I know that some young people quite clearly think that is where they should be starting, rather than at the bottom. Then there is another group of young people who are working for nothing, frequently for months on end, just to get work experience. I am glad to say that I have had a couple of such young people through my office. I am not glad to say that they were working for nothing-I gave them money at times when I could-but the fact is that they moved on to other jobs. I am pleased to have made a small contribution in my own electorate to help some local young kids to move on. One is now working for Boral in a good job, but he worked for me on and off for six months b-fore that. We could all in our own small waysand I am sure many members do-provide that sort of guidance. I get back to this very important concept that a job is more important than anything else. In the midst of all of this, there are a couple of other points I want to mention. People are feeling alienation from the system, too. That alienation is being reflected in Queensland. I know of people very close to me who are saying that they are going to vote for One Nation in the Queensland election. They are not racist. They are just sick of the system. They feel left out of the system. It is no good saying that anybody who is going to vote for One Nation is a racist. They are not racist; they are sick of the system. A message is going to be sent to our political leaders on Saturday week stronger than any message that has been received in recent years; I guarantee it. People are going to be shocked and surprised at what is going to happen in Queensland in a week and a half. I can only say that that will be as a result of alienation. We have to recognise that. Young people are saying, 'I am going to vote for One Nation.' People who have never voted before are saying that, and they are saying that because they are alienated. They do not want a system that is leaving them out in the cold. They want a system that says, 'We are going to do something for you. We are listening to you.' I wish they would listen to people who do provide a reasonable way ahead. Unfortunately, they do not see that. They see those people as part of the system that they want to rebel against; the system that has not given them a job, that has not given them a future. That is what we, as members of parliament, have to remember. Another relevant point is the element of family breakdown and another that was identified in the report is a lack of spiritual direction for kids. There is no spiritual direction. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware of that. I do not want to sound like I am preaching at a Billy Graham crusade. If anyone needs converting, I do. But, believe you me, we had much more Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4953 spirituality in our community when we were younger; we could tum to religious figures if we were in trouble. I remember the broadcaster Hayden Sargent, who was a minister in the Church of Christ. He used to run coffee shops and things like that for young people to give them spiritual direction. Now we talk about counselling services. While they are genuine, it is a yearning for spirituality that we are seeing. These kids have no direction. They have no-one to tum to. I think some of us should say that there is a God that they can tum to, and that they should be doing that. Another issue is family breakdown. Frequently, our laws are hastening family breakdown instead of trying to prevent it. Instead of trying to nurture the family, our laws seem to be in a mad rush to disintegrate the family. Overall, I think the picture this report paints is one that needs addressing. It is not just me who is saying that; a lot of people are saying that. In all sincerity, let us get something done about jobs. It is easy to say that, but why aren't we addressing that issue? As I have said before in this House, we need major capital works programs in this country to get these sorts of jobs going, to get the economy moving. Even if it means spending money to do that, the net result will be far better, and the social result from that sort of spending will prevent the costs associated with the downside-the absolute fortune spent on prisons and the dreadful impact of suicide on families. I commend the report, and I do recognise the members of this committee as genuine, decent people, trying to strive to come up with something that will help Australian society. issue which affects many people throughout Australia, none more so than the residents of one of the towns in my electorate of Gilmore, the residents of Bundanoon. Before preparing to speak on this issue, whilst concerned, I knew little about youth suicide. But just recently I discovered my own electorate was amongst the worse affected and did not know how to do anything about it. I must admit that I thought twice about relating this story to the parliament. However, in deciding to do so, I felt that you, my colleagues, could also be affected by the tragedy that has occurred and which we must all face as community representatives. Bundanoon is a close knit rural community situated in the southern highlands. Its 1,800 residents have regular routines-working, visiting their families, relaxing in retirement, working for the community, meeting socially, looking after each other's children and each other, and lobbying the local council on issues they feel will affect them and their families. In fact, I am immensely proud of the residents of Bundanoon in the work they have achieved as a community. It was also my privilege to have served these residents as a former councillor of the Wingecarribee Shire and in my former role as tourism manager some years ago and now as their federal member. Bundanoon could be like any other rural community in Australia except the residents are reeling from the suicide of five people in recent months and possibly a sixth person in the neighbouring town of Exeter. This has left the town dazed and confused, asking why and searching for answers. To give other members a sense of what the community is going through, I would like to quote from a newspaper article which appeared in the local paper at the time of the first suicides. The paper stated: No-one knows for sure why sleepy Bundanoon has been hit with an extraordinary wave of suicides. The reason for one death was clear enough-the 77-year-old business man was in failing health.",147,Representatives Main Committee
441,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (11.37 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on the issue of youth suicide, an4954 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 One other victim in his 30s was soon to be retrenched, but, apparently, was optimistic about his future. The youngest victim, 19, had a secure life and a bright future. He was nothing like the stereotyped young suicide victim. He was working with his dad in the family tree-clearing business and he was popular. He had prospects, money in the bank, and the support of his mum, dad and older sister ... but none of that was in his mind when he killed himself. In Bundanoon there seem to be few answers. All victims were known to each other. Two were the best mates who took their lives just 11 days apart, yet so far there is no common link and it still remains a mystery. Hundreds of local residents gathered at the public meeting to discuss their feelings and concerns for their community. I commend the organisers for their initiative and the residents who attended for the bravery and care during such a difficult time for them. While it is recognised that not all the victims were young people, the impact of any suicide on family members, friends and even acquaintances and strangers in a small community can be enough to destroy their confidence and make them question their own judgments and lives. I do not believe that federal politicians have a role to play in intruding on the grief of the residents of Bundanoon. However, I believe we have a responsibility to do what we can to make sure it does not continue. As you are all aware, Australia has the fifth highest male suicide rate of all developed countries across all age groups with an average of 18 people in every 100,000 taking their own lives, a crisis in anyone's language. What was once a taboo subject to be ignored at all costs and certainly not mentioned in public is now one of the biggest killers of our young people. The recent Australian youth forum held in Canberra and attended by young delegates from all over Australia listed youth suicide as one of the top 10 issues facing young Australians today. Many of you would be aware of the recommendations which came out of that forum. However, I believe it is necessary to highlight some of them because this is the voice of young people talking in their own words. The underlying message was that greater education awareness programs were needed to reduce the number of young people who felt the need to take their own lives. The recommendations included continued government funding for essential suicide prevention services; ensuring adequate counselling was available in schools, universities and workplaces; implementing programs in the school curriculum which emphasise the importance of companionship, mentoring, communication, self-value and self-esteem; and increasing a positive image of young people in the media which is identified as being very important for improving the self-image young people have. One of the most interesting comments to come out of the youth forum recommendations on youth suicide was that society must learn to shift its focus from the material to the ethical and to emphasise values, not value, and to assist in lowering the unrealistic expectations which currently burden Australia's young people and which are seen as a direct contributor-to youth suicide. As one young American youth worker commented at the forum: The thing I've noticed here in Australia is that kids are very down on themselves almost as if you train your kids that way like you're saying 'Try and be the same as everyone else, don't excel, don't stand out, just get by.' The youth worker went on to say: Without the encouragement to achieve something, what can they do? Most rural kids don't have a hope. City kids are overloaded. Country kids are trapped-both feel the other location is the answer. Neither Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 4955 are right. Well meaning people who help them, particularly in the country areas, burn out after a few years. Already action is being taken by people in the community and I am fortunate enough to represent an electorate which is quick to help itself. Prior to the Bundanoon tragedies, a resident of nearby Burrawang was already working on a video which focuses on youth suicide. Film producer Jan Howe's video looks at ways of promoting high self-esteem in young people as well as ways to help others identify signs of suicidal depression. The video is unique in that it is aimed at youth helping youth and draws on a wide range of not only expert opinion but also youth experience which is vital to get the message across to all people in the community. In a recent review Jan Howe said that one of the most important things was harnessing the energy of young people to help other young people. She said: They want to Lead, to do, to achieve. They say they want not only to make a difference but they want to be involved in making it happen. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jan for her initiative and to urge all members to support any efforts by Australians to combat this ever increasing epidemic. I would now like to take up the point on where we as individuals and as community representatives can improve the image that the community and young people have of themselves, because I think that is fundamental to helping young people look for an alternative to suicide. You can throw all the money in the world at the problem, but it will not improve the situation if the underlying issue is one of lacking a sense of purpose and vision. Through the media we get negative images of young people. This can only be described as a reflection of ourselves and the vision we are offering them for the future. According to Captain David Woodbury of the Salvation Army, hope is one of the biggest motivators which can lift a person out of despair. 'If we are to reverse the alarming youth suicide rate,' he says, 'then we must give young people something worth believing in, a conviction that the future will be better than now.' Many young people are cynical about their future and the society we have created for them by our decisions. This is something which I believe contributes to giving young people a very limited set of options and to leaving them feeling abandoned. In Australia today more than 2,000 deaths a year are recorded as suicide. In men aged 15 to 24, the rate is currently in the vicinity of 25 to 30 per 100,000 people. You would have heard many theories about why this is so: some of them will have considered the fact that young people are looking for attention in a world that moves too fast to make an impact; another would be that, as a society, we no longer have initiation rites for young men, so they take to challenging themselves and each other in extreme situations such as street racing and gangs. There is no simple explanation for the horrific youth suicide rate, except to say we have failed our young people. Since 1943, the youth suicide rate amongst men has risen while suicide amongst young women has remained relatively stable but still at an unacceptably high five per 100,000 people. A number of studies have been produced that identify high risk groups such as those with a mental illness, rural and remote residents and indigenous Australians. Yet we have not been able to stop the tide. A 1992 survey of teenagers in Victoria found that more than five per cent of year 11 boys and 15 per cent of year 11 girls reported having thoughts about suicide in the week before the survey. In Western Australia, 23.5 per cent of 15to 16-year-olds 4956 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 surveyed by the Child Health Group had reported often considering suicide in the previous six months. There are a number of reports which suggest evidence that copycat suicides may impact heavily on some young people, while the death of a close friend can also have the opposite effect on others. All in all, the most staggering figure to be reported is the cost of suicide. Measured in years of potential life lost, from 1983 to 1992 the number of years lost is estimated to be more than 230,000 years. That is 230,000 years of effort and energy which our young people, who would have eventually grown older, should have contributed to the community. It is 230,000 years which the community would have no doubt benefited from in terms of experience, commitment and dedication. And this figure does not include the lives of the children these young people may have had, or grandchildren, and their eventual impact on our communities. The May 1997 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled Aspects of youth suicide recommended that a National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention be established to advise the minister and government. This could be combined with a recent suggestion by Dr Brendan Nelson, the member for Bradfield, to create a separate department and ministry for youth, with youth representatives providing advice-a proposal I fully support. The report also recommended that funding be targeted to the most effective areas and that a comprehensive education campaign be established to prevent youth suicide. We, as leaders of the community from all sides of the political arena, have done everything we should have in terms of reports, reviews and recommendations. Where we have failed our young people is in changing attitudes so that our perceptions of their future are reflected back to us in the most appropriate, enthusiastic and opportunistic way. One way we may be able to arrest this is through the initiative of organisations such as Here for Life, which is hosting The Australian People's Forum on Youth Suicide at Old Parliament House on 10 and 11 August 1998. The theme of the forum is 'Partnering with the community to understand and prevent' and it asks the question: with one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world, are we really the lucky country? The Australian people's forum is a chance for people from all areas of the wider society to voice their ideas and opinions and to bring together representatives from the community to better understand the issue of youth suicide and to develop workable solutions to prevent this problem. I would like to conclude by returning to where I started, to a place close to my heart and to a place which is recovering from the impact of such tragedies-Bundanoon. The public meeting which attracted hundreds of local residents considered a detailed action plan to cope with the past and to move on from the tragedy. The action plan, largely written by the Anglican minister, Reverend Wayne Tildsley, draws on the community spirit of the Bundanoon community. It involves counselling sessions, community gatherings, relationship enrichment seminars for couples, and advice for parents and teenagers. Reverend Tildsley said a process of reconciliation had begun. It started with people reconnecting with each other, and accepting each other without judging them or trying to change them or even to offer solutions. I believe that, if we are to have a chance to help our young people, we need to be able to reconnect with them and to give them a feeling of sovereignty over what is also their community and their nation, but most of all-their home! chairman of the committee that produced this report.",149,Representatnes Main Committee
442,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Forrest),"I call the honourable member for Fisher, theThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4957 Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the most satisfying aspects of my tcnure as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, prior to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) asking me to take on the role of Government Whip, was the seminar on youth suicide which we were able to organise in this very chamber early last year. The problem of youth suicide is a bipartisan issue. The Prime Minister himself indicated the gravity of this social problem confronting our nation by opening the seminar. We realise that politicians do not have a monopoly on good ideas and common sense, so we invited a wide range of people who were fighting this social evil at the coalface to attend a seminar on youth suicide. People from community groups right around the nation came and gathered in this room along with members of the committee-I would like to recognise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the deputy chairman of that committee-to pool our collective ideas and our experience. We also invited four key presenters to attend: Dr James Harrison, the Director of the National Injury Surveillance Unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; Associate Professor Pierre Baume, the Director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention; Professor Robert Kosky, the director of the psychiatric department at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital; and Dr Meg Smith OAM, the Chairman of the Youth Suicide Prevention Advisory Group. Firstly, eaeh of these four key presenters outlined aspects of youth suicide and their experiences and brought forward some suggested solutions. We then had questions to the presenters from members of the committee and other parliamentary colleagues who were present. Then in the aftemoon, in a very interesting development, the parliamentarians present moved back and the community representatives came forward to participate in a round table discussion. I must say that the recommendations by the committee were unanimous and non-partisan. They recognised that govemments of both political colours have sought to fight youth suicide, and that the previous government had a program and the new government has a program. But at the end of the day, we need to do more-not necessarily spend more, but we need to have a more effective solution to this major social problem. That is why I am particularly pleased at the government's response to the summary report which was lodged in the parliament last year. The Minister for Family Services( Mr Warwick Smith), like everyone else in the parliament, is exceptionally concerned about the ongoing tragedy of youth suicide. There were a number of recommendations made by the committee. The key recommendation was that a National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention be established to provide strategic advice to the minister and the government on youth suicide prevention and related matters. Also, within six months of its establishment, the council should produce a comprehensive three-year work program to be reviewed and updated annually and the council should report annually on progress in meetil1g the objectives in its work plan. A recommendation was also there for the secretariat to be provided by the Department of Health and Family Services. A further recommendation related to the need for the council to be responsible for creating appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation between governments at the community, state and territory as well as federal levels.",152,Representatives Main Committee
443,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.50 A.m.),"by leave-Thank you very much for that attribution,4958 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 I am very pleased that the minister has agreed to set up the National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention. The minister has been particularly receptive and the government is now seeking nominations for the council from state and territory governments and it is aiming to ensure that nominations include broad expertise and representation from stakeholders within the government and community sectors. I am sure you will agree with me, and also share my hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that some of the people who participated in our seminar could have a role to play on the National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention. One thing that came through to us very clearly from the seminar was that very effective work was being done at the grassroots community level but, in many respects, the ideas and what was being discovered in various areas were not being shared so what we needed was much better coordination. We must make sure that we did not reinvent the wheel in different parts of the nation but that we pooled our collective experience so we can solve and fight this growing social problem. The council will be carrying out that role. r was also very pleased that the existing Youth Suicide Prevention Advisory Group agreed with the need for a ministerial level council to provide better capacity for policy input and coordination of youth suicide prevention across Australia. So this is not a council coming in on top of what is already there; it is a cooperative approach which has been drawn from the collective experience of so many people who have fought youth suicide around the nation for so many years. The other priorities which were looked at very favourably by the government are contained in the summary report tabled in the parliament. The House of Representatives standing committee, I believe, has done an outstanding job with respect to the seminar on youth suicide prevention. It was not meant to be a talkfest but an opportunity where people from around the country who had a contribution to make were able to do so. As an aside, I would like to recommend that more of our committees should have one-day seminars. I know that just prior to my relinquishing the position as chairman of the standing committee, we had organised to have a seminar on men's health, which subsequently proceeded"" and that was also very successful. Unfortunately, there is a perception about politicians in the country that, whenever the government suggests something, everyone on the other side of the House disagrees. Often, as in this matter of youth suicide, there is a pooling of ideas. We do have people from across the political spectrum who feel very strongly about issues confronting our young people and, to be honest, we cannot as a nation be proud of the fact that in 1995 some 350 young males committed suicide, as did 84 young females. I must say that I was personally shocked to hear that people as young as 12, even younger, have contemplated taking their own lives. While governments have endeavoured to solve the problem in the past, regrettably, the rate of suicide continues to increase. The summary report, which I commend to anyone who has not read it, highlighted the magnitude of the problem confronting Australia. The summary report was unanimously supported by all members of the committee. The government considered the summary report in very great detail. There was a change of minister during that process and the new Minister for Family Services has brought forward what I believe is a very strong and effective response which largely implements the recommendations of the committee. The way in which this seminar, the report and the government response have been handled is a vindication of our committee system in the parliament. We have gone out there and sought ideas from those who had something to offer. The report was tabled in the parliament and the Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4959 government has now responded, largely implementing the recommendations in the report. I would like to commend all members of the committee, the parliament, the government and the minister on bringing forward this new national response to youth suicide. I hope that the appalling statistics that confront us in the media regularly will be no more. on this report, including those who are not members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Youth Affairsdone by this committee. I also would like to compliment the previous chair, the member for for being the deputy chairman. There are congratulations all around on the importance of this issue to all Australians and the priority that it has been given in this particular instance. Statistics of suicides, particularly youth suicides, as we know, are alarming. One of the saddest things about the suicide statistics is that they are probably lower than the actual figures because they do not necessarily represent the true picture. In many cases, suicides are officially recorded as deaths of some other nature. Sometimes this is to protect the victim's family and friends from further trauma and sometimes because the deaths have been identified as accidental. This can happen when the cause of death appears to be an accidental overdose, for example, a car accident, a drowning and other similar sorts of accidents. I understand this point was made to the committee by Dr James Harrison during the seminar held last year. Also alarming, and also not portraying an accurate picture, are the statistics on attempted suicide. Similarly, many attempted suicides are covered up to protect other parties, or they appear as narrow escapes from accidents or accidental overdoses, for example. This report notes that accurate figures on attempted suicide are almost impossible to obtain but suggests that, for every death resulting in suicide, there are probably 10 admissions to hospital for attempted suicide. But, of course, there are those suicide attempts which do not end up in hospital and are, therefore, not recorded. Such is the impossible task of accurately portraying the prevalence of suicide in our community. Statistics given at last year's International Association of Adolescent Health Pacific Rim Conference showed that, for example, in my state of Western Australia more than four people every week committed suicide in the past year. Our state coroner has said that, in Western Australia, suicide is the highest contributor to non-natural death. A federal government commission report, the Research and consultation among young people on mental health issues, stated that two out of five young Australians knew someone who had tried to commit suicide, but more shocking than that is the fact that one in 20 had attempted to commit suicide themselves. These are all very gloomy statistics, and really there is no good news on this matter; this is an issue which does not presently have anything positive about it. Hopefully, a decrease will be imminent, and this would be positive, but currently there is nothing but bad and worse news regarding our youth suicide problem in Australia.",153,Representatives Main Committee

449,Mr Randall,"Chairman. I believe congratulations go to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick,4960 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 Since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicide has almost trebled. The rate of young female suicide has doubled. Children as young as 12, as the previous member has reported, have attempted suicide. I recall reading last year that a I O-year-old boy also had attempted suicide. This was a child, not a youth, who lived in a rural area, which, of course, is a general area where suicide is most prevalent in Australia. In my own electorate of Swan, approximately one-third of the population is made up of people aged between 15 and 24. I see on a regular basis the effect of youth suicide and attempted suicide on the families and friends, and some of them are former students of mine, which is even more saddening. I am also a father of two young children, and I fear for what they will see and what would lead people they know to have suicidal thoughts. Naturally, I pray it does not touch my own family. I have a self-interest. But I do not claim to have any greater concern on this issue than anyone else in this House or anyone else in the community. We are all touched by it, and we all have an obligation, an absolute responsibility, to our young people-and to the futurc of our country-not to fail them but to make them want to stay here, to be alive and to bc with us. The Aspects of youth suicide report reiterates, through its expert findings, the causes commonly found to contribute to youth suicide, and these have been split into, broadly, two areas: global and personal. Global factors include social triggers such as high divorce rates, high youth unemployment, low church and religious participation, high female unemployment and a high number of unwanted pregnancies. Social factors include things like the loss or death of a family member or friend, divorce or other major family upheaval, relationship break-up, geographical or emotional isolation, drug abuse, which is a huge factor, confusion over sexuality, particularly in the case of homosexuality, and contagion, or what I call copycattingthat is, emulation of heroes who have suicided, such as notable people such as Michael Hutchence recently. With respect to copycat suicides, the government's action of developing a media resource kit on the reporting and portrayal of youth suicide is certainly a step in the right direction. This has been done in consultation with the media and health sectors, and, with the prevalence of copycat suicides, it is an imperative measure. I cannot stress cnough, though, that responsible reporting and sensitive handling of the news of suicide is so very important. These global and social triggers are not the definitivc list. Sadly, there are more. Thankfully, many of these triggers can be experienced without lcading to suicide. But we as parents and responsible adults in a community facing increasing confusion and upheaval need to be aware of the potential impact., of these types of situations on our youths. I am pleased to see the importance placed by the committee on education on depression because it is the absolute point of no return that leads our young people to feel there is no other way out. As the report suggests, there is a need for young people to be educated in constructive and positive problem solving techniques. I agree with one of the recommendations of the report in relation to this: rather than drawing attention to suicide prevention as a strategy, a focus should be placed on depression. This would give greater targeting of the cause rather than the effect. I belicvc that, if our young people were reassured that depression was curable, their perception of suicide as the only way out could well be reduced. But, as I mentioned, this is up to all of us. We all need to recognise depression and its symptoms and to know how and where help is available. This will be more achievable if depression becomes less stigmatised. I am also of the opinion that this course of education Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4961 about depression must involve counselling at every possible comer. There is very little merit, in my view, of prescription of antidepressants to our youths if they, as young inexperienced people, are not given expert psychological advice and assistance to get them through a crisis which has led them to severe depression or to an attempted suicide in the first place. Depression has also been accepted by the government in the context of the committee's recommendation, and a lot of work is being done here also. I wholeheartedly support the committee's recommendation to better coordinate existing bodies dealing with youth suicidethis was also mentioned by the committee chairman, who spoke previously-so that an expert body can be formed. The federal government has accepted this recommendation and an appointed body is being created to enhance the coverage and coordination of youth suicide activity across the country. The government is also establishing the National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide. The work of the committee has been very comprehensive on this most sensitive of issues. The committee has concluded that the issue of youth suicide needs to be opened up. Study, acceptance and understanding of depression needs to be opened up to help us as a community deal with the issue and, hopefully, contribute to a marked reduction in the number of attempted suicides and suicides. I am personally grateful to the committee for the great work that they have done, and I will certainly follow these recommendations with interest. Therefore, I naturally wholly endorse the committee's report. Speaker Quick, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Youth Affairs for this particular report. I find the report quite valuable to those who are dealing with this particular area. I fully endorse most of the recommendations. What is the problem of youth these days? I am too old to recognise how young people operate these days. I can only relate to some instances in my own youth. I had a number of friends who committed suicide-two, in fact. One was a brother of a dear friend of mine. The question is: how do you rationally understand an irrational act? That is pretty hard to do. In Cowan, for a number of young people I speak to there are enormous pressures upon them. They have problems associated with their families. They have problems associated with dealing with the community, having access to the community, having access to the decision making processes of the community. They feel a bit ostracised from the community. They also have great demands placed upon them in relation to education and work. Over the last 20 years or so there seems to be a different attitude within the community as to how we deal with our youth, in particular, work opportunities for them. We have a greater emphasis on education, which is rightly so. However, we tend to put too much emphasis on education and not enough emphasis on moving into employment fields. When I left school at 16 there was a huge amount of opportunity for young 16-year-olds. There is not that opportunity anymore. I spoke to a 16-year-old girl doing work experience in my office recently. She knew someone who had attempted suicide. As I say, a dear friend of mine recently was contemplating it as well. I asked her why she thought this young person had taken such a drastic step and she said that it was because of the stress that this particular person was under. She felt that the pressure from her peers and society in general to achieve was so great that it pushed her beyond the brink. The 16-year-old also said that the high number of single parent families and families with step parents were also to blame. These children missed out on something, coming from a broken home.",155,Representatives Main Committee
450,Mr Richard Evans (Cowan) (12.09 P.m.),"Firstly, I want to commend you, Mr Deputy4962 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 That is a cry that I hear in my office almost daily, in particular, from people associated with the Child Support Agency. A man came into see me, and my staff and I were very concerned about him, to talk about his family and the stress that he was under. It seemed to us that he was about to take his own life, and we had to bring in the authorities down to look after him. So in Cowan there is a high concern about families and the destruction of them through whatever means, but we do not seem to be supporting them in the community as much as we could. The young girl I was talking to, who was doing work experience in my office, related that story about the pressures in the community. Clearly, the high incidence of family breakdown can be attributed, in part, to the pressure of parents today to make ends meet, to pay off mortgages and meet their financial commitments. This young person I spoke to also believes that pressure on her peer group of those final years of high school and the process of sitting formal exams is also to blame. As she said, the competition to get into university or any further education is so great today that school children need to achieve at a high level just to be competitive. I say to the policy makers that we really need to start addressing youth affairs in a different way. The facilities available in Cowan for young people are scarce. I have called upon local government and the state government to address these issues. We need to really be thinking about youth issues more clearly. They are an important part of our community, and it seems to me that we do not necessarily treat them with much seriousness. The coalition government has recognised that not all teenagers want to go to university and that some teenagers are unable to achieve the grades required to gain entrance. In the last 18 months we have worked hard to provide alternative types of training and options once a teenager leaves high school to alleviate some of the pressures that our young people are feeling. We are providing opportunities. There are a number of groups which are earmarked in the report as those at higher risk of attempting suicide in Australia. They include: those who live in rural and remote areas, particularly males; those of Aboriginal descent, particularly males-and I have had a number of Aboriginal males within my electorate who have committed suicide-and those suffering from mental illness. In young males over 16 in Australia there has been an increase in death from hanging. I am gravely concerned that Australia's rate of suicide compared with other countries is in the high range. This is how irrational thinking about this is. You try to understand rationally why people in Australia, such a great country as it is, are committing suicide. You cannot understand an irrational act rationally, I am sure. There are a lot of things that we can do. There are a number of things that the federal government is providing. I would like to see them provide more opportunities for young people, but they are recognising some areas and working on them. These areas include $6 million for rural and regional youth counselling services, $6 million to Lifeline and Kids Helpline for telephone counselling services, $3 million for programs for parents, $2 million for education and training professionals in education and medical fields, and a fUlther $1 million for research into childhood mental health and factors contributing to adolescent suicide. As the report so starkly shows, it appears that, despite the government's best efforts, we are still missing the point. The difficulty in building an effective program is recognising the major factors that affect suicidal people. If the money we are funnelling into research into youth suicide is not making an impact, then we must spend the money more wisely. Thursday, 4 June] 998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4963 I give another example. Mr Andrew Hoare from the Wanneroo accommodation service and I have spoken many times about youth homelessness and the impact that has on young people and the desperation that a lot of these young people in the electorate have. I am very concerned about youth homelessness. I mentioned a report in the last parliament on that particular issue. Youth homelessness exists in my electorate, I am sorry to say. To say that we can solve it by doing certain things is difficult, because there are no easy solutions. With youth homelessness there are people that are abused, there are those that abuse the system and there are those that do not know what they want. A lot of the suicides that we have in our area come from these particular demographics. I will end my remarks there. However, I do want to say a couple of final points about my own electorate. I have an area with increasing numbers of children. I have an increasing youth area with a teenage population. I am concerned about the lack of facilities available for these young people. Sure the traditional things are there, but, when it comes to community support for these traditional institutions such as the Boy Scouts and sporting groups and other groups, they are not getting the community support from other parents. It is almost into a crisis state in Cowan. I am trying to work with the local council to improve the facilities there. We are going to have a bit of a crisis I think in a couple of years in Cowan with our young people regarding facilities. I hope it does not lead to frustration and lack of hope and opportunity as to what was so rightly identified by the report for these young people to take the ultimate step in taking their life, because they do have a future in Australia. This young generation is the future of Australia. As legislators and as older Australians we all have the responsibility to ensure that they participate in our community. in this parliament who have not been touched in one way or another by an incidence of youth suicide either through dealing with our constituents or maybe through our children's peer groups or perhaps directly through our families. I know that I, on being told on one occasion of a youth suicide, along with many others, have expressed dismay and have questioned what occurred in the life of that young person that so overwhelmed them that they were driven to the tragic step of ending their life. Last year I attended the funeral of a young girl who prematurely ended her life. The palpable pain and disbelief of the parents as they searched for an answer to their daughter's death was really quite heart-rending. They, like many other families affected by youth suicide, need to know that compassionate and responsible measures are being taken to combat the rising incidence of youth suicide. I would like to commend the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for its report, Aspects of youth suicide. I would plead that the report will not be left to gather dust on the parliamentary shelves, and I do not believe it will, but it is important that its recommendations will be acted on in a constructive and coordinated way. We need to remind ourselves of the facts and dimensions of the problem. In 1995, suicide was the recorded cause of death for 2,366 Australians. Of those deaths, 1,871 or 79 per cent involved males. Of these, 355, or 19 per cent, were young men aged under 25. That is almost one death a day for almost every day of the year. I believe that, at present, the highest risk age range for suicide of males appears to start at about school leaving age and continues into early middle age.",157,Representatnes Main Committee
451,Mr Nugent (Aston) (12.18 P.m.),"It would be fair to say that there would be few of us4964 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 Suicide rates for females in 1995 were much lower than for males. There were 495 female suicide deaths recorded. Seventeen per cent of those-that is, 84-were under 25 years of age. ABS figures show that in 1995 suicide was the fourth leading cause of premature death in Australia following cancer, heart disease and accidents. Furthermore, whilst suicide represented six per cent of all causes of premature death in 1983, it has risen to 9.2 per cent in 1995. So it has gone up by 50 per cent in percentage terms. These are of course disturbing figures. Even more disturbing is the fact that they are not finite figures. The rate of completed or attempted suicides in Australia is generally recognised as higher than reported due to a number of factors such as under reporting, not officially recording suicides in order to protect the victim's family or perhaps not recognising the suicide due to the nature of the death. It may be drug overdose related or single person car accidents. According to the report, hospital statistics show that for every death resulting from suicide there are 10 admissions to hospital for attempted suicide. Again, these figures do not represent the numbers of attempted suicides in reality because many are not admitted to hospital or do not seek help in any form. It is also generally recognised that factors linked to youth suicide are numerous and complex. The committee concluded that young people who suicide fall into several main categories, the higher risk categories being: those who live in rural and remote areas, particularly males; those who are of Aboriginal descent, particularly young men again; those young people suffering a mental illness; those who have access to lethal means, such as young males in rural areas having access to firearms; those who have previously attempted suicide; and those who are confused about or ostracised because of perhaps their sexuality. In the 1996-97 budget, the national youth suicide strategy provided $19 million over three years to be spent on a number of measures including rural and regional youth counselling services, telephone counselling services specifically for young people, programs for parents, education and training programs for professionals, and $1 million for research specifically into childhood mental health and factors which lead to adolescent suicide and attempted suicide. Whilst much is being done to help prevent the incidence of youth suicide, obviously more needs to be done. The committee made a number of recommendations in the report, including the establishment of a National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention and with a research advisory committee complementing the work of the council. Development of a depression awareness campaign for young people, adoption of standard procedure for hospitals when treating young people who present with attempted suicide or self-harm injuries, a review of current funding and redirection of some funds to more appropriate and better targeted programs, and ensuring consistency in data collection at all levels of government were also priority recommendations of the report. Given that the rise in youth suicide rates cannot be explained by a single issue or cause but is a combination of a number of complex and diverse factors such as family discord, isolation and depression, finding a solution to the problem will not be easy. It is not just a matter of providing more funding but of ensuring a coordinated approach to suicide prevention between national and state bodies with both state and federal government working in close cooperation and with consultation. The cost to the community of this premature loss of life is enormous. Apart from the impact on the family and peers, the estimate for years of potential life lost due to suicide was more than 230,000 for the period 1983 to 1992 alone. Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4965 We, as a government, have a responsibility to do something about this dreadful situation. We have the opportunity to take future positive steps to reduce this premature loss of life-and I hope that we do-effectively and efficiently and to make a long-term commitment. When we do that and as we do that, I know we will have the support of the opposition. life by walking out onto the highway and into the path of oncoming traffic. Weeks before, Julie's schoolteacher suspected something was wrong when Julie asked a lot of questions about domestic violence during a police presentation at the schoo!. These suspicions were reinforced when Julie was caught smoking marijuana before school and then later found semi-conscious in the school toilets with half a bottle of whisky beside her. Despite exhibiting these signs indicating she was suffering from emotional trauma, no-one was there for Julie when she needed help. Like Julie, Allen also exhibited potential suicide signals. Allen was a keen school student and sportsman but he started to fall into disruptive behaviour patterns. The school guidance officer became so concerned about his behaviour that she contacted his family. But they more or less told her to 'get stuffed'. Allen subsequently died from a drug overdose. Even though a couple of people sensed the growing anguish these kids were experiencing, their effOlts to help counted for nothing. What measures can we as a community take to get to these young people before they reach this crisis point? Today and on other occasions we have had many speakers referring to the statistics of youth suicide. However, I would like to take a more positive approach, especially as the statistics are so horrific. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I have discussed the issue of youth suicide with organisations and individuals who deal with this tragedy on a regular basis. I believe we need to develop a more coordinated and supportive approach from peers, friends, teachers, authority figures and workmates. People in our community need to be made aware of suicidal behaviour before the health system can respond. I am inspired by the efforts of thousands of people across Australia who work so hard in the search for a solution to this youth suicide epidemic. Many positive programs are being put into place. One community network is a pilot project known as the Here for Life youth suicide prevention project set up in Logan city in the south of Brisbane. This project targeted youth and provided a support network where potential suicide cases were detected. The Here for Life's local community youth strategy plan was very successful in Logan city, and I would like to inform the House about some of the positive feedback they received. The youth health services workers are now referring many of their clients to GPs in the network. Gaining access to general practitioners is now much easier. Police officers are able to contact local community health centre volunteers when they are confronted by young people who are threatening suicide. GPs are contacted by school guidance officers regarding ex-patients. Guidance officers can inform the doctors when the students are displaying odd behaviour. In one case, a youth worker was called to assist an 'at risk of suicide' single mum with three children-mum only wanted to be seen by a GP, and the youth worker contacted the GP network. These results from this type of support are what is needed within the community. They are a very positive indication that a network can function effectively in the referral and management of youth at risk. It is particularly pleasing to note that many of the examples involved the services of GPs.",159,Representatives Main Committee
452,Mrs Elizabeth Grace (Lilley) (12.25 P.m.),"Julie was 16 when she took her own4966 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 I was so impressed with the work being done by the Here for Life program that I set up a task force in my own electorate of Lilley to adopt a similar approach for the north Brisbane region. This community network is modelled on the Logan city community youth strategy plan. It targets adolescents in years 8 to 12 at school, post-secondary youth, young adults from the ages of 21 to 25 and their gate keepers-the teachers, the doctors, the clergy, families and community workers. Our first meeting was held on 24 October 1997 and was attended by Reverend Bruce Cornish of the Sandgate Uniting Church; Debbie Kilroy of Pine Rivers Community Health; Inspector Paul Jones of the Sandgate Juvenile Aid Bureau; Murray Benstead, a very concerned private citizen; Mitchell Dobbie, Director of Youth Hotline; Kim McLean of Catholic Youth Services; Michael Greco of the Royal College of General Practitioners; John Kennedy, Principal of St Patrick's College at Shorncliffe; and Keith Hamburger, a Queensland government suicide prevention project officer. As a result of this, the Sandgate and District Life is Worth It Focus Group was formed. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. is Worth It Focus Group was formed. Its main goal is to promote understanding and goodwill to achieve partnerships between families, the community and government agencies. These partnerships will be with a diverse range of people-from the education system, including the school groundsmen, service organisations, sports and recreation clubs, industry, academia and church and community leaders. With the support of these community minded citizens, the state government and the Assistant Police Commissioner of Queensland, the focus group was formed and it centred on four of our local high schools in the Sandgate police district. The support of Mr Barry Barlow, the executive officer of the community service projects, and Ms Kathy James, the director of nursing for the Community of the Prince Charles Hospital and District Health Service, has been invaluable, as has the support of Mr Keith Hamburger and the Reverend Bruce Cornish. Reverend Cornish eventually took on the role of chairman of this focus group. I must compliment the state government in Queensland on its strategy to create five network models in Queensland, which are to be situated at Bowen, the Gold Coast, Ipswich, Roma and Rockhampton. These five network models will eventually be expanded to 100 community networks across the state which will be capable of a sustained and effective response to youth suicide and other serious self-harming behaviours. The Howard government has also shown a determined effort to meet the challenge of youth suicide head-on by launching a national youth suicide prevention strategy. This will be a coordinated initiative that will run to 1999 with a budget of $31 million. This is on top of the funds the Howard government has allocated to research into youth suicide and prevention. There is no doubt Australia has a youth suicide problem. While the overall suicide rate has remained stable for most of this century, the youth suicide rate has increased dramatically over the last three decades, particularly amongst young males. Suicide amongst young males is the biggest killer after road trauma and larger than any of the other categories of fatal accidents. Even though the level of youth suicide has increased fourfold in the last 35 years, it is still not possible to forecast what particular individual will commit suicide. It is also extremely difficult to show that anyone prevention strategy is beneficial.",161,Representatives Main Committee
453,Mrs Elizabeth Grace,"As a result of this meeting, the Sandgate and District LifeThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4967 The white paper on youth suicide suggests that the youth suicide rate has stabilised and that there are grounds for optimism. However, there is much more work to be done and I am pleased that the Howard government and the state governments across Australia, especially ours in Queensland, are giving this issue such serious and systematic attention. The future is not some place we are going but one we are creating. Let everyone work on creating a positive future for the youth of Australia. the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which we are all speaking about today, deals with a major problem afflicting not just young people but people of most age groups in Australia. Suicide is one of the 10 most prevalent forms of death in developed nations. I have obtained some statistics on suicide which illustrate the enormity of the problem. Choosing 1991 on a random basis, there were 1,847 male suicides across all age groups in that year and 513 female suicides. By 1996,. the yearly figure had increased to 1,931 for males but had thankfully dropped slightly to 462 for females. This meant that the rate of suicide across all age groups hovered around 21 for every 100,000 males between 1991 and 1996, but dropped slightly from six to five per 100,000 females. For the age group that this parliamentary committee report focused on-those aged between 15 and 24-there were 376 male suicides in 1991, dropping to 351 in 1996. For females, the incident rate reduction was far more pronounced, with 86 suicides in 1991 and 56 in 1996. These are not just statistics; these are real people-young, full of potential and with the capacity to make a difference in the lives of their community and the network around them, a contribution lost to this nation. Our rates of male and female suicide are about double those in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark, and they are also above those in the US and Canada. Over a longer lifetime, 30 years, the committee heard that the rate of youth suicide had quadrupled. If this were the case with the road toll, I suspect there would be a newspaper editorial or a feature story every day, but of course deaths on roads have declined with safer cars, compulsory seat belt wearing and a great community effort. We have not been so fortunate with suicides. When we compare the statistics with those from 100 years ago, we find that not much has changed. In 1887 there were 20.6 deaths per 100,000 males. In 1996 the rate was 21 per 100,000. So it has transcended generations, and the common myth that suicide is a product of today's Australians being increasingly unable to cope with modem day challenges is no more true than a similar claim a century ago. Challenges in life, fragile elements of human character and many of the difficulties we face are common with what was felt by our forebears. It is clear to me that, while every death in our young age groups is particularly a tragedywhether it be from suicide, drug overdose, road victim trauma or the like-we must ask ourselves why males are far more likely to take their own lives than females. Being the proud father of a precious and beautiful young boy, I have made a point of reading and talking about Steven Biddulph's acclaimed work on raising boys. I believe in his thesis that helping boys grow with and cope with their maleness is a key to nurturing healthy, happy and centred young men. I recently attended the handover and celebrations of the Seaford scout troop and remarked on this with many of the scout leaders. They shared the view of a lot of Mr Biddulph's strategies and believed that engaging young boys in activities with older men who have learnt",162,Representatives Main Committee
454,Mr Bills On (Dunkley) (12.33 P.m.),"The Aspects of youth suicide report prepared by4968 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 to deal with their maleness and who can guide them through that task makes an enormous contribution to the development of those young people. It was gratifying that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) chose to open the committee's seminar on aspects of youth suicide held in February last year. The Prime Minister has matched his very sincere empathy with all those who come in contact with young people at risk with substantial allocations of federal funds. I will not repeat those figures. My colleagues have already covered much of that. Also, I welcome the committee's call for a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention to be established and recognise that the government has acted on this and a number of the other recommendations. Obviously, we must be incredibly sensitive with the way we handle the reporting and discussion of this great problem. There are plenty of suggestions that some of the statistical evidence available to us about this phenomenon, as was reported by Dr Harrison from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, is not always accurate. Obviously, we need to be sensitive about this, but to be able to rely upon accurate research data will guide policy makers in their efforts and also guide the efforts of the many not-forprofit organisations like Here for Life trying to make a difference in this area. The Here for Life organisation is actually convening the Australian People's Forum on Youth Suicide. That is scheduled for August this year in Canberra in this area, and I hope many positive suggestions come out of that occasion. Community workers in the field share the view expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Tim Fischer), who, on 18 July last year, commented that there is possibly a catch-22 situation in elevating the discussion in terms of the exposure in the media of the issue of suicide. Sadly, there are some people who try it as an option and emulate the discussion itself. The Deputy Prime Minister's call really is for the media to handle the issue with sensitivity and not sensationalise it, as tends to occur in the tabloid press. Young people regularly tell me that the media is not interested in good things about them or what they do. They perceive this clearly and identify negativity about young people as being a more cut through approach-in media jargon-in terms of getting stories before the broader community. I have noticed political propaganda being circulated in Dunkley also embraces this warped thinking that talking down young people and their prospects is a more sensational and effective way of catching people's attention. As the committee concluded, it might be best to often focus on depression awareness and problem solving skills. AlthoughI do not have a teenager in my household yet, I understand that a number of adolescents, particularly boys, have difficulty in communicating openly with their parents. Their peer group literally becomes a lifeline. It was for that reason I was particularly interested in and supportive of the work the Here for Life organisation did in developing a national peer support campaign for the youth of Australia. This campaign, funded with the assistance of Coles Myer and the Rotary district 9810 of my community, put forward 30-seeond community service announcements called, 'Look. Ask. Act.' Andrew Gaze was the face of this campaign, and the simple message was, 'Observe the behaviour of your friends, of those people close to you, because, in their behaviour, they may be telling you something that others in their families are not seeing and that you have the opportunity to help them through the difficult time they are experiencing.' Already the National Health and Medical Research Council has moved to develop guidelines for clinical practice, the reason being that many doctors and health professionals become the Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4969 key contact point with people suffering from ailments or conditions that lead to suicidal tendencies. Because one in four people will have suffered at least one episode of major depression by the time that are 18, helping health professionals to identify, diagnose, prevent and manage depression in young people, particularly those aged 13 to 20 is a positive measure. It is for this very reason that I am very supportive of the work of Dr Nikki Martin in Frankston, who, with the help of the division of general practice, the peninsula health care network, the local councils and youth workers in the area, has worked and is continuing to work to develop a youth health service for young people of the Mornington Peninsula community. Her work is outstanding. The perception that health professionals, properly trained, may still not be attractive to a young person is being addressed by having health services available through the youth resource centre so young people can go to a place where they are comfortable, talk about their situation and hopefully get the treatment they need. I had the opportunity of talking with a young man who was recently released from prison. He was in there because he had a drug habit, and his pilfering and petty crime had him convicted and imprisoned. His mother committed suicide because she felt she had failed him and had failed in her task as a mother. He is a young man who has just come back out into the world, needing all the help he can get, and his own family feel they have let the young man down. Now he is looking around for guidance from beyond his own family. It is for that reason that working with parents is so important, I think, in tackling this issue, working with school communities so that those contact points and the people who are there to help and nurture young people through difficult times know what to do so that they are also tooled up. I am looking forward to discussing this matter further with the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and Dr Martin in the next few days. Finally, in closing, I would like to talk a bit further about the challenges facing parents. I have had cause in. the last six months to actually take the place of a parent of a young person who is contemplating suicide. I have had to make the phone calls through those community organisations to those health care providers, and it is frightening how difficult it can be to get help. Even as a member of parliament, trying to find an appointment slot, trying to talk to the right person who can make a difference, was an extraordinarily time consuming and difficult task, and I was not faced with having to provide immediate care for the young person like a parent would. There are services out there. They are grossly overstretched. But the thing that concerns me most is that they do not always connect very well. I have some statistics here, which I will not talk about, time does not allow me, about the number of people who were hospitalised for their depression or some psychiatric condition that has led them to contemplate suicide. But between a healthy person and someone with a psychiatric disorder is an enormous bunch of people who still can be depressed and can contemplate suicidal acts. Where do these people go? How do we help their parents? How do we help them? These are the issues that are going through my mind, and I look forward to discussing them further with the coalition government ministers, who I know share a deep concern for young people and for what they are experiencing and also share a very deep interest in the recommendations of the committee's report. as their sense of isolation increases and their emotions are heightened. I guess young people, in particular, are least able to cope with those negative feelings, and they can act on impulse",163,Representatives Main Committee
455,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.44 P.m.),"So many people can be vulnerable to self-harm4970 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 with dire consequences. Life is not a cartoon. The simple act of ending one's life, or of ending the life of another, is nothing that can be repealed in the next episode. A lot of young people do not have the experience to cope with life's ups and downs nor, sadly, do they have the family or peer support that they need. I would like to register my congratulations to the honourable member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) for his contribution. His usual studied contributions to debates in this place have been enhanced by his speech today. He mentioned the work of Steve Biddulph. Raising Boys is a book that I have read, too. I have a six-year-old son, who I must admit frightens the living daylights out of me with his cartoon like expressions. If he gets upset about something, he says, 'I'm going to kill myself.' He says those words. It frightens the living daylights out of me, because I know that, as a boy, he is amongst the most vulnerable in our community. Statistics prove that. I think Steve Biddulph's book, Raising Boys, raises a lot of matters that arc at the heart of a lot of social problems and provides some real guidance to parents and to those who care as far as matters such as the rising levels of youth crime are concerned. I do not think anyone would disagree with me when I say that when a young person takes their own life it is a tragedy which not only deeply affects family and friends but also tears at the fabric of our society. We lose the marvellous potential-potentia1 that is never going to be realised when a life is lost-and the aspirations that parents have for their children. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs found that in 1995 alone 434 young Australians between the ages of 12 and 25 committed suicide-350 of them were male and 84 were female. These are horrendous statistics in anyone's language, that so many young men, in particular, and young women should decide to take their own lives for one reason or another. It is a shocking indictment on our society. The committee's report also notes there has been a growing trend in Australia since the 1960s, with rates of suicide per 100,000 head of population showing male suicide has almost trebled while young female suicide has doubled. What is even more tragic in these statistics is that it includes children as young as 12--children just 3Yz years older than my daughter and five or six years older than my son. I spoke to one young person recently on this subject. She was 25. She said she thought youth suicide occurs because there are so many adult pressures on young people these days and that in a lot of ways youth has been taken out of young people. They have worries about education, finding a job, money and family break-ups. They even have worries about having a roof over their heads. These are the sorts of things that a lot of young people worry about these days. The economic climate over the past decade has done nothing to allay their fears, and even talking about those sorts of matters only confirms them. When they reach 18 young people have even more responsibilities thrust upon them. It is no wonder some of them react as they do. However, it is not a simple cause and effect scenario, because there are also factors involved which drive a person to suicide. A major one the committee identified was depression, and it recommended the need for young people to be educated about what depression is, how to recognise the symptoms and where to get help. Yet the sad fact is those statistics are indicative not only of the deeply troubled section of our community, our young people, but also of a more general malaise which has crept upon all of us. Not so long ago Australia was regarded internationally as the No. 1 place to live. Then our rating somehow slipped to 8th place and has now plummeted to 18 or 19 on the list. An Thursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4971 important part of the Howard government's strategy to repair our society and put us back into the top 10 by the year 2010 includes addressing social imperatives such as youth suicide. This is because we recognise the good health of our society and the good health of our economy are codependent. One without the other will not put us back on top. With social issues such as youth suicide, when we talk about finding solutions for helping our young people, I believe we must act locally but with the benefit of our collective experience at the national level. There have, however, been some difficulties in doing this because the committee discovered during its investigations that there were inadequacies of detailed national data collection. This was highlighted by the committee, and I believe its work is more valuable to us as a result. If we can draw together the historical strands of what is being done by various levels of government and non-government organisations over the past few years, this government can ensure a more coordinated and financially better targeted approach in its current and future endeavours. The standing committee has helped with the process of national data collation by holding a seminar in February last year, which drew together a range of expert views and experience. I am sure these people greatly assisted the committee in the formulation of its final recommendations. I know from my own local involvement that we are greatly concerned in my own electorate of Moreton about what we can do to prevent this very real phenomenon of youth suicide. In fact, during the last election campaign, the coalition's youth policy was launched in my electorate, at the MacGregor Scout Hall, and that contained some definite policies and directions about what to do about youth suicide. I am particularly pleased to note it was one of my own local branches of the Young Liberals, the then Tarragindi branch-now renamed the Robertson Young Liberals-which helped submit some of the ideas used in the policy the coalition took to the last election. Another important lesson I have learned is that it is vital we have a bipartisan approach to youth suicide prevention. There is no room for political point scoring along the way. I am pleased to be a member of a government which recognises its role to build upon the positive action which has been taken in the past to solve this problem. This means the $18 million allocated by the Howard government to the national youth suicide strategy is in addition to the $13 million allocated by the previous Labor government under its 'Here for life' program. This is a total of $31 million in funding for the 1998-99 year for various programs to help young people at risk of suicide. These programs include funding for rural and regional youth counselling services, programs for parents and relevant professionals like doctors, teachers and health workers, funding for telephone counselling by Life Line and Kids Help Linc and follow up monitoring and help for young people who have physically harmed themselves. There is also funding for more research programs into the factors leading to youth suicide, including specific research into childhood mental health. Griffith University, which is at the heart of my electorate of Moreton, has received $100,000 under the national youth suicide strategy to research practical strategies for successful intervention to reduce access to hanging as a means of suicide. Clearly, the more we find out the more we can do to help our young people deal with their problems instead of resorting to suicide. 4972 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 Everybody in life experiences ups and downs. What we need to do as a community is to support our young people during their passage to adulthood so they can learn to live through the downs as well as the ups. The fact many young people need our help more than ever is a fact of life we must deal with. We can do this as individuals, as a community and as a government. One can only hope in the future youth suicides will be reduced and government strategy, a whole of government strategy, will do something towards helping this. This is why programs like work for the dole provide a sense of belonging, a sense of need. It says, 'You are needed by our community. We want you to get involved in these sorts of programs.' Those sorts of programs are practical issues, perhaps off the direct agenda of youth suicide, but they are about sending a signal to our young Australians that there are people in the community and in government who want to support them and want to give them the support they need along the way so they can make a positive contribution not only today but also tomorrow. Aspects of youth suicide. In doing so, I would like to congratulate the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave) for his thoughtful comments. What he had to say about work for the dole and the inclusion of young people were very important comments. This motion arises out of a seminar held in Parliament House and entitled Aspects of Youth Suicide. It highlighted the urgent need for governments to work together on this important community issue. I should note that the government took action immediately in the 1996 budget. The government's national youth suicide strategy included an amount of $19 million over a three-year period allocated for a strategy of research counselling and early intervention programs, and that showed a great commitment from day one. This is a non-partisan issue in the sense that no-one can be unaffected by concern about this important subject. The first academic in modem times to address this subject was Emile Durkheim who wrote a book entitled Suicide. He took great interest in the changes that were happening in Europe where in a developing industrial society fundamental changes were taking place that required a new method of analysis. He was trying to look at situations of individuals in groups, because, although suicide is a deeply personal thing, it impacts uponA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.55 p.m. to 1.07 p.m. that the social dislocation that was occurring in Europe at the time of industrialisation was very important in the study of suicide. It is interesting to note that we are also going through a period of social dislocation and have been doing so for some decades. For instance, the feeling of social dislocation, or alienation which can arise from it, has sometimes led young people to embrace subcultures where they do find some meaning and purpose, but some of these are counterproductive. For example, the recent phenomenon of the youth grunge culture where the lead singer of a popular group committed suicide legitimised that action for others to copycat. I think that is a recent illustration of how too much socialisation in the wrong area can be detrimental. It is not sufficient in my view to medicalise the problem of suicide, where individuals with psychological dispositions perhaps to suicide are seen as the central locus of the problem. The problem is far too widespread for us to focus particularly on that. What we have to look at is the general situation in our society.",165,Representatives Main Committee
456,Mr Mutch (Cook) (12.52 P.m.),I rise in support of the motion to take note of the report,168,Representatives Main Committee
457,Mr Mutch,"I was speaking about Emile Durkheim and his study on suicide. He foundThursday, 4 June 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 4973 I think there are a lot of young people involved in attempted suicides and the like, and we have to look very carefully at their developing sexuality and their need for intimacy. Perhaps there are some cultural lessons we can learn from various ethnic groups in our country. Although it might generally be said that the dislocation from one's country of origin might lead to social dislocation, we should also be looking at the cultural structures, particularly the extended family structures, of a lot of our migrant groups. They can give support to a lot of young people and to anybody else in those family structures. I think they are very important in making sure people feel they belong to something and then they can find people within those structures whom they can go to to talk out their problems and where they can always find sympathy. It is very hard to get exact figures but I know I have been to two funerals this year of young men from my electorate. They are particularly traumatic experiences to attend. It is obviously a very sad situation where a country like Australia-with our wealth and opportunities-has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the western world. The Sutherland Shire Council community report stated that there were 25 suicides in the shire between 1988 and 1992 of people between the ages of 15 and 24. But we are not always sure; sometimes you are not sure whether a death was accidental or whether it was suicide. I had the experience of meeting one young man who was emerging from a particularly destructive cult. He came to see me. He was obviously very disturbed about this, but we thought he had got out of the cult. Unfortunately, he committed suicide and he made mention of his involvement in this particular organisation in his suicide note. That was another disturbing example in my local area of a suicide which I had cause to note. I blame that very much on the actual perverse socialisation that occurred in the cult and the fact that he was isolated and alienated when they kicked him out of it. But there are positive things happening. I had the good fortune to be invited to a group which was set up under the auspices of the Gymea Anglican Church recently. They call themselves SOULIES. I do not think I have been more impressed by a group of young people. I was also very happy to see the opportunities that are presented to make sure that young people have the opportunity to not be alone, that they can mix in a tremendous environment. I felt particularly welcome when I went to visit this group. To see the numbers of young people who are involved in the SOULIES group made me very optimistic about the future. We have to see this as a holistic solution, rather than just specifically addressing the psychological aspects, which of course are very important. Governments can do things. The member for Moreton referred in a very pertinent way to the work for the dole scheme. This sort of scheme-where young people have something to do with their lives, have a cause for their lives and are also contributing to other people-is very important. We have got to be looking at the social dislocation that occurs in our society and addressing some of those problems, and governments can playa very big role in this. I could go further and talk more about some of the recommendations of the Aspects of youth suicide seminar, but they have been well canvassed by members and I will just applaud them and say that we all have to get right behind this and give it all the support we can. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony) adjourned. Motion (by Mr Anthony) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. 4974 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 June 1998 Commonwealth Employment Service difficulties being faced by one of my constituents with the termination of the CES. In my electorate of Shortland, which is partly the Hunter and the Central Coast, we have seen the end of that 50-year tradition of the CES, with the wide range of services they provided, particularly to employers but most of all to smaller employers in finding people for them and sifting through and prioritising the people they sent for interview. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 1.13 p.m. to 1.24 p.m. Member for Hume of the member for Hume( Mr Sharp), who has just announced his retirement, to the development of Australia's transportation system. I would like put on record that John Sharp will certainly be a loss to the National Party of Australia, he will certainly be a loss to the government and also, I believe, to Australia for the role that he has played-and perhaps any future role that he may have chosen to have played had he stayed in politics. I wish John Sharp, his wife Victoria and their three children all the very best in his future life outside of politics, in whatever field that may be. John Sharp has spent 14 years in the federal parliament. He originally came into this august institution at the age of 29. He was initially the member for Gilmore and then became the member for Hume. He has held many senior front bench positions but, most importantly, he was shadow spokesperson for transport and regional development for over 10 years. This culminated in his becoming the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for two years in government. Without doubt all members of this House would recognise the incredible work that the member for Hume did in that period in reforming, in particular, the railway, aviation and transport sectors. Turning first to the area of railways, it is basically through his determination that the establishment of a single access regime will come into place on 1 July 1998. This will allow the free movement of goods and cargo across the three different rail gauges and through the different instrumentalities that are under the control of the states. The member for Hume was also very successful in leading the privatisation of AN. There are now three new private sector operators of rail systems. Likewise, he has a keen interest in seeing the development of the Sydney-Canberra very fast train and was most instrumental in achieving the ultimate Commonwealth contribution to the Alice Springs-Darwin railway. He also started the privatisation process of the National Rail Corporation. But it is the area of aviation which really brought John Sharp to the fore, particularly in his period as shadow spokesperson. After the Monarch crash and before the Seaview crash, he pursued the government vigorously to see an improvement in aviation standards across Australia, particularly through the reform of the old Civil Aviation Authority into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. While he was minister he initiated a complete rewriting of aviation safety regulations and was responsible for appointing a number of new board members to CASA. He was also behind the decision which culminated in the privatisation of a number of our airports, raising over $4 billion which was used to help pay off federal government debt.",168,Representatives Main Committee

At Mascot airport he was instrumental in introducing the slot landing system, which came into operation in March 1998 and is saving airlines enormous amounts of money, and in reopening Sydney's east-west runway. A long-term operating plan has now been established at Sydney airport and much of that is due to the work that John Sharp did when he was Minister for Transport and Regional Development. In the area of roads, and this is certainly relevant for the people of Richmond, John Sharp was instrumental in putting together the roads of national importance program through which over $3.1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years upgrading the Pacific Highway north of Hexham right through to Brisbane. Concerning the electorate of Richmond, I pay tribute to the work John Sharp did in ensuring that a number of projects were put into the first budget of the coalition government after it was elected to power. Tomorrow, Friday, the Brunswick Heads bypass, a $21 million bypass of the town of Brunswick Heads, will officially be opened by the new Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Vaile), but great credit goes to John Sharp for actually making it happen. John Sharp was also responsible for the approval of the Chinderah bypass and ultimately for the $224 million Chinderah to Billinudgel project. He also pushed for the introduction of the black spots program. In the maritime industry, John Sharp played a critical role in turning the ANL shipping line into a profitable business which is now ready for privatisation. He also played a critical role in waterfront reform. I wish John Sharp the very best. He has played an invaluable role for rural Australia and for the National Party. I consider him a good friend and I wish him well. Commonwealth Employment Service Member for Hume Committee the anger, disgust and frustration of one of my constituents from Norah Head who, not having access to the CES, contacted the department at Tuggerah and was given three employment agencies to contact to try to find work for her 17-year-old daughter who desperately wants a job. She contacted Drake and received a recorded message but, at the end of the recorded message lasting 10 minutes, she was none the wiser. She then contacted Coast Enrolment Gosford and was told to take her resume there by the following day. It would have cost her $20 return to get there by public transport. She was also told to contact the Wyong agency which would have cost $10 return to get there by public transport. People in the area have lost access to the CES and have lost the convenience and support that not only the CES but also other organisations that were in operation at that time gave to them. I want to bring to the attention of the Main Committee our deep concern at what this government has done with the abolition of the CES. May I ask: has the member for Hume( Mr Sharp) resigned from the parliament? we come from opposite sides of the political spectrum, I would like to commend the member for Hume for the very valuable work we were able to achieve together on committees of this parliament.
