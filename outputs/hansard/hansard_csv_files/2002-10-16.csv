The first project was a marvellous musical presentation performed at the Bowman Hall in Blacktown on 28 August. This presentation was part of the Centenary of Federation celebrations conducted in both the Greenway and the Parramatta electorates. This musical presentation was the brainchild of Father Arthur Bridge OMA, chairman of Arts Musica Australis, who sought funding from both the Greenway and Parramatta Centenary of Federation committees for a musical depicting Australia’s heritage. The musical presentation included musical snapshots of outback Australia and multicultural Australia. All the musical items were specially composed for this particular performance by composers with connections to Western Sydney. Richard Gill OMA conducted and Peter Skrzynecki provided the text. The orchestra and choir were made up of students, teachers and friends of MLC Burwood and Trinity Grammar School, Hunters Hill. These two schools have an outstanding track record in the performing arts and their performance on this particular night contributed greatly to the success of the evening. The performance was attended by the Governor of New South Wales, Professor Bashir, who spoke at the end of the performance, congratulating everyone involved. The second project relates to the opening of the Blacktown Arts Centre, which is a refurbished former Anglican Church in Flushcombe Road, Blacktown. This centre arose from a long-established community need for a contemporary multi-arts venue in Blacktown. The centre will support the growth of professional arts practiced in Western Sydney. The forecourt for the arts centre was funded by a grant from the Centenary of Federation community projects program. The total value of the grant was $42,000. It was utilised towards the overall exterior landscaping of the site, including public seating, paving, lighting and planting. I thank the chairman of the Greenway Centenary of Federation committee, Mr Bill McNamara, and his hard working committee on the completion of their program. The committee consisted of the Reverend Glen Renton from the Blacktown Uniting Church, Mr Greg Skeoch from Mitchell High School, Councillor Alan Pendleton, Mrs Terry Driscoll, Mr Fred Williams, Ms Doreen Ross and Miss Vilma Ryan. Ryan Electorate: World War II Memorial tee today about an important memorial plaque that was rededicated in the federal seat of Ryan on Sunday, 6 October. The rededication was performed by Reverend Professor Norm Barker. This remarkable memorial plaque was originally laid on 13 August 1995. It is a testimony to those special Australians who contributed to Australian wartime efforts in World War II with their hard work here at home. I want to take this opportunity to, firstly, thank the Toowong RSL sub-branch and, in particular, its president, Mr Merv Bunney, for his invitation to attend the rededication ceremony.

She also put on a community event afterwards for all those who took the time to come along and support the occasion. In 1995 Australians remembered five decades since the end of World War II and it was during this very poignant time that the Toowong memorial plaque was first laid in a small park in Toowong. But, due to the fact that this property has now been sold, the memorial had to be relocated to a new site at the Toowong clock tower. This site is considered to be the centre of the local community and therefore is a very fitting site for this new memorial plaque. The hardships of World War II were experienced not only by our soldiers who travelled overseas to protect the values and way of life that we all enjoy and cherish today but also by the family and friends left behind. I know that all members of this parliament acknowledge the sacrifices that Australians made in World War II. Those who served at home in factories and on farms also endured the dislocation of their lives that war always causes. I take this opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to those who have sacrificed their lives and I also pay tribute to their families. I think everyone in this parliament acknowledges that it is most appropriate and, indeed, an obligation upon all of us to acknowledge the community work that is done by veterans and RSL sub-branches throughout our country. As the federal member for Ryan, it is my privilege to pay particular tribute on this occasion to the Toowong RSL sub-branch. It is an active subbranch. Mr Merv Bunney is the president, and he is very dedicated to working for the veterans in his sub-branch. It is appropriate that Mr Merv Bunney be acknowledged for services to the community. (Time expired) Calwell Electorate: The Smith Family’s Education Program Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (9.45 a.m.)-I rise to speak to the parliament today about an initiative by the Smith Family in my electorate of Calwell. The Smith Family, who are best known for their toy drives and emergency services, are a non-religious and nonprofit organisation. Their mission is to deliver a more caring and cohesive Australian community. The Smith Family runs a number of programs to support the education of disadvantaged kids and their families. They include a literacy program, a new early intervention program to help kids aged between zero and five years, a program to improve access to information technology, and an English language tutoring program. The Smith Family has a desire to facilitate full participation in the education process. It is in this spirit that a program has been established in Broadmeadows to help students from disadvantaged families continue their education, with financial support from sponsors. I met with Boyd and Maria, two of the education support workers, at the recent launch of the Learning for Life service by the state Minister for Employment, the Hon. Monica Gould. The program pays a scholarship and provides additional assistance through education support workers to support students and low-income families through primary, secondary and university schooling. The aim of the program is to give kids of all abilities a chance to get the most out of their schooling. As parents know, sending kids to school, even public school, involves rising and often unexpected costs which poorer families find difficult to meet. The scholarships help pay for things like uniforms, books, stationery and school outings and camps. Families on benefits or working families on low incomes are eligible for the scholarships, with families eligible for up to three scholarships at any one time. Annual scholarships are about $204 for primary, $324 for junior secondary, $504 for senior secondary and $2,000 for university students. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7801 Sponsors can be confident that 100 per cent of their donation goes directly to the families and that all expenditure is directed towards education costs. The program also involves support from an education support worker who keeps in contact with the students and families to provide assistance, referrals and advice. The Broadmeadows workers inform me that the program is an outstanding success, with hundreds of sponsors and over 300 families already receiving scholarships. I thank the Hume City Council for its continued dedication to our community through its social justice charter and for its assistance to and cooperation in this program. I am committed to equality in public education, so I welcome the Smith Family into my electorate of Calwell. I will be joining the program as a sponsor. I know I share the same sentiments of gratitude as my constituents for the tremendous helping hand that the Smith Family has given to our community. It is a program that other honourable members may wish to acquaint themselves with and they may consider sponsoring a low-income student to better their education. Petrie Electorate: Community Groups Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.48 a.m.)-I rise today to acknowledge some of the fine work by organisations in the Redcliffe Peninsula. I would like to start by congratulating Robert Moncur from the Woody Point Neighbourhood Watch for winning not only the regional but also the Queensland award for his work with Neighbourhood Watch. It is a very fine organisation and one which is run very expertly. It does terrific work in the community and for the Woody Point residents. Congratulations to Robert. I want to praise the Redcliffe SES, who have also had a winning time. They took third place at the state rescue competition when they came head to head with seven other SES teams in a two-day competition. The Redcliffe team had six members, and they were engaged in things like first-aid, rescue, navigation, and land search and rescue. They were put into mock emergency situations, and they were able to draw on their expertise and their experience. I want to congratulate the SES for their wonderful work and for the great work they do in our city. I also want to congratulate manager Mick Ryan, Loretta Bruhn, Robert Majewski, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Avery and Gary McGinn. Well done to those people. Another club that always shows great community support in the Redcliffe area is the Redcliffe Leagues Club. They came to the forefront again in donating a much needed trailer to the Redcliffe and District Cardiac Rehab Support Group. Des Webb just recently handed over the trailer to the support group. I want to congratulate the Redcliffe Leagues Club for the work they do. The cardiac group works with very few resources. They are senior citizens of the community who have had major heart episodes. They meet every week for a three-kilometre walk along the foreshore at Redcliffe. They are very supportive of the community and visit shopping centres and community groups, so that trailer will be a fantastic and welcome addition. It will make it easier for the group to carry equipment. It is an important addition for their educational supplies and also for their testing kits. Congratulations to them. On a final note, I want to also congratulate the Redcliffe Peninsula jet skiers for having an open day on 6 October. Jet skis are a menace if not used properly. With the participation of the Queensland Water Police and the Jetboat Sports Association, the open day focused on safety and speed requirements so that jet skiers can live in harmony with the bay-side community residents. The open day was well attended, and I want to congratulate them for a marvellous day. 7802 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 Lowe Electorate: Community Services ment the wonderful work of the Homebush-Strathfield Meals on Wheels based at the Strathfield community centre, Bate Street, Homebush, in my electorate of Lowe. The HomebushStrathfield Meals on Wheels operates in the Strathfield local government area. With the help of their many dedicated and tireless volunteers, they supply and deliver meals to residents who are temporarily or permanently unable to prepare their own meals. Their clients are generally the aged, who are very frail and who deeply appreciate the work of the Meals on Wheels volunteers. They also provide meals to younger people with a disability. In a letter I received last month, Ms Anne Sheppard, the vice-president of the management committee, invited me to attend their annual general meeting, which is to be held at the community centre tonight. I let Ms Sheppard know that I could not attend because parliament is sitting this week. Tonight, the Homebush-Strathfield Meals on Wheels will be honouring many of their long-serving and dedicated members by presenting them with certificates in recognition of their service. Without the commitment of their long-serving volunteers, the vital service they provide to the local community would not be possible. AlthoughI cannot be there tonight to congratulate them in person, I would like to record in the parliament this morning the magnificent service they provide to the community I represent. I congratulate the following volunteers: Mrs Margaret Cole, for her five years of service; Mrs Annette Cooper, for her five years of service; Mr Alan Lynch, for his 10 years of service; Mrs Maree McDougall, for her five years of service; Mrs Diana Moloney, for her 20 years of service, which is a wonderful achievement; Mrs Carmel Monaghan, for her five years of service; Mrs Pushba Pulendiran, for her 15 years of service; Ms Dorothy Spratt, for her five years of service; and Mrs Margaret Vella, for her five years of service. Finally, I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous job done by the Homebush-Strathfield Meals on Wheels Service Coordinator, Ms Cheryl Brown; the vice-president, Ms Anne Sheppard; and the entire management committee. Well done, Homebush-Strathfield Meals on Wheels. We are all very proud of you. Fisher Electorate: Facilities for Car Enthusiasts stration) (9.54 a.m.)-I would like today to update the House on a very serious problem on the Sunshine Coast and, in particular, in the electorate of Fisher. I am referring to the ongoing difficulties that residents and holiday-makers are having with car hoons. Prior to the 2001 election, one of the key issues raised with my office by constituents was the fact that we seem to have so many car hoons, so many people who have such a total disregard for the rights of their fellow citizens that they are prepared to do wheelies and doughnuts and make an inordinate amount of noise as they enjoy the use of their vehicles. I called a public meeting, some 200 people attended and a resolution, moved by Buderim resident Mr Tony Nioa, was carried unanimously. I was particularly impressed with the unanimity at the meeting. We had large numbers of residents and citizens at the meeting who were concerned over the impact of these car hoons on their lifestyle. We also had a substantial number of car enthusiasts there-people who have performance enhanced vehicles, people whose cars have been hotted up, but who were particularly annoyed that many in the community identify them as car hoons just because they spend what is, in many cases, tens of thousands of dollars improving their vehicles. The resolution was that, firstly, there ought to be zero tolerance for car hoons; secondly, as a community we should endeavour to locate a place where car enthusiasts are able to display their vehicles in a well-lit area on a regular basis so",129,Representatives Main Committee

I spoke with councillors who came along and, as a community, we were able to have another meeting last week. Three hundred people turned up this time and we were able to update the community on the situation. I want to praise councillors Dickson, Natoli, Cansdell and Taylor of Maroochy Shire Council and councillors Dwyer, Wallace and Champion for their interest. Ms Fiona Simpson, the member for Maroochydore, has cooperated. Unfortunately, the Labor member for the Kawana, Mr Chris Cummins, refused to attend the meeting. He claimed this had been solved by the state government, but the community believes otherwise. I intend to continue to progress this matter to make sure that not only are residents able to enjoy the wonderful lifestyle on the Sunshine Coast but also that holiday-makers from around the country can come to the most magnificent tourist destination and enjoy their holiday without interference by car hoons. (Time expired) the time for members’ statements has concluded. 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (9.57 a.m.)-I want to speak briefly today because the matters before us are relatively minor and not controversial, but I do want to raise a couple of issues relating to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act more generally. The legislation before us, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2002, relates to the operation of the act and the land claim being made in order to facilitate the Darwin to Alice Springs railway line. Schedule1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976-often known colloquially as the land rights act-lists areas of land that become Aboriginal land under the act. When a land claim has been made under the land rights act, a settlement is sometimes reached, as it has been in this case, by agreement between governments, and the Northern Territory government and the relevant land council. In such cases, the Land Commissioner’s office is asked to adjourn the land claim until the land can be scheduled under the land rights act and approaches made to the Commonwealth minister for Indigenous affairs asking for the land to be scheduled, as has been undertaken in this case. The Parliamentary Library has made it clear in its review of this act that there are two main paths by which land can be granted in fee simple-that is, the unfettered title to land-to traditional Aboriginal owners. The land claim path so described involves an application to the Aboriginal Land Commissioner seeking recognition of a group’s traditional attachment to land which is available for claim under the land rights act. We would all be familiar with this process, in which the Land Commissioner conducts a hearing and produces a report based on the evidence presented. In almost every case the Land Commissioner has recommended to the Commonwealth minister that a grant of fee simple be made over part or all of the area that has been claimed. That process has been going on now for some 25-odd years. The minister then considers the report of the Land Commissioner and, where a recommendation to grant is accepted, the minister recommends to the Governor General that a grant of fee simple be made to the relevant Aboriginal land trust. In that case the grant does not in-",132,Representatives Main Committee
223,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"In accordance with standing order 275A7804 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 volve a parliamentary action but does entail a pretty lengthy process associated with a land claim inquiry which, of course, is thoroughly tested. Alternatively-and this is what we are dealing with here today-when a description of land is added by parliament to schedule 1 of the land rights act, the Commonwealth minister must establish an Aboriginal land trust to hold it for the benefit of Aboriginal people with a traditional entitlement. The minister has to then recommend that the Governor General grant the land in fee simple to the Aboriginal land trust. A number of areas-and these are mostly ex-reserves-were transferred to Aboriginal ownership by this method soon after the passage of the land rights act. Subsequently, it has provided a means by which agreements designed to settle outstanding land claims can be given legal effect. The addition of the five parcels of land in this case will bring the total number of land parcels scheduled in this way since 1977 to 69. This mechanism does tend to facilitate negotiated outcomes but requires the involvement of parliament, which must amend the schedule to the land in question. I think that oversight is desirable. I would not necessarily agree with some that it should be removed and allowed simply at the minister’s discretion. The minister described in his second reading speech both the region and the background to the land to be scheduled, so I do not intend to go into that in any detail. Suffice it to say that, after discussion and agreement in order to facilitate the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, title to this block of land will be granted to the Harry Creek East community to enable them to move. The community’s current land is situated on the old north-south stock route and has been rendered unfit for continued habitation because of the proposed construction of the railway. Hence the former government of the Northern Territory agreed to grant the community another parcel of land. That is really what we are dealing with here. The urgency for the scheduling has, I understand, to some extent been brought on by the speed with which the whole process has actually developed. As the minister has noted, the Central Land Council has agreed with the Northern Territory government that a parcel of land be allocated to the Arnapipe Aboriginal land trust on behalf of the members of the Harry Creek East community. This allocation is to allow the permanent relocation of the community. I think it goes to show how accommodating such communities can be. This is a very large thing we ask of people-that is, to up stakes and move entirely from land that they had formerly inhabited. As I have indicated, the developers have commenced operations in the area concerned earlier than expected. They cannot coexist; the people simply cannot live under those circumstances. The community comprises: seven families, representing up to 35 people; six houses; six shower blocks; a generator shed; other sheds; two large and three small stockyards; and large water storage tanks and associated equipment. So it is quite a substantial move which, as I understand it, is to be funded by the Northern Territory government to the tune of at least $1 million. The closest community buildings at Harry Creek East are located within 100 metres of the railway centre line. You can see how important it is that this scheduling take place. It will allow for the long-term relocation to a site south-east of their present home. The families of the Harry Creek East community were initially reluctant to relocate into a less certain situation than they currently enjoyed. They were not prepared to simply do it on an understanding; they really wanted the matter to be formalised by the parliament. One issue affecting the timing of the relocation was the negotiations regarding the location of the new site to ensure that there was minimal interference with the many sacred sites in that region. That has been necessarily a time-consuming process. The social impact analysis of the railway states that the identification of an acceptable relocation site has been far from easy. I am Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7805 not surprised at that. I think that would be true of any community asked to remove itself, particularly in a case such as this, from land with which it has traditionally been associated. A million dollars has been set aside by the Northern Territory government to relocate the community. On 21 August this year Northern Territory Chief Minister, Clare Martin, said that the community had agreed to move and ‘that is part of the railway contract, but I can give you a very strong assurance that will happen appropriately and the community will be appropriately relocated’. I am sure there will be many watching to ensure that that is the case. The finalising freehold title of the land will enable the relocation to actually occur. I imagine that will proceed quite quickly from this point. I want to make a couple of comments on the current state of the Northern Territory land rights legislation. I am sure all of us are familiar with the history of this legislation. It was very important in Australia’s treatment of Indigenous people. It was enacted in 1996 and it was seen then as a milestone in the recognition of Aboriginal rights to land. It is fair to say that all these years later, although we have dealt with what was in some respects much more complex and potentially far-reaching legislation under the Native Title Act and its various amendments, this legislation gives much greater protection and engagement of Aboriginal people in both the management of their land and the potential to benefit from it. Although it has weaknesses which have been well understood by all of those involved, in my view it still, in the way it understands Aboriginal connection with the land, represents the gold standard against which others are, for the most part, judged to be deficient. It is still central and relevant to the lives of Indigenous people, as was pointed out by the House of Representatives committee which was responding to the government initiated Reeves report. As I am sure members will be aware, this act has been reviewed a number of times, most recently at the instigation of the current government. The Reeves report of 1998 brought down what has been described as one of the most complicated and incomprehensible documents ever to see the light of day-particularly unsuitable for Indigenous people, for many of whom English is not their second but their third or fourth language, and it is not written in a form that the average Australian whose first language is English could understand. It is an entirely inappropriate document with which to seek to engage in dialogue with Indigenous people and it was rightly criticised by the House of Representatives committee at the time. That report made very far-reaching and, I must say, controversial recommendations and created a great deal of anxiety and alarm in many Aboriginal communities-because it seemed to represent a significant watering down of the regime that had previously applied, and they did not see most of its recommendations as necessarily resulting in greater benefit to Indigenous people, but the reverse: it seemed that it would diminish their entitlements. It was reviewed by the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with a remarkable outcome of bipartisan support for the recommendations of that committee. By and large, it is fair to say that the committee rejected pretty fully the recommendations of the Reeves report. They made it clear that the land rights act should not be amended without the understanding and the consent of the traditional owners of the Northern Territory land after appropriate consultation-none of which had occurred in the case of the Reeves report. Even though nothing much has been done following this report, that anxiety and alarm still exists. Four years later, the minister has said in his second reading speech that he is waiting to hear from the northern land councils and the Northern Territory government. Nonetheless, it is fair to say-and the minister is here to receive this criticism-that there has not been much of a sense of urgency about dealing with these matters, even though the minister insists that the 7806 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 act still urgently needs repair and claims that it is not assisting in improving the social and economic position of Aboriginal landowners. There are a lot of a reasons for that, and most of them actually do not attach to the way the land rights act operates. They have to do with the way communities are supported, the relationship between communities and government, and a whole range of problems which, frankly, also exist in other places where there is not a land rights act. I cannot put the continuing disadvantage of Indigenous people down to whatever might be seen to be the deficiencies of that particular act. I think that is a blind. We need to be very careful in this case about ascribing cause. The minister has issued what I regard as a fairly rough outline of the issues he believes should be addressed, and he has visited land councils. I must say that, when I visited them subsequently, they were a little dismayed at the way the minister had approached them, and his behaviour was still being commented upon some weeks later. The Reeves report and, as I can understand it, the minister’s intention still aim to reduce barriers to economic development of Aboriginal land. If it were the development of Aboriginal land by Aboriginal people for their benefit, I guess I would be impressed at that as a goal. But the complaints are really about the failure of new mines to be established, for instance, and the exploitation by others of Aboriginal land-which may not result in any benefit to Indigenous people. The reality is that there have been many exploration licences issued and mineral leases agreed to. It may not be a process that enables people to snap their fingers but, remembering the principle of Indigenous ownership of land, I think that is as it should be. Noone is suggesting that we would not want to see an appropriate streamlining of approvals, if that is the obstacle; but let us not kid ourselves that that is necessarily going to assist Indigenous people. Another of the aims the minister apparently has is to assimilate the devolution of control away from land councils to more localised regional bodies-which is one of the contentious recommendations of the Reeves report. It is worth remembering that, at the moment, for every hundred Indigenous people in this country there is a registered organisation. The problem is not that we have too many big organisations but that we have a plethora of small ones. Every grant of land or money or, indeed, of engagement between government and Indigenous people requires them to register an organisation. It is bizarre. They belong to more bodies collectively than other Australians would ever dream of. It is an extremely expensive administrative process, and I would not want to see that replicated by another set of organisations. Those who have been involved in the native title process will tell you just how disappointing it has been that very often these new bodies do not have sufficient resources to do what it is suggested they should. That is particularly true of the rep bodies. The suggestion to streamline processes for new councils to be formed is one that the committee agreed to. Everyone understands that this act is not necessarily perfect in its operations and that there may be aspirations that are being thwarted by the current arrangements. I am sure that everyone would agree ultimately that that recommendation of the House of Representatives committee is a reasonable one. Another goal is to improve the management and distribution of the Aboriginal Benefit Account. Depending on how that is done, most people would agree that there is room for improvement there as well. After my discussions with people in the Northern Territory, both within the land councils and outside them, I am aware that they understand that neither the Northern Territory government nor the Labor Party-nor, I believe, the Democrats and the Greens-will tolerate Aboriginal people being railroaded into amendments which are designed to suit other parties. There has to be that consent, the consent has to be informed, and the discussion has to be unWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7807 dertaken at a level that respects the basic principles of land rights. It is important that none of us forget that the people who were here before we arrived are the people whose land we are talking about. This is not some other, Johnny-come-lately third party. These are the original owners of the land. There is very little left of it in their control, and it is vital that we do not water down the provisions of what was and remains a very important act to the people of the Northern Territory. In many ways it is a measure against which other lesser titles now granted through the Native Title Act should be judged. I for one will certainly be watching very closely to ensure that whatever agreements are reached are transparent, public, clear and well understood by all the parties. Certainly as far as the Labor Party are concerned, we will not tolerate amendments being made without that fundamental agreement of Indigenous people of the Northern Territory. Amendment Bill 2002 is, as the previous speaker has acknowledged, a fairly basic piece of legislation; but I note that the minister’s second reading speech mentions the need for repair to the land rights act. Perhaps this bill makes a minor change, but the matter of changing ownership of land from one area to another et cetera indicates just how much reform is needed and how urgent that reform is. Nevertheless, this is the bill before us. We have the great projectthe Darwin to Alice Springs railway line-well ahead of schedule. There is some urgency about it and so we would no doubt expect the legislation to be accepted, and I understand that all parties, including the Northern Territory government and the people involved, are agreed. The point I want to make this morning very briefly is-and I will come back to the minister’s second reading speech again-that the important ambition for the land rights act of 1976 was to advance the situation for Aboriginal people. Whilst much land is held by Aboriginal people, we know there are still huge challenges for them in the social and economic area. I was part of the committee, as was the member for Lingiari, that reviewed the Reeves report. Unlocking the future was the title of that report, and we believe we did offer some solutionsbut that view was not shared by all, I know. Nevertheless, we cannot get away from the minister’s point in the second reading speech: the enthusiasm for land rights has not been followed by sufficient improvement in the social and economic situations of Aboriginal landowners. The example that the minister used, in terms of exploration and mining in Aboriginal lands, is that there has been just one new mine on Aboriginal land in 25 years. There have been over 1,000 applications to explore on Aboriginal land, but more than half of those applications remain outstanding. There will be all sorts of debate and discussion and passionate views held. At the end of the day, this land is for the benefit of those people and, surely, they need to be very much respected. We have great challenges in that but, suffice it to say, I support the amendments and I wish them a speedy passage. on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2002 into some sort of substantial context. As the member for Lingiari, my constituency encapsulates all but 300 square kilometres of the Northern Territory. It is the area that the land rights act applies to. In excess of 45 per cent of my constituents are Indigenous Australians, most of them living in remote communities. Prior to entering this parliament, my job was as a policy officer at the Central Land Council. I have a greater knowledge and experience of the land rights act than anyone else in this parliament. In that context, I am pleased to support the legislation that has been put before the parliament simply because it schedules and gives land to Aboriginal Territorians under the land rights act.

225,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.16 A.m.),"Firstly, let me put my contribution to the debate7808 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 the Upper Daly land claim. It is extremely important that we comprehend that the land rights act’s basic objective is to return people’s land to them. There will also be the scheduling of a very small portion of land to relocate the Harry Creek community, just north of my home in Alice Springs. The member for Fremantle spoke about this in the context of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway and the need to relocate some communities. I am aware that the Northern Territory government has contributed in the vicinity of $1 million to assist in this relocation. The outcome-which is the result of negotiations between the Northern Territory government and Indigenous people through their representative body, the Central Land Council-is agreement on a package of land which will suit their requirements. This is very important to these people. I listened carefully to the contribution from the member for Grey. I want to record my appreciation for his involvement in the House of Representatives committee, of which he is now chairman, and his involvement in the deliberations on the report Unlocking the future, to which he referred. I am sure he would agree with me that the process of undertaking the work of the committee in the context of reviewing the Reeves report was very instructive because of the very high support given to the Indigenous organisations in the Northern Territory, the land councils, for the work they do in relation to the land rights act and for recognising their responsibilities under it. However, we need to be very careful. I would countenance the fact that the minister, who is at the table and who I am pleased to see here, has been a little less than careful. speech, the minister referred to this issue of exploration of Aboriginal land. He says that the land rights act is in urgent need of reform. He says there has been only one new mine on Aboriginal land in 25 years. He also made that claim in an article in the Sunday Territorian on 8 September and on ABC radio, I think on the morning of 20 September. But that claim is wrong. It is plainly wrong. I seek leave to table a document which outlines the number of mining agreements under the land rights act for the grant of mineral leases since 1987 by the Central Land Council. Leave granted. context of the land rights act-and I refer here to the area of the Central Land Council-the CLC has processed 10 agreements for mineral or gas and oil leases over that period. You will see, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, once you get this list, that these include the gas fields of Mereenie and Palm Valley, the goldmines at the Granites, the Tanami, Dead Bullock Soak, the Tanami extension, Molech, Edna Beryl, Groundrush and Chariot. The mining companies involved include Santos, Magellan, North Flinders, the Tanami Mine Joint Venture, North Flinders again, Giants Reef and Newmont Mining. They are significant mining bodies in the Australian mining industry. The minister needs to understand the process that is involved in the finalisation of these agreements and the process that people must undertake once an exploration licence has been granted. I make the point, Minister, while I think of it, that you made this observation about Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory; but do you know that, on pastoral land in the Northern Territory during the 25 years about which you speak, not one mine has been established? That has nothing to do with the land rights act. What you need to comprehend, Minister, is that under the land rights act the land councils are required to process exploration licence applica-",137,Representatives Main Committee

228,Mr Snowdon,"Minister, let us be very clear about this. Let us understand that, in theWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7809 tions and mineral lease terms and conditions. And they do it. But they cannot and should not be held responsible, as some would seek to do, if companies carrying out exploration cannot find the minerals because they do not look hard enough or because they are warehousing the exploration leases. Minister, I refer you to a report prepared by Dr Ian Manning, from the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, which is a comprehensive analysis of the mining industry and its relationship with the land rights act and the Native Title Act. Whilst it is not my intention to read you chapter and verse of this document-I refer it to you and ask you to read it-I will make mention of a couple of things. I will read a summary of an argument made by Dr Manning: Elements in the mining industry have claimedThe minister seems to have picked up on this, because it is the same old tired tripe that we have had shoved down our throats since I have been involved in politics in the Northern Territory and since the land rights act was established by successive CLP governments in the Northern Territory-and, I might say, by successive conservative spokespersons on the issue of Indigenous affairs in Australia since that time. Dr Manning says: Elements in the mining industry have claimed that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and Native Title have dampened mineral exploration activity in the Northern Territory. However the only period where the effect appears to have been serious enough to depress the NT share of total Australian mineral exploration was the period 1996 to 2001. This was not due to Native Title as such but to the Northern Territory government’s refusal to adapt its legislation to the reality of Native Title. In the body of his document there is an apt summary of why this was a problem. It does not lie at the feet of the Northern Territory land councils, the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council, the Anindilyakwa Land Council or the Tiwi Land Council; it lies at the feet of the then Northern Territory CLP government. Dr Manning further says: The Wik decision late in 1996 was followed by a decision by the Northern Territory government to suspend the issue of exploration licences on pastoral leases. The then Northern Territory government suspended the issue of exploration licences on pastoral leases. They claim that this was because of uncertainty created by the Wik decision. However, as the minister will be aware, other states, particularly Western Australia, accommodated these issues and the reality of native title, and continued to issue exploration licences. You would expect this to result in a fall in the Northern Territory share of exploration licence expenditure or expenditure on exploration. The share, in fact, fell to under eight per cent from 1997 to 2002. Given that new exploration licences were no longer available on pastoral leases, this implies that the emphasis in exploration shifted to Aboriginal lands. The land councils assisted by increasing their rate of grant of exploration licences, reflecting systemisation of the process and the increased familiarity with it of both the applicants and the traditional owners. In 2001, the Northern Territory resumed issuing exploration licences on pastoral leases. In the one year a large number of backed up ELAs were approved-more than the industry had the capacity to handle. Later in his document, again a summary piece, in relation to the land rights act-and this is very important-Dr Manning says: There is counterpart legislation to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in North America, New Zealand and many other countries where there are indigenous peoples. Multinational mining companies expect to find such legislation in place and indeed believe that it is to the advantage of the industry since it provides a framework to govern relations between miners and traditional owners and Aboriginal people 7810 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 generally. Not all the industries adopted this view but significant industry voices moderated their opposition to the Land Rights Act since 1998. And this is all true. Minister, I know it might be hard to believe but since the election of the good people’s Labor government in the Northern Territory the atmosphere has changed. In the years since 1978, since self-government, up until last year, the attitude of successive CLP governments was one of marginalisation, division and litigation. Ask your advisers, Minister, to delve into the history books-I have got the corporate memory, but I doubt that they have-and see how many times successive CLP governments sought to litigate over issues to do with the land rights act. For what purpose? The fundamental purpose was one of division-perpetuating the sorts of myths the minister has perpetuated by alleging that only one mining lease has been developed on Aboriginal land in the last 25 years. It is wrong and you are perpetuating the same myths, the same lies, that have been used by successive conservative governments in the Northern Territory to give us division.

But I say to you, Minister, do not perpetuate the myths, the untruths, these things that would otherwise be called lies. Do not perpetuate them. It does you no justice. I note that the CLP in the Northern Territory has, true to form, started to run again the lines on division on the basis of the land rights act. Minister, it behoves you-and I think you are the person who can do it-to accept the responsibility you have been given, to work responsibly with people and to not perpetuate these untruths.

244,Mr Snowdon,"Instead, now we have a Northern Territory government which hasWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7811 pleased to be part of the committee which drafted the report Unlocking the future. Minister, I would draw your attention-as I have done previously-to the very first recommendation of that report, which referred to the need to get informed consent. I know that you accept that Indigenous people in the Northern Territory have the capacity to speak for themselves, but do not foist onto the land councils the responsibility for the social and economic deprivation they have suffered in the past 25 years. The people who are primarily responsible for that deprivation are the successive CLP governments, who refused in every budget to provide the resources necessary to improve the lot of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. Again, I would ask the minister to ask his advisers to delve into the history books and to see the disservice that successive CLP governments have done to the Northern Territory and to the people of Australia. They are responsible-not the Central or the Northern Land Councils, not the Anindilyakwa Land Council and not the Tiwi Land Council. I would also ask, as I have read this piece of legislation on numerous occasions, that the minister familiarise himself with it and get to understand, particularly, section 23. He would know, if he read section 23, that whilst it can be read broadly it has been read very narrowly by successive governments in terms of the provision of resources to land councils for them to do their work. I know what has happened. I have seen it. I have observed it. I have experienced it. I have seen the withdrawal of services from the bush and heard the plaintive cries from Indigenous Territorians to have those services restored or to get some modicum of justice in the delivery of education, health and housing. That is not the responsibility of the land councils. They can be advocates, but that is not their primary responsibility. If you read section 23 of the land rights act, you will certainly come to understand that very quickly. I am very proud of this land rights act, and I am proud for two reasons. One, whilst it was drafted by a Labor government, it was in fact passed in the parliament by the conservative government of Malcolm Fraser. Two, it is an historic document and one which needs to be seen for what it is. It has given a great deal of hope to many Indigenous Australians, but it has also given them the basis on which to maintain their cultural integrity. I ask the minister to reflect very carefully on his use of language over the need to amend this act and to not-and I take you back to what I said originally-use these untruths or these myths that are perpetuated by some elements of the community for their own political purposes. I ask you, Minister, to not take the advice of those same advisers who advised consecutive CLP governments, because they had the same bias. They are conservative and they seek to perpetrate division. You can malign people or you can justly say that things can be improved. I say to you, Minister, that it will be done through cooperation, not myths. It will be done by negotiation, not litigation. It will be done by people sitting down together-and I hope you are; I am sure you are-for the purpose of being able to do that. I look forward to the results of those communications, consultations and negotiations.

I too want to make it clear that I am about seeking reform in a cooperative way. I do want to work positively with the Northern Territory government and with the land councils.

245,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous7812 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 be able to see whether there is, amongst the new government in the Northern Territory and the land councils, a willingness to recognise that they are stakeholders in relation to this legislation, as there are other stakeholders, and that there is a window of opportunity for reform or else the opportunity to continue the adversarial approach of the past-which I think in part was exemplified by some of the comments by the member for Lingiari. I take the opportunity to thank the member for Fremantle, the member for Grey and the member for Lingiari for acknowledging that this legislation today is uncontroversial and that it has a particular purpose-that is, to schedule certain lands where it has been agreed by all the stakeholders that title should be assumed for four new areas of land that will be now brought within schedule 1 and will be Aboriginal land held in traditional terms and for the benefit of Aboriginal people. I am glad that we were able to get this legislation through, and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the Senate, because there are benefits that Indigenous people will derive through the implementation of the legislation. Having brought forward legislation that is an agreed outcome, in my second reading speech I made it very clear that this legislation is in need of repair and needs to be the subject of significant amendment. I heard in all of the speeches today a recognition of that point. The point is that, once you have agreed there is a need for reform, you then have to ask yourself: how can you move it forward? I took the view some time ago that this is not going to move forward if there is an adversarial approach taken. I know the realities: the realities are that there will not be changes initiated by this government that will pass both houses unless the Northern Territory government, the land councils, the Labor Party, or perhaps the minor parties in the Senate agree to the passage of the changes. If the major stakeholders are not agreed then change will not ensue. In April this year I issued a discussion paper. It was a very comprehensive paper outlining the sorts of issues that have been raised in relation to land councils, such as whether there should be new land councils. There have been a number of communities and traditional owners at various times who have sought-as we saw in the Tiwi case in particular, but it has been sought in other cases as well-new land councils, which were agreed to by a former Labor administration. There is nothing magic about whether or not there are new land councils. If people want to be able to have councils which they think are going to be more responsive to them, I do not see why we should stand in the way, and I do not know whether legislation should be so prescriptive that it makes achieving those changes almost impossible. I think it is an area in which reform can be looked at. But there may be people in those existing land councils who do not wish to lose some of the authority that they have now, and any fragmentation may impact upon them. I understand that people will bring forward those views, but let us have a look and see how we can have a body that is responsive to the views of traditional owners. That is what I have sought. I think there is a recognition that that reform is necessary. There has been a response from the larger land councils saying that maybe what we should be doing is regionalising. In the options paper I have also recorded how we might be able to pick up those sorts of ideas in a reform process. In relation to exploration and mining, all of the parties have acknowledged that there is a need for change. The member for Lingiari made that clear in his own comments. He talked about warehousing as a potential problem. There are a number of problems in relation to selection of companies, negotiation time frames, negotiations unresolved after certain time frames and whether there should be a veto or agreement, exploration agreements, the reasonableness of agreements, whether there should be a moratorium period, how to prevent wareWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7813 housing and what the role of the Commonwealth minister ought to be. These are important questions. In the options paper I have suggested a number of ways forward which people can talk about. We have talked about economic development and how you might promote it for the benefit of Indigenous people. The point was made today that the situation in the Northern Territory, where land has been in the hands of Indigenous people for a very long period of time, is no different from what we are seeing in other parts of Australia. Let me just make the point that it ought to be different if people have had control of their own lands for such a substantial period of time and there is the prospect of economic developments and those developments have not ensued. There is also the use of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Fund. The trust fund has benefited from mining developments in the past but it is not being renewed. The fund is diminishing and yet people want to make increasing demands upon that fund. I am concerned that the birth right of Indigenous Australians is going to be whittled away by very large, bureaucratic organisations that continue to ask for more and more funds from the benefits fund. There are issues in relation to the distribution formula, land council funding, the possible reforms to improve the operation of royalty associations-land councils have raised this-and possible reforms to the amount for the benefit of the Northern Territory Aboriginal people. There are issues, which I think need to be looked at, in relation to finalising outstanding claims and the land commissioner’s powers. There are issues, which I also think can be looked at, in relation to the role of the Northern Territory government and devolution. There are issues in relation to compulsory acquisition of interests in Aboriginal land for public purposes and the clarification of the application of Northern Territory laws. In other words, there is a whole range of issues that can be the subject of sensible discussion. I know that some people would like me to take a definitive approach, outline what the Commonwealth’s position is and say, ‘That is our position and we are going to ram it through.’ My view is that that approach would not work. It is one of the reasons why I have been to the land councils and the Northern Territory government. I do not know what behaviour of mine might have been of concern to the land councils, as suggested by the member for Fremantle, but if she is saying that the view I have put that there ought to be a negotiated approach-and my efforts to encourage them to do that-is in some way a behavioural issue, I am interested in that. However, I have sought to ensure that the improvements which I think are possible are agreed-but they have to be agreed with all the stakeholders. I note that the member for Lingiari qualified himself as being the person most expert in relation to Northern Territory land rights legislation. Apparently he was not expert enough to know that I was in the parliament when the legislation was enacted. I chaired the first joint select committee reviewing the land rights legislation before it was actually implemented to ensure that it would meet its stated purpose. I guess he was not aware that I have been closely following these things over some 25 years. That may suggest that he has perhaps come to the scene a little more recently. The point I want to make is that I do not dissemble or mislead in relation to matters on which I comment. The point I have made about no new mining developments proceeding under this legislation was well taken. I understand that the member has tabled, with my consent, a document which suggests that mining developments have come to fruition after the enactment of this legislation. I will be interested to have a look at it. The advice I have received is that those mining developments which have been completed-beyond the Granites Mine that was essentially approved from the exploration stage after the Northern Territory land rights legislation was passed-were developments initiated before the legislation was put in place. 7814 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 The member for Lingiari claims that this legislation has not stood in the way of developments that it was agreed would proceed before the legislation was enacted and which, because of the time frame over which they are implemented, were developed in those latter stages during the period of this legislation. To include those in a list is, I think, misleading. The point I have been making is that, if you look at the implementation of this legislation and the initiation under this legislation of an exploration which finds a deposit and then enables that deposit, once identified, to be the subject of a development and then the implementation of a mine, only one such development has proceeded. That is the point that I have made. I believe the point is well taken. It is not meant to create any particular animosity. It is simply meant to demonstrate that, if legislation imposes a lot of barriers that have to be passed and some of those barriers are operating in a way that is inhibiting development which can benefit Indigenous people, that legislation ought to be looked at. The point that has come out of this debate today is the point that I have been making all along, and that is that there is a need for reform. It needs goodwill. I have given time for people to demonstrate-this paper was out in April. I have given people time to reflect upon the issues that have been raised. I have put all the options down on the table so that people can look at them. AndI have said, ‘We need to have sensible discussion, not posturing, about identifying where we can agree, and it might be possible to achieve meaningful reforms.’ That is what I would like to see. I recognise that there has been a change in the atmosphere in the Northern Territory, but the change in atmosphere is not enough if it is not matched by results. I will give more time for this to happen. I recognise what the Chief Minister has said to me, that they are a new government, that they have their own priorities, that they want to try and establish with their own priorities the speed with which they will deal with these sorts of issues. I am prepared to accommodate that. But I do not think it is reasonable to use that as a basis for putting this matter on the backburner so that it is never addressed. There may be people in the Northern Territory who take the view that, if you can keep it going long enough and you can stop any change long enough, one day in the distant future there may again be a change of government and then it will be in our hands to be able to do it. They might be saying that to themselves. should not be able to make assumptions about those sorts of matters. Certainly, in terms of the implementation of realistic policy, I do not think the interests of all of the stakeholders in the Northern Territory ought to be disadvantaged by people taking a strategic position that cooperation should be withheld in order to be able to deal with these sorts issues at some time when we think we are going to be in power and might be able to deal with them. I think people of goodwill ought to demonstrate that goodwill by being prepared to sit down and discuss all the points that have been raised in the discussion paper and to outline where agreement might be possible. I think that should be able to be achieved-I make that point. I will seek it and I will continue to work for it. This legislation we are dealing with today is evidence that beneficial outcomes can be achieved. And this legislation and its passage ought to be seen as an effort on the part of this government to demonstrate its willingness to work with land councils, with the Northern Territory government, with miners, with fishermen, with all of the stakeholders in the Northern Territory, to get an improved result. I am not wedded to particular reports or their outcomes; what I am looking for is agreement. I notice people condemn the Reeves report-we saw a lot of that today. I simply note that Reeves was not one, as a former member of parliament, who",141,Representatives Main Committee

Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 amend the excise legislation to deal with the case where manufacturers lower the alcohol content of a product while labelling the product at a higher alcohol strength, taking advantage of a loophole in the food labelling standards. Both the brewers and the spirits industry support these changes. Labor also supports these bills. Under the current excise legislation, excise duty is imposed on the actual alcohol strength, not the labelled strength, of excisable alcoholic beverages. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code allows for a variation between labelled strength and actual strength for alcoholic beverages consumed in Australia. Consequently, there is a potential loss of revenue when manufacturers reduce the alcohol content of a product and pay excise on the content while labelling their product at a higher alcohol strength allowed by the food standards legislation. Manufacturers who pay excise duty on the basis of actual strength and not the labelled strength, where the actual strength is lower than it says on the label, can gain a competitive advantage. Treasury believes that currently some manufacturers of RTDs label their beverages with an alcohol content of five per cent when they have an actual content of 4½ per cent. To prevent this practice from spreading throughout the industry, the government has decided to charge excise duty on the labelled alcohol content where the labelled strength exceeds the actual alcoholic content. Currently, the Excise Act 1901 does not have a method for determining the alcohol content of a beverage. A new provision will give the commissioner the power to determine, by instrument in writing, the rules of the determination of the alcohol content. In making the rules for working out the alcohol strength of beverages, the commissioner may make different determinations for different classes of alcoholic beverages. I understand that Treasury anticipates that the commissioner will make the rules in consultation with the manufacturers.",144,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Cox (Kingston) (10.55 A.m.),"The Excise Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and7816 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 While it is obviously desirable to accurately label the content of excised alcohol products, removing the incentive for manufacturers to reduce the alcohol content of their product may result in the alcohol content of some products rising, with some health implications. However, it is not good public policy to deceive people, and exaggerating on the label the alcohol content of a product is not an appropriate way of manipulating people to consume less alcohol. There is a valid public policy objective in encouraging people to reduce their alcohol consumption where that consumption has negative implications for their health. Responsible sections of the alcohol industry call this ‘encouraging people to enjoy in moderation’. Public policy responses include education, programs to address substance abuse, and the use of taxation to discourage consumption. Unfortunately, these approaches do not, either individually or collectively, provide more than a partial solution to the problem, because there are many factors that contribute to alcoholism. One of the things that state and federal governments have done over the years is to encourage moderation by giving people a price signal in favour of low-alcohol beer. As I said in debate on the last set of excise and customs bills, there is an argument for extending concessional excise treatment to low-alcohol RTDs, or ready-to-drink products. When I made a suggestion about low-alcohol products, the government responded to me by saying that the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia had put up some proposals which they costed at $82 million. Alcohol taxation is complex. The current situation is set out on the department’s web site. Presently we have a situation where beer which is in individual containers not exceeding 48 litres in size and has an alcohol content not exceeding three per cent by volume is taxed at $28.95 per litre of alcohol, calculated on the amount by which the alcohol content by volume exceeds 1.15 per cent. Beer in individual containers not exceeding 48 litres in size, with an alcohol content exceeding three per cent but not exceeding 3½ per cent by volume, is taxed at $33.75 per litre of alcohol, calculated on the amount by which the alcohol content by volume exceeds 1.15 per cent. Beer in individual containers not exceeding 48 litres, with an alcohol content exceeding 3½ per cent by volume, is taxed at $33.75 per litre of alcohol, calculated on the amount by which the alcohol content by volume exceeds 1.15 per cent. Beer in individual containers exceeding 48 litres, with an alcohol content not exceeding three per cent by volume, is taxed at $5.78 per litre of alcohol, calculated on the amount by which the alcohol content by volume exceeds 1.15 per cent. Beer in individual containers exceeding 48 litres, with an alcohol content exceeding three per cent but not exceeding 3½ per cent by volume, is taxed at $18.16 per litre of alcohol, calculated on the amount by which the alcohol content by volume exceeds 1.15 per cent. But other alcoholic beverages not exceeding 10 per cent alcohol content, including ready-to-drink or pre-mixed spirits, are taxed at $33.75 per litre of alcohol. Brandy is taxed at $53.38 per litre of alcohol. Fruit brandy, whisky, rum and liqueurs are taxed at $57.17 per litre of alcohol. Other spirits and alcoholic beverages exceeding 10 per cent alcohol content are also taxed at $57.17 per litre of alcohol. The effect of lowering the excise on low-alcohol spirit RTDs might well be to increase the market share of spirits at the expense of the brewers and government revenue, without resulting in a substantial reduction in alcohol consumption. Change relative prices, and consumers may change their choice of product but they will not necessarily change their basic consumption behaviour. This is called a substitution effect. Debate about alcohol taxation has usually been aimed at achieving these substitution effects, increasing one product’s market share at the expense of another by adjusting the relative tax levels. Since there are different excise reWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7817 gimes for spirits and beer, and since wine is taxed on value, there is plenty of opportunity for the various protagonists to mount arguments that are convenient for them. However, the tax regimes for the various products have a history, and the differentials have proven quite resilient over time. Changes have been at the margin to achieve revenue and other objectives, and I expect that changes will continue to take place at the margin. There are two areas where there is scope for adjustment of the current taxation of alcohol. The first is the absence of a low-tax regime for low-alcohol products other than low-alcohol beer. The Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia proposed a similar regime apply to low-alcohol RTD products as will apply to low-alcohol beer when the most recent excise and customs bills to go through the House eventually become law-that is, a tax-free threshold for the first 1.15 per cent of alcohol in a product; an excise concession for low-alcohol beer, whether draught or packaged; and an excise concession for mid-strength draught product but not for midstrength packaged product. The cost of these three measures is, as the government has already pointed out, very high. While a tax-free threshold of 1.15 per cent of alcohol by volume would accommodate very low-alcohol products, it would represent a tax cut for other spirit products. DSICA suggested an option of adjusting the rate of excise to compensate for that loss of revenue, but that is not what they were asking for in the first instance. There is, as I said in the debate on the previous customs and excise bills, an argument on health grounds for lower tax to apply to low-alcohol products to at least provide an incentive for their consumption over full-strength products, as is the case with beer. I would be interested in hearing the views of both the spirits industry and the wine industry on this and how it should be funded. This debate could be very constructive, particularly if each sector of the industry is prepared to examine how its own tax regime could be adjusted to encourage consumption of low-alcohol products and does not expect the relativities to be changed so that they can be funded by other sections of the industry. Australia is a country where social drinking is the norm. Connoisseurs of fine wines and spirits aside, there would be real benefits from giving people the choice and an incentive to choose low-alcohol products to consume in social situations. The other alcohol tax change that is overdue is reform to the wine equalisation tax, WET. Last year I chaired Labor’s wine tax committee. The other members were the member for Hunter, Senator Sherry, the member for Bass and the member for Cowan. BeforeI go any further I should declare, as I did in the committee’s report, an interest: I am an independent grape grower but my interests do not extend to winemaking-and I do not expect them to for quite some time, if ever! Wine is not subject to an excise; it is subject to an ad valorem tax of 29 per cent. With the new WET and the GST, Australia has the most heavily taxed wine industry in the world. The wine industry has both big and small producers and makes both value and premium wines. Views on the taxation of wine have been divided within the industry for many years. The industry was united on nothing other than its collective opposition to action by successive governments to increase the level of taxation on wine. Small winemakers, particularly in WA and Tasmania, have traditionally shared with the spirits industry a view that wine should be taxed by volume of alcohol. That would reduce the tax on premium wines. Winemakers, both big and small, in the other states have taken the view that ad valorem taxation should be maintained. Ad valorem taxation at the current rate has meant value wines are relatively low taxed on a comparison of tax per standard drink. Premium wines, at about $15 a bottle, are relatively highly taxed on a standard drink basis but are not as highly taxed as brandy and spirits. But super premium wines are the most highly taxed alcoholic beverages on both a 7818 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 standard drink and an absolute basis. I understand that one of the reasons that the Howard government set the WET in the way it did was because it did not want to see the price of Grange Hermitage and Hill of Grace fall as a result of the introduction of its new tax system. The wine industry felt it was disadvantaged by the introduction of the WET, and that if it had been a wine equalisation tax and not an wine increase tax it would have been struck at 24½ per cent and not 29 per cent. After extensive consultation with the industry in all states, Labor’s wine tax committee found that there were two wine industries: small wineries with high cost structures and no economies of scale in either production or marketing, and large wineries with very low cost structures and huge market power. The small wineries have been responsible for the resurgence of many country towns, regional areas and the image of the industry. The large wineries have led Australia’s massive growth in wine exports. Each is dependent on the other, and a wine tax that favours one group over the other would not benefit the industry as a whole. The people on the Labor Party’s wine tax committee came from Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and the Hunter, so we basically represented a group of interests and were aware of the sorts of problems that the industry as a whole is facing. The committee identified very early in the process that with the introduction of a federal wine equalisation tax there were going to be no exemptions from the old state liquor franchise fees that had prevailed before. One of the first things that the committee did, at the suggestion of the member for Hunter, was to propose that there be an exemption from the WET for small wineries. We were unsure as to how to set that exemption. Labor first proposed an exemption for a wholesale value of about $100,000. When the Prime Minister did his deal with Senator Lees to get the whole of the new tax system package through, the government agreed that they would adopt an exemption and set that exemption at about $300,000. The Treasurer then spent a considerable amount of time trying to renege on that deal, and he was partially successful in the end. After many months of agitation by the Labor Party, and with the Democrats having completely given up, the Treasurer one day rang Senator Lees-I suspect at the behest of the Prime Minister. He called Senator Lees and Senator Murray around to his office and they had a meeting, which I understand lasted for a couple of hours while they thrashed out something that was supposed to approximate the deal that the Prime Minister had done with Senator Lees to get the tax package through. That was a system not of exemptions but of rebates and it was a system that was shared between the states and the Commonwealth, so the states were left with the cost of their rebates and the Commonwealth offered a top-up taking the value of the two rebates to $300,000. This left the winemakers in a difficult situation-it was a rebate and not an exemption. They had to have the working capital to pay the tax. They had to contend with the paperwork required to go through the process of claiming the rebate and had to claim the rebate from two different levels of government. It was a rather awkward way of going about instituting a fairly simple promise that had been made by the Prime Minister. The Labor Party maintained the view that it ought to be an exemption and, in fact, moved amendments to make sure that it was an exemption. One of the ironies of the whole process was Senator Lees voting against a Labor Party amendment to implement the promise that she had extracted from the Prime Minister. Eventually the legislation passed as a rebate. The wine industry over the course of our deliberations had four different policies. One of the things that struck me very early in the discussions that we were having was the difference between the large wineries and the small wineries and their cost structures. We were going Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7819 around vineyards in Tasmania and most of the ones we visited had a winery building and a few acres-and I do mean a few acres, in some cases two or three acres-of grapes stretching up a hill. remember most clearly the level of production: they were picking grapes and putting them in shopping baskets. They were then putting them into a crusher which had a mouth on it probably less than a foot across. It was very small-scale production with probably fewer than 50 barrels to hold the stock. Obviously, on that basis, it is not a huge and profitable industry. In fact, a lot of small wineries were arguing that from a $20 bottle of wine, after they took out their costs and after they paid their tax, they were getting back only about 50c, which is pretty cruel. It is pretty hard to market from a small winery, and that is one of the reasons I would say to the parliamentary secretary that I would not be in a hurry to go into the small winemaking business. It is a battle to get shelf space; you do not have the marketing advantages that the big wineries do. The big wineries can do a deal with a liquor chain and can unload a lot of wine very quickly and expeditiously. Small wineries just cannot get the shelf space, and they wind up with a marketing technique that involves going to restaurants and selling out of the boot of the car. They are totally dependent on cellar door sales and on mail order. They face a completely different world from that of the big wineries. The big wineries can in some cases produce wine almost as cheaply as you can bottle water and can get it distributed and sold at remarkably low prices. There really are two different industries. It struck me fairly early in our deliberations that one way of solving the cost problem for the small wineries and perhaps encouraging them not to advocate volumetric taxation, which would have been to the huge disadvantage of the large wineries and grape growers producing non-premium grapes in the big irrigation areas, was to offer them an exemption. It is worth mentioning that changing cropping in those areas from citrus and other products to grapesputting them on microdrip irrigation and things like that-has enormous environmental benefits relative to other crops in dealing with salinity and reducing water consumption, and you do not want to discourage people from converting to grapes in the irrigation areas. So we would be able to solve the volumetric ad valorem debate within the wine industry by offering the small wineries a decent and appropriate level of exemption. You can debate what that level should be, and there were some people in the industry who had fairly large notions of what a small winery was and of how big the exemption should be. We realised that if it were set at a dollar level there would always be pressure on government to index the exemption; otherwise it would be eroded, and it would be much smoother and much more efficient to set it as an exemption for production of a certain number of litres of wine. We dealt with suggestions from the industry for an exemption of up to a million litres of production. I did not think that would constitute a small winery, and I said so to the Winemakers Federation board. I was pleased that a lot of people in the Winemakers Federation did not think a million litres would constitute a small winery either; the upper bound of their negotiation was about 600,000 litres. We had this committee, and the Winemakers Federation went through four different policies while we were deliberating. They eventually came to a policy very similar to the one we advocated. Our committee recommended-and I will only read the recommendations that relate to the wine equalisation tax-that we adopt as a policy an ad valorem tax regime for wine and that we maintain the wine equalisation tax at 29 per cent of wholesale value. It was absolutely a",145,Representatives Main Committee

At one of those wineries I can7820 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 red-letter day when the Winemakers Federation walked into my office and said that they were prepared to drop 24½ per cent as an ambition and go for 29 per cent WET because it made the whole thing a lot less expensive and more doable. Our committee also recommended that we adopt a policy of replacing the current state and federal rebates for cellar door and mail order sales with a WET exemption for all wineries set at an appropriate threshold expressed in litres on domestic sales; that we join with the wine industry in a campaign for the immediate adoption of this new structure for the taxation of wine; and that we hold discussions with the wine industry on possible arrangements for a phased implementation, subject to budgetary conditions of a WET exemption at an appropriate level, in the event that the current government rejects the proposal. This report came out just before the election, and the Winemakers Federation passed a resolution saying that they agreed with the report, subject to setting a satisfactory level for the exemption. In the election campaign, we proposed the option of small wineries taking an exemption if they had production up to 50,000 litres. The Howard government proposed no such exemption. In fact, the only thing that they offered the wine industry was a committee. That committee has subsequently been set up and given terms of reference which do not include wine taxation. The terms of reference include tourism and exports but they specifically do not include wine taxation. The committee has been doing some touring, and the issue raised everywhere is the level of wine taxation. It is time that the government seriously looked at the exemption situation and tried to put it on a regularised basis that does not create a situation where they are asking the states to pay a rebate on a federal tax, when the Commonwealth keeps all of the proceeds of the federal tax. With a glut likely to occur in the production of grapes over the next few years because of all the plantings that have taken place recently-this did not bite in the last harvest except in some irrigation areas because there was relatively low production due to weather and other circumstances across south-eastern Australia-it would be very timely for the government to address this issue and to make sure that our small wineries, which are feeling the cost pressures, are put on a basis that is as sustainable and as healthy as possible. I am very interested in the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration’s response to this important issue. My Labor Party colleagues and I have set up another wine committee. This time it is not a wine tax committee but a wine committee to progress issues-whether they are issues about trade, tourism, wine tax or research-which will benefit the wine industry. There are 15 members of this committee. It is chaired by the new member for Ballarat, who is a very energetic and forthright advocate for the industry. The first thing that we are doing is writing to every winery in Australia, sending them a copy of this wine tax report and reminding them that this is an issue that the government is not addressing and has specifically decided to ignore in the context of the review that it promised at the last election. stration) (11.24 a.m.)-in reply-I want to thank the honourable member for Kingston for his speech which, in many respects, was well removed from the particular provisions of the Excise Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002.

251,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7821 doubt she will find the comments made by the honourable member for Kingston somewhat interesting. In his speech the member for Kingston referred, of course, to the taxation of wine, and it is correct to say that the industry views are divided. The fact is that across the industry as a whole the wine industry pays significantly lower tax than the spirits industry. The wine industry itself commissioned a study that found that the price and tax effects predicted in A New Tax System were very closely delivered following tax reform-that is, the 29 per cent WET produced outcomes predicted. The member for Kingston also spoke about cellar door rebates versus exemption. I want to point out to the honourable member that the cellar door rebate system is a targeted measure to assist small producers, and the exemption mechanism could be exploited by artificial means of company splitting to qualify a number of times. The existing rebate is directly tied to small wineries operating at cellar doors as a means to encourage regional economies and also tourism. I imagine the member for Kingston would applaud that particular aim. The member for Kingston also referred to the possibility of extending concessional treatment to low-alcohol ready-to-drink products-that is, the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia option-similar to low-alcohol beer. I want to place on the record that the government did consider alcohol tax at the time of tax reform, and we took external submissions into account. The RTD taxation is similar to but not exactly the same as for beer and, following tax reform, there were significant benefits to RTD producers, and the government has not announced or discussed further significant policy changes to alcohol taxation arrangements. Having said that, I did undertake to the honourable member that I would refer his comments to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, and I will do so. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code allows for a variation between label strength and actual strength for alcoholic beverages consumed in Australia. With the limits set by the code, manufacturers are allowed to label drinks with a higher alcohol content than they actually have. Without the changes in this bill, there is concern that the practice of overstating alcohol content on the label could spread because manufacturers may gain a competitive advantage from offering what looks like an expensive drink at a relatively low price. This also represents a risk to the revenue. A measure was therefore announced on budget night to deal with the problem. It affects only a small number of manufacturers at this stage but the concern is that other manufacturers may adopt the practice if it is not checked. The bill deals with the problem such that by changing the rule that currently applies the excise duty on excisable alcoholic beverages is calculated on the basis of the actual alcohol strength of the beverage. These two bills together will mean that excise duty will be charged on the basis of the alcohol content shown on the label of the bottle or can where the label’s strength exceeds the actual alcoholic content. For the purpose of this measure, an unlabelled alcoholic beverage-for example, beer in a keg-of the same kind as a labelled product such as bottled beer will be treated like the labelled product. The opportunity has also been taken to correct a long standing deficiency in the excise laws. The bills will give the commissioner the power to determine, by instrument in writing, rules for working out the content of alcohol in the beverage. The rules may specify sampling methods and permit unavoidable minor variations between the nominated or label strength and the actual strength as a result of the manufacturing process. I gather that the member for Kingston is actually supporting the bill, even though he did not talk on the bill. I commend the bill to the chamber.

NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 2002 Cognate bill: NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (FRANKING DEFICIT TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. rupted, the New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2002 is the third tranche of consolidations and it also contains further amendments arising from the new simplified imputation system. The minor additional bill dealing with the franking deficit tax makes further consequential amendments arising from the new imputation changes. The opposition support the principles underlying the bills before us today. We continue to have concerns with regard to the implementation of the reforms, but essentially we agree with the direction being taken in the bills and we will support them. However, given the extraordinary complexity of the consolidations measure, we will again seek to refer the bill containing the third consolidations tranche to the Economics Legislation Committee when it reaches the Senate. As for the previous tranches, we are happy to cooperate to undertake this further examination in a timely manner so that it is not held up unnecessarily. I will now turn to the detail of the bills. The consolidations measure aims to implement the Ralph recommendation that groups of wholly owned entities be permitted to choose to be taxed as a single entity rather than on an entity by entity basis. There have been two tranches of consolidations legislation so far. The first provided a broad overview of the consolidations measure and set out ongoing rules for joining an existing consolidated group. The second set out cost-setting rules for the initial formation of the consolidated group, the treatment of attribution accounts held in relation to interests in foreign entities, and the transfer and pooling of foreign tax credits. This third tranche contains further cost-setting rules to cater for consolidated groups and linked entities joining existing consolidated groups, and for trusts joining or leaving a consolidated group. It contains measures to address some revenue risks; modifications to allow a consolidated group to continue to exist even though the head company is replaced by a new shelf head company; consequential amendments to ensure that the core rules apply in an appropriate manner to multiple entry consolidated, or MEC, groups; and additional rules to deal with the attribution of income and deductions when a subsidiary is in a consolidated group for",150,Representatives Main Committee

It contains modifications to the removal of the existing grouping provisions to allow the transfer of losses between an Australian branch of a foreign bank and the head company, amendments to ensure that the thin capitalisation regime continues to operate as intended under the new consolidations regime, amendments to ensure that the existing provisions under income tax law for research and development deductions interact appropriately with the new consolidations regime, and technical corrections to the consolidations losses rules and the MEC group membership rules. The opposition has consistently supported the principle of consolidations to minimise compliance costs and to strengthen the integrity of the tax system, and we continue to do so. However, this is an extremely complex measure with very large revenue costs-over $1 billion over the forward estimates period. It is only proper that the parliament check that it works as well in the detail as it is claimed to work in principle. For the two previous tranches, the opposition has done this check through the Senate committee process, with speedy referrals through the Economics Legislation Committee. We will seek to do so again with this bill. This committee process has been very beneficial in bringing attention to difficulties hidden away in the detail of the previous tranches. I note, for example, that in the public hearing on the second tranche earlier this week, there were some very constructive discussions regarding the detail of various consolidations, value-shifting and demergers provisions. The government’s tardiness in bringing the measure forward means that it is now nearly four months after the proposed starting date, so we recognise the importance of making sure the legislation is not held up unnecessarily. Nevertheless, it is not just our right but our responsibility to apply substantive parliamentary scrutiny to the legislation, and we will do it. I note that it was initially expected that this third tranche would complete the consolidations measure. However, the government has now indicated that yet more legislation is required to be introduced later this year. Press reports have suggested that this remaining legislation is expected to be relatively minor, with the Corporate Tax Association being quoted as saying that the existing three tranches provide: ... 98 per cent of what’s needed to breathe life into these measures. However, I note that the government itself has been a little more cautious, with the EM stating only that the rest of the legislation will deal with: ... remaining discrete and specialist areas of the regime. The opposition and I would appreciate from the parliamentary secretary some more definitive advice from the government on how much more legislation we can expect on this measure. Do we really have 98 per cent of the measure before us or is it 90 per cent? Should we brace ourselves for a never-ending story-as it has been for the Ralph package as a whole, with measures being tacked on, revised or even abandoned according to the government’s fancy? At what stage can we be confident that the legislation provided to the parliament will really constitute a working whole, with subsequent legislation only providing detail? This will obviously affect our decision on whether the passage of the tranches currently before the parliament should be made contingent on the presentation of future legislation. We would appreciate this further advice as soon as possible. Possibly the parliamentary secretary could provide this at the conclusion of the debate. The main bill also contains further amendments to the existing income tax law arising from the new simplified imputation system. These relate to modifications to arrangements for the intercorporate dividend rebate, a broadening of the exemption from the benchmark rule for franking, provisions relating to distributions on non-share equity interests and some franking 7824 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 transitional rules. The amendments are not expected by the government to have any revenue impact. These appear to represent sensible and uncontroversial consequential reforms arising from the introduction of the new simplified imputation system and, accordingly, we will support them. There are some consequential amendments to the minor additional bill we are dealing with that relate to franking deficit tax liability. These are not expected to have any revenue impact either. The original bill was only introduced at the end of May, so it seems extraordinary that these changes could not have been foreseen at that time. Nevertheless, the substance of the amendments appears to be sensible and uncontroversial, and we will support them accordingly. Having dealt with the specifics of the bill, I would like to turn to a couple of thematic issues regarding business tax reform and the context in which we are considering these bills. I have noted already that the extraordinary complexity of the business tax legislation that has been coming forward from the government is causing concern. As an illustration, the business tax bills presenting the three consolidation tranches since May-that is, in the last five months-have come to over 650 pages of legislation and nearly 900 pages of explanatory memoranda. I understand that consolidation is a major measure and that these bills have covered some other substantive measures, such as the new value shifting regime. I also understand it is easy for people outside government to espouse simplicity. It is those inside who are ultimately responsible for protecting the revenue, and dealing with complex taxation concepts and transactions must, of necessity, introduce a base level of complexity to the drafting. Let me go even further and suggest that some business interests are prone to walk on both sides of the street on the question of tax simplicity. They say they want simplicity-which generally means principles based drafting, backed up by broad anti-avoidance measures-but they simultaneously want certainty, which generally means narrowly defined drafting and guaranteed safe harbours from tax scrutiny. SoI understand there is a very difficult balance to be struck. However, I am concerned the balance at present is not being struck correctly. We are increasingly seeing a bias in favour of more and more complexity. The clearest evidence of this is the continuing protests regarding the compliance burden imposed by the tax system on Australian business. In recent times we have had the extraordinary spectacle of Australia’s peak accounting bodies in open revolt against the compliance burden with respect to the GST, saying they have had enough of the ridiculous contortions imposed by the so-called simplified taxation system. This has been reinforced this week by evidence given to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the second tranche of the consolidations legislation. It highlighted very serious concerns regarding the start-up compliance costs imposed by this new consolidations regime, as well as the additional compliance burdens from the new value-shifting regime. I do not want to go to the detail of these concerns, but I note for the record that there does seem to be a serious storm brewing amongst tax professionals in the business tax area as well. I gather the government will be seeking to address these concerns through education programs for tax professionals and the like. However, if they were serious about the issue, they would seek to address the problem at its source-in the legislation itself. At the moment, it is simply not realistic to expect that a general interested reader or taxpayer will understand anything more than the highest level summary of the legislation. This is not good enough. It fails to do its proper duty to the parliament and, more particularly, to the public. In my view, a substantial part of the anger about the compliance costs imposed by recent tax changes has been precisely for this reason. Too many of these changes have been all but incomprehensible, even to those with a general understanding of tax and a detailed underWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7825 standing of their own financial affairs. A modest amount of tax-simplification prevention would surely be far better than millions of dollars of attempted tax-education cure. I believe more effort needs to be put into clearer, plain English expositions of the tax principles in the legislation itself and in the explanatory material prepared for the parliament. The aim should surely be to ensure that an interested general reader or taxpayer could follow the direction of the law not just for the overview of the legislation but for its significant components. I leave that as a challenge for the government to take up, perhaps initially through the Board of Taxation or through some independent body. Let me turn now to the second thematic issue that sets the context within which we are looking at this legislation: the overall revenue neutrality of the business tax reforms. On the expenditure side, when it comes to offering concessions to business interests, we have found that the Treasurer is always quick to open the Commonwealth’s purse. He spent $1 billion here on consolidations and another $1 billion there on restoring depreciation concessions, with hardly a second thought, but he has been noticeably tardier on measures in business tax reform that were designed to protect the revenue. In this vein, I welcome the modifications to the consolidations measure in this bill, which finally address some of the revenue integrity concerns pursued by the opposition in both houses and through the Senate committee process. There can be no doubt that these modifications have come about thanks to the rigour of the parliamentary process acting as it should. It emphasises yet again the critical importance of allowing time for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of such complex legislation. As I indicated in the debate on the previous tranches of consolidations, Labor’s support for the Ralph reform package has always been on the clear condition of revenue neutrality. We all know now that this condition has not been met. It is just another in the long list of the Howard-Costello government’s broken promises. I am sure the Treasurer wishes the issue would just fade away. Despite repeated requests in this House and in the Senate, the Treasurer still refuses to release any updated estimates on the true cost of business tax reform. Of course, it will not just fade away as an issue because questions of revenue underpin almost every decision that a government makes, and the Treasurer himself knows that. After all, he was quoted in London recently as saying: ... the biggest gripe that theyand by ‘they’ he meant finance ministershave is that when they’re in a Cabinet there are generally sixteen or seventeen people who want to spend money and one that wants to save it and this is an occupational hazard of Finance Ministers which we all have in common and share around the world. This should be treated with the usual scepticism that applies to the Treasurer’s portrayal of his heroic solo efforts. After all, each year we see the newspapers reporting that the Treasurer dashes out his budget speeches in longhand from scratch on the weekend before the budget is released. But at least the quote does show that the Treasurer is aware of the critical importance that fiscal discipline plays in responsible governance. Unfortunately, it does not seem to have been working in practice for the government. As my colleague the member for Kingston has been pointing out, the government’s response to every bump in the road has been to loosen fiscal policy on the expenditure side and to turn to a new tax to fund the gap they have created. The problem with fiscal discipline for any government, of course, is that it is hard. There are always many more worthy causes for the spending of public money than money to spend on them. This means that each and every spending choice, whether by direct government 7826 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 payment or equivalently by the government deciding to offer tax concessions, must be considered with equal rigour within the fiscal framework. This is the rigour that needs to be applied to legislation such as this concerning business tax as well as to orthodox expenditure propositions. Let me emphasise that this does not mean we are intrinsically hostile to requests for special incentives, grants or concessions from business interests; it is just that we believe they should be scrutinised with the same rigour as calls for spending from other sectors in the community. We continue to be open to being convinced on the merits of expenditure proposals in business tax reform to improve national economic welfare. However, we will continue to weigh their relative priority carefully against all other priorities both from within that sector and more broadly across the whole of the economy. This is where the condition of revenue neutrality for the overall Ralph package comes in. It was a clear and direct fiscal test in the Treasurer’s own portfolio and it is one that he has failed comprehensively. It is no wonder he will not release the updated balance sheet on business tax reform. He knows that the revenue will come up short, and the shortfall is being made up through increased taxation elsewhere. After all, it does not look good when you are applying for a new job to have to admit your results were not too flash in the last one. The problem for the Treasurer is that in his job there are external examinations, so the impact of his actions will show up eventually. Just last month, his final assessment for last year came in: a budget which has gone $1.3 billion into deficit at a time when the economy continues to grow strongly and at a time in the budget cycle when you would expect the budget to be in surplus. This $1.3 billion deficit is despite the Commonwealth now being the highest taxing Commonwealth government in Australia’s history. We learnt recently that the budget would have gone a further billion dollars into deficit if the losses from currency swaps had been properly brought to account. There is no doubt that this weakening of the budget has severely compromised Australia’s options for genuine economic reform into the future. The opposition supports the principles underlying these bills. They are sensible extensions of business tax reform. However, given the complexity of the consolidations measure and its significant revenue implications, it is our intention to apply further and rigorous parliamentary scrutiny to that bill by referring it to the Economics Legislation Committee when it comes before the Senate. It is my understanding that it is the government’s wish that the two bills be kept together to avoid any timing issues. We are happy to respect this and move for them to be referred to the committee together. I understand the Senate’s processes. Formally it will go there when we pass it but they make decisions about whether it will go earlier. I accept that the parliamentary secretary is correct about that. I simply make the point for the record here in the Main Committee that it is our intention to refer the principal bill. If, as I understand it, the government wants both the bills, then we are happy to have them both referred-although, as I have said, the franking deficit bill seems to us to be quite minor. I note that the government has again needed to bring forward last-minute corrections to the bill. Given that we intend to refer the bill for Senate committee scrutiny in any event, we do not intend holding up the passage of the bill because we have not been able to assess the merit or significance of these corrections. But I think it does underline yet again the issue regarding the increasing complexity of these bills. Even the government does not seem to understand them when it brings them forward. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the general reservations we have in the broad about the process of business tax reform, the measures in these particular bills have our support in principle. We will support them in the House and subject them to scrutiny in the Senate where, depending upon the outcome of that scrutiny, we expect them to pass. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7827 Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.52 a.m.)-I welcome the chance to speak on the New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Amendment Bill 2002. The consolidation and other measures bill follows the May act and the June bill, both dealing with the rules for consolidations. BeforeI discuss the bill in detail I would like to address a couple of the comments made by the member for Fraser, who was concerned about the compliance burden on businesses, and point out that the bill goes a long way towards addressing those compliance burdens. I also quote, in relation to those comments, from an article from the Financial Review of Saturday 17 March 2001: The Treasurer’s office asked the Corporate Tax Association, which represents Australia’s largest companies on tax matters, to survey its members about whether they wanted tax consolidation. Eighty per cent replied that they did. SoI believe that this bill and these measures go ahead with the broad support of our corporate community. The member for Fraser also commented that the average taxpayer has difficulty understanding complex tax measures. Of course that is the case, particularly when you consider that the average individual does not operate a business through wholly owned groups of consolidated companies. I support the rewritten taxation act. The new income tax act of 1997 has rewritten substantial provisions in plain English. People in my own electorate of Farrer who consult the act directly on land care provisions and other pieces of legislation that apply to them in their farming enterprises have no trouble understanding the plain English words of the act. For most corporate groups the measures in the bill will provide the necessary legislation to enable them to go ahead and consolidate. Further legislation introduced later this year will deal with remaining specialist areas of consolidation. During 2001 significant draft legislation on business tax reform was put out for public comment. The Board of Taxation was set up to oversight the consultation process. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer is responsible for progressing various business tax reform measures, including the introduction of consolidation. It is useful at this point to give some background on what the consolidation regime is, how it works and what it means for taxpaying companies. From1 July 2002, eligible wholly owned groups can consolidate to form a single entity for income tax purposes. The head company pays pay-as-you-go instalments and self-assesses a single annual income tax liability on behalf of the whole group. Note that this is an income tax liability. Consolidation does not affect other tax obligations such as GST, FBT and pay-as-you-go withholding. A consolidated group can be formed by a single Australian resident head company and all its eligible wholly owned Australian resident subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may be companies, partnerships or trusts. A foreign owned group of Australian resident subsidiaries may be able to consolidate by forming a multiple-entry consolidated group. The head company of the consolidated group chooses for itself and all its subsidiaries to be treated as a consolidated group for income tax purposes. The decision to consolidate will usually remain in place until the head company ceases to be a head company. The subsidiary membership, however, may change from time to time. Participation is optional, but it is irrevocable. Consolidation simplifies the taxation of wholly owned groups and reduces compliance costs, because transactions between members of the group are ignored for income tax purposes; losses, franking credits and foreign tax credits are pooled; pay-as-you-go instalments are aligned with annual income tax obligations; and a single income tax return and pay-as7828 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 you-go instalments replace multiple reporting requirements for the entire group. Importantly, consolidation reduces opportunities for tax avoidance through loss creation and value shifting. Without legislation for consolidation, the income tax system treats each company in a wholly owned group as a separate entity, meaning that each entity must separately account for all transactions and debt and equity interests with each other. For business, this is costly and may obstruct formation of the most efficient business structures. The community may view existing grouping provisions as opportunities for tax avoidance through artificial arrangements. Consolidation will improve efficiency and reduce the cost of compliance by groups reorganising themselves and possibly ending the need for complex business structures. Most small businesses use straightforward business structures, and this legislation is unlikely to affect them. Similarly, sole traders are not affected by the legislation. Consolidation only becomes relevant when one company wholly owns at least one other business entity. The benefits of consolidation for a particular group will vary from group to group, but the compliance cost savings which should occur from not accounting for intragroup transfers for tax purposes and from not having to meet multiple pay-as-you-go instalment obligations should not be underestimated. The cost of compliance has sometimes been referred to as a deadweight cost, a deadweight loss. In other words, time and resources are spent providing information to the tax office. This information may not be of any use to the company for any other purpose. It may not be required under any accounting standard. Therefore, to be able to do away with it is a significant benefit to the company or entity concerned. Consolidation allows this by treating the wholly owned group as a single tax entity. This means that there can be income tax free movement of assets between entities, with no rollover requirements; the buyback of shares without triggering a capital gain or loss, thus simplifying equity restructuring in some circumstances; and the liquidation of a member entity without creating a deemed dividend or capital gain or loss. The existing grouping provisions for wholly owned groups will be removed from 1 July 2003. All businesses using these provisions should carefully analyse the consequences of not consolidating. If a group chooses not to consolidate, it will no longer be able to transfer losses or excess foreign tax credits between group members, transfer assets between members free of capital gain or use the intercorporate dividend rebate for franked or unfranked dividends. From1 July 2002, prospective buyers of an entity that is wholly owned by a company need consider the consolidation status of that company when making assessments as to its value. A buyer would need to be aware that an election to consolidate could have implications for who gets the losses and franking credits of the entity, what the cost base of the entity’s assets is and who is liable to pay tax for the period when the entity was part of the group. As part of the integrated tax design process, the ATO has consulted widely with business representatives and advisers and developed a blueprint of the steps to consolidation, known as the consolidation pathway. These steps are a useful guide for taxpayers. The steps cover choosing whether or not to consolidate; formation of a consolidated group; and operating as a consolidated group, which covers the responsibilities of the head company. To return to the legislation in question, the Minister for Revenue announced at its introduction that it: ... includes the important third stage measures in the progressive introduction of the consolidation regime into Parliament, and builds on the core consolidation platform introduced in May and June 2002. The minister also said: Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7829 The imputation measures contained in this Bill form part of the package of amendments needed to implement the new simplified imputation system which simplifies and gives more flexibility to companies franking dividends to shareholders. I commend the ATO and the minister for the way in which they have rolled out this complex tax legislation in a new inclusive way. Normally, legislation is introduced into parliament and eventually gets passed, and business runs around in a panic working out what it all means, how to use it and how to avoid getting penalised for doing the wrong thing. The process that saw the introduction of the consolidation measures was really a codesign of the legislation with industry groups and practitioners. Users of the legislation were shown it early on, were able to comment on it and had the opportunity to understand some of the problems. Codesign allows progressive development that takes into account the feedback of the users, who make an important contribution. A series of consultation forums and feedback workshops were held around Australia. I am pleased to say that regional areas were included; my own home town of Albury was a venue for one such as session. I took the opportunity to attend. It was well attended by local practitioners who had their say and had their input heard. I am sure they made the point with ATO representatives that they want the ATO off their backs and they want to be free to pursue the income earning activities of their businesses rather than have to deal with technicalities required by the tax office. This measure is an important step in that direction. To turn to some of the specifics of this particular piece of legislation, as stated the key measures of consolidation were contained in the May consolidation act and June consolidation bill. The measures in this bill will: modify apportionment rules for income and deductions where a subsidiary member of a group has only been consolidated for part of an income year; modify membership rules to ensure that a consolidated group will not cease to exist if a new head company replaces the existing head company; modify the general cost-setting rules in certain circumstances; complete the removal of the current grouping rules in relation to foreign tax credits, thin capitalisation, intercorporate dividend rebate and capital gains and losses; and make amendments to the May act and the June bill to address issues raised through consultation. This bill also contains amendments relating to the new simplified imputation system that commenced on 1 July 2002. The amendments are straightforward. They will remove the intercorporate dividend rebate, particularly for franked dividends paid within groups after 30 June 2003 as a consequence of the consolidation regime; broaden the exemptions to the rule which requires dividends paid by a company to be franked to the same extent; and provide transitional rules relating to franking periods for early and late balancing companies. The New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Amendment Bill 2002 will make minor and consequential amendments to the New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002. I will highlight some of the more important measures of the consolidation bill. Where a consolidated group joins another consolidated group, modifications are required to the basic rules of a single entity joining a consolidated group. Modifications expressed in this new law allow the consolidated group being acquired to be treated as a single entity for income tax purposes. This bill also allows special rules to work out the tax cost-setting amounts when trusts join or leave a consolidated group. Additional measures prevent unintended tax benefits being received when the cost-setting rules are applied. Modifications to consolidation rules contained in the May act and the June bill were made as a result of the consultation processes. Changes to the membership rules will ensure that a consolidated group will not cease to exist even though the head company is replaced by a new 7830 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 shelf head company-for example, those who wish to implement a Wallis report recommendation that an Australian bank should be able to interpose a non-operating holding company between the bank and its shareholders. The consolidated group will continue to exist, with the former head company as a subsidiary member and the interposed or shelf company as the new head company of the group. Changes to existing capital gains tax rollover relief for shareholders involved in a share exchange are also proposed after consultation with external advisers. The changes will help reduce unnecessary compliance costs by preserving a consolidated group where nothing of substance has changed within the group. The group will not have to apply cost-setting rules, including the tedious process of obtaining market valuations. This bill also explains rules that apply to multiple entry consolidated groups. Specific modifications are needed to take into account the special characteristics of MEC groups. Unlike a consolidated group, an MEC group does not have an Australian resident head company but has two or more so-called tier 1 companies that are similar to the head company of a group. The modifications ensure that these tier 1 companies are treated as if they were the head company from a cost-setting perspective. I referred previously to part-year rules. The existing provisions that split income and deductions between an entity that joins or leaves a consolidated group part way through the year and the head company do not deal with amounts that relate to a period of time; they only deal with amounts that relate to a single moment when income is derived or an expense is incurred. These amendments apportion amounts of an entity’s assessable income and deductions that are spread over more than one income year by splitting them between the entity and the head company of a consolidated group that it joins or leaves in the year. The split is based on how much of the year the entity spent in the group. This bill amends and upgrades various taxation acts following the introduction of the consolidation measures and reflecting changes to the law around capital gains tax rollover relief for asset transfers between group members. In addition, the Income Tax Assessment Act will be modified to make sure that it operates appropriately in respect of loss transfers between an Australian branch of a foreign bank and the head company of a consolidated group. As part of a new tax system, a new thin capitalisation regime was introduced. The objective of this regime is to ensure that multinational entities do not allocate excessive amounts of debt to their Australian operations. Following introduction of the consolidation regime, a number of amendments are required to ensure that the thin capitalisation rules continue to operate as intended. The final amendment contained in the present bill that I would like to discuss relates to research and development provisions. It is important that the R&D regime interacts properly with the consolidation provisions, so that the policy intent behind both is preserved. Our income tax law contains a number of provisions that aim to encourage companies to invest in R&D activities. Amendments ensure that a head company qualifies for R&D deductions while any of its subsidies do, and that the expenditure history needed to access some R&D deductions is not affected by consolidation history rules. In conclusion, in commending this bill, I remind members that in continuing to implement the new consolidation regime the bill provides for the ongoing implementation of business tax reform arising from recommendations contained in the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. No-one can deny that the performance of the Australian economy in the world economic environment of 2001 and 2002 to date has been outstanding. All this occurred at a time when we were implementing the greatest tax change in Australia’s history. For most of 2001 the Labor Party was claiming that Australia would go into a recession as a consequence of the GST. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7831 Perhaps they thought that due to the world economy’s downturn they could score political points by blaming a downturn here in Australia on tax reform. The downturn never happened, but the Labor Party continued to campaign against tax reform. This government had the courage to persist and to take the difficult decisions needed to address the tax reform that the country needs. We are continuing with reform. We know that business, industry and their advisers have a great deal to cope with all of the changes. I suppose that is what happens when you have such a long period-the period of the previous Labor government, when no changes were made-when the government was simply too timid to take the necessary hard decisions. We appreciate the challenges faced in coming to terms with new tax law, and the full public consultation process we have developed and illustrated in respect of consolidations is a good example of our response to this. This government will continue working to create a modern, competitive and fair tax system in keeping with the modern, intelligent nation that we have become. I commend the bill to the House. ness Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2002, because it is designed to encourage a business climate conducive to investment. Investment creates jobs, and jobs are critical in helping to provide the capacity for individuals to take care of their own lives and in helping to provide that satisfaction which comes from people being able to work and be in control of their own affairs. I am also pleased to support this bill because it is about the government’s commitment to business simplification through tax simplification. It is the continuation of a process which has gone on for some years now. In particular, it builds on the work of the May consolidation act and the June consolidation bill, which have passed through or are passing through this House respectively. Thirdly, I am pleased to speak in support of this bill because it contains provisions which address revenue risks that have been foreshadowed by the government. Looking at these questions in the context of small business needs within my own electorate of Flinders, there are over 6,000 incorporated organisations within the electorate of Flinders, many of them existing within holding company arrangements and within consolidated groups. Such companies as the Koowee Village Bakery, Gendore in Tooradin, Baker Boys in Rosebud, Hastford in Hastings and the Big Flower Farm in Phillip Island all create jobs and all require a simplified tax environment. This is exactly a means to achieving that increasingly simplified tax environment. In creating jobs, they have a profound impact on the society, quality of life and general level of happiness for people within our area. In addressing the new business tax system bill, I want to proceed in three stages: first, I wish to outline briefly the current environment which necessitates the changes; secondly, I want to discuss the purpose of the legislation as a solution to the existing challenges; and thirdly, I want to outline the effect of the legislation. In looking at the current situation, it is critical to note that there are challenges for consolidated groups which unnecessarily restrict their formation and their financial life. In particular, where consolidated groups seek to join with each other, there are barriers which act as a disincentive to free investment. The current situation means that there is limited relief from income tax on revenue gains realised on a share exchange, and shareholders are unable to defer a revenue loss realised on a share exchange between members of a consolidated group. Similarly, on the disposal of assets for taxation effects, currently income tax consequences on disposal of an asset by a wholly owned subsidiary attract unintended effects. The group which acquires an entity is given no regard, even where the asset was acquired before the subsidiary came to be wholly owned by the group.",152,Representatives Main Committee
253,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.07 P.m.),"I am pleased to rise and speak on the new New Busi7832 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 There are a number of other areas where there are challenges, such as the inclusion of the purchase price where a new entity is created, the transfer of tax history between entities, the splitting of income between entities and the splitting of capital expenditure between entities. All of these are part of a general problem which acts as a disincentive to investment, because one part of a holding group which is genuinely part of a legitimate structure is treated separately and the benefits do not accrue to the whole. So there are barriers to investment and there are challenges in terms of the ease and simplicity with which actions can go ahead. What is the purpose of this legislation? This bill is one of a series of bills being enacted progressively to effect significant changes in the taxation of consolidated groups. The key elements were introduced in the May consolidation act and the June consolidation bill. The purpose of the legislation is to allow wholly owned entity groups to choose to consolidate under a fairer and more flexible regime. How does it do that? It does that through 10 stages. First, it treats joining consolidated groups as a single entity for income tax purposes, by applying cost setting rules where one consolidated group joins another consolidated group. Second, it modifies membership rules to protect the existence of a consolidated group when another head company replaces an existing head company. Third, it makes specific modifications to the consolidation rules that take into account the special characteristics of a multipleentry consolidated group. Fourth, it amends the part-year rule to address amounts that are brought to account of a consolidated group over a period. Fifth, it deals with the problem of capital gains tax rollover relief for assets being transferred between members of the same wholly owned company group. Sixth, it ensures that the thin capitalisation rule continues to operate as intended for a consolidated group. Seventh, it ensures that the aim to encourage companies to invest in research and development is not hindered due to a company being part of a consolidated group. Eighth, it rectifies technical deficiencies in the consolidation loss rules. Ninth, it phases out the existing group rules for foreign tax credits and other rules concerned with the use of foreign tax credits. Tenth, it amends the current law so as to implement the new simplified imputation system. There are four key effects which flow from this. First, it apportions income and deductions between a head company and a subsidiary member. Second, the result will be to modify the general cost-setting rules so as to change the environment for investment. Third, it prevents the double taxation of gains and duplication of losses, and fourth, it will allow for assets to be transferred between members of a group, without requiring cost base adjustments to address value shifting. In its essence, this bill helps create an investment climate for businesses not just within Flinders but within Australia more broadly, so as to allow investment, which in turn creates jobs, which in turn have a profound effect on the capacity of individuals to carry out their lives. It is worth reflecting on the place of investment within the overall process of economic growth. Ultimately, there are three key elements to economic growth-and there have been, historically, over the last 40 years. They are population growth, which has provided approximately 1.8 per cent of the growth every year within Australia; participation, which has been flat when you account for the fact that, whilst there has been an increasing number of people participating, the average hours worked have decreased; and productivity, which has provided the bulk of average growth over the past 40 years. These rules assist with investment, which assists with productivity, which assists with the growth in jobs. Above all else, that has an impact on families’ lives and on the capacity of individuals to control their own lives. Very simply, I am delighted to support this bill because of the effects it has for ordinary Australians and the capacity it establishes for the creation of new jobs. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7833 stration) (12.15 p.m.)-in reply-In summing up the debate on the New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Amendment Bill 2002, I point out that I listened very carefully to the contributions made by the honourable members for Fraser, Farrer and Flinders. The bright and spirited contribution by the member for Flinders in a debate on what many people would say is not exactly a riveting aspect of tax law was refreshing and most impressive. There is no doubt that his constituents find him a very effective local representative. Mr Neville interjectingthe honourable member for Flinders. Since the measures contained in these bills represent the ongoing implementation of important tax reform initiatives, I trust that the bills will receive the support of the Main Committee. I am particularly pleased that all members have supported this very important measure. I would like to respond to some of the comments made in the debate, in particular by the member for Fraser and to sum up the matters contained in the legislation. The member for Fraser said that he agreed with the direction contained in the legislation and supported it. He referred to it being sent off to a Senate committee. We welcome the opposition’s support for these measures and also its support for a timely review by a Senate committee. Business is clearly anxiously awaiting passage of this legislation, in order to provide them with the necessary certainty to undertake transactions subject to the new regime from the date of operation, 1 July. While the member for Fraser says that the opposition wants to follow due process and wants to scrutinise the legislation-that is part of the opposition’s job-it is important that this legislation be passed as expeditiously as possible. The member for Fraser referred to what he considered to be the complexity and size of the legislation. He claimed that the balance was not being struck correctly and that there was too much complexity. The fact is that the transition from the current rules for taxation of wholly owned groups to consolidation is complex. Most people recognise that this is a very important change. The transition from the current rules of taxation for wholly owned groups, in which individual entities within the groups are recognised for tax purposes, to the consolidation regime wherein a group of entities is treated as a single entity does require rules, and results in compliance costs for taxpayers. However, these are mainly transitional. Compliance costs need to be considered against the considerable compliance and administrative savings once consolidated groups are formed. Consolidation is a very important tax reform for Australian corporate groups. It will assist in simplification of business structures, reduce ongoing compliance and administration costs, improve business efficiency and strengthen the integrity of the tax system by preventing inappropriate outcomes being generated through intragroup dealings. The complexity of the consolidation regime arises from the complexity of the existing tax system, changes to the platform on which consolidation was proposed, changes resulting from equity and other considerations and changes to ensure that consolidation does not provide unintended tax benefits. The member for Flinders indicated in his speech that this legislation will in effect boost the economy and create jobs. The member for Fraser also queried why consolidation is not revenue neutral. There is a cost to revenue associated with introducing consolidation but this cost is, as I have pointed out, mainly transitional and reflects the fact that consolidation will allow company groups to access some losses that are currently trapped in individual group members. This cost is",161,Representatives Main Committee

255,Mr Slipper,"Indeed, as the member for Hinkler favourably comments with respect to7834 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 mainly transitional. Compliance costs need to be considered against the compliance and administrative savings once consolidated groups have formed. The member for Fraser also claimed that this legislation is before us nearly four months after the start-up date of 1 July. The legislation contained in the first two tranches enabled domestic groups to decide whether to consolidate. That legislation was introduced before 1 July 2002. Legislation in this bill builds on the existing framework to provide further details applying to groups headed by non-resident entities, and these are a relatively smaller number of taxpayers. The bill also contains some technical and consequential amendments and these amendments have arisen from consultation and are consistent with the policy framework introduced in the first two bills. The member for Fraser also queried why there is to be another consolidation bill. I think that he probably understands that, but this bill and the earlier two tranches do contain the majority of the consolidation rules, and while these measures cater for most taxpayers there is a small group of taxpayers that need specific issues addressed-for example, life insurance companies. Rules for these taxpayers will be in the next bill. An initiative of this magnitude is likely to require finetuning over the course of the next 12 months as the government responds to ongoing consultation with the business community. I think that most people accept that, when you do have real and major reform, it is necessary to make sure that it is operating as intended. The member for Fraser also referred to the consolidation measure and the role of the Board of Taxation. The Board of Taxation was in fact involved in the development of the consolidation measure through the consolidation steering committee of the Australian Taxation Office. The member for Farrer, in a particularly thought provoking contribution, referred to the very good education process around consolidation and the good codesign process ensuring that business understands and can deal with the measures. The government clearly welcomes the comments made by the member for Flinders in relation to the fact that the measure has been developed in a manner inclusive of business concerns and the consultation process has been widely praised by the business and professional community. I also welcome the endorsement of the ATO education process by the member for Farrer, particularly her constituents’ positive experience of the ATO consolidation roadshow. Her comments are proof that the education process is vital to ensure that businesses are ready to engage with the new consolidation regime and that the education process is working well and tailored not just to the big end of town but also to small and medium businesses. The member for Flinders referred to his commitment to business simplification through taxation simplification, and I want to thank the member for Flinders for his particular comment in this area. The bills introduce, as the debate has indicated, the third tranche of consolidation legislation and provides further amendments to the simplified imputation system. Both measures commence from 1 July this year. Extensive consultation has occurred on all measures, as you would expect in relation to law changes of this nature, and they do enjoy widespread support in the community. I hope that is something that the Senate legislation committee takes into account. The consolidation regime will introduce major integrity advantages over the existing system of taxing corporate groups, while at the same time enhancing business efficiency by streamlining intragroup transactions without tax costs and reducing ongoing compliance costs for Australian business. The government has adopted a staged implementation of these measures to ensure that consultation with business could occur on each tranche, while ensuring that the elements required to effect a decision to enter a consolidation regime were prioritised. With the passage of these Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7835 bills, taxpayers will be in a position to understand the dynamics of the regime in relation to the formation of consolidation groups and the acquisition of new subsidiaries. Key consolidation measures contained in the New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2002 which are critical for companies planning to consolidate include the interaction of reforms with international tax, research and development concession and foreign tax credit provisions. The bill builds on and modifies aspects of the core consolidation principles included in earlier tranches of consolidation legislation to ensure that they operate correctly in relation to trusts, recognise the special structure of foreign owned company groups and operate where an existing consolidated group joins another consolidated group or where more than one entity joins an existing consolidated group. The measures also modify the general rules to enhance the integrity of the earlier measures by preventing unintended windfall gains arising on entry to consolidation, as announced by the government in July 2002. The bill also effects the removal of existing grouping rules from the current tax law in recognition of the fact that intragroup transactions will not be recognised within a consolidated group and the current grouping rules are to be withdrawn for non-consolidated groups from 1 July 2003. The simplified imputation amendments will generally apply to dividends paid on or after 1 July 2002 and will facilitate entry to the new system for early and late balancing companies. The amendments also facilitate more flexibility in franking dividends by publicly listed companies as a result of extending the exclusion from the benchmark rule in certain cases. This has been a good debate and I commend both of these bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (FRANKING DEFICIT TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 15 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following paper: That this House: (1) expresses its outrage and condemnation at the barbaric terrorist bombings which took place in Bali on 12 October 2002; (2) extends its deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the families and loved ones of those Australians killed, missing or injured in this brutal and despicable attack; (3) offers its condolences to the families and friends of the Indonesians and citizens of other countries who have been killed or injured; (4) condemns those who employ terror and indiscriminate violence against innocent people; 7836 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 (5) commits the Australian government to work with the Indonesian government and others to bring those who are guilty of this horrendous crime, and all those who harbour and support them, to justice; and (6) reaffirms Australia’s commitment to continue the war against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (12.27 p.m.)-I rise today to express my profound sorrow about the terrorist attack in Bali and to express my sincere symphathies to the families of all of those who have lost loved ones and to those who are still waiting for news. No doubt they are hoping for the best but fearing the worse. I have been contacted by Mr David Stewart of my electorate. His son, Anthony Stewart, 29 years of age, is still missing. He is a member of the Kingsley football team. He was last seen on the dance floor of the Sari nightclub. Obviously Mr David Stewart and his wife, Marilyn, have been devastated by anxiety as they have waited for news. Mr David Stewart is actually travelling to Bali today to look for his son. His trip is being paid for by his employer, in a wonderful act of generosity. Mr Stewart is in contact with consular officials and they will meet him on his arrival in Bali. My heart goes out to David and Marilyn. I note that this family has already suffered a great deal, having lost Anthony’s twin brother four years ago in a car accident. Our thoughts are with you in this very terrible time of suffering. I feel touched by this tragedy in a number of ways, as I am sure all Australians are. I feel especially touched because I returned from Bali on Friday morning having taken a short holiday there with my sister, my nephew and a friend of my nephew’s. When I became aware on Sunday of the dimensions of this tragedy I could clearly imagine how my family would have felt if our holiday had been timed slightly differently. I could clearly imagine the distress my parents would have felt as they desperately tried to find out whether their only two children, my sister and I, and their only grandson, were safe. Imagining their distress as they would have tried to phone the mobile and, if that had not worked, looked to other ways to find out information, I suppose I feel I have a small window on the suffering of Mr Stewart and the many Australians who are in a comparable position. Having so recently returned from Bali, I can visualise the Kuta area. I can visualise Australian holiday-makers. I can still feel the slightly warm, humid air. I know many Australians have travelled to Bali and would be in a similar position. It is that familiarity with the scene of this tragedy, as well as the dimensions of the tragedy itself, that make it so real to all of us. Of course it is not just Australians who have suffered: Balinese have been killed and injured, as have nationals of other countries. I fear that the suffering of the Balinese people will not end there. Those who have visited Bali know that the Balinese people are friendly and peaceful people. Their Hindu offerings are everywhere as you walk around the streets. Their belief in karma tends to lead to an attitude of doing good to others. They seem wonderfully fond of children and are likely to make a fuss in restaurants and in the streets of the children of tourists. Their livelihood depends on tourism and, even with extensive tourism, making a reasonable living has for many in Bali been a challenge. During my recent holiday I stayed in Ubud. Whilst there, my sister and I were taken for a walk through rice fields and the associated countryside by a Balinese guide. He also showed us his village and his family home. He explained to us that he left his village at the age of 14 to live and work at the hotel at which we were staying. In exchange for the hotel owner paying his school fees, he worked in the hotel as a 14-year-old houseboy. Some 16 years later, he is still there. He talked to us about his concern that there had been some reports of date-rape drugs being used in Kuta bars and nightclubs, and said that he was worried that such reports Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7837 could reduce Bali’s attractiveness as a tourist destination and that Bali could not afford any such loss in trade. How much more worried must he and the millions of Balinese whose livelihoods depend on tourism be now? He also talked to us about the nature of the medical system in Bali. He talked of how Balinese must pay for medical assistance and how very expensive it is for them. He said the birth of his first child had cost two million rupiah-a huge amount of money from his perspective. We know that many Balinese have been left with injuries which will require ongoing treatment and that many will suffer additionally because of the cost of such treatment. Whilst Australia suffers as a result of this tragedy, I believe it is important that we strive to understand the situation of and maintain compassion for others who have suffered. In the light of that, can I use this opportunity to publicly state that the opposition believes that the government should take a compassionate approach to dealing with the Woomera detainee who has a wife who was injured by the blast. I am not aware of all the details of this man’s refugee claim. However, I would ask that the government take a compassionate and sympathetic view to meet his needs to comfort his wife at this time. I understand from a media report in today’s papers that the government appear to be taking a sympathetic view, and I welcome that. Our thoughts now are with all who grieve or who are racked with worry about their loved ones. Over the coming days the details of what has happened will become clearer and Australia will start to bury its dead. As we mourn, our thoughts will turn to ensuring that those who caused this crime against humanity are brought to justice. No stone should be left unturned in this pursuit of justice. As Australians pursue the culprits, it is vital that our anger-our righteous anger-at this appalling act is directed at the right targets. I note that in the editorial of yesterday’s Herald Sun the following statement was made: Also badly wrong are Australians who criticise Canberra for its determination to stop the flow of boat people. The illegals set out from Indonesia and are often without papers. How easy it would be for fanatics to smuggle one of their own among the self-styled refugees. I view this to be an irresponsible statement at this time. I support, and the whole opposition supports, vigorous security testing of any person who arrives in Australia unauthorised, whether that be by boat or plane. No-one who constitutes a security risk should be released into the Australian community. Our approach to this should be guided by the national interest and an abundance of caution. We should take no risks. While taking no risks and vigorously security testing all unauthorised arrivals, it is incumbent upon us to be honest about the outcomes and the magnitude of any threat. We know from evidence to this parliament from the Director-General of ASIO that, of the 5,986 unauthorised arrivals in the last three years, not one was found by ASIO to be a direct or indirect security threat. Consequently, there is absolutely no evidence to support an assertion that unauthorised boat arrivals have been used by terrorists as a method of entering Australia. I say once again: vigorous security testing must continue. We should never let our guard down. We should take no risks. We should be honest and clear about the outcomes of that security testing. I believe the Herald Sun editorial of yesterday was not sufficiently honest and not sufficiently clear. In pursuit of our righteous anger about this appalling incident in Bali, we must make sure that our efforts, our anger and our pursuit of justice is directed at the right targets and we must allow no distractions. Once again, I believe yesterday’s editorial constituted such a distraction. Let me conclude by reiterating that this is a time of enormous sadness. I know that my thoughts and the thoughts of every member of this House-and, I suspect, of every Austra7838 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 lian-are with those who grieve or those who wait for news of loved ones who are still unaccounted for in Bali. Most particularly at this time, my thoughts are with Mr David Stewart of my electorate as he travels to Bali today and searches for his son. port the motion before the House, because that which occurred on 12 October 2002 will be remembered by all Australians as the day when more innocent young Australians died than in any other peacetime event, when the innocence of Bali was shattered and when the confidence of Australians in the security of their region in peacetime was savagely shaken. The blast occurred on a Saturday evening, at a time when the bars in Bali, filled with young Australians and others, were most crowded. These people were enjoying a hard-earned break. Several had been playing sport that day, and some of them were from my electorate. The blast not only destroyed people and property and injured many others but also was of particular savagery. It left a hole in the ground which was some two metres deep. A thousand metres away from where the blast occurred, high up on a building, were found pieces of the car which contained one of the bombs. There were two bombs, not one. The first was used to attract the attention of those inside and to tempt them outside. Then the second bomb-a heavy explosive equivalent to three 44-gallon drums of explosives-blasted the whole street and killed the greatest number of people possible. It was the work of expert, insidious people. It was cowardly, heinous, the work of deranged minds and clearly the work of fanatics. And it was done to maximise the number of deaths. The blast also destroyed Bali as the place of innocence-what I would call almost the seventh state of Australia. Australians are now fleeing Bali, yet it has been a traditional destination for us. Kuta itself has been known as the ‘Bondi of Asia’, a place where we had a playground reminiscent of the best places in Australia, a place where freedom and innocence was enjoyed and a place which I have enjoyed with my wife and family on more than one occasion. The blast also savagely damaged Indonesia itself: not just people and property but also that country’s reputation and standing, the relationships it has with other countries and its economy. The member for Fadden has drawn my attention to the fact that, on a Singapore Airlines flight the following day, the jumbo contained one female passenger for the whole flight-and that passenger was a journalist. Therefore, Indonesia itself must face severe questioning and determine what it will do in the light of the tragedy. It has, in terms of the human loss, seriously affected my own electorate. In Bali at the time there were at least two football teams, one of which has been hideously affected. The Coogee Dolphins rugby league side, which is based just outside my electorate, has many members who live in my electorate. It has suffered five deaths and another member is missing. And there are five people from my electorate already confirmed dead. That team has been a fantastic contributor to our community and to Australia. Every year it raises $10,000 for the Prince of Wales Hospital fundraising efforts. It is very sad that people like that who have been wonderful contributors to the Australian community should be cut down in this way by terrorists. The Woollahra Colleagues team had some 15 players there as well. They had been playing in the Bali rugby 10’s competition that day against many friends from other parts of Australia and Asia. They were only minutes away from the Sari Club at the time the events happened. Normally, they would have been there at that time but they had had a game that afternoon and stayed on a little longer before going on to the club. They were so affected by what happened that they refused to talk to the press out of respect for all their friends who were cut down.",163,Representatives Main Committee
256,Mr King (Wentworth) (12.37 P.m.),"It is with heavy heart and hesitant voice that I supWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7839 They have contributed marvellously in Bali itself; they contributed blood, they gave up their places on aeroplanes back to Australia and they kept in touch with their officials in Australia who have informed me of events as they have happened. I want to place on record the sincere and heartfelt thoughts of the whole community of Wentworth for those who have lost life, for those who have been injured, and for the families, relatives and friends who have been affected by this terrible event. I have spoken to the club officials involved. I have offered assistance on behalf of the Commonwealth and of my office in Wentworth and, of course, I will attend the funerals of those who have died, wherever possible. The eastern suburbs of Sydney have suffered a terrible tragedy. Sporting officials and others have been most concerned about all of the events of that time. Can a worse event be imagined than where those who contribute through sport have gone, at the end of a long season, to holiday in Bali and have found terrorism attacking the very heart of what they were doing? Indeed, terrorism attacks the heart and soul of our society and almost invades our being. What could be more part of the fabric of who we are and what we are in Australia-what could be more typical of our young Australians and their way of life and all of the values that they support-than the end-of-season traditional sporting tour? Along with the holidaymakers and families whose lives have been lost, these sportsmen went away to kick up their heels and find that they have come away with this terrible loss. It could not be worse. Not only have teams from my electorate been affected but also at least two other deaths of individuals-tourists and others-from my electorate have been reported. But the losses that have occurred affect not only people in my electorate; the whole Australian community has suffered a terrible human loss. We already know that 21 people have been officially confirmed dead, but police reports indicate that up to 150 may have died in this terrible tragedy. Many more have been injured. The families of those who have suffered have also been injured through shock and related events. I want to commend the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, on the way in which this issue has been handled and the expeditious manner in which the defence forces, the medical authorities and others have brought their assistance to this event as it has unfolded in Bali. I want to commend the Prime Minister for his cool and calm response, along with that of the foreign minister and others in the government, to this tragedy. But Indonesia too has suffered, as I have indicated. The loss already has been confirmed of some 14 Indonesians dead, over 200 injured and many others missing. But it is not only the loss of people such as Marde, the doorman at the Sari Club, or of the club and its facilities and the neighbouring club itself; it is also the loss to the tourist trade, the loss to the economy in Indonesia and the damage to its relationships with other countries, especially with its neighbour Australia, which we in this country have worked so hard to build up over the years. When we look at what was behind these particular acts, it can only be said that this has been the work of terrorists. It is said that C4, or Semtex, has been found on the site. That is an explosive that has been linked to al-Qaeda bombs exploded elsewhere, including that which was pitted against the US Cole. It is also, I regret to say, an explosive that is used by the armed forces of Indonesia. But it is important to say that whoever did this must be condemned as terrorists, because can it be said that the fanatics who carried out this work were anything other than people who wished to inflict the greatest damage not only on those who were in the club and on Bali, but also on Indonesia itself? Terror is a strategic weapon and it has strategic goals. It also has this one great advantage for those who exercise its evil trade: you do not need an army to achieve your objectives; 7840 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 against a modern free society you have an easy target. That has been found elsewhere around the world, not just as we have observed in Bali, to our great cost and to the cost of the Indonesians, but also in the Middle East and other parts of the world. This brand of terrorism is the ultimate expression of rejection. For these people, life is meaningless for any form of so called enemy within or without. The only way to confront it is to deal with the foundation-the ideologies, the political thought and the infrastructure. However, the first step is to destroy the operational capacity. Future steps will require more political means and other resources to tackle the real cause of this international terrorism, which is despotism, and the faulty beliefs of those who practise it. In the circumstances, I strongly support this resolution. I support the words of the Prime Minister and the initiatives that have been taken to date. I warmly commend the resolution to the House. bers of this House, I believe that words can hardly express the grief that we feel for the Australian victims-it now looks like there are more than 100 Australians who may have diedof this Bali bombing. It is a deed that has no justification. In my electorate, we have the Alfred Hospital with its burns unit. There are six patients-five Victorians and one Canadian-who are in a serious condition. The Alfred is doing everything it can with the greater workload. The Alfred staff are great, working longer hours, extra shifts have been put on and the hospital has received a huge degree of support from the general public-people calling in to offer assistance to families of the injured, schools offering to hold fundraisers et cetera. Jodi Cearns, pictured in the Herald Sun today, is one of those who are hospitalised in the Alfred. I particularly want to mention two of my constituents, Greg Elliott from St Kilda and Ric Elliott, also of St Kilda, who is in the Darwin hospital. We wish them a quick recovery on behalf of all of the people of Australia but particularly the people in my electorate who know them. Parliamentarians owe the Australian people our judgment in these matters-to think about these things seriously, to understand them. We owe it to the victims to try and give them an analysis and a framework for what we ought to do. The opposition, like the government, believes that Australia needs to take measured but remorseless, steadfast action to bring the perpetrators to account. This action against the terrorists should not simply be a bringing of them to justice but also an attempt to prevent events like these happening again. As the member for Lalor said, we do not need to link Bali to boat people who came here under other circumstances or allegations. There is no evidence at all, as she insisted, that they were involved in terrorism. Similarly, we do not need silly polls such as the one on Sky News this morning about undertaking strategic air strikes against Indonesia. Shame on the person who is responsible for that, and for exacerbating our relations with Indonesia. The Indonesian people and the Indonesian government have expressed their deep concern at and opposition to what happened in Bali. In good grace we should accept that those are their sentiments. There is some speculation in the Murdoch tabloids today that the person behind this incident was Mohamed Kalifa, Osama bin Laden’s brother-in-law and the South-East Asian operations director of al-Qaeda. More likely-and I think this is most people’s judgment-this event was orchestrated by Jemaah Islamiah. This is a group that is not, thankfully, active in Australia and has no record of activities in Australia, although I note that Abu Bakar Bashir was interviewed in a Sydney Islamist publication Nida’ul Islam in 1998. Analysis that Jemaah Islamiah was behind this event has already been expressed by the government and the opposition. I particularly commend to all Australians and members of this House a paper written",168,Representatives Main Committee
257,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.48 P.m.),"I rise to support this motion. Like all memWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7841 by the International Crisis Group, headed by Gareth Evans, on al-Qaeda’s South-East Asian links. The paper is particularly timely and was written before the events in Bali. The Christian Science Monitor, which has been extremely perceptive about this issue over the last months, has identified three people who have been involved in bomb making and in incidents throughout South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Two of these men are now in custody: Agus Dwikarna, an Indonesian businessman convicted of explosive charges in the Philippines this summer, and a Kuwaiti, Omar al-Faruq, who is probably well known throughout Australia as the person who did the interview about activities in this part of the world. I will come back to him in a minute. The third and most crucial person, who was highlighted on Lateline last night, is a 37-year-old Indonesian, Riduan Isamuddin, alias Nurjaman, better known as Hambali, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who is the operations head of Jemaah Islamiah. There are two other people linked to Abu Bakar Bashir who also have ties to al-Qaeda. One is Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi, who was involved in bombing attacks in Manila in 2000 and planned to attack American facilities in Singapore. He is part of a group called the Ngruki network, identified in the International Crisis Group’s splendid paper. It is very important to understand the Ngruki network. The Pondok Ngruki, like a lot of the places that spawned the Taliban regime and al-Qaeda on the borders of Pakistan, is a religious boarding school. It preaches a form of Islamism-and I use that word very advisedly; it is not an Islamic school. Discussing the dangerous activities of alumni of this madrassa is no criticism of the Islamic religion. No person who seriously evaluates these events, particularly in South-East Asia and Indonesia, would in any way be critical of Islam. In fact, the tens of millions of moderate Islamic people in Indonesia are the major bulwark against these extremists. But these types of madrassas are of concern to people who followed events in Afghanistan. They spawned a sort of Islamist ‘Lord of the Flies’, with all the subsequent dreadful events during the Taliban rule of Afghanistan. This central Java madrassa, Pondok Ngruki, obviously concerned the International Crisis Group when they were forecasting what might happen in South-East Asia and in Indonesia. Perhaps the threat they predicted might be spawned by the Ngruki circle has come to pass in this part of the world. I emphasise that the International Crisis Group’s paper on alQaeda and its local satellite in South-East Asia was printed months before these events. Thankfully we have had a sympathetic reaction from the Indonesian government to the foul murder of our citizens. This reaction includes the visit of Megawati, the President of Indonesia, to Bali to express her condolences; the condolences she expressed to the Australian Prime Minister; and the statement of the Indonesian Defence Minister Sutarto that there are terrorist groups operating in Indonesia now. Even Indonesian opposition figure Amien Rais seems to understand the necessity for Indonesia to pass measured, intelligent terrorist legislation-like the legislation we recently passed in Australia-in Indonesia. Such laws need to be passed in Jakarta so that they can handle terrorism within the rule of law, now that Indonesia is a democracy. Unfortunately, the Indonesian Vice-President, Hamzah Haz, has not expressed any sympathy for those who are the victims of the explosion. I hope he will consider doing that at some time soon. Australians and Americans did not appreciate his saying after the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington that the attacks would ‘cleanse the United States of its sins’. I hope that the overwhelming sentiment we have seen expressed to the Australian ambassador in the streets by the people, by the responsible Indonesian ministers and opposition leaders will be the prevailing reaction in Indonesia. That so far seems to be the case. There are many genuine people who wonder about the causes of such terrible events and claim that there are root causes that are specific to any one event. I saw that Senator Brown 7842 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 got himself in some trouble with the public by saying that it was Australia’s policy on Iraq that led to these people doing these dreadful things in Bali. Nothing justifies what happened in Bali. There can be no reason to kill innocent Australians: young people from rugby and other football teams from all over this country who were up there to celebrate victories in reserve grade matches and grand finals. Nothing justifies killing innocent Australians. We have seen a variety of claims by various terrorist leaders that there are various causes of their misdeeds. Osama bin Laden threatened that Australia would be a target for what it did in East Timor. I can tell Mr bin Laden or any of his associates that no-one in Australia regrets what we did in East Timor; intervention had non-partisan support here. Australia will not bend its policy to the wishes of terrorist groups or their exaggerated threats and rhetoric. I conclude by suggesting that the bombing in Bali, maybe related to al-Qaeda, and the incidents over the last few weeks are very disturbing. We have had the blowing up of the French supertanker, the attacks in the Philippines and the sinister murder of American teachers in Indonesian Papua. They may be related to these events in Bali. We need to have the attitude to this new anti-Australian terrorism that Mikhail Gorbachev described as perestroika: new thinking about these kinds of groups and individuals who perpetrate terrorism. They are terrorists, not militants. We need to understand that Islamist terrorists are arraigned against us, against Australia, because of the kind of tolerant, democratic society that we are. People on all sides of politics need to understand that we need to be strong, steadfast but measured and intelligent in our response to these terrorist attacks. We need to act in a way that shows terrorists who hate and envy the very way we live that we are committed to the defence of free and tolerant societies like Australia. We will not take a step back. sorrow and compassion for the families whose lives have been torn apart by this barbaric and cowardly terrorist attack in Bali. October 12, 2002 will forever be a sadly defining moment in our history. Some commentators have stated that this day will be Australia’s 9/11. In many ways I believe they may be correct, because this tragedy has touched the lives of all Australians. Almost every Australian has been to Bali or knows someone who has been to Bali. Many of our sons and daughters have for years made Bali a regular holiday destination, and Bali has always been held as a special place in the hearts and minds of so many Australians. Personally, members of our own social club-Club Ski, as we call it-recently returned from Bali. I was not part of that trip but I very easily could have been. Two of our friends also returned only last week from Bali. Almost every Australian you talk to has some friend or someone they know that was either there at the time or has recently been to Bali. The greatest tragedy of this barbaric, disgraceful act is that it has claimed so many of Australia’s finest: our young, energetic, enthusiastic, optimistic people who had so much to live for and so much to offer Australia and the rest of the world-people like the McKeon family from Kincumber in my electorate. The Central Coast Herald reports that Mr Ross McKeon, 46, is in a stable condition, with burns covering much of his lower body, having been sent home on the second plane out of Bali following Saturday night’s bombing in Kuta. The youngest daughter, Kristy, 12, was expected home late last night, suffering trauma. She was there, of course. More tragically, the wife and mother, Lynette, and the daughter Marissa, 14, are still both missing and unaccounted for. The McKeons are only one of the many Australian families that have been shattered by this terrible, horrific act. In the Sydney Morning Herald today, Wednesday, 16 October, there is also a report on the group of people that the McKeons were with. As many Australians do, they went with a group to Bali. I will read part of the report from the Sydney Morning Herald:",170,Representatives Main Committee
258,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (12.59 P.m.),"I rise in this place today with a heavy heart, full ofWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7843 Moments before, teenagers Ashley Airlie, Kristy Webster, Kristy and Marissa McKeon, Candace Buchan and Chloe Byron had been dancing and giggling, enjoying the Kuta Beach nightlife under the nurturing eye of their parents. … … … Gayle Airlie, Lyn McKeon, Cathy Seelin, Robyn Webster, Geraldine Buchan and Kathy Salvatori took them out dancing. None of them came home. Also missing are Chloe Byron, 15, and Marissa McKeon, 14. The tragedy in Bali strikes at the very heart and soul of our Australian community. On behalf of all the residents of the Robertson electorate and, indeed, all Australians, I offer my deepest condolences to those who have suffered and are suffering from this shocking tragedy. Those subhuman creatures-for they are not humans-who place no value on human life, who planned and carried out this most heinous of crimes against our society and others, must be hunted down and brought to justice. No-one can rest until they are. This Sunday is a national day of mourning, as I am sure all members and all Australians know. I will be going to church, and I know that all Australians in their own way will be with the people who are suffering-with the parents who do not know where their children are, with people who do not know where their wives and mothers are. In the seven years that I have been here, I have not witnessed such emotion as I have seen in the House over the past two days. I have spoken to many members who have been in this place much longer than I, and this tragedy has affected all members of parliament-as it has all Australians-as nothing has before. As I said earlier, our sympathies go out. I know that the government, the opposition and all members of parliament will work together to ensure that everything that can be done will be done for these people and that, hopefully, the people who planned and carried out this crime will be brought to justice. Ms KING (Ballarat) (1.04 p.m.)-I rise this afternoon to add my voice to those of the members of this parliament in condemning the attack in Bali on Saturday. The fact that this happened in a place that we do not associate with terrorism, a place where Australians have gone for generations to holiday or to celebrate the end of the football season-young people just having fun-seems somehow to make this attack even more obscene. Words can never be enough in circumstances such as this. Our language often fails us. There are not enough words in our language to describe the shock, the anger and the grief, but they are all that we have. A banner being held at a prayer session near the bombsite read: ‘The heart of Bali is broken.’ I think that, as the growing magnitude of this callous act dawned on us all on Monday, all our hearts felt broken. But as we hear the simple stories of kindness, of the care with which the survivors of this blast have looked after each other and of how they have stood by their friends who have died and tried to give them and their families some dignity, we know that, while our hearts have broken, there is a strength in our spirit that can never be broken. I would like to add my heartfelt condolences to the families of those injured and of those who have died, and to those who have members of their family still missing. None of us can imagine how you are feeling, but we stand by you in your grief, ready to help in whatever way we can. Every member of this House has been affected in some way. Many of us have people in our electorates who have died, who are injured or who are awaiting news. There are thousands of stories. They have all affected us. But it is the people from our own electorates who have driven this home to every member of this House. We feel personally responsible for the safety of the members of our electorates, and this is a personal affront to the safety of the people of our electorates-people like David Ure, from Ballarat, and his girlfriend, who were in the 7844 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 nightclub on the evening of the attack. We were all grateful to hear his voice on the John Laws program on Monday and to hear that he was coming home. Then there are people like the McIntoshes, also from Ballarat, who cancelled plans to go to the nightclub that night and decided to have a quiet night at home instead. I want to encourage all those people who were in Bali at the time to take great care of themselves and to make sure that they seek out appropriate medical and counselling services. It will take a great deal of time for the survivors of the Bali attack to fully recover from the event. It is likely that many never will. Equally, our nation is likely not to fully recover. Not since the Second World War have we had such a loss of civilian lives overseas. People of 22 other nations have had citizens killed or injured in this attack. Now is the time to reach out to those who have been injured or have died and to bring them home. In addition to grieving for those lost in this barbaric and senseless act, we must do all we can to find those who perpetrated this crime. Australia must look to the security of our people in our region and do what is best in the national interest of our citizens, to protect and defend them and to ensure that this does not ever happen again. To do that, we must have a regional response. There is limited value in Australia making efforts to improve our domestic security if terrorists are operating with impunity on our doorstep. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in his call for a regional summit on terrorism at the earliest possible opportunity. Under this government, Australia has disengaged from its nearest neighbours. The government has attempted to distance our nation from our geographic place in the world. I think this has been to our cost. If we are to fight terrorism in our region, we must do it in partnership with Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and our other neighbours. Australians need to know and understand the politics of our region and to seriously tackle the challenges in our part of the world. This event is also a serious test for the Indonesian government. We are all aware of the significant difficulties faced by Megawati Sukarnoputri as she attempts to balance the many complex factions within her government and community. We know that there is a significant chance that her leadership will be severely tested in the coming months. It is vital that we in Australia do all we can to help Indonesia gather the evidence and build a strong case against those who planned and carried out these murders. There are already talks of al-Qaeda links to the local Jemaah Islamiah group, and Australia has moved to have the UN list them as a terrorist organisation. We must work with Indonesia to determine whether this is true and whether this group is responsible. To act prematurely without that evidence will cause significant instability in Indonesia. But act we must-in a timely, assured and measured fashion. We owe it to each one of the victims of these attacks and their families to find the perpetrators and ensure that they are made responsible for their actions. In calling for the perpetrators of these murders to be brought to justice we are asking Indonesia to defend its own national interests. This is as much an attack on Indonesia and its people as it is an attack on Australia’s national interests. We cannot forget that this atrocity was perpetrated on Indonesian soil. Potentially, it was an attack directly aimed at the destabilisation of the Indonesian government. The government of Indonesia must stand up after this attack and say, ‘No more! We will not be a target for terrorists, we will not harbour terrorists and we will do everything in our power to ensure that those who are responsible for this cowardly attack face justice.’ The main tool of terrorism is fear. Their tool is going after innocent civilians when we least expect it, in locations where we least expect it. The Bali attack was an attack on our democracy. It was a cowardly attack and I join with ever member of this House Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7845 in condemning those who have sought to threaten us in this region and take away from people of all religions the right to enjoy a secure and safe environment. How does one express their most inner anger, their hurt, their sorrow and their inability to make it easier for those parents, brothers and sisters who have lost their loved ones in what can only be described as the cruelest form of murder. On 12 October 2002, in our electorate of Gilmore there were many families who were personally touched by the tragedy and many more who were in disbelief at the realisation that terrorism has arrived on our own doorstep. As I sit in parliament and hear the many stories coming from the electorate and elsewhere in Australia. I think it has to be a dream-it cannot be true. But the cold, hard reality is that it is true. It is true that many Australians died and many more are still missing. It is true that some of the people went out one night to experience the dream of holidays by the sea and in doing so left all their personal belongings and ID behind in the hotel. It is true that now, burnt beyond belief, it is hard, almost impossible, to identify them. It is true that in a country not as advanced as most Western countries this is causing extra grief to families who must wait for the authorities to release names and identities. It is true that we have had to send refrigeration units to Bali to bring back our dead. And, yes, it is also true that many of those who were not injured are volunteering to assist in what for them must also be traumatic. But then is that not what Australians do best-look after our mates? Bali is a place that people once connected with the good times that Australians relish and enjoy. Now, forever, it will be associated with the barbarism of a terrorist attack. Whilst the September 11 attack last year affected many people, to others it was still something that largely happened to someone else on the other side of the globe. We could certainly identify with how shocking and horrific it was; but the attack in Bali is something completely personal. It is an attack on our doorstep targeting, deliberately and brutally, a large group of defenceless victims, predominantly European and Australian. However you look at it you cannot escape the pointed significance of the target. It is the work of jackals-predators who prey on the weak and defenceless at a time when they least expect it. Regardless of who the perpetrators turn out to be-and that is not for me to decide-generically they are organised mass murderers running their own agenda without any regard to humankind. They are a faceless enemy, acting with the fervour of zealots who are prepared to do anything to achieve their own ends. Watching the news bulletins, as so many other Australians have done, I ask myself why. What do they hope to gain out of such an act? It has certainly created fear-fear that is real and palpable. If anything it should steel our resolve to meet this threat head on and attack it conclusively while we still can. We cannot, nor should we, have to live with such a threat over our heads. We cannot allow terrorists to develop their skills to a level of sophistication where the implications are more destruction with less capacity to respond. I am reminded of the catchphrase of our RSL: ‘the price of freedom is eternal vigilance’. How true. Whilst in our own lives we continue to promote peace, these old diggers know that the enemy can take on many forms and we should be prepared. Terrorists are the enemy. We are engaged in a war on terrorism whether we like it or not. We have been drawn into it surreptitiously by the mere fact of who we are. There is no choice and anybody who suggests that we could have somehow remained insulated against this has no appreciation of the realities of our global community. The war is not one being fought by professional soldiers capable of defending themselves. The brunt is being borne by innocent, defenceless civilians whose only crime was to gather together in a public place to enjoy a holiday that many",172,Representatives Main Committee
259,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (1.11 P.m.),"I rise to support the motion put by the Prime Minister.7846 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 worked and saved for for years. Now we must accept the fact that it is becoming increasingly possible for terrorists to deliver a similar, if not larger, event on Australian soil. Incredible as it seems, it happened in Bali. If an unsophisticated, home-grown extremist has the capability of destroying so many people as in the Oklahoma City bombing, for instance, what sort of damage can a committed expert do? I saw the footage of Craig Salvatori and his two daughters. His wife, the children’s mother, was killed in the blast. What a waste. As a mother, like many mothers, I can immediately identify with it. Watching him, it seemed to me that the realisation was only just dawning on him. He seemed stunned and uncomprehending of the enormity of his personal loss. The two young girls were clinging to their father. I wonder whether the impact had begun to sink in. But sink in it will. There was vision of men weeping in shock at what they had seena scene that was extremely upsetting and will be imprinted on my mind for a long time to come. With so many dead and injured there are many other similar stories, like those from my electorate. We, along with the families, are all in shock. The parents from two of our families have got on a plane to Bali to try to locate their children, no longer able to wait after misleading calls saying, yes, they were okay but now they are missing. That is the difficulty with being in a country where communication is not as simple as we would expect it to be. Soon there will be anger, questions and the demand that the perpetrators be punished. That is a perfectly understandable human response and well warranted. If we were placed in a similar position, that is a reaction we too would experience. Now, against all of our beliefs and upbringing, we need to accept the reality of terrorism and we need to deal with it. We can no longer be making apologies for mass murderers, giving energy to their foul regimes through our own inaction. We should not forget the response of Australian authorities to this tragedy and all those people, be they officials or just mums and dads, relatives or those on holidays, who have helped in the aftermath. They have been working in difficult circumstances and they are doing a magnificent job. The victims, their friends and relatives also need support and we should be doing everything we can to contain the emotional injury that will come. They have come through a warlike experience and are feeling the same emotions as combatants. We owe it to ourselves to make sure that this does not happen here. But, in doing so, we need to accept that we will require some soul-searching and perhaps a hardening of attitudes. This may not be something that will sit easily with some, but it has to be confronted. This Sunday has been declared a national day of mourning. A number of church services will be held in my electorate. As a member of the Australian government, there will be many decisions to make. I ask myself continually: has this really happened; did it really take place? Yes, it did; yes, it is true. To the Dunn and Lewis families of Ulladulla, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (1.19 p.m.)-Most Australians at some point in their lives have lost someone they love. This loss is always sad even when we know that a parent or older friend has had a long and full life. We are sad because we will miss them. Such loss is sad but not tragic. Tragedy has also struck many of us. Indeed we still have generations of people who lost fathers, brothers, sons and husbands in war. These young men, cut down in the most vigorous years, with so much potential and so much to look forward to, left generations of mourners behind them. The loss of young life is tragic. How much more tragic are the events that we are seeking to understand in Bali? Families of the young people who died in Bali-and they have been mostly young people, from what we can tell at the moment-will struggle forever not just with the inevitable feelings of sadness, loss and anger but also with the disbelief that comes with the senselessness of the way Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7847 their loved ones died. These people had not put themselves in harm’s way. They were not on a battlefield. They were doing what millions of young people around the world do every Saturday night: they were enjoying each other’s company and some relaxation. We can understand accidents and we can understand illness, but violence is much harder to come to terms with. The questions are inevitable. What could make someone want to take another human life-the life of a human they have never met, a person who was as good or as flawed as any other person? It is impossible for most people to understand what could make someone take a single life. How much harder, then, is it for us to understand this type of mass murder? We have plenty of experts and academics explaining to us who the culprits might be, what their political motives are, what the defence and foreign affairs implications are, the logistics of identifying people and transporting the dead and wounded-all of these things have been covered in detail almost nonstop since news of the bombings first came to Australia. This overload of information is typical of a nation in shock embarking on a collective grieving process. We are filling up every minute with words and work because it is easier than sitting still and being quiet and feeling the pain of those around us. We are, as a nation, like the person who hears of the death of a loved one and immediately busies themselves in planning the funeral or cleaning the house or notifying family members, because it is easier to work than to feel. What we have not talked about, because we do not have the words to, is the horror behind the bombings. What makes people want to kill like this? How can we, as a community of nations, not only arrest and jail forever the perpetrators of this crime but also learn to live together with mutual respect, building a world where peace and tolerance, not violence and zealotry, are the standards? I have no power to explain to the families of the dead, the wounded and the missing why their loved ones have been the targets of such destructive power. No words I have can lessen the pain or lessen the burden of waiting. Sometimes, when confronted by tragedy, we feel so powerless to help or to offer comfort that we turn away from our friends in their hour of need. It is our own inability to help which makes us keep our distance. But I say to those who witnessed this cataclysm and survived: I understand that this horror will be with you always, that a sadness undeserved has come to you which will never leave. I offer my support not just for today but for the length of your days. To the families of those who have lost loved ones I say: I share your pain, and I am willing to share your burden. If, as a nation, we could parcel out your pain, each taking a piece and leaving you only what is bearable, we would do it-but we cannot. You each have your own journey of grieving and all we can do is try to smooth your way. To those who are waiting to hear the fate of family and friends who are still missing: I can imagine you sitting with friends and family at kitchen tables around the country. Perhaps one family member is on the phone, trying to get information, struggling with overseas telephone connections or waiting in a queue for an update from foreign affairs. I can imagine you waiting. Please try to imagine us there with you. The whole nation waits, as you do, to find out the fate of those missing Australians. We cannot ease your suffering-we are powerless to change history-and all we can do is sit quietly with you and wait. Hopefully, we will be able to share your elation as you discover your loved one is alive. If not, we will mourn their death with you. I have a message for our neighbours in Indonesia also. We know that most Indonesians share our despair and are horrified by what has happened in Bali. We know that this is the work of a handful of extremists who do not represent Indonesia and do not represent Islam. 7848 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 We are saddened by the deaths of many Indonesians in this attack. We thank Balinese locals for the work of their emergency services personnel and volunteers. We hope that the perpetrators of this terrible crime are brought to justice swiftly. My heart goes out to those who have been touched by this tragedy around the world, and I am grateful for the messages of support we have had from our friends overseas. I am always proud to be Australian, and this terrible tragedy has, as such events often do, shown us what is best about our nation. We have all read the stories of selfless sacrifice: of mates returning to a raging inferno to search for mates, of strangers offering comfort in the last hours of life and of volunteers working around the clock in Balinese hospitals helping victims of all nationalities. Of course I am proud of this behaviour, but I am also proud of the way, as a nation, we have not rushed to blame our Balinese friends or all Indonesians or all Muslims. We have a right to be angry and, after this disbelief, after this grief, that anger will surely come, but let us be sure that that anger hits its mark and does not compound this tragedy by claiming innocent victims of its own. I hope that as a gesture of goodwill and solidarity we offer our medical facilities to seriously ill Balinese whose injuries are beyond the capabilities of local medical centres and hospitals. Let us fly them to Australia if it is the best way to treat them. Let us assert, in the face of terrorism, that we believe in common humanity. Sitting suspended from 1.26 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. Minister on Monday, 14 October, which was supported by the Leader of the Opposition. It is difficult for all of us to express the sorrow, the frustration and the anger that we feel following the events that took place in Bali on 12 October 2002. Those of us who were not there can only imagine the horror, but for the survivors it will be a recurring nightmare for the rest of their lives. For the families, friends and colleagues of those killed, 12 October will forever be a day of sorrow and pain. Tragically, this will be the case for the Golotta family of Tea Tree Gully in my electorate of Makin. John and Tracey Golotta were on a two-week holiday in Bali with their son Michael, his girlfriend Jasmine and their 19-year-old daughter Angela. According to reports in the Adelaide Advertiser, on the evening of October 12 the family were enjoying themselves at the popular Sari Club. Apparently Angela decided to stay on with her friends when the other members of her family returned to their hotel. Tragically, it was the last time that they would see her alive. On hearing the explosions, Mr Golotta and his son Michael rushed to the scene and witnessed a horror they will never forget, but they were unable to find Angela. Over the next two days, they searched the hospital wards, hoping for a miracle, but it was not to be. The Golottas found their daughter among the dead at Sanglah hospital and were only able to identify her by the jewellery and the clothing she was wearing. As their local federal member, I have written to John, Tracey and Michael Golotta to express on behalf of our community my deepest sympathy. But words cannot satisfactorily explain the pain we all feel at the loss of such a bright and beautiful young woman. Equally we cannot understand the twists of fate. A little over a week ago, the Sturt Football Club were celebrating their first South Australian National Football League premiership since 1976. Many of the players and officials travelled to Bali to enjoy a well-earned holiday and to celebrate the club’s success. On October 12, their joy and happiness turned to terror and grief as 22-year-old Josh Deegan, a player in Sturt’s reserve side, was confirmed dead and club trainer and former player Bob Marshall is still unaccounted for. Among these tragic tales are also the acts of heroism, which have yet to be fully recognised but which will become more apparent in the days and weeks ahead. In true Australian fashion, so many of our compatriots who were near the tragedy thought not of their own safety but of how they could help those",175,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mrs Draper (Makin) (4.00 P.m.),"I rise to support the motion moved by our PrimeWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7849 trapped and injured in the burning wreckage. It would be true to say that the Australians who volunteered to help in the rescue effort and afterwards in the Balinese hospitals have saved lives. I commend Tony Martin of Mountain Creek in Queensland who, in a letter printed in the Australian today, suggested that the most fitting memorial to those who have suffered would be to build an Australian-standard teaching hospital in Denpasar. Given the lack of facilities and expertise in the area currently, I believe Mr Martin’s suggestion makes a good deal of sense and would be supported by many Australians. In his address to parliament, the Prime Minister correctly described the Bali bombings as an act of ‘barbaric, brutal mass murder without justification’. No religion can or should justify this atrocity. No god would sanctify it and no philosophy worthy of a civilised humanity would condone it. If the terrorists hope to demoralise us and weaken our resolve to end their tyranny, they are much mistaken. The Australian government will work with the Indonesian authorities and with other nations, including our friends in the United States and the United Kingdom, to bring the murderers to justice. Our commitment to the war against terrorism is, in the words of our Prime Minister, ‘uncompromising and unconditional’. We will work with our allies to seek out terrorist organisations in our region and around the world. Our efforts cannot have any limits if we are to succeed, and we will succeed. In our grief at the loss of so many fine Australians, we should not forget those from other nations who were also victims on 12 October. Our cousins across the Tasman suffered great loss, as did the Indonesian people. The long-term effect on the Balinese economy will also be to the detriment of their local people. Already a poor nation, Indonesia cannot afford such a blow. The Indonesian authorities have said they will now crack down on terrorism within their country. This is good news, although it must be said that the United States and others, including Australia, have expressed concerns about Indonesia’s lack of endeavour on this front. For the sake of those Indonesians who were killed on 12 October as well as those from other nations, Indonesia’s actions must now match its rhetoric. Terrorism will thrive where there is a lack of resolve to fight it. The citizens of many nations died when the twin towers were destroyed on 11 September 2001, and innocents of multiple faiths and nationalities were among the dead on 12 October 2002. The commitment of Australia to the struggle against terrorism is equally matched by its commitment to helping the victims of terrorists. Within hours of the tragedy in Bali, the Australian government and its agencies had moved swiftly to provide much needed medical supplies and assistance in the Balinese hospitals and had begun the process of evacuating those Australians who were severely injured. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a helpline for families and friends seeking information about their loved ones. Officers of the state and federal police and ASIO are on the ground in Indonesia, working with their Indonesian colleagues to track down those responsible for the crime. Foreign Minister Downer and Justice Minister Ellison have flown to Bali and then on to Jakarta for top-level meetings with the Indonesian government. All that can be done is being done. The Prime Minister’s motion conveys the message that all Australians want conveyedsympathy to the grieving families, hope that the injured will recover and a resolve to put an end to those who caused such terrible suffering. We must all remember, as do those who have fought in previous wars to defend this country, that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But, as we all know, the defence and price of our freedom have many different aspects. As a former member of the Australian Defence Force who served as a nurse in the Women’s Royal Australian Navy, I do not resile from the work yet to be done to seek out the terrorists wherever they may be both in our region and around the world, and, with our allies, to bring them 7850 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 to justice. Finally, I welcome the Prime Minister’s declaration that this Sunday is to be a national day of mourning. I know that all Australians will take this opportunity to mourn those who died, pray for those who are injured and reflect on how this terrible tragedy has changed our nation forever. this debate on the motion before the House. We will all remember for the rest of our lives the events of 12 October. We will all remember that horrific terrorist act against innocent civilians, and particularly the fact that it was targeted at young people who have-and, unfortunately in some cases, who had-the rest of their fulfilling lives to look forward to. I feel a great sense of loss and sympathy for the families of those involved. I lost my mother in May this year. She was a 65-year-old woman, and I am far from over my personal grief. I cannot imagine losing my son. I cannot imagine losing someone who has the rest of their life to look forward to. Unfortunately, this tragedy has very much hit my local community. The death toll of people from the electorate of Grayndler is already in double figures. Today, I spoke to one family member in Marrickville who, just 15 minutes earlier, had it confirmed that the body of their sister-in-law had been identified in Bali. This afternoon I learnt that the Dulwich-Newtown Basketball Club, some of the members of which were on a trip in Bali, has three confirmed dead and three missing. These were young boys-they were not even young men; they were young boys really-from Dulwich High and Casimir college in Marrickville. The extent of the grieving, as well as the lack of understanding of how anyone could perpetrate such murder, is very much rippling through my local community as people engage in their everyday activities. One person I rang this morning-just one of the people I have spoken to-was involved, as I am, with the South Sydney Football Club. We knew each other, but I did not know that at the time. I phoned. I have just been trying to contact families to offer my assistance through my contact with the federal government and agencies. I acknowledge that the one positive thing that has come out of this week-that is, in question time yesterday and again today-is that people have put party politics aside to try and look after the communities which we seek to represent. The events of 12 October put some of the more petty issues which divide us into appropriate perspective, and I think both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition gave outstanding contributions in the parliament on this issue on Monday. We need to remind ourselves why people commit an act such as this, an act which we find so extraordinarily incomprehensible that it is difficult to find appropriate words to describe it. It comes from extremism, fundamentalism and intolerance, and we need to remind ourselves at this time as well that the response requires that we put ourselves above extremism, fundamentalism and intolerance. We need to remind ourselves, for example, that members of the community, regardless of their religious backgrounds, are horrified. The Islamic members of my community are just as horrified as the Christian members and the Jewish members, and we need to make sure that innocent people do not suffer from misplaced anger. We must remember the victims of this tragedy and honour them. We must ensure that justice is done and that the killers are found, tried and punished. But amidst this we must not forget that misdirected vengeance will not bring the dead back to life. It will only create more grieving families and more sadness, and there has been far too much of that already. This is a time for the community to come together as a nation. I pay tribute to the many people, beyond those who have already had publicity in the papers, who carried out acts of heroism. There is no doubt of the Australian character of",178,Representatives Main Committee
261,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (4.08 P.m.),"It brings none of us pleasure to contribute toWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7851 mateship and of giving people a hand. We have already heard stories about people giving up seats on planes-even though they were injured themselves-to people who were more in need. These are indeed heroic acts. Many of the people concerned will never be recognised publicly, but we should pay tribute to them. They did not do it for public recognition; they did it because of their humanity and because of who they are. I greatly admire them. I used to find it quite difficult as the shadow minister for ageing and seniors, my former portfolio, to go into nursing homes and to see the work that doctors and nurses do as part of their everyday activities. The work that has been carried out in Bali and also in Australia over the past few days by doctors, nurses and emergency staff working for 48 hours without a break is quite remarkable. It makes our jobs as politicians seem pretty damn easy, franklyand we complain about some of the time constraints that we have! The sort of pressure on people who go into those professions out of their commitment to and their love for their fellow human beings is something we should remind ourselves of. It is something positive to help us come through this. Sunday has been declared a national day of mourning for the victims of the Bali bombing. On that day the hearts of all Australians will go out to the families concerned, particularly those touched directly by this enormous human tragedy. I believe that we need to mourn collectively, as a nation, and to go through a grieving process. We need also to make sure that we respond to this tragedy appropriately: by all means target those responsible, but remember that to cause innocent people to suffer is an inappropriate response to a tragedy such as this. I also think it is important to acknowledge that it is not just Australians who have been affected by this tragedy; people from throughout the world who were there at that nightclub have been affected. I, like many Australians in their younger days, have been to Bali. I have been to Bali twice, and I have been to the Sari Club. Bali is a place where you go to forget about day-to-day activities. There is something about a holiday in a tropical climate: even if you have been away for only two days, you get off the plane at home feeling like you have been away for two weeks. That is what attracts people to Bali, and that is what somehow makes it worse. It makes it worse that the innocent people who were there were fulfilling their desire for a better life and that they were cut down in such a tragic way. We must also remember the Balinese themselves: a peaceful, heart-warming people who have reached out to generations of Australians as friends and neighbours. The Australian government must do what it can for them as well. I know there is a call for Balinese who were injured in that tragedy and who need medical assistance to be brought to Australia so that we can assist those people as well. I commend this motion to the House. are broken, friendships are shattered, lovers are parted. October 12 will always be a day of profound national sadness. The bombing in Bali has saddened all of us. Young lives have been lost. People who travelled abroad in friendship, who were building bridges and who were living the very essence of life are no longer with us. I give my sincere condolences to all of the families. There are 180 dead, 30 Australians have already been identified as having been killed and sadly that number is likely to rise significantly. There are numerous people missing and over 100 injured from Australia alone. Each of these people has their own story; they are a parent, a brother, a sister, a child or a friend in their own right, and they all have parents or brothers or sisters or children or friends of their own. There was a headline this morning that read, ‘Time to bring them home’. That strikes at the very notion that they are ours and they must come home. But they will not come home as they left. Our loss has also been replicated by that of others, particularly the Balinese. They lost their own, and sadly I",180,Representatives Main Committee
262,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (4.19 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not as we were. Families7852 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 feel they may have lost much of their heritage. There will be hard times ahead. At this stage, 24 countries in all have people either dead or missing, so it is a loss for many. Australians are looking for a symbol. They are seeking to share their collective pain by making a collective gesture. CanI gently suggest a wattle tribute-the wearing of a sprig of wattle, or even a yellow ribbon to symbolise the wattle, over the heart. Communities, families and individuals could plant wattle trees as a sign of renewal and as a symbol of Australia. This expression of compassion and generosity, which we see in so many Australians, extends throughout the country. We have seen terrible sadness in Bali. In this case, Australians and others have shown their extraordinary generosity in lending their aid to those who are suffering. Immediately after the tragedy in Bali, Somers resident Tamara McKiernan spent 20 hours taking care of the injured in one of Bali’s hospitals. She first brought bandages and disinfectant from local pharmacies to ensure that the hospital had as many emergency supplies as possible before tending to and translating for many of the most desperately injured. Tamara was one of so many Australians, Balinese and others who showed great generosity, and her spirit is a fine example of what we can be in times of tragedy. We will always face difficult challenges, but Tamara McKiernan reminds us of both how lucky we are to live in such a stable and caring community and, sadly, how we can never take these blessings for granted. That very compassion brings us to the essence of Australia. This has been a country built on hope and aspiration, on a bright and sunny spirit. We must grieve as we share the collective pain. The individuals closest will always bear the personal loss. But we must also remember that the murderers sought two things: they sought to create fear and they sought to create hatred. They seek to do this both at home in Indonesia and abroad. Roosevelt said, ‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.’ So we must be vigilant but we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid in our own homes and to let the murderers take the victory they wish for. Kipling said, ‘Being hated, don’t give way to hating.’ The murderers were engaged in a vain attempt to stop the future, a future about a diverse world-for that is the only viable way that we can live together. Anything else will give way to walls of hate and mistrust. And if we retreat we close ourselves off from the world. So while we cannot give way to fear and hatred we must also be resolved: we must address those who carried out this act of pure hatred. The threat which manifested itself in the bombing in Bali is a threat against all people: Muslims, Christians and Hindus in Indonesia; Muslims, Christians and others in the West; Muslims, Christians and others in Australia. So you cannot purchase immunity through insignificance. Whether we engage or withdraw, the threat will still be there-to us and to others. This action was not caused or carried out by any Australian. It is part of an ongoing campaign that has ripped at the heart of Indonesia and has also caught France, Germany, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, Britain, Ecuador, Hungary and many other countries by taking their nationals and residents from them. So the violence is indiscriminate, and it is founded on an oppressive vision. Our response must recognise the reality that, before this, there were 30 bombings in the last year alone in Indonesia. The bombing in Bali was part of a continuing process. It was the first time, though, that it had reached out so clearly and tragically and ripped at Australia. We must be resolute against such indiscriminate hatred, but not by force alone. The solution lies in Indonesia, so we must work with them. We have to make this extremist philosophy unsustainable. We cannot accept violence as a legitimate political expression. We know that education and openness break the shackles of control which are based on ignorance and domination, so there is much to be done there. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7853 We are not as we were. Too many beautiful young lives have been lost and too many families’ hearts have been broken. We must grieve for all, and for each of them. And we must be unrelenting in our search for their killers. But let us not hand the murderers the victory they want by darkening the essence of our Australian soul. Ultimately, let us honour our young by living with their hope, their generosity and their belief in the future. Bali, I will make a number of historical allusions. In the centre of Charters Towers there is a beautiful band rotunda in a once beautiful park-it has been virtually destroyed by the state government’s attitude towards flying foxes, so we have lost our beautiful park. It was a Boer War memorial and, as such, there are the names there of 30 or 40 Charters Towers citizens who died in the Boer War. I suppose it is to our shame that we were associated with a war in which 28,000 women and children perished in concentration camps. There is no precedent for what happened in Germany, except for the treatment of the wives and children of the Boer farmers who were in those concentration camps. Nearly 30,000 of them died, and you can get some idea of how horrific it was when you consider that the Americans lost 54,000, killed in the war against Japan. We are here today to mark the deaths of maybe 100 or 200 Australians, but we participated in a war in which 28,000 totally innocent civilians died in concentration camps. And you say, ‘What the hell were we doing in that war?’ We were in that war because we were scared-we were a little tiny outpost of Anglos in a great big sea of people who were very different to us and we felt we had to stay close to England or our situation would not be a happy one. On the same basis, we went into the First World War and had much higher casualties per head of population than any other country in that war. Our casualties were quite horrific and were a significant proportion of our entire population. Again, you say, ‘What were we doing in that war? What, really, did it have to do with us?’ Again, we had to stay close to England because we were scared, because we were a little tiny outpost in a sea of people who were different to us. TodayI broke ranks with my Independent colleagues in the House of Representatives because they felt that we should not go into Iraq except under a United Nations sanction. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Lindsay, we admire your courage and independence of thought in taking the stand that you did. But I did not see it that way. Quite frankly, I felt that we really do have to stay close to the United States. This country will be in the gravest peril unless it does stay close to the United States. You have to ask yourself: are our interests best served in staying close to the United States? Internal politics dictate that the United States operates very aggressively in the Middle East. The internal politics, trade considerations and interests of this country do not at all dictate that we should be involved in the Middle East. But if we are not, and if we start showing distance between ourselves and the United States, and we get into trouble and have to holler for a marshal, I do not know where that marshal is going to come from. I never criticised this government for going into East Timor. But every single piece of knowledge that I have accumulated from the thousands of history books that I have read in my life-probably about two or three a week-indicates to me that you do not pick a fight with a country that has the fourth or fifth biggest standing army on Earth when, at the same time, you have one operational submarine, no radar and, I do not hesitate to say, 50,000 silly little plastic rifles that the SAS quite rightly refuse to take. As an ex weapons instructor in the army and a person who shot-I will do some skiting-in the Earl Roberts shoot for the British Commonwealth, I would like to think I know a little bit about firearms. Even then, there are only 50,000 of those rifles.",181,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (4.28 P.m.),"In speaking on the motion on the terrorist attacks in7854 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 Honourable member interjectingthat occurred in Bali. I am sorry that you do not understand-and I would have thought it was fairly obvious to most people on the planet-that the tragedy occurred in Bali because of our very close association with the United States. If you would like to present some other reason I would most certainly be keen to hear it, and I am sure that everyone else here today would be keen to hear it. I will help you out if you are having difficulties. We are talking about going in and having a fight when this country is undefended. As a North Queenslander yourself, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you and I are both well aware of the fact that the entire north Australian coastline-from Cairns through Bamaga to the Gulf of Carpentaria, over to Gove and Darwin and down to Port Hedland and Karrathais about 6,000 kilometres. Only 100 kilometres of that shows any signs of human habitation. You have to understand that, if we want to live in South-East Asia, we must know and understand our neighbours and we must become great friends with our neighbours. Any person that has a fight with the person next door is very foolish. You have to get along with those people. But you have to see it from their point of view. They have 250 million people crammed onto six tiny little islands. The way they see it is that we went in and took half of one of those islands from them. That is the way that they see it. There is great rage and anger we are dealing with and confronting here. I think every Australian who loves his country does not want us to continue in a situation of rage and anger with our nearest neighbours. But to get out from under the United States’ coat-tails we must become a country in our own right, and we are far too small, at 20 million people, to even remotely consider doing that. I am pleased to see here the member who represents the vast landmass of the Northern Territory. In the last war our interests were subjugated to those of Great Britain. When 110,000 Japanese troops were massing on the Malaysian border, not a single military person in the world hesitated for one moment in wondering exactly what they were doing. They were massing there for an attack upon Singapore, and everybody knew that. Even though this was occurring and even though the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Curtin, was well aware of the fact, where were our troops-where was the Australian Army? Our interests were so subjugated to those of Great Britain that the Australian Army was defending the Libyan desert. Three of our five divisions were defending the Libyan desert. We are told that there is no threat from our northern neighbours. That is what they said in the Second World War: ‘The Japanese have got no way of coming down the peninsula. They haven’t got any armoured personnel carriers, they haven’t got any lorries-they have no means of getting down there.’ They walked and they commandeered bicycles. It was very surprising. We are being told the same load of rubbish now that we were told then. Our interests were so subjugated that, with the enemy knocking on the door and bombing Darwin, our troops were defending the Libyan desert. This country has got to grow up. It has to mature and become a country in its own right. We are Australians. We are not descended from the British or descended from whoever; we are Australians. We are a different thing completely and we must acknowledge that fact. To do that, we have to develop northern Australia. Frankly, there is no doubt in my mind that in another conflict they will draw a line, probably from Karratha to Cairns, and say, ‘You can have all of the stuff north of that.’ That is not an unreasonable proposition. Do you think that a mother in Sydney would believe her son should be taken from her and shot fighting in a war for country that this country has never been interested in? There is no development there, there are no people there-there is nothing there. I pay great tribute to pioneers in places like",183,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Katter,"I am copping an interjection here. What we are talking about is the tragedyWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7855 Darwin and little Karumba in my own electorate, where my own family originally come from, and all of those areas. I pay great tribute to them. But I was at a conference recently where they said: ‘They keep talking about northern development-they’re never going to develop it. It’s been 150 years and there’s still nobody there.’ It is a valid argument. Is this country really interested in occupying its landmass? You would have to say no, it is not. People say to us: ‘We can’t have a population of 50 million. Mr Carr said you can’t possibly have a population of 50 million. This country can’t support a population of 20 million.’ The Murray-Darling Basin at this very moment supports a population of 20 million and it has supported a bigger and bigger population every single year of its existence. Maybe it has reached a hiatus now-I do not know-but it supports a population of 20 million people. Everybody knows that. There is six times more water in the rivers of the Gulf Country, the area that I represent, than there is in the Murray-Darling Basin. We have twice as much arable blacksoil land as the Murray-Darling has, stretching north for 1,200 or 1,300 kilometres all the way from Blackall to the Gulf of Carpentaria. This area can be developed. If we grow up and are able to stand on our own two feet, we will not be dragged into situations such as the terrible events that occurred in Bali where our own citizens are killed. That sort of hatred is being turned upon us because of things that the United States are doing-and I am not saying that they are wrong-in the Middle East. We are paying the penalty for that. It is a surrogate punishment, and it is a surrogate punishment that will continue and will get worse. I want to put on record here today that what you saw in Bali is only the tip of the iceberg-that is only a start. This nation must grow up. It must move to that population. It must occupy its continental landmass. Otherwise it will provide a magnet to every other country on earth that is overpopulated. Our nearest neighbour has 100 million people going to bed hungry every night. If you return to those figures I gave you, you will see that the Gulf Country by itself can support a population of 100 million people. Do you think it is fair to ask an American mother to sacrifice her son in fighting for land that this country was never interested enough to occupy, except for a hundred thousand or a couple of hundred thousand hardy little souls who live in the area north of the line from Cairns to Karratha? TodayI plead with the government of Australia. We need to become a country in our own right. We need to have our own ability to defend ourselves. This is not a huge expense, strangely enough. We could have a hundred patrol boats equipped with guided missiles, 10 or 20 submarines instead of six submarines and an adequate radar system. But most of all, if we have a coastline of 6,000 kilometres that shows human occupation for only 100 kilometres, what right do we have to hold on to that in a world where a third of the population goes to bed hungry at night? People ask whether it will help the Philippines or Indonesia if we develop and produce food in these areas. Yes, it will. In fact, the biggest agricultural commodity this country produces is beef. One in seven beasts we produce in this country goes to those countries by way of the live cattle trade. We send out a very cheap product; we send a $400 steer up there. They put a lot of time and effort into making that steer a really big bullock, and then they process him out because they have very cheap wage rates up there. They are able to secure from us enormously cheap, high-quality protein, which is of enormous value to countries such as those. There is a great future in the trade arrangements between us and these countries. There is a great saying that good fences produce good neighbours. A good fence is defence capability. There are basic elements. I could talk about a lot of automatic rifles in this country. I could talk about following the Switzerland model or following the Israel model. They are little countries surrounded by big giants. I could talk about the enormous success of the Israeli 7856 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 war machine. There are only four million people in that country, but when you take them on you take on an army of three million people. There are very few countries on earth that would like to pick a fight with an army with three million soldiers in it. The situation is similar with Switzerland. I do not think it has been invaded for 600 years, because every single Swiss citizen has an automatic firearm at home. It also has the lowest homicide rate in Europe-arguably in the entire world. The very essence of this great tragedy, and I want to put this on record here, is that this sort of thing will occur again and again, and it will get worse and worse, until this country grows up and occupies this continental landmass. As long as it does not do that, quite rightly the rest of the world will look at it as a magnet. Professor Richard Blandy, in an excellent landmark article in the Australian some years ago, said that the population of Australia in the year 2001-(Time expired) I did believe-every member of this House, in extending my absolute sympathy, support and comfort to those people whose families, friends and communities are affected. I thought every single one of us supported them and would continue to support them. Who would have thought that an area like ours in western New South Wales could be amongst the first in Australia to suffer the direct consequences of these lunatics? One hesitates to call them human beings; they are simply disgusting people without the courage or the nerve to face up to the world and be identified for whatever it is they believe in. They certainly do not believe in religion or in a cause; it is some mad power game where they want to dominate everybody around them. They do not have the guts, the courage or the ingenuity to do it in a way so that the rest of us can recognise them. I think what makes this seem just so terrible to all of us is the fact that it is our youth and our sporting people, things that Australia absolutely prides itself on, who have been so directly affected by this. I know that we are a very proud people, a very proud young nation, and we have never been involved in anything we did not truly believe in or back as a nation. To have this cowardly thing happen is probably a new experience for this country. We have been involved in stand-up wars where you face the people you are fighting, but I think this sort of thing brings home, right across our country and across every country, that what was the world’s problem is now very much our problem. What do you say to people like the family of Paul Cronin from a little town called Trundle; to the family of Brad Ridley-a very good friend of my daughter-from a town called Burcher; and to the family of Greg Sanderson, who do not really know but who obviously, like the rest of us, fear the worse? They were all part of a football club providing the youth and zest that all of us, old and young, thrive and live on. We really do not know the fate of Gerard Yeo, a boy from Dubbo who came from the Coogee Dolphins football club. Not knowing is pretty terrible for everyone. What do we say about it? We all feel a very deep anger. I think it is a good anger, because that anger is what is going to sustain us for some time to come. Whether you are family, whether you are from the community or whether you are someone who has to deal with it to make sure it does not happen to us again, you never get used to it. This anger is going to sustain us while we learn to live with it and while, as Australians, we do our level best to deal with it-as does the rest of the world. Make no mistake: the whole world has to deal with it. What kind of a world is it if we have to continue never knowing who is safe and never knowing where terrorists may hit?

The Prime Minister said quite correctly that there is every chance we may have to deal with this on our home soil, let alone in another country. Let us keep acting in an open and Australian way. For those who are injured, whether they be in Sydney hospitals, from western New South Wales or from any part of Australia that has been so devastated by this, let all of us continue to act as Australians. Let us back those who are going to do their jobs and, without doubt, we will find the people responsible for this. We have to find the people responsible for this so that the relatives, the friends and the communities-in fact, the whole Australian community-so struck down by this know not only that we can handle this in the future but also that their loss, our loss, is simply a catalyst for making sure that the whole world is better prepared to deal with this in the future. If somebody wants to talk about America being responsible for this or somebody else being responsible for this then they need to get in touch with the real world. The people responsible for this are the nameless, faceless, gutless people who are not about religion and who are not about a cause but who are about having everything their own way. As devastated as we all might be, we have to deal with that. The only way to deal with it is try to root it out. I know that the parliament joins in saying to those so affected by this that it is going to be a long haul. The waiting must be absolutely terrible. We will get there. Those affected have the deepest sympathy of everybody in this place. motion. Sunday’s attack in Bali was an attack on innocence. I would like to identify with the remarks of the member for Parkes, especially the latter part where he referred to the gutless nature of those people who perpetrated this act of violence and inhumanity. This was not an attack that any ideology or measure of perceived injustice could ever justify. Innocent Balinese, innocent Australians, innocent people from other countries-young people from all across the globe-are now dead. Innocent families have been shattered. Children have lost their parents; parents have lost their children. This was a callous act of mass murder; a cowardly act; an act of intolerance, malice, discrimination, inhumanity and just plain bastardry. It demands a response. It demands that we find those responsible and make them confront the consequences of their own brutality. We have an obligation on behalf of all those who have suffered and are suffering to bring them to justice. The horror of Sunday morning also demands that we attempt to understand why it happened and how best we can prevent it from happening again. If we do not do so, we will be doing a further injustice to those people who have suffered. This morning more than 30 Australians have been confirmed dead and 180 remain unaccounted for. It is terrible to contemplate what the human cost may ultimately prove to be. For the most part, as people have said and the media have portrayed, those Australians in the Kuta area were at the time enjoying a typical Australian experience-getting away from the clutter of ordinary life to spend a week or so in one of their country’s favourite holiday spots. They were there with their best friends, their mates, their uncles, their aunties, their cousins, their football teams, their families. For some it was their first trip overseas. I took my own children to Bali last year. It is an adventure many young Australians have taken over the past 30 years. Many people in this parliament would have had that experience. What a tragedy it is that this tradition, one which has brought so much pleasure to people from all over Australia and one which has brought much needed funds to the deserving Balinese population through tourism, may be irretrievably lost. This tradition is not only ours; it is a tradition that belongs to Bali too. Of all the people such a calamity could have befallen, it",186,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (4.51 P.m.),"I rise to speak in support of the Prime Minister’s7858 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 grieves me that it is the people of this island who will hurt the most. The Balinese are renowned throughout Asia for their kindness, their generosity, their selflessness and their gentle nature. They have a special place in the hearts of many Australians. We have come to share much with these people in the past. I can only hope that this attack will not stop Australians from sharing their lives with the Balinese in the future. One tradition that certainly has not been lost is the tradition of mateship in times when we need it most. I just want to say a few words about the extraordinary efforts taken by Territorians to assist the victims over the past four days-in particular, the staff and volunteers at the Royal Darwin Hospital, the police, emergency and defence services and the many other community organisations that offered their help. Royal Darwin is a relatively small hospital, but nonetheless it coped magnificently at extremely short notice to care for the 61 bombing victims who began to be flown in just 24 hours after their ordeal. The staff of the hospital and other services faced enormous pressure. Working double shifts in many cases, their efforts undoubtedly saved the lives of some of the most seriously injured. We owe them our gratitude. They gave comfort to those who were suffering. The Northern Territory government should also be noted for its efforts to coordinate logistics and support services for all those involved. I am proud of the community spirit that has been shown by Territorians and their government. They responded to this tragedy willingly and well beyond the call of their duty. They have our respect and admiration. News reports today and yesterday have suggested that up to eight men in two vans carried out the attacks, possibly through a remote control device. Traces of the military explosive C4 were found by a multinational team of forensic investigators earlier in the week. Two possible suspects have been questioned by Balinese police, and talks have also begun with up to 10 other potential witnesses. Although it is too early to consider any of these developments a breakthrough, they are all helpful signs of progress. They give us hope that the cause of this painful event will eventually be revealed. Another helpful sign is the cooperative efforts of the Indonesian police, security and other agencies to involve Australia and other countries in their investigations. What is unhelpful is the series of accusations against individuals, organisations and even an entire religion that have surfaced in the past couple of days from sections of the Australian community before any evidence has been accumulated. Whilst the known and identified terrorist organisations clearly have to be brought to book, we need to ensure that we ourselves do not impose injustice on injustice. Our relationship with Indonesia has suffered over recent years, partly because of the rebirth of the situation in relation to East Timor and partly because of deliberate choice and changing priorities. Last month I travelled to Indonesia with a parliamentary delegation. Part of this visit involved participating in a forum at the Muhammadiyah University in Malang on the island of Java, where we discussed the relationship between politics and Islam in the Indonesian society. It was clear to me from being at this forum that there is no tolerance for extremists in the general population of Indonesia. Today, I received a message of condolence from the master of ceremonies of the forum in Malang, Mr Rinjani Bonavidi. I would like to take this opportunity to read from his letter. He said: As a person who has received the goodness of the Australian Government as well as her people, I would like to express my deepest sympathy for what has happened in Bali. For Indonesia, may this incident show the right path for all of us and enlighten the hearts of our leaders to stand for a better nation. We can all take heart from knowing that this sentiment is felt widely across the peoples of Indonesia. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7859 Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, as you would know, because you were a part of the parliamentary delegation, we also met with leaders of the Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest Islamic organisation in the world with over 45 million members, and a representative of the Central Board of the Muhammadiyah, which has over 30 million members. I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we were led to believe from these discussions and from those at the Muhammadiyah University where we participated in a seminar that there is a strength of feeling against extremists by the majority of followers of Islam in Indonesia. We need to be very careful that we do not demonise, as some people would like to do, elements of the Islamic population because of the actions of these extremists, who it is clear to me cannot justify their actions on the basis of religion. This attack was clearly directed against young westerners, and perhaps directed against young Australians. But we should be left in no doubt that it was also about destabilising the political leadership of Indonesia. It is worth recalling that only recently the Indonesian parliament rejected a proposal to incorporate sharia law into the Indonesian Constitution. This reaffirmed the view of the founding fathers of the Indonesian Constitution in 1945, who then chose not to incorporate sharia law into the Constitution because they believed in a secular state. It is clear Australia now needs to renew its links with the region and make them stronger. There was a time when Australia was a regional leader; we need to be a leader again. We must dispel the notion that we can act in isolation from the experience of our neighbours. The global war on terrorism, of which we are now more deeply a part than ever, is not a war of Western dominance over Eastern or other ideas. If it is practised in such a manner, it will inevitably fail. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the regional community is looking for leadership, and I believe that is the case. As Paul Kelly said in today’s Australian: Bali’s October 12 attack links security within Indonesia directly to the security of Australia and Australians. It is an ominous linkage. It has always existed in theory and now it exists in practice. He went on to say: Australian needs to renew its multiple links within the region. The problems of crime, drugs and boatpeople have been joined by terrorism. There is no option but deeper regional co-operation. Call it Keating’s revenge. Dennis Shanahan made a similarly worded observation in the same paper: The problems of crime, drugs and boatpeople have now been joined by terrorism. There is no option but deeper regional co-operation. It is clear that informed commentators are expressing this view, a view which I strongly share and identify with. We may be able to avoid another Bali. We at least have to try. In doing so we are faced with a number of tasks, two of which are to find the perpetrators of this madness and to bring them to justice. But we owe it also to the victims, their families and our future security to be a better neighbour and to look for stronger relationships within our immediate region. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (5.01 p.m.)-I would like firstly to offer my condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the Bali bombing. This is one of our nation’s greatest tragedies: the murder of so many innocent young holiday-makers. The grief at these untimely deaths must be immense. We cannot let these crimes go unpunished. BeforeI came down to make this speech I saw on the AAP wire service that Indonesia has just arrested the alleged maker of the bomb, and there were some preliminary details on the wire service. 7860 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 In my time as a member we have been challenged by the Port Arthur massacre, the Black Hawk tragedy-I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you were on hand at the time of that tragedy and responded very quickly to that-and the attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001. They were tragedies that come to mind that were similar to this one. But we should expect that, as great as those tragedies were, this atrocity will scar our nation more. Almost every community in Australia will be affected in some way. From my home town of Adelaide, the Sturt Football Club-the mighty double-blues-after winning their first premiership since 1976, were celebrating with an end of season trip. One of them, 22-year-old Josh Deegan, a member of the Sturt reserves, has been confirmed dead. Josh went to Highgate Primary the year ahead of my wife’s brother, and later to Unley High School in my electorate. In his obituary published in the Australian today, Unley High’s Deputy Principal, Malcolm Lindquist, described him as a model student: He was quiet but he was a good scholar, loved his sport, particularly football, and he was part of a group who had remained friends. Josh had lived or spent some time in my electorate. Sturt Football Club trainer Bob Marshall is still missing. Another Sturt player, their full-forward, Julian Burton, is suffering from severe burns. I offer that as an example of the way these deaths are almost a snapshot of young Australia and how they will affect every community. Tim Hawkins, a law graduate of the University of Tasmania, a bronze medallist in the world under-23 double sculls and the brother of Barcelona gold medallist Stephen Hawkins, was in the vicinity of the Sari Club on Saturday night and is still missing. Like many Australians, I have visited Bali: once, in 1998, with my wife; and in July last year on a parliamentary delegation. In 1998 my wife and I made one or two trips to Kuta and spent some time in some of the other nightclubs. We were not in the Sari club, but we certainly walked along Jalan Legian, where these terrible murders took place. I feel, as I suppose many hundreds of thousands of Australians do who have visited Bali: there, but for the grace of God, go I. It really does bring home how indiscriminate terrorism can be. In considering where to go from here, there is no road map to show us the way. Indiscriminate terrorism has rarely touched our nation. We all look to our leaders to provide strength and purpose. We pray for those who have survived and those who are still missing, and we ask why people can be so filled with hate that they will indiscriminately kill innocent people. We also look to ordinary people who, by lending a hand, became heroes: the unnamed Australian men who pulled women from a room at the Sari Club, or Angela Graham of Melbourne, who pulled her friend Sophie Karagiannis from the club; Hanabeth Luke of Byron Bay who helped a tourist escape the club after her boyfriend had been killed, and Busselton policeman Tim Britten, who rescued wounded people from the Sari Club. A tragedy such as this shows the true character of a nation. We see it in the injured who still helped others to survive, we see it in the outstanding professionalism of our medical, defence and police personnel. What we have seen since Saturday night is the full resources of government being applied to retrieve and tend to the injured, to repatriate those who were killed, to counsel the bereaved and the traumatised, and to use our good offices to encourage Indonesia to do more to find the perpetrators of this massacre. As I said before, tragedies such as this can show our country at its best. I think of Dr Bill Griggs and the Royal Adelaide Hospital trauma service. For as long as I have known him, Bill has been wherever he was needed-on a hospital ship in the Gulf War and saving Mika Hakkinen’s life during the Adelaide Grand Prix, as well as attending countless traumas over the years. Fortunately, in the Gulf War, they were prepared, with the mighty American hospital ships, for combined burn and blast injuries. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7861 Sadly in Bali, of course, the medical facilities were nothing like that. I think of the comments of a Western Australian burns surgeon in today’s Australian who said essentially that in 20 years she had never seen injuries like this-combined full thickness burns with blast injuries, shrapnel and so on. It is the sort of thing you would only see in a military or war situation. I am also thinking of the professionalism of our government. I think of our defence forces who have helped evacuate those Australians who are injured and who are helping to repatriate the remains of Australians killed in the blast. I think of our mission in Jakarta and our consulate in Bali. Our mission in Jakarta is one of our largest missions, and it has representatives from virtually every Commonwealth department. Due to the importance of our relationship with Indonesia, as you would be aware, we have many of our top people there. SoI think at the moment of our ambassador, Ric Smith, and also the consul general, Ross Tysoe, and their professional and excellent staff. They would never, in their wildest dreams, have prepared for something like this. Evacuations of Australians, maybe, but with a thing such as this it is hard to imagine. I also have been impressed by the airlines, Qantas and Garuda, in the compassionate and timely way they have responded. In my comments I have mainly focused on the Australian impact, but it was not just Australians who were killed. People of many nationalities-over 30 from the United Kingdom, many from Indonesia and others from a whole host of countries-were killed. Some people will say this is a result of Australia taking a strong stand against al-Qaeda in the war against terrorism. I do not believe we had any choice. To have ignored what happened on 11 September 2001 would have been wrong. Australians were killed in the World Trade Centre bombing and in the plane which crashed into the Pentagon in Washington. I conclude by commending all the volunteers and the men and women of the ADF and the state health and police services. I also commend the men and women of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and those of the many Commonwealth departments that have made a contribution and have helped us to respond to this tragedy. Once again, I send my sympathy to all of those who have lost family or friends in these callous murders. for its infamy. It is a day that will be remembered for its infamy for the entirety of Australia’s history, because on that day a secretive, snide and savage group of terrorists took the lives not just of a few but of probably hundreds of innocent Australian tourists going about their normal lives in a holiday atmosphere. The debate that we are participating in, initiated by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, is an immensely sad one because those who were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing have been cut down so brutally and so savagely by those who would do harm not only to them but to all those they represent: the Australian people and the people of the West. We know that no-one has come forward to claim that they have done this, in exactly the same way that no-one has come forward to acknowledge their attack on the US Cole. Noone has come forward to acknowledge that they attacked United States embassies in Africa. No-one has come forward to claim that they were responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1994. Equally, no-one came forward at the time of September 11. Almost a year later, the leader of al-Qaeda finally said, ‘Yes, we’re responsible.’ In a promotional video they had prepared, they said they had planned it. But the probability, from all that can be gleaned so far, is that this attack on innocent Australians is but one in a series of pattern attacks where the people who are responsible for them do not take the time to acknowledge that they are responsible. Not only do they not take the time to acknowledge their guilt; they do not acknowledge any participation whatsoever.",187,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (5.10 P.m.),"12 October 2002 is a day that will be remembered7862 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 This is a pattern of attacks that has been going on for a long period of time. Essentially, it is a series of entirely unprovoked attacks against Western secularism. In the West we have, for hundreds of years now, been able to separate church and state. The West, since the end of the Reformation and the great religious wars, has split state functions and clerical functions. Those people who professedly are behind al-Qaeda and behind a number of organisations now operating, as we know, in South-East Asia seek to establish theocratic states not only in South-East Asia but in many places around the world as well. For them, the simple existence of a Western secular state in Australia, the United States, Britain, Europe or the Middle East is an affront to the narrowness and the fundamentalist nature of their thinking. The savage brutality and barbarity of their actions is of course an outgrowth of their point of view about those whom they seek to destroy. They seek not only to destroy the individuals whose lives they have taken away and whom they have maimed-people who will carry those burdens and traumas through the rest of their lives-but also to wipe away Western secular society and the very foundation of the way we go about doing things. There is a point of difference that I have with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. In their contributions to this debate they both made the point that these were indiscriminate killings. I know it is the normal way in which this would be depicted, but I in fact demur and argue that these were highly discriminate killings. They discriminated precisely. They were precisely designed and precisely executed to attack people from the West, people who are identifiably different from those who undertook to exterminate them, and to do so without any qualm whatsoever for the dimensions of the anger, anxiety and trauma that they put through not only the direct victims but their families, friends and indeed the societies from which all of these people come. This effectively is part of our memorial debate in regard to all of those Australians who have been identified as having lost their lives. The number has gone from 14 to 30 Australians identified. There are still more than 140 people who cannot be identified, and many of those may be Australians. It is already the greatest peacetime loss, certainly the greatest loss from an act of terrorism, that Australians have had to undergo. There has been a whole range of reactions to that. Part of the reaction is for some people to say-and it has been said of the attacks on the twin towers and also of these attacks-that we should be finding space to forgive these people for what they have done. That might be a good Christian approach to argue for and to contemplate. Given the depth of infamy that is involved in the attacks on the twin towers, the attacks on Washington and the attacks that have been attempted around the world, including the attempted attacks on the US embassy and the Australian High Commission in Singapore and a series of others that have failed in this long series of attacks on Western secular democracies, this part of a long war that began more than a decade ago and began unprovoked by us, I cannot find that I have the space for that kind of charity, because we are involved in a changed set of circumstances where there is a fundamental attack on the core nature of our society. If we allow the fundamental strengths of our society to be used against us, and if we allow our normal compassion to be extended to those who would exterminate us utterly, I think we would be doing the wrong thing by those people who have had their lives and futures entirely and untimely stripped from them. It would be the wrong thing to do by people who were entirely innocent. There is a stronger reaction that you can have. It is a reaction that was expressed by Mark Antony in Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar was not a person who was without guilt. Julius Caesar razed towns; he depopulated places in the wars that he undertook in Gaul, Spain and elsewhere. But Antony made a speech over the body of Caesar after he had made a pledge to the Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7863 23 or so people who had assassinated Caesar-Cassius, Brutus and a range of others such as Trebonius and Casca, who struck the first blow. Taking their bloody hands in his, he pledged that he would give the funeral oration for Caesar and that he would not take up the cause against these people. Then in making a speech over Caesar’s body when he was alone with it he apologised for using temperate talk in regard to the people who savagely stripped him of his life at what was still a relatively young age. This is not a temperate speech, but given the nature of the long war that we have been involved in and the long war that will continue until the people who perpetrated this are brought to justice and until Western secularism wins out against this savage attack on it, I think it might underline the strength of feeling which a lot of people have, and which I certainly have, in regard to what has happened. He said this: O Pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, ThatI am meek and gentle with these butchers! Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue), A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Atè by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc,” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men, groaning for burial. We should not easily forgive or forget what has been done to our Australian citizens. We should pursue the perpetrators and we should bring them to justice. previous speakers on this particular paper, except the member for Kennedy. I found myself in disagreement with virtually everything that the member for Kennedy said. Having noted that, I was very privileged only six weeks ago to be able to go to Indonesia on a bilateral parliamentary delegation and talk to the Indonesian government and to ordinary Indonesians. I found in Indonesia, having not been there previously, a land of contrasts. I had feelings of very great concern and feelings that the Indonesians were very much the friends of Australia. My concerns were related to the environment, finance, the rule of law and those sorts of things. And there was the question of Islam. I want to tell this parliament and the Australian people that every person I spoke to where this issue was discussed, from the leaders of 90 million Muslims down to the slums of north Jakarta, people universally wanted to tell us that they were followers of a moderate religion, a religion that preached love for their fellow man, a religion not unlike the traditional beliefs of Christians, Jews, Buddhists and so on. The clear understanding here is that what happened in",191,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (5.21 P.m.),"I wish to associate myself with the comments of all7864 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 Bali is the responsibility of a small group of extremists. Let us make that very clear-a small group of extremists, utterly rejected by the great bulk of the Indonesian people. There should be no doubt about that. There should be no retribution brought down upon the good people of Indonesia. I would like to focus on Indonesia in a different way to previous speakers. Indonesia is a vast archipelago of 17,000 islands. It has a population of about 230 million. Its size, the nature of its domestic and international policies and its relative proximity to Australia ensure that bilateral relations between the two countries are of the highest importance. It is essential that Australians understand and are conversant with Indonesia’s culture, government, politics, economy, trade and defence policies. In 1997, we all know that the Indonesian economy suffered an almost mortal blow and was required to undertake major reform. In 1997, the GPD of the country was $US215 billion, but following the collapse of the economy in that year GDP fell to a low of $US95.4 billion. Fortunately, GDP has now risen to about $US161.9 billion. The level of trade between Indonesia and Australia is significant, with Indonesia being Australia’s 10th largest market for merchandise exports and our ninth largest source of imports. In 2001, two-way merchandise trade was approximately $7.1 billion. In 1999-2000, Australian investment in Indonesia was $2.6 billion. Australian aid to Indonesia is about $120 million per annum, and it is worth every cent. It does marvellous things. For example, we support 360 new postgraduate scholarships for study in Australia every year. In relation to health services, we are providing facilities to immunise against polio 1.3 million children in four provinces. We are training 320 midwives in basic safety delivery care. We are delivering emergency obstetric equipment to 496 health centres and 27 hospitals. We are supplying almost half a million HIV-AIDS blood test kits. Most members will know that Australia provides a range of technical training and services to Indonesian government agencies in areas such as money laundering, antiterrorism, finance, corruption commissions and so on. A key level of support is in bilateral defence cooperation initiatives, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, will know about. The bilateral defence cooperation initiatives cost around $4.75 million. In May 2002, there were 34 TNI personnel in Australia undertaking education training activities under the defence cooperation plan, and we undertake technical cooperation capacity building with Indonesia’s directorate-general of immigration. Following the Asian financial crisis, Australia provided to Indonesia $US1 billion in second-tier support funding as part of the IMF’s support package. Indonesia recognised that. Indonesia recognises that Australia is a great friend. In relation to agriculture, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research has 50 projects, to the value of $42 million, in Indonesia. The worrying problem for Indonesia is of course the government debt to GDP. At the end of 1997, that figure was 34 per cent. Towards the end of 2000, it increased to over 100 per cent. Imagine running a country with a debt to GDP of over 100 per cent. Fortunately, it has come back from that: it is expected to fall to about 90 per cent by the end of 2002. The problem for the Indonesian economy, as members will all understand, is that high levels of government debt divert revenue away from public programs designed to stimulate the economy and to produce recovery in Indonesia. I want to stress that Australia and Indonesia will remain good friends. We will cooperate in every way that we can, and we will cooperate in relation to this outrage that has occurred in Bali. I am very pleased to see that the Indonesians have arrested maybe one of the culprits, as reported on an overseas news wire this afternoon. I am hoping there will be a quick determination of who the culprits are. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7865 I would now like to pay a tribute to the Australian defence forces and the way in which they have responded. We have to be utterly proud of what the men and women of our ADF do when their country calls upon them and that they are able to do what needs to be done in a timely and efficient manner. There are no hassles; they just deliver the service. So to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force: well done; keep up the good work at a time when you probably have the highest level of activity you have seen for many years. I close by taking this opportunity to express condolences to the families and friends of those who have been touched. I do that on behalf of my wife, Margaret, on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Townsville and Thuringowa. debate. The Bali bombings of 12 October have been appropriately described by the Leader of the Opposition as our darkest day since World War II. Terrorists have engaged in mass murder. They have struck at innocent, unarmed civilians and they have struck without warning. They gave their victims no chance of saving themselves and they gave their victims no reason for their attack. They have still given the world no reason for their barbarous acts. They have not come forward to say who they are. They are faceless killers. They have inflicted a horrible tragedy directly on those they have murdered and wounded and on the families and communities of their victims. Australia grieves for its people who have been cut down and violated so wantonly. The parliament grieves for them and records its sorrow and distress and its feeling for the victims and the survivors. I grieve and the electorate of Bendigo grieves. In the minds of many Australians, the name Bali is associated with peace, enjoyment and holidays. It is a popular destination that many Australians make for to enjoy their vacations, to mark the end of a sporting season, to honeymoon or to get a glimpse of a unique part of Indonesia’s heritage and beauty. In my own electorate of Bendigo, possibly thousands have been to Bali since it became an affordable holiday venue. That peaceful atmosphere was shattered with the terrorist atrocity on 12 October. Some 30 Australians are now confirmed dead and some 180 Australians are still unaccounted for. Most of them will probably never be found alive. In the Bendigo district, at least two families are still denied knowledge of what has happened to their loved ones. There are also Indonesians and people from many other nationalities who have been killed or wounded or are unaccounted for. This agony is borne directly by many individuals and families, but all Australians feel it, understand it and want to communicate it. At this stage it is hard to know exactly who inflicted this outrage. One thing is sure: they are criminals and they must be pursued and brought to justice. It should not have been possible for the bombings to take place. It is up to Indonesia, Australia, the South-East Asian region and the international community to find and punish the perpetrators and make the South East Asian region safe again. It is pleasing that a team of officers from ASIO and the Australian Federal Police are now in Indonesia to help the Indonesian government identify the perpetrators. It is pleasing that Australia’s Minister for Justice and Customs and Minister for Foreign Affairs are also now in Indonesia. It is heartening that world leaders have spoken out against the Bali bombings, adding international weight to the outrage and international pressure to bring the perpetrators to justice. At this stage it is not certain who were the direct targets of the terror attack. Were the bombings directed primarily at the United States, at the West or at Australia-or were they directed at all? We do not know the answers yet. The faceless assassins have not identified themselves. But one thing is sure: Australia has suffered enormously. The Australian toll is horrendous.

269,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (5.30 P.m.),"It is with great sorrow that I rise to take part in this7866 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 vivors and their families. As the Leader of the Opposition has stated, it is perhaps the worse civilian tragedy Australia has suffered since World War II. In World War II the enemy was known. The nation could strike back and defend itself and the nation had friends and allies. In the Bali horror the enemy is not yet known. He gave no warning of his attack and Australia must wait patiently to get justice. But Australia today does have friends and allies, and the enemy of Australia is the enemy of decent nations around the world. I agree with the opposition leader that Australia needs to take a leading role in helping to restore security against terrorism in the South-East Asian region. That involves bringing together heads of government from Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. It involves recognising that the nations of the region have been active in tracking down and dealing with terrorism. The Bali bombings have given a heightened international profile to terrorism in the South-East Asian region and now it is necessary to step up activity within a regional framework. Australia needs to be seen to be playing a role as a genuine partner of the region, concerned for the well-being of the region. Australia has to be a spokesman for itself and the region rather than just an agent for any force outside the region. Australia has been sensitive in many ways in its relations with Indonesia concerning terrorism. It needs to continue to be sensitive as it endeavours to pursue the 12 October perpetrators and to make the region safe from terrorism. I said earlier that the 12 October bombings should never have been possible. I notice there are strong indications that the Indonesian government should have been more active in dealing with terrorism in its own territories. If this is the case, then Australian and Indonesian victims, and victims of other nationalities, have paid a horrendous price for the Indonesian government’s apparent weakness. But let us bear in mind that the United States suffered an enormous loss on 11 September 2001 when terrorists hijacked domestic aircraft and crashed them into the World Trade Centre in New York. The United States, with all its wealth, its sophisticated and massive intelligence and its police apparatus, was not able to prevent that terrorist attack. What is certain now is that Indonesia is confronting the reality of terrorism on its own soil. I believe it will be assisted to continue to do so by Australia and the region recognising this and working sensitively and effectively as a regional community to tackle terrorism. Australians want answers and they want justice, and they want them as soon as possible. They also want long-term safety and peace in the region. I believe that must be vital long term for the international community and the United Nations in resolving the perceived wrongs and injustices that are the hotbeds of war and terrorism. On behalf of the people of central Victoria, I express our condolences to all those who have lost loved ones during this atrocity. Also on behalf of the people of central Victoria, I express our appreciation to all of those agencies that have been involved in the recovery, the RAAF Hercules crews and the medical staff-most of whom were volunteers-in Bali and in the Australian capital cities. They are all doing a superb job in what must be the most difficult of circumstances. I also place on the public record that I believe the government’s handling of this issue has been swift and appropriate, and it should be commended for that as well. to the emergency services and staff of the Royal Darwin Hospital, which played such a vital role in the dreadful aftermath of the Kuta bombing. The Royal Darwin Hospital is a regional hospital built and staffed to cater for the accident, emergency and health needs of a population of around 150,000 people, of which about two-thirds live in the immediate vicinity in Darwin, Palmerston and nearby-the boundaries of the Solomon electorate.

270,Mr Tollner (Solomon) (5.37 P.m.),"The Prime Minister has already paid brief tributeWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7867 the city of Darwin has been bombed, has survived a cyclone, has seen the first wounded Australians return from Vietnam, has seen successive waves of refugees arrive on our shores and has seen troops and aircraft depart for war to keep peace. Nothing could have prepared the city for the critically injured people who began to arrive at 1.40 a.m. on Monday morning. I draw on the official report of the medical superintendent of the Royal Darwin Hospital, Dr Len Notaras. The course of events was that on Sunday at 9.30 a.m. the medical administrator on call received a message from the director of the emergency department at the Royal Darwin Hospital stating that an Australian national patient had arrived via a commercial flight from Bali following a bomb blast the previous night. In view of media reports and the arrival of the first patient, instructions were given to the bed manager to discharge as many patients as possible in preparation for the expected receipt of emergencies from Bali. At 10 a.m. the hospital was advised that a Hercules had departed for Bali via Darwin with a partial medical crew and that there were about 40 Australian casualties in Bali. The Royal Darwin Hospital disaster plan was put into action. All elective surgery and clinics for the following day were cancelled, and intensive care units and coronary care units were prepared to receive up to 15 patients. At2 p.m. on Sunday, the information was that 20 patients were being evacuated from Bali at 2200 hours and a further 20 soon after. The decision was made to clear the two surgical wards to accommodate up to 60 casualties. A medical team, including a burns specialist and an intensivist, arrived from Adelaide to assist the RDH medical staff. The first arrivals of injured were at 1.40 a.m. on Monday. Over the next 16 hours, 62 casualties were received at the hospital with injuries consisting of severe burns and trauma. Fifty-three patients were evacuated to the burns unit of major city hospitals across Australia over the next 24 to 36 hours. That report conceals the suffering, the pathos and the heroism of patients and those attending them during the first 1½ days. No event in Australia’s history, apart from the world wars, has seen anything like the scale of injury and suffering that arrived on those first Hercules aircraft through Monday morning and the rest of the day. No regional hospital has faced such a task in Australia’s history. The Royal Darwin Hospital has a young but highly qualified team in its emergency department and burns unit. Those teams performed a continuous 36 hours of work, providing surgery, intensive care and specialist treatment for the wounded innocents of the Sari nightclub-victims who had endured a full day of makeshift care in Bali attended by staff and volunteers who could do little more than keep up their fluids, soothe their wounds with ice and water-soaked towels, and hold the hands of the young victims. There will be many stories of the heroes of the Bali bombing. Among those will be counted the Royal Darwin Hospital staff. Specialist burns nurse Alison Mustapha; the director of the emergency department, Carol Mansfield; and senior emergency department nurse Ronni Taylor worked tirelessly for 1½ days coping with burns victims who had suffered injuries not seen beyond the battlefields of war. The young English graduate in specialist emergency, Dr Didier Palmer, and the head of the intensive care unit, Dr Dianne Stephens, were just two of the staff who carried out their jobs with professionalism and dedication from the early hours of Monday morning. Medical superintendent Dr Len Notaras and acting general manager Dr Gary Lum tackled the organisational task that confronted the hospital. I spoke with Dr Len Notaras yesterday. He had been on his feet, bar a short nap, for about 40 hours. He spoke about the nature of the injuries, the number of critically ill, the sheer scale of the task and the extent of suffering that confronted his staff on Monday. He told me that for those at the hospital, on the front line of disaster and tragedy, those 40 hours had been ex7868 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 traordinarily challenging but rewarding. He said to me, ‘IfI were run over by a bus tomorrow, I would think that at least I had done something useful in this life.’ Those in the emergency, burns and intensive care units of the Royal Darwin Hospital have been through an experience that they will never, ever forget. But their memory will be of being equal to the task, of success, and of alleviating suffering and providing the best care possible for those who arrived on stretchers on Monday. The hospital treated 62 victims of the bombing, many with limbs lost, deep shrapnel wounds and extensive burns that became infected over the first 24 hours after the bombs exploded. Of these 62 patients, the nationalities of 11 remain unknown-a clear indication of the critical condition of these victims. Today, almost all of those patients have been transferred to hospitals in other capital cities. Just seven remain in care in Darwin. I have also spoken with St John Ambulance General Manager, David Baker, who received a phone call from the communications centre early on Sunday morning to advise that there had been a terrorist attack in Bali. He told me that, from that moment on, the situation that unfolded left many experienced people stunned. By good fortune, nine paramedics were completing a residential intensive care paramedic training program in Darwin, and this group was one of the first put on full alert. Other crews were called in, and a huge number of volunteer ambulance officers and first aiders offered their services. Coordinated by Operations Manager Trevor Sellick and his deputy, Michael McKay, crews for dozens of ambulances were ready for action by 9.30 p.m. on Sunday evening. St John’s volunteers were stationed at the airport and at Royal Darwin Hospital. By7 a.m. on Monday morning, the first two Hercules had arrived and been carefully unloaded-with 38 patients transported, involving an effort of more than 30 paid staff and volunteer members of St John Ambulance. Mr Baker said that some were unprepared for the images that they encountered but all undertook the task with the utmost professionalism. On Monday afternoon, a further two Hercules were unloaded and 22 patients were convoyed to Darwin Hospital. By then, many St John’s people had been stood down for a well-earned rest. The Alice Springs Deputy Operations Manager, Craig Garraway, and the Katherine OIC, Kevin Blake, provided coordination expertise. Paramedics were backed up by volunteers and administrative staff-many of whom, including the CEO, drove the ambulances, leaving paramedics free to assist the patients. With a normal daily complement of just three ambulances and six paramedics in Darwin, the availability of more than 30 staff and members was unbelievable, with vehicles rushed in from Katherine and Batchelor and St John people volunteering without a thought for their own situation. The cooperative effort between military medical and nursing staff, Royal Darwin Hospital medical and nursing staff, and paramedics and volunteers from St John Ambulance was magnificent. The people of the Top End feel a strong affinity for their near international neighbours. It should be remembered that Denpasar is about the same distance from Darwin as Cairns, that Dili is as far from Darwin as Newcastle Waters-a town a little more than halfway to Tennant Creek. I have had several inquiries from constituents regarding Australia’s efforts towards the care of those Indonesian nationals left behind in the hospitals of Denpasar and Bali. I have been able to tell them of the Australian government’s response, sending medical consumables and funds to assist the injured still in Bali, and of the offer by the foreign minister for treatment of seriously injured Indonesian nationals in Australian hospitals. Members will be aware that my colleague in the other place Senator Nigel Scullion has circulated to members and senators a phone number for anyone experiencing difficulties in Darwin. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7869 Darwin’s proximity to this event and the involvement of its citizens in the first line of emergency evacuations means that they keenly feel the horror and tragedy of the bombing. All Australians condemn this unspeakable act and feel the anger against the despicable bastards who carried it out.

That horrific blast obviously affected every member of parliament in this House on Monday, regardless of their political persuasion, as well as their staff and all of the people who work in this place. It affected us because, as previous speakers have said, it was the worse incident of that proportion ever to face this nation in peacetime. We all witnessed through the media the number of deaths and the way in which this horrific bombing created unbelievably horrific injuries, caused by fire and shrapnel made up of glass, metal, timber and concrete. As some members have said, it was not just the burns; you have to keep your mind focused on the fireball that followed the explosion and the intensity of the heat that was contained in that fireball. It brought back memories for me of when I was fighting a bushfire years ago and a father and son were in their paddock. The bushfire was fanned by a very strong wind, and they were enveloped in a fireball that went through that paddock. It was one of the most horrific scenes that I have ever experienced in my lifetime. I cannot imagine-in any way-the horrific injuries that were caused by this bomb. Many young, healthy, fun-loving Australians were cut down in the prime of their lives. Our grief is devastating. We have all experienced grief at some time in our lives, within our own families; but what we are talking about here are mothers, brothers, sisters, fathers, cousins, friends and mates. They saw their relatives and friends go to Bali, which has been enjoyed by Australians for many years as a place of relaxation and fun, and be killed or horribly maimed as a result of this treacherous and inhumane attack on innocent people. What has come out of this is that, quite obviously, places like Bali are not as well equipped as we are in this country to handle the sort of devastation on human beings that was the aftermath of this tragic and terrible terrorist activity. The medical facilities were expended very quickly and were hopelessly inadequate. People in the medical areas were unable to cope with the number of victims of this despicable act. But the positive thing that came out of it was the unselfish commitment of Australians, from all walks of life, to help fellow Australians, as they do when people are in need. They not only helped fellow Australians but they also helped their mates and newly-found friends, people from overseas and the friendly Balinese people who were also innocently caught up in this terrible, terrible tragedy. That unselfish commitment by those Australians and others was given in this dire time of need, as Australians always give it. We saw, and still see, volunteers-many of whom were doctors and nurses on holiday in Bali-doing what they could to assist people. We saw Balinese and overseas visitors spontaneously acting to assist fellow human beings who were being engulfed in the fireball that followed that explosion.",196,Representatives Main Committee

272,Mr Schultz (Hume) (5.49 P.m.),"On 12 October this year, terrorism arrived on the7870 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 The nature of the injuries was such that our own surgeons and our own medical peopleand, indeed, many other people and organisations, including the RAAF and the Australian Federal Police-went across to see what they could do to assist and to look at what we could do in terms of identifying the treacherous and cowardly animals, as I have described them, that were responsible. There is absolutely no doubt that the resolve of the parliament and the Australian people is strong in terms of tracking down these terrorists, identifying them and making sure that they pay the appropriate penalty. But it will never bring back all of those beautiful people-men and women, young people, teenagers-who have gone. And there is the knowledge that there are 30 known Australian dead at the moment and the possibility of up to 183 or 200 people killed in this devastating, horrific incident. Many of those people, because of the heat and intensity of the fire that engulfed them, will never be found. They will just have disintegrated. That is the sad part about it, and that is the sad part of life that many Australians will have to face in the not too distant future. I know I can speak on behalf of all of my parliamentary colleagues, regardless of their political persuasion, in saying that our hearts bleed for those people. Our sorrow was seen here, as I said, in the chamber on Monday and is still seen in this chamber today. We can only offer comfort by way of our sympathy to all of those people affected by this treacherous act. I hope in my own heart that all of the authorities that are involved in this matter-including the Australian government, the Indonesian government, the US government and any other government that lends assistance in some way to try to identify who these people are-are all totally committed, as Australians are, to ensuring that the ultimate penalty is meted out to the vicious, cowardly individuals who use soft targets throughout the world because they do not have the courage to come out and confront people in the traditional way in which wars have been fought throughout the world from time immemorial. It sends a very compelling message to the people who live in a vacuum in this country who do not think that this sort of terrorism can come in and touch us. It can. It sends a very strong and compelling message to all Australians to be vigilant. In closing, my final comment is that all of the people out there in our communities are the eyes and ears of this nation. At some time, they will be called upon by those in authority in this country to give information on any activity that may result in any possible terrorist act in this country. I appeal to them to think about that. On this sad occasion, I again offer my very deep condolences-and condolences on behalf of my family and all of my constituents-to all the families affected by this outrageous terrorist act that has taken away so many fine Australians. are defining moments that shape our future. Certain events in the Second World War, although hidden by the public view due to media blackouts-events such as the Kokoda Trail battles, the first enemy attack on Australian soil, the bombing of Darwin, the shelling of our coastline at Newcastle and Bondi and the midget submarine attacks in Sydney Harbour which resulted in so much loss of life-were such events. More recent events, such as the Port Arthur massacre and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York-witnessed live on TV by many Australians-were major events that will live in our memories forever and have changed our lives. The horrific bomb attack on Australian citizens and others in Bali last Saturday is an event that has brought grief and sorrow to many Australian families. It will open up a new chapter in our history, in the way we live and work and in our internal security and defence preparedness. This new chapter will call for a more inclusive and united Australian population where all of us, whether Australian born or more recently arrived, recognise Australia as our home,",199,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (5.59 P.m.),"There are dark periods in our history whichWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7871 where the conflicts of the past are forgotten and where our religious and ethnic backgrounds are used not to divide us but to unite us. Tragic occasions such as the Bali bombing bring out the best in us. There are many stories of heroism and mateship shown by the people injured in the attack. Without being paranoid, we will all have to be more alert to the dangers that could present themselves in the changed world. Within Australia we must ensure that we have a fair society so that no Australian citizen feels resentful enough to harbour terrorists or take part in terrorist activities. We need to ensure that our defence forces have the necessary modern equipment to detect any threat to Australian citizens and are in a position to act swiftly and effectively in the event of any terrorist threat to Australian citizens, property or sovereignty. Barbaric, despicable, disgusting, outrageous, heinous-the English language is a versatile one, but there are simply not enough adjectives to describe what a terrorist does. Innocent lives are shattered and innocence itself is a victim. What took place in Bali was a criminal act so abhorrent as to defy description. The perpetrators of the crime will not find the Paradise they seek. There is no justification for this crime, not even by their own teachings. The Prophet Mohammed said: The killing of an innocent person is like to kill the whole mankind. There is no justification on any level under any religion, Islam included, for the crime that was perpetrated by the criminals in Bali. The dead and injured were innocent, and Islamic law is very clear on this point. Unfortunately killing happens in self defence under both Islamic and Christian traditions, but even then there are strict rules that apply, and the killing of innocents is expressly prohibited. This was not self-defence. There is no possible definition in either Islamic or Christian faiths that could come anywhere near using self-defence as an excuse. There is no excuse. Islam is a faith based on peace and tolerance, despite what some elements of the media would have you believe. Almost every faith has its extremists, those who would twist the words of the holy books and the holy menA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.03 p.m. to 6.19 p.m. tremists-those who would twist the words of the holy books and the holy men to their own twisted position in order to justify their own extreme views. Australia is a multicultural and tolerant society. People are free to worship however they choose. There is no compulsion in religion. We are the stronger for it; we are the better for it. The electorate of Greenway and your electorate of Chifley, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, have people from all corners of the globe. Dozens of languages are spoken in our respective electorates and many different faiths are practised. Our electorates are a sample of the wider Australian community. There are thousands of people of the Muslim faith in Blacktown who add a rich texture to our community. The criminals who carried out this heinous crime in Bali are not representative of them; they are poles apart. Fundamentalism and fanaticism must be fought at every turn because they are the threat to peace; they are the threat to innocence. Tolerance is a basic tenet of all faiths, and fundamentalism is an enemy of tolerance. They cannot live side by side, they cannot coexist, because the latter does not allow for the former. When someone takes an extreme position there is no room for debate, no room for negotiation, no room for tolerance-no room to move at all, except towards destruction. With the fundamentalists of any religion, we are dealing with minds locked in a past long forgotten or locked in a time that never existed in the first place.",200,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Mossfield,"Before the division I was saying that almost every faith has its ex7872 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 Society is a changing thing-it changes all the time, from moment to moment-but a fundamentalist does not see it that way, or will not admit it. The growth of our society throughout history has come from minds that are open to new ideas and new concepts and from people able to adapt and change. Without change a society stagnates, turns inwards and slowly destroys itself, yet that is exactly what the fundamentalists want. They want to wind back the clock to the Middle Ages and not budge. They cannot see the self-destructive nature of their position. They do not believe in tolerance. They do not believe in any positive force. They believe only in hatred, fear and ignorance-the destructive forces. They believe only in violence as a solution because they cannot allow for diplomacy, which would necessarily involve compromise. With compromise comes an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of another’s position-and no fundamentalist worth their salt would ever acknowledge that somebody else might have a valid point. The Koran, chapter 8, verse 61 says: If they seek peace, then you seek peace. And trust in God for he is the one that hears and knows all things. But fundamentalists do not want to trust in God. They think they know better. They think they know more. What happened in Bali was an outrage perpetrated against innocent civilians but also perpetrated against the Koran and the teaching of Islam. Hundreds of families and thousands of friends, relatives, neighbours and mates will have to deal with this tragedy on a very personal level. My heartfelt sympathies and condolences go out to them. The electorate of Greenway has lost citizens in this attack, as have most electorates around Australia. It has touched every corner of our land. We as a community will have to deal with this tragedy. The world is not the same any more as we mourn the loss of lives and the loss of innocence. Terror has struck in our very midst. While September 11 was horrifying and affected us all very deeply, it was also distant, half a world away, and I think that in some cases the immediacy of it never really struck home. This attack in Bali, however, is similar in scale to the World Trade Centre disaster when one considers the relative population sizes of our two countries, and it hits home more. It has far more potency here in Australia because it was our own people in our own backyard. Bali was a holiday destination for so many thousands of Australians every year, and by targeting foreigners in Bali the terrorists knew that they were targeting Australians. As America was the victim on September 11, Australia was the victim on October 12. There were people of other nationalities who were killed and injured, just as there were in the World Trade Centre, but the target this time around was Australia. We will have to come to terms with that and we will move on, always remembering and forever honouring those who perished. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims. murdered an as yet uncounted number of young Australians and people from other nations. This evil was no wraith: brutal, callous mass murderers bombed the Sari bar in Bali. Australians are presently numbed and they are filled with anguish for those who died and their grieving families. However, as the details of this cruel and barbaric bombing become known, Australians will undoubtedly be filled with righteous outrage and with a sense of purpose to ensure that the murderers are brought to justice. We need to remember that many people of other nationalities died or were injured on that terrible day in Bali, including many Balinese and other Indonesians.

Terrorism is the cruellest, most indiscriminate and arbitrary of hateful acts, striking down the young and the innocent. Terrorism sacrifices the hopes, ideals and very lives of the innocent to fulfil the twisted, vengeful and hate-filled ideology of the terrorist. As chairman of the Australia-Indonesia Parliamentary Group, I would like to say on behalf of other members of the parliamentary group that we are thankful that the Indonesian government and people are working hard, with limited resources, in Bali to identify the dead and return them to their various homelands. It is encouraging to see the cooperation between Indonesians and Australians in the police and forensic work and in the investigation of this dreadful crime and its aftermath. We need to remember that this is a blow not only to Australia, bringing terrorism to our very doorstep, but also to the Indonesian people because of the loss of life of Balinese and other Indonesians. It is also an economic blow. I am sure we all trust that President Megawati and the Indonesian people will, like all people of goodwill, make every effort to detain and bring to justice the terrorists here and abroad. In our outrage, distress and sadness we must not be deterred from rooting out and removing those who deal in the evil of terrorism here in our region and elsewhere around the world. Terrorism has no faith, no home and no creed. All good people of goodwill and faith around the world would rightly condemn terrorism. There is a suggestion that, if Australia had not supported the US in condemning Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, somehow we might have been able to avoid this dreadful and brutal act in Bali. But cowering from evil would not protect us, as it has not protected others, such as the Kenyans when the American Embassy was destroyed by al-Qaeda in 1998 and the Germans in the Tunisia synagogue. Terrorism is a many-headed monster with tentacles around the world. It lives in the shadows and has no borders or faith, as I have said. Those who threaten international peace or security cannot be allowed to build and to grow in sanctuaries around the world that welcome terrorists. Weapons of mass destruction and those who murder their own people, as Saddam Hussein has in Iraq, cannot be tolerated. No-one wants war, but none of us can allow weapons of mass destruction and terrorists to grow and flourish and threaten international peace and security. We all pray that those Australians and people of other nationalities who have lost family and friends in Bali, and those who are horribly injured, will have some comfort and peace in the time ahead. any measure, but it was not blind. The people who perpetrated it were purposeful: they sought out their targets. There were in fact four blasts that evening and the targets in each case were clearly identified. In the case of the nightclub in Bali, the target was clearly intended to be predominantly European, predominantly Australian, and on an island of course where the prevailing religion is the minority religion in Indonesia. It was the cold-blooded murder of innocent people. BeforeI make some comments about, if you like, the political and strategic circumstances surrounding this, I want to place on the record my deepest and sincerest condolences to the victims and their loved ones. Like everybody, I have watched the news over the last couple of days and seen the footage of the Air Force taking people to hospital and the interviews with various survivors and also with doctors. Two stories out of the many hours of news footage stick firmly in my mind. One of the RAAF people spoke about an Australian who had been put on a plane to be evacuated but who actually gave up his seat because he thought another person was in a worse condition and so volunteered to wait. But more compelling was the",202,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (6.29 P.m.),"Last Sunday’s act of brutal terrorism was barbaric by7874 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 comment made by one of the doctors involved in providing what level of support could be provided in Bali with very limited resources. They had limited pain-killers. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 6.43 p.m. dia reports about a doctor who was talking about the problems in Bali in seeking to administer health care to those who were most in need. He commented that they had a shortage of supply of many medical items, including anaesthetics and pain-killers. As they went around to treat people, individuals who were offered pain-killers actually turned down the pain-killer and said, ‘No, give it to the person in the bed beside me or to the person over there; I think they are in greater pain than I.’ When you consider the circumstances in which that happens, it is a truly remarkable turn of human nature. It demonstrates a very positive side to what is, in all other respects, a very tragic set of circumstances. Terrorism is not new. It is not new, and it did not start on 11 September last year. Innocent people going about their daily peaceful lives have been killed and maimed in various parts of the world all too frequently. If we look at just the last 40 years, there are too many examples you can cite-in Europe, in Africa, in Asia and in South America. The examples are all too common. At times this has involved non-state terror; at other times it has been state sponsored terror. People will sometimes refer to that as ‘dirty wars’. Indeed, at the moment in the parliament we have a visiting delegation from the United Kingdom, and many of us have had an opportunity to meet with them in different forums. At one such meeting, they reminded us of the UK experience in dealing with terrorism within their home borders for some generations now. None of that minimises the horror, but if we are to properly respond to this terrible circumstance in which we as a nation now find ourselves we must understand the context in which these shameful acts have occurred. We have to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice, that they are held accountable, but we must be equally careful not to lay the blame at the feet of innocent folk. We have to target the terrorists-all terrorists and only the terrorists-in this struggle. There has been some significant media coverage and other reports of the activities of the Jemaah Islamiah group in Indonesia-and I think, by any assessment, they are prime suspects-but we have to proceed with caution and with clear judgment as we look at the evidence and the facts associated with that. It is the case that they have experience in explosions, it is the case that they have demonstrated an intent and, whilst they have not had the ability to conduct an exercise as large or as coordinated as the four blasts last Sunday, they probably, more than any other group, would have had access to others who could have assisted them in the execution of their plan. But we should be careful as we go about assessing the evidence to ensure that what we do as a nation, both militarily and diplomatically, is just and well founded. I mentioned that terrorism is not new. It is now on our doorstep, and it does require us, as a nation, to respond directly. That means we have to review our counter-terrorism capabilities. I wholeheartedly endorse the statements by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in respect of our counter-terrorism capabilities and the need to review them. I applaud the fact that we now have a counter-terrorism capability, to some extent, on both the east coast and the west coast. I think that is a good move. I would suggest to the government the merit in looking at a third unit in Northern Australia, whether that be based in Townsville or in Dar-",203,Representatives Main Committee
277,Mr Bevis,"Before the adjournment for the division I was commenting on one of the meWednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7875 win. I think there are very good grounds for having a third unit raised, and I understand there would be some costs incurred in doing that. But, as we have seen not just last Sunday and not just in September of last year, the nature of the threat to Australian peace now is different from that upon which we have traditionally configured our security forces. In May 1998, I was the shadow minister for defence, and I gave a speech in Western Australia, the Blamey Oration, in which I said: ... overt military threats from hostile states are increasingly being subordinated to, or complicated by, a mixture of economic, religious, political, environmental and resource security challenges, as well as the activities of non-state actors-most notably terrorist groups and transnational criminal organisations. I gave two examples from that time. One was the hijacking of an oil tanker in Asian waters and the second was the Sarin gas attack by the Aum Supreme Truth religious cult in Tokyo, and I made the observation: Neither conforms to conventional warfare patterns. There is no foreign state involved. Neither is easily dealt with by conventional force structures. I also said: Terrorism, in its various forms, must now be included as an integral factor in our future security planning. Some 4½ years later we are now commencing to seriously put in place that planning. I think it is important that that be done. It is also important though, as we review our response to terrorism, that we look at our capacity to respond, our information gathering capacity and our analysis of that information. I make no comment about the circumstances of the Bali terrorist attack in particular but clearly, as with September 11 and all the other examples of non-state terror of this kind, a critical component is the ability to gather intelligence, to analyse it and then to act very quickly. We need to review our capacity in that area. There has been a suggestion that we should also be reviewing our internal domestic antiterrorism laws. The parliament has not long ago done just that. Our domestic antiterrorism laws have to be finely balanced. It would make no sense to introduce antiterrorism laws that so undermined our civil liberties and freedom that we would lose the very things we cherish and which terrorism seeks to destroy. SoI am cautious about any further review. However, I do think the call by the Leader of the Opposition for a regional response to this issue is timely. There is, whether we like it or not, a South-East Asian focus to the war on terror. Some of you will be familiar with the publication Jane’s Defence Weekly. Jane’s put up an article on 14 October, following the Bali explosion, which was headlined ‘Al-Qaeda goes South East’. The very first sentence of that article said: While attention in Washington continues to be focused on Saddam Hussein and Iraq, the war on terrorism is far from over and has entered a new phase. The war on terrorism is now, whether we like it or not, in South-East Asia. It is important that we define this properly. I do not actually like the term ‘war on terror’ because it does not define who you are at war with. It is a bit like the ‘war on crime’ or the ‘war on drugs’ that people talk about-it becomes a never-ending saga. But there is one thing we have to be certain and clear that it is not: it is not a war on Islam. Other members have spoken about that, and I think that is an important point that we need to be mindful of all the time. I am concerned about the many very fine Australians of Islamic faith who do feel persecution in their daily lives because of the reaction of some in our community to these events. That is improper and it should not be occurring. We should have foremost in our minds when 7876 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 we debate these matters those concerns of our citizens who are of Islamic faith, who are concerned that the interpretation sometimes given to this is that it is in fact a holy war of a different sort. It is nothing of the kind. It is a war on terror. It is a war on terror that requires a military response but for which a military response alone is inadequate. The war on terror must include diplomatic and economic responses if it is to succeed. I want to say in that context, and picking up on the comment that was made in that article from Jane’s, that there is a distinction between the war on terror and dealing with the problems of Iraq. I want to remind the parliament of a comment made by General Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser to Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush Sr. He made this comment only a couple of months ago: ... the central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism. We cannot afford to be diverted from the war on terrorism. That must be our first, second and third priority in responding to the dangers that we have now confronted first-hand. We should not allow ourselves to be diverted by what I think is a much easier to understand and easier to target adversary but, frankly, one that is a separate issue that will, if we are not careful, distract us from the important task at hand. Finally, I want to return to the point I commenced on. The events in Bali last Sunday were tragic, they were barbaric and they were unforgivable. It is important in responding to that that we firstly do what we can to assist those who are injured and their loved ones, and the nation has pulled together incredibly well to do just that. We must now turn our attention in the days and weeks and months ahead to ensuring those responsible are brought to account. Let us do that with resolve; let us do that with justice. Ms PANOPOULOS (Indi) (6.55 p.m.)-It is with great sadness and anger that I rise this evening to support the Prime Minister’s motion. As a nation we are still shell shocked and as a people we will be transformed in ways that we are yet to comprehend. We feel a heavy, oppressive grief, yet the implications of this horrendous attack have yet to penetrate the depths of our national consciousness. My heart goes out to the families and friends of loved ones who have died, who are missing or who are injured and to many others who are waiting to hear news of their loved ones. The tragedy has affected every corner of Australia, including my home town of Wangaratta. I am touched by, and proud of, the Australians in Bali and back home who instinctively volunteered to provide medical assistance, counselling and on the ground support. The mass murder of Australians in Indonesia by terrorists has forever shattered the political innocence of our nation. Although the word ‘terrorism’ may have lost some of its impact from overuse in recent times, those who committed this terrible crime have succeeded insofar as they have instilled terror and trauma in the hearts of Australians. Many are asking why this evil attack happened. Unlike Singapore and Malaysia, Indonesia has until now refused to accept and acknowledge that there are indigenous terrorist cells flourishing within its borders. The card of political extremism is also being played out in Indonesia. Vice-President Hamzah Haz has pandered to fundamentalist Muslims, claiming that there were no native terrorists in Indonesia and that the alleged extremists ‘only wanted to see that Indonesia has a religious society’. But there are known terrorist training camps in Indonesia, and fundamentalist Muslim terrorists have travelled in and out of Indonesia unimpeded. Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, advocates the importance of holy wars and has conducted a propaganda campaign in support of bin Laden, describing him as a ‘warrior of God’. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7877 Bali is the Western mecca of the Muslim world and an obvious and easy target. It is a Western holiday destination in the middle of the largest Muslim population in the world, with free and easy access for bombs and their components and for terrorists. If Bali had been geographically close to Canada, the high death toll would have been of Canadians. Equally, if it were geographically close to any Western nation, that nation would suffer the majority of casualties. I categorically reject the view that the Bali bombing was retaliation by fundamentalist Muslims against Australia’s support for the war against terrorism. Terrorists are trained to kill and inflict maximum harm indiscriminately. They do not select a target location and politely warn the citizens of some countries and not others. The citizens of many nations who have not joined the war against terrorism have also been tragically killed. The German Chancellor recently campaigned against the war on terrorism, yet this has not afforded immunity to German tourists in Tunisia who were killed earlier this year in attacks linked to al-Qaeda. There were French and Pakistani nationals killed in a recent bombing in Karachi. We cannot purchase immunity from terrorist activity through silence and inaction. Such compliance has not been and will never be effective in protecting the citizens of any single nation-not even the citizens who live in religiously oppressive nations where political injustice is the norm. The Sari Club was bombed because it was a venue known to be patronised by Westerners, and it is the values that are broadly embodied in Western civilisation that were the targets of fundamentalist Islamic terrorists. We value a secular society in which we are tolerant of different religions and of different belief systems. We strongly believe in the freedom of an individual to pursue their life’s ambitions and dreams according to what is important to them. We do not prescribe a righteous religious path for all to follow and we do not condemn to death those who disagree with us. We are tolerant and subscribe to the saying ‘live and let live’. We should be proud that intellectual, personal and political freedoms are the hallmarks of Western civilisation. It is these freedoms that have shaped our country and that have shaped our lives, it is these freedoms that have made Australia a prosperous and successful nation, and it is these freedoms that are under attack by Islamic fundamentalists who believe we are a decadent, immoral, ungodly society that is having a corrupting influence on the world and who blame us for the social and economic failure of their respective countries. Their propaganda pits the West as the fat cow, milking poor Islamic countries, yet the founder of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, inherited a family fortune that was built on extreme inequality between the ruling Saudi aristocracy and the rest of the Saudi population. The terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiah that has strong training and other links to al-Qaeda is the prime suspect for the Bali bombings. Its terrorist network stretches across South-East Asia and some of its members have been arrested in Singapore and Malaysia. Through striking fear in our very hearts, terrorists attempt to blackmail us into accepting their ideology as the only way of life. They are no different from the murderous authoritarians that have plagued human history. It is in such times that Australian people look to their national government for leadership. We should not be held hostage by the twisted, authoritarian, murderous ideology of fundamentalist Islam that has claimed so many Australian lives and traumatised many more. We cannot buy immunity from terrorists and, no matter what some people may say, you cannot do a deal with them either. The world of terrorism will not be placated by peace marches and hectoring speeches denouncing those who dare to confront these criminals and the nation that supports them. Such behaviour befits only those in search of a fool’s paradise. Those who claim that the terrorist attack of September 11 was a matter exclusively for the United States and that Australia had no part in responding are now completely discredited. The massacre of Australian citizens has irreversibly shaped the debate in Australia and de7878 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 fined the nature of Australia’s response to those who present a threat either at home or overseas. The threat to Australians does not come from what its government does, but it could come from what it fails to do. We as a government will continue to work with Indonesia and other neighbouring countries to hold accountable those nations who harbour, train and fund terrorists and to bring to justice the criminals who have murdered so many innocent people. I commend the Prime Minister’s motion to the House. Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, which is the subject of the motion before this chamber, concerning the horrible events of 12 October in Kuta in Bali. I think it is fair to say that members of parliament, just like ordinary Australians, are having great difficulty at this time coming to grips with the magnitude of what has happened in Bali. I cannot think of a family in Australia that has not had a family member or knows of a friend who has been in Bali at some point. Bali has almost become a rite of passage for Australians. My family is no different. Friends and my own son were there last Christmas, and two nieces planned to be there next April. I think we are grieving as we understand that there has been a terrible loss of life-not only the 30 Australians known to be dead but the 170-odd who appear to be still missing, although we are still working on that. Television has graphically brought to every living room the full horror and magnitude of what has happened. The role for an opposition in these circumstances is to support the Prime Minister and the government of the day because, under our system of government, it is they who are responsible for taking action. Everyone from the Prime Minister down knows that they have the full measure of support from the opposition, as well as the support of the Australian people, in this terrible tragedy. Much has been done in the aftermath of this terrorist attack that we can be proud of: the individual acts of bravery and courage that were carried out by Australians who were there, and by the Balinese as well; the role of public servants and holidaying doctors who sprang into action as a consequence of this disaster; the role of our ADF; and, as the member for Solomon outlined in some detail, the tremendous job that the Royal Darwin Hospital has performed. We all owe them great thanks. We are thankful for the initiatives that the government took as a result of this, although we have a responsibility to ask our Prime Minister that any actions that are subsequently taken are calm, measured and calculated. We are in a grieving process at the moment. I have no doubt that at some point a great deal of anger will be felt about what has happened, but we have to be careful not to rush to judgment. We know that this was clearly a terrorist attack. What has made it so different is that I, together with a lot of Australians, felt that terrorism happened in other parts of the world and would not hit Australians so dramatically with the loss of such numbers-in particular, so many young Australians. It is a loss of innocence for us; it is a loss of innocence for Indonesians. I have been impressed by many of the Australians who, when returning to Australia, have expressed their gratitude to the citizens of Bali for the way they responded and assisted them, both individually and organisationally in terms of the hospital there. It is very hard to grasp positives out of something that has been so horrible and so terrifying and something that is beyond our imagination. But it reinforces a number of things. In the longer term we need to use this shared horror to strengthen our relationship with Indonesia, our most important and nearest neighbour. We have to understand that they, too, have suffered their losses. There is much we can do to build those links. I sincerely hope that in the future as we look down the track we are able to say that the relationship between Indonesia and Australia has been strengthened immeasurably.

It is quite clear that we are mutually dependent on every country in our region to treat terrorism with equal seriousness and determination. In that regard, the Leader of the Opposition seeks to have a summit, and that is to be commended because, having had the attack in Bali, there can be no guarantees that there will not be future acts of terrorism. The honourable member for Brisbane-whose views I hold in the highest regard-reminds us that terrorism is not a new thing. As I have said previously, it is not that we have not sent Australians in the past to fight in a war against terrorism; what makes this different is that it has affected us so directly. Some may say that it is not appropriate to raise issues in such a debate, but the honourable member for Greenway pointed out that we need to be reassured about our own capability. When the honourable member for Brisbane was the shadow defence minister he proposed that there be a national security council. I acknowledge that the Howard government has done much to beef up the security subcommittee of cabinet and its operations, but I regret to say that the government is yet to respond to a parliamentary report tabled in September 2000, some two years ago, entitled From phantom to force. The very first recommendation states: We recommend that the Government develop and maintain a national security policy. This policy should, amongst other things, guide the Defence Forces on their role in an integrated national concept for promoting and achieving international prosperity, peace and security. We further recommend that the Government explore the feasibility of creating a National Security Council to oversee the development and maintenance of a national security policy. It is hardly what you would call a breathtaking recommendation. I do think it deserves the serious consideration of not only the government but all members of parliament. I regret to say that that recommendation has yet to be responded to. I also wish to raise one other issue about our capability. Terrorists are not great users of mobile phones, the Internet, faxes or the traditional means of communication, although they sometimes do. In our intelligence apparatus it is clear that we not only need governments to take decisive action in relation to their own countries but also need some on-the-ground intelligence capability that is able, as best it can, to gain information about possible terrorist actions in our region. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has a watching brief on terrorism. I would love to say to you that we were able to anticipate such a tragedy. We were not. But I am particularly interested in the new role and responsibilities that ASIS may have and particularly in the deficit that I suspect may exist. People have suggested that this was the act of Muslim fundamentalists. I want to hold judgment on that until that is clearly demonstrated. I do hope that Indonesia, and Australia also, will acquire the information and evidence about who was responsible for this dastardly attack. In my electorate I have, according to the latest census, some 9,000 Muslims, and I have three mosques. As other members have said, we value the contribution that they as Australians who profess a faith in Islam make to Australia. I regret that sometimes our citizens take pre-emptive action, I think based on ignorance and fear, to attack those people. I regret to say that there has been another incident at the King Abdul Aziz School and mosque in my electorate. After September 11, I took the initiative to go there and seek to reassure them, and next Friday week I will again be at the mosque. I want to make the point that I understand we will follow a period of grieving with one of intense anger. I think it is important for leaders in the community, and members of parliament for that matter, to hold their judgment until the evidence is adduced. When the evidence is there, we need to take action, not only to bring the perpetrators to justice but to ensure that our countries have the relationships with each other that enable us, as best we can in this uncertain 7880 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 world, to prevent further terrorist action. In closing, I extend my condolences to all those who have lost loved ones or who have loved ones who are missing, in their period of extreme grief. stration) (7.16 p.m.)-When significant or tragic events occur, many of us recall where we were when we first heard what happened. For instance, on 31 August 1997, many people remember when Diana, Princess of Wales, was involved in a car accident while being chased by paparazzi, and her subsequent death. On September 11 last year, when planes in the United States were hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Centrer towers, many of us recall exactly where we were when we heard that terrible news. On 12 October this year-it was a Sunday morning-I had a phone call on behalf of constituents, at about 8.30 a.m. This person was ringing on behalf of my constituents who had two daughters on holiday in Bali, asking what arrangements were being made to evacuate them from what had become a hellhole. AlthoughI had read four papers that morning, the papers had clearly gone to print before the bombs went off in Bali. I had to find out the facts, and I want to say that the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were both very helpful. Fortunately, the family involved were able to have their daughter returned by Qantas to the Sunshine Coast, and they are now recuperating at home. No doubt Robert and Janet Munn were pleased that they received a phone call at 1.30 on Sunday morning from their daughters. But, tragically, many others have still not heard from their loved ones and may well not hear from them in the future. There are also tales of near escapes: Alistair and Geraldine McGregor, newly arrived residents from Zimbabwe to the Sunshine Coast, had a taxi on his way to the Sari Club when he was stopped at a roadblock. He thought that an earthquake had occurred. Had he been 10 minutes earlier, he could well have been one of the casualties. There are unforgettable events in history, and we always have to learn from what goes before. October 12, 2002 was referred to by an international media outlet as ‘Australia’s September 11’, and I fear that it will be remembered as Australia’s blackest day since the Second World War. I join with the Prime Minister and other honourable members in support of this bipartisan motion-a motion that expresses outrage and condemnation at the barbaric terrorist bombings of 12 October in Bali. It is a motion that extends its deepest, heartfelt sympathy to the families and loved ones of those Australians killed, missing or injured in this brutal and despicable attack. It is a motion that offers its condolences to the families and friends of Indonesians and citizens of other countries who have been killed or injured. It is a motion that condemns those who employ terror and indiscriminate violence against innocent people. It is a motion that commits the government of Australia to working with the Indonesian government and others to bring those who are guilty of this horrendous crime to justice and also to bring to justice those who harbour and support them. Most importantly, I support this motion which reaffirms Australia’s commitment to continuing the war against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world. The attack on Bali is an outrage and a tragedy to all Australians. We do not as yet know the final death toll. I have heard reports that at this stage 30 Australians have been identified as having lost their lives, that some 183 people have been confirmed as dead, that at least 196 injured Australians have been evacuated-many in a critical condition-and that about 180 Australians remain unaccounted for. These figures might not now be entirely relevant, because no doubt they change as the minutes and the hours pass. We can only pray for the in-",208,Representatives Main Committee

The reports that I heard out of Bali were beyond anything that I could contemplate: the absolute horror that occurred, the stories that unfold-stories of tragedy, stories of bravery, stories of selflessness. While this undoubtedly was one of the most heinous crimes to ever be committed, it is amazing how, when something like this happens, people work together. They risk their own lives; they seek to help others. We can in effect take pride in how so many people had such little regard for their own safety in their desperate attempt to save other people who were in the Sari Club-other people who were at risk of losing their lives. Like many other honourable members, I have a family. I cannot even imagine the agony of waiting for the news if it were my son, daughter or other family member who was missing and possibly presumed dead. Of course, many people would have had a high level of expectation of hearing positive news on the morning on Sunday, 12 October. As the hours passed, the hopes would have dimmed and the desperation would have grown. I felt enormously proud of how we as Australians joined together to extend our sympathy and our prayers to those people who lost so many members of their family, friends and other loved ones. I have to say that the way the parliament operated on Monday and Tuesday was entirely appropriate. We put aside the combat that happens in the chambers of this place and we came together in an act of unity. All Australians were stunned by the magnitude of this horror. All Australians were appalled. In times of national tragedy, we tend to appreciate that, as citizens in our community, there are more things that bring us together than actually divide us. I was very humbled to be part of this parliament on Monday and Tuesday of this week. It is a time when the nation needs to work together to support the victims’ families and to ensure that this kind of horrendous act does not happen again. While it is only a small thing, I have established a condolence register in my office where many locals will want to mourn the victims and pay their respects to those people who have lost their lives. They may want to congratulate the rescue workers who, working under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, helped to keep the loss to even the horrendous levels we have seen reported. People may also wish to reflect on the tragedy through poem or prayer. Enormous contributions have come from so many people and organisations. We have to acknowledge the countless acts of generosity from Australians everywhere. Sunday is an important day for us. Some of us are religious and some of us are not, and this Sunday has been allocated as a national day of mourning. I want to encourage those who go to places of worship on Sunday to participate as part of a community outpouring on this national day of mourning. It will be an opportunity for people to give thanks for the lives of the innocent people who were lost; it will be a chance for us to pass on our best wishes and sympathy to the families and friends of those who have gone or who have been grievously injured. I want to encourage people to go to church services. My understanding is that on the Sunshine Coast local churches are having special memorial services and there will be community gatherings. I would encourage those who are not practising a religion to reflect in their own way on Sunday, either privately or together with others. I do not believe the magnitude of this loss has fully sunk in to our Australian community. As the days pass and as we grieve our loss, we have a right to feel a sense of deep anger and very strong determination to do everything we as a nation and as a community can to bring to justice those who are responsible for this crime. We owe it to those who have died, we owe it to those who have been injured and we owe it to ourselves. I suppose we have been fortunate in Australia because we do not have a culture of violence in this country. Many 7882 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 2002 other countries have daily tragedies-maybe not of this magnitude-and people in those countries expect to wake up and read about some sort of cataclysmic event. The war on terrorism must go on in an uncompromising and unconditional fashion. Putting our heads in the sand and hoping terrorism will go away is not a solution. As the Prime Minister has said, terrorism is not dispensed according to a hierarchy of disdain, and anyone who thinks this does not understand history. We are dealing with people and organisations who have no respect for human lives or human values. They do not care whom they kill, and it is impossible to guess who or what will be their next target. Let us just make sure that nobody has an opportunity to mark another day in history that we will remember forever-like 12 October and 11 September-through reckless terrorism attacks. I feel particularly moved to be able to join in support of the motion proposed by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (7.29 p.m.)-I join my colleagues in registering my deepest condolences to all those involved in the dreadful events that occurred in Bali last weekend. To the loved ones of those who were killed, I am deeply sorry. To those who remain with the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their family member or friend, we here wish we could ease your pain. And to the survivors now home in Australia, we are glad you have returned and we express our sincere hope for your complete physical and emotional healing. To those traumatised by what they experienced in Bali, by what they had to do and by what they could not do, we offer our commitment to provide ongoing support. To our young Australians, we are sorry at the loss of innocence that this experience has caused, but we are very proud of the Australian spirit you and others displayed in Bali. We admire the many examples of courage and bravery in this case of terrible adversity. That your thoughts were to help strangers and your mates makes us very proud. To those who have survived, like Leah Lee from my electorate in Newcastle, we are pleased that you can continue to live your life with us and hope some normalcy will return for you soon, as hard as that may be. This terrible act of destruction and evil impacts greatly on all Australians, so it is very important that grief is openly expressed. Pain needs to be shared. We do not want our survivors and their loved ones, or the loved ones of those who were killed, to suffer trauma and pain forever. We have seen that too often with our veterans of war. Our national day of mourning on Sunday will be an important step in our collective grieving, and ongoing counselling will also be essential. I congratulate the Hunter Area Health Service in my region and the state member for Newcastle, Bryce Gaudry, who made counselling services available in Newcastle only hours after learning of the Bali disaster. That typifies the strength and compassion of the city I represent. This deliberate act of mass destruction so close to our shores in a place so many Australians associate with happiness and fun is a shocking example to us of the violence and horror of terrorism. If there is anything positive to come from this tragedy, it comes from seeing the response of our medical services, emergency agencies and defence personnel. Their commitment, compassion and organisational skills and the quality of the services they provide make us all grateful to live in this country. At this time of immense need, we truly appreciate the fact that we do live in such a country-a country that has an ethos of public and community service. We are grateful that we have well-trained doctors and nurses, efficient emergency and relief workers and organisations and a very professional and capable Defence Force trained to cope with all eventualities. We are also grateful for a parliamentary democracy where all parties can work together for community strength and stability. We are now supremely grateful for our aviation capabilities and our communication and information systems. Wednesday, 16 October 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7883 We now know that the real wealth of this country is our people, their amazing spirit and the strength of our social infrastructure. Here in parliament we must be mindful of our role in protecting those things. I would like to read from a speech I made in this chamber on 18 September, during the Iraq debate, which I think is very relevant. At that time. I said: Noting the Australian casualties of September 11, we are reminded that we do live in a global village. Globalisation sees Australians living, travelling and working in many different parts of the world. I also said: ... it is also important to consider what Australia’s role should be in contributing to international security and peace. And: ... the greatest contribution we can make to world peace and stability is support for security and stability in our own region-the Pacific and South-East Asian region. This is an area of foreign affairs I think this nation has been neglecting. We need to ensure we have exemplary joint programs and programs of exchange in education, diplomacy, culture, sport, the arts, trade agreements, aid programs and our treaties. Through these programs, we can foster mutual respect, tolerance and understanding and further strengthen friendships with our near neighbours. We do not need to look far to find internal conflicts in our region that threaten peace and security. The Solomons, Fiji, the Philippines, Bougainville, East Timor and Indonesia all experience some instability and internal conflict. There is much for us to do. Now, sadly, we know that there is indeed much we must do. It will never be possible to build walls high enough to protect us from the world. Protectionism will not work. We need to secure our nation by keeping our institutions and services strong, but we also need to strengthen our cooperative relationships with our neighbours in our own region. The Leader of the Opposition’s call for a regional summit against terrorism is a strong endeavour that should be supported. The perpetrators of this terrible and tragic event showed no respect for the people of Bali nor concern for their economic and human loss. It is important that we support and encourage efforts by Indonesia to be more responsive to the threat of terrorism from extremist groups that pose a real threat to regional stability. Terrorism has visited us now, but it is not yet entrenched. Terrorism can be defeated and terrorists can be marginalised and deterred. Unfortunately, we now more closely appreciate the threat of terrorism and the horror and suffering it brings. We all dearly regret the loss of life and sorely regret that those lives and that innocence lost cannot be brought back, but the memory of those who have experienced this tragedy and their suffering must be honoured. I welcome any measure by this parliament to appropriately pay homage to those involved in the Bali catastrophe. Debate (on motion by Mrs Hull) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 7.35 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Electoral Rolls: Electors (Question No. 475) on 5 June 2002: (1) How many electors are listed on the electoral rolls for the divisions of (a) Fraser, (b) Solomon, (c) Moore, (d) Blair, (e) Reid and (f) Denison. (2) How many Australian Electoral Commission staff are allocated to the divisional offices to provide services to those electors. (3) What additional resources are made available to divisional offices with substantially more enrolments to assist them with the task of servicing electors. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The enrolment for the divisions you identified as at 28 June 2002 was: (a) Fraser 111,175 (b) Solomon 52,883 (c) Moore 74,128 (d) Blair 76,976 (e) Reid 76,102 (f) Denison 68,047 (2) All divisions generally have three ongoing staff. However there are times when staff numbers are less pending filling of vacancies, due to periods of leave or due to temporary absences or transfers. (3) In managing the workload of the different divisions, a number of things are considered when deciding on whether to fill on a temporary basis or allocate additional resources. These include the number of enrolment transactions, complexity of enrolment transactions and diversity of the local community. That decision is a matter for the Australian Electoral Officer for the relevant state or territory. All divisions are provided with separate allocations of temporary staff to support the roll review process called Continuous Roll Update (CRU). Divisions receive allocations based on workload, eg. number of letters posted and the degree of processing difficulty. Workplace Relations: Industrial Disputes (Question No. 787) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) How many industrial relations disputes have been brought by employees of his Department against the employer. (2) How many disputes have been brought by employees engaged directly by the Industrial Registrar. (3) Of those, how many employees engaged by the Registrar are attached to a President, Deputy President or Commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission. (4) What were the dates of filing for each of those disputes. (5) For each of those disputes, was it the subject of mediation, conciliation or arbitration. (6) What were the findings or agreements reached in each case. (7) In each case, has counselling been provided to either the employee who brought the case or his or her superior. (8) What programs exist within his Department and within the Registry to ensure good personnel practices are adhered to by those in authority in his Department or the Registry. (1) For the period 1 July 2001 to 26 August 2002, there have been two such instances. (2) For the period 1 July 2001 to 26 August 2002, there has been one such instance.

283,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) For the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, employees filed disputes on September 17, 2001 and March 25, 2002. For employees engaged directly by the Industrial Registrar, the employee filed a dispute on June 7, 2002. (5) For the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, the disputes are being settled through conciliation. For employees engaged directly by the Industrial Registrar, the dispute was settled through conciliation. (6) The disputes filed against the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are proceeding through conciliation conferences but are unresolved at the present time. The dispute filed by an employee of the Industrial Registrar was settled by way of confidential agreement of the parties. (7) No. (8) The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations DEWRSB Agency Agreement 20002003 and Australian Workplace Agreements provide the framework for a strong culture of high performance, trust and communication between the employer and employees. The agreements are supported by a number of principles based guides and policies, that are readily accessible to employees and managers through its intranet site, which reinforce the principles of better people management. These include guides for managing breaches of the code of conduct, review of actions, occupational health and safety matters, whistleblowing, gifting, outside engagement, e-mail and internet usage and specific guides on exercising delegations fairly and appropriately. The department also has a People and Leadership Statement which outlines its priorities for people management in the next three to five years. It has in place a Workplace Diversity Strategy and, specifically, an Australian Indigenous Recruitment and Career Development Strategy and Disability Plan. Managers are regularly updated on their responsibilities. This is supported by supervision, middle management and leadership development programmes. The department has a robust and effective performance management system in place for its entire staff with clear accountabilities for effective people management practices and adherence to the APS values and departmental values. The Registry has a number of avenues for ensuring there are effective and openly accountable personnel practices in operation in relation to its employees. Firstly, the Australian Industrial Registry (Continuing Change) Agreement 2002 (the Agreement), among many other matters, provides an agreed employer/employee operational framework with a ‘focus on quality people management strategies, including the establishment of a high trust culture … a commitment to open communications, and a Team and individual-based feedback system within and between Registry Teams...’. Clause 9.11 of the Agreement provides further details about how the Registry will ‘work together’, how consultation and communication is to take place, and where there might be a disagreement how the parties will work together to resolve the matter. At the Team and individual level, the Registry has constructed its performance management arrangements directly in line with the APS Values contained at section 10 of the Public Service Act 1999. The Registry has a number of corporate policies and guidelines to specifically address and support personnel management issues such guidelines have been promulgated as People& Planning Advices and deal with such matters as: occupational health and safety the Registry’s Employee Assistance Program whistleblowing rehabilitation/return to work (both for compensable and non-compensable cases) procedures for determining breaches of The APS Code of Conduct review of actions (pursuant to section 33 of the PS Act). The Registry also has a Workplace Diversity Program as required by s.18 of the Public Service Act 1999, an Occupational Health and Safety Agreement as required by s.16 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and a range of strategies (although not in single specific documents) relating to operational considerations such as information management and technology, training and development, etc. The Registry’s Intranet also contains a significant range of materials from which both managers and employees can draw guidance in relation to performance management. Internally, each Team and individual performance Plan is evaluated at mid-year and at the financial year’s end 30 June. Team Plan evaluations are forwarded to the Industrial Registrar for review and subsequently placed on the Registry Intranet for the information of and comment by all Registry employees. Team managers also subject themselves to 360 degree feedback from their staff, as well as extensive external evaluation of service provision. Environment: Natural Heritage Trust (Question No. 788) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) What were the successful applications for Natural Heritage Trust funding projects located entirely or partially within the electoral divisions of (a) Prospect, (b) Chifley, (c) Fowler, (d) Reid, (e) Blaxland, (f) Macarthur, (g) Werriwa, (h) Parramatta, (i) Lindsay, (j) Greenway, (k) Mitchell and (l) Macquarie. (2) Do recent figures released by Environment Australia show that since 1996 the electoral division of Prospect has only received $45,050 in funding while the neighbouring electoral division of Parramatta has received $575,454; if so, what is the reason for the difference. (1) Tables showing funding for successful projects located entirely or partially within the electoral divisions of (a) Prospect, (b) Chifley, (c) Fowler, (d) Reid, (e) Blaxland, (f) Macarthur, (g) Werriwa, (h) Parramatta, (i) Lindsay, (j) Greenway, (k) Mitchell and (l) Macquarie are attached (Attachment A). It should be noted that these projects may also be partially within electorate divisions other than the 12 specified electorates. (2) Yes. Data from my Department, based on information provided by proponents, indicates that funding under the Natural Heritage Trust for projects located solely within the electorates of Prospect and Parramatta was $45,050 and $514,734 respectively. Trust applications are assessed on the basis of merit without reference to electorate detail. The nature of the Natural Heritage Trust is such that applications received from neighbouring areas can vary substantially in quantity, quality and in the relative priority of the natural resource management issue each proposal addresses. Trust applications are assessed and prioritised by State Assessment Panels. These panels are each chaired by a community representative and have a majority of community members. The State Assessment Panel recommendations are forwarded to the Commonwealth, with the final decision made by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and/or Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The projects approved within the electorates of Prospect and Parramatta went through this process with the State Assessment Panel recommending each of them.",214,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

(2) For each category referred to in part (1), how many drivers are employed in each capital city (a) under a collective agreement and (b) on an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA). (3) During the winter adjournment of the Parliament, (a) how many casuals employed in each capital city under (i) a collective agreement and (ii) an AWA were offered employment, (b) what was the average number of hours worked by casuals in each capital city under (i) a collective agreement and (ii) an AWA and (c) how many hours of employment were worked by non-ongoing drivers in each capital city under (i) a collective agreement and (ii) an AWA. (4) Is information identifying which casual drivers are employed on a collective agreement or an AWA available to those staff who (a) decide which drivers are engaged and (b) allocate jobs to drivers; if so, in what way is it available. (5) Is there any advice or instruction within the Ministers Department to give preference of engagement to non-ongoing staff who are employed on AWAs; if so, what is it. (6) What guidelines are used to determine which non-ongoing staff are offered employment and how are those guidelines promulgated to both drivers and those who determine the engagement. ourable member’s question: (1) (a) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Ongoing (Permanent) 11 7 13 5 4 5 1 0 (b) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Non-ongoing (Casual) 115 30 16 5 5 6 0 0 (2) (a) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Ongoing (Permanent) 1 2 5 2 0 3 0 0 Non-ongoing 81 4 6 5 0 6 0 0 (Casual)* (b) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Ongoing (Permanent) 10 5 8 3 4 2 1 0 Non-ongoing 47 28 10 0 5 1 0 0 (Casual) (3) (a)(i) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Non-ongoing 70 2 6 5 0 5 0 0 (Casual)* (a)(ii) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Non-ongoing 40 28 10 0 5 1 0 0 (Casual)* (b)(i) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Non-ongoing 7.7 7.7 9.5 6.8 0 3.3 0 0 (Casual) (b)(ii) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin Non-ongoing 5.7 7.2 8.2 0 4.4 1.6 0 0 (Casual) (c)(i) Canberra Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Darwin",216,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

Environment: UNESCO Convention (Question No. 910) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 2002: Which States have become parties to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage adopted on 2 November 2001. At present, there are no States Parties to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office (Question No. 931) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 18 September 2002: (1) Has he seen the recent report by the Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office that Australia would be worse off if it did not sign the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. (2) Has he seen the report by Dr Clive Hamilton, Executive Director of the Australian Institute that, based on the recent report of the Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office, Australia’s gross national product (GNP) would decline by 0.4% by 2010 if the Howard Government did not adhere to the Kyoto Protocol, whereas, if the Howard Government was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, Australia’s GNP will decline by only 0.33%. (3) Why will the Howard Government not immediately sign the Kyoto Protocol. (1) The results contained in the reports on economic impacts of the Kyoto Protocol, undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and McKibbin Software Group have been misrepresented. Some of the modelling presented in the reports suggests a short-term economic cost for Australia in not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol; however, all the reports highlight that by ratifying we face costs that are inherently difficult to predict, but likely to be higher in the long run than the costs of not ratifying. This uncertainty is compounded by the fact that we don’t yet know the nature of international climate change action post-2012. (2) Yes. Dr Hamilton has selectively quoted results from one set of modelling results, for one year. The modelling suggests the costs of ratifying are likely to be higher than not ratifying, in the long run. It is the potential longer-term costs of ratification that the Government is concerned about. Any analysis of the longer-term costs of climate change action is inherently speculative. The best means of ensuring the basis for a cost effective response to climate change is to work towards a global response that includes participation by all major emitters of greenhouse gases. The Government has recently announced a climate change agenda that will focus upon the longer term, covering not just the next few years, but a twenty to thirty year time horizon. The strategy is intended to ensure that Australia can continue to cut greenhouse emissions, while maintaining a strong, competitive economy. It will be developed over the coming months working with all levels of government, business and the community.",233,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
286,Mr Downer,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,234,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
287,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) The Government has decided it is not in the national interest to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because under present arrangements, it does not provide an effective framework for addressing climate change. The Government has consistently stressed that to be effective, a global response to climate change that includes participation by all major emitters of greenhouse gases is needed. The Kyoto Protocol will cover only about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even as a first step it does not provide a clear path towards developing countries’ commitments. If Australia were to abandon our long expressed and clearly articulated requirement for a more comprehensive global response it would send a signal to investors that Australia was prepared to expose itself to binding legal commitments that could in the future impose costs not faced by neighbouring regional economies. For Australia this is not a trivial matter, given the significance to our economy of investment in greenhouse intensive industries such as natural gas, alumina and aluminium production, coal, paper and metals processing. In addition, the nature of future obligations beyond the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is unknown, and the US has indicated that it will not ratify The Government will continue to develop and invest in domestic programs to meet the target agreed to at Kyoto of limiting greenhouse emissions to 108% of 1990 levels over the period 2008 – 2012. Australia is within striking distance of achieving this target. Environment: Kyoto Protocol (Question No. 932) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 18 September 2002: (1) Has he seen the report titled “Kyoto snub will hit economy: report” by Stephanie Peatling and John Garnaut on page 3 of The Sydney Morning Herald on 16 September 2002. (2) Did the Government release the report by the Australian Greenhouse Office on Friday, 13 September 2002 despite receiving it in April; if so, what was the reason for the five month delay. (1) Yes. (2) The reports by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and the McKibbin Software Group on the potential costs to the Australian economy in ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and achieving our 108% emissions limitation target were received between April and July 2002. The reports were released once processes for interagency consideration had been completed. The Government is pleased to have the reports on the public record because they fully support the Government’s assessment that it would not be in the national interest to ratify the Kyoto Protocol under present arrangements.",234,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
